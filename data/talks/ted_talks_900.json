[{"title": "Creative houses from reclaimed stuff", "duration": "1077", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_phillips_creative_houses_from_reclaimed_stuff", "transcript": "(Applause)Thank you very much. I have a few pictures, and I'll talk a little bit about how I'm able to do what I do. All these houses are built from between 70 and 80 percent recycled material, stuff that was headed to the mulcher, the landfill, the burn pile. It was all just gone. This is the first house I built. This double front door here with the three-light transom, that was headed to the landfill. Have a little turret there. And then these buttons on the corbels here \u2014 right there \u2014 those are hickory nuts. And these buttons there \u2014 those are chicken eggs.(Laughter)Of course, first you have breakfast, and then you fill the shell full of Bondo and paint it and nail it up, and you have an architectural button in just a fraction of the time.This is a look at the inside. You can see the three-light transom there with the eyebrow windows. Certainly an architectural antique headed to the landfill \u2014 even the lockset is probably worth 200 dollars. Everything in the kitchen was salvaged. There's a 1952 O'Keefe & Merritt stove, if you like to cook \u2014 cool stove. This is going up into the turret. I got that staircase for 20 dollars, including delivery to my lot.(Laughter)Then, looking up in the turret, you see there are bulges and pokes and sags and so forth. Well, if that ruins your life, well, then, you shouldn't live there.(Laughter)This is a laundry chute. And this right here is a shoe last \u2014 those are those cast-iron things you see at antique shops. So I had one of those, so I made some low-tech gadgetry, where you just stomp on the shoe last, and then the door flies open and you throw your laundry down. And then if you're smart enough, it goes on a basket on top of the washer. If not, it goes into the toilet.(Laughter)This is a bathtub I made, made out of scrap two-by-four. Started with the rim, and then glued and nailed it up into a flat, corbeled it up and flipped it over, then did the two profiles on this side. It's a two-person tub. After all, it's not just a question of hygiene, but there's a possibility of recreation as well.(Laughter)Then, this faucet here is just a piece of Osage orange. It looks a little phallic, but after all, it's a bathroom.(Laughter)This is a house based on a Budweiser can. It doesn't look like a can of beer, but the design take-offs are absolutely unmistakable: the barley hops design worked up into the eaves, then the dentil work comes directly off the can's red, white, blue and silver. Then, these corbels going down underneath the eaves are that little design that comes off the can. I just put a can on a copier and kept enlarging it until I got the size I want. Then, on the can it says, \"This is the famous Budweiser beer, we know of no other beer, blah, blah, blah.\" So we changed that and put, \"This is the famous Budweiser house. We don't know of any other house ...\" and so forth and so on. This is a deadbolt. It's a fence from a 1930s shaper, which is a very angry woodworking machine. And they gave me the fence, but they didn't give me the shaper, so we made a deadbolt out of it. That'll keep bull elephants out, I promise.(Laughter)And sure enough, we've had no problems with bull elephants.(Laughter)The shower is intended to simulate a glass of beer. We've got bubbles going up there, then suds at the top with lumpy tiles. Where do you get lumpy tiles? Well, of course, you don't. But I get a lot of toilets, and so you just dispatch a toilet with a hammer, and then you have lumpy tiles. And then the faucet is a beer tap.(Laughter)Then, this panel of glass is the same panel of glass that occurs in every middle-class front door in America. We're getting tired of it. It's kind of clich\u00e9d now. If you put it in the front door, your design fails. So don't put it in the front door; put it somewhere else. It's a pretty panel of glass. But if you put it in the front door, people say, \"Oh, you're trying to be like those guys, and you didn't make it.\" So don't put it there. Then, another bathroom upstairs. This light up here is the same light that occurs in every middle-class foyer in America. Don't put it in the foyer. Put it in the shower, or in the closet, but not in the foyer. Then, somebody gave me a bidet, so it got a bidet.(Laughter)This little house here, those branches there are made out of Bois d'arc or Osage orange. These pictures will keep scrolling as I talk a little bit.In order to do what I do, you have to understand what causes waste in the building industry. Our housing has become a commodity, and I'll talk a little bit about that. But the first cause of waste is probably even buried in our DNA. Human beings have a need for maintaining consistency of the apperceptive mass. What does that mean? What it means is, for every perception we have, it needs to tally with the one like it before, or we don't have continuity, and we become a little bit disoriented. So I can show you an object you've never seen before. Oh, that's a cell phone. But you've never seen this one before. What you're doing is sizing up the pattern of structural features, and then you go through your databanks: Cell phone. Oh! That's a cell phone. If I took a bite out of it, you'd go, \"Wait a second.(Laughter)\"That's not a cell phone. That's one of those new chocolate cell phones.\"(Laughter)You'd have to start a new category, right between cell phones and chocolate.(Laughter)That's how we process information.You translate that to the building industry. If we have a wall of windowpanes and one pane is cracked, we go, \"Oh, dear. That's cracked. Let's repair it. Let's take it out and throw it away so nobody can use it and put a new one in.\" Because that's what you do with a cracked pane. Never mind that it doesn't affect our lives at all. It only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural features. However, if we took a small hammer, and we added cracks to all the other windows \u2014(Laughter)then we have a pattern. Because Gestalt psychology emphasizes recognition of pattern over parts that comprise a pattern. We'll go, \"Ooh, that's nice.\" So, that serves me every day. Repetition creates pattern. If I have 100 of these, 100 of those, it makes no difference what these and those are. If I can repeat anything, I have the possibility of a pattern, from hickory nuts and chicken eggs, shards of glass, branches. It doesn't make any difference. That causes a lot of waste in the building industry.The second cause is, Friedrich Nietzsche, along about 1885, wrote a book titled \"The Birth of Tragedy.\" And in there, he said cultures tend to swing between one of two perspectives: on the one hand, we have an Apollonian perspective, which is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized and perfect. On the other end of the spectrum, we have a Dionysian perspective, which is more given to the passions and intuition, tolerant of organic texture and human gesture. So the way the Apollonian personality takes a picture or hangs a picture is, they'll get out a transit and a laser level and a micrometer. \"OK, honey. A thousandth of an inch to the left. That's where we want the picture. Right. Perfect!\" Predicated on plumb level, square and centered. The Dionysian personality takes the picture and goes:(Laughter)That's the difference. I feature blemish. I feature organic process. Dead center John Dewey. Apollonian mindset creates mountains of waste. If something isn't perfect, if it doesn't line up with that premeditated model? Dumpster. \"Oops. Scratch. Dumpster.\" \"Oops\" this, \"oops\" that. Landfill, landfill, landfill.The third thing is arguably \u2014 The Industrial Revolution started in the Renaissance with the rise of humanism, then got a little jump start along about the French Revolution. By the middle of the 19th century, it's in full flower. And we have dumaflaches and gizmos and contraptions that will do anything that we, up to that point, had to do by hand. So now we have standardized materials. Well, trees don't grow two inches by four inches, eight, ten and twelve feet tall.(Laughter)We create mountains of waste. And they're doing a pretty good job there in the forest, working all the byproduct of their industry \u2014 with OSB and particle board and so forth and so on \u2014 but it does no good to be responsible at the point of harvest in the forest if consumers are wasting the harvest at the point of consumption. And that's what's happening. And so if something isn't standard, \"Oops, dumpster.\" \"Oops\" this. \"Oops, warped.\" If you buy a two-by-four and it's not straight, you can take it back. \"Oh, I'm so sorry, sir. We'll get you a straight one.\" Well, I feature all those warped things because repetition creates pattern, and it's from a Dionysian perspective.The fourth thing is labor is disproportionately more expensive than materials. Well, that's just a myth. And there's a story: Jim Tulles, one of the guys I trained \u2014 I said, \"Jim, it's time now. I got a job for you as a foreman on a framing crew. Time for you to go.\" \"Dan, I just don't think I'm ready.\" \"Jim, now it's time. You're the down \u2014 oh!\" So we hired on. And he was out there with a tape measure, going through the trash heap, looking for header material, or the board that goes over a door, thinking he'd impress his boss \u2014 that's how we taught him to do it. The superintendent walked up and said, \"What are you doing?\" \"Oh, just looking for header material,\" waiting for that kudos. He said, \"I'm not paying you to go through the trash. Get back to work.\" And Jim had the wherewithal to say, \"You know, if you were paying me 300 dollars an hour, I can see how you might say that. But right now, I'm saving you five dollars a minute. Do the math.\"(Laughter)\"Good call, Tulles. From now on, you guys hit this pile first.\" And the irony is that he wasn't very good at math.(Laughter)But once in a while, you get access to the control room, and then you can kind of mess with the dials. And that's what happened there.The fifth thing is that maybe, after 2,500 years, Plato is still having his way with us in his notion of perfect forms. He said that we have in our noggin the perfect idea of what we want, and we force environmental resources to accommodate that. So we all have in our head the perfect house, the American dream, which is a house, the dream house. The problem is we can't afford it. So we have the American dream look-alike, which is a mobile home. Now there's a blight on the planet.(Laughter)It's a chattel mortgage, just like furniture, just like a car. You write the check, and instantly, it depreciates 30 percent. After a year, you can't get insurance on everything you have in it, only on 70 percent. Wired with 14-Gauge wire, typically. Nothing wrong with that, unless you ask it to do what 12-Gauge wire's supposed to do, and that's what happens. It out-gasses formaldehyde \u2014 so much so that there is a federal law in place to warn new mobile home buyers of the formaldehyde atmosphere danger. Are we just being numbingly stupid? The walls are this thick. The whole thing has the structural value of corn.(Laughter)\"So ... I thought Palm Harbor Village was over there.\" \"No, no. We had a wind last night. It's gone now.\"(Laughter)Then when they degrade, what do you do with them?Now, all that \u2014 that Apollonian, Platonic model \u2014 is what the building industry is predicated on, and there are a number of things that exacerbate that. One is that all the professionals, all the tradesmen, vendors, inspectors, engineers, architects all think like this. And then it works its way back to the consumer, who demands the same model. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. We can't get out of it. Then here come the marketeers and the advertisers. \"Woo. Woo-hoo.\" We buy stuff we didn't know we needed. All we have to do is look at what one company did with carbonated prune juice. How disgusting.(Laughter)But you know what they did? They hooked a metaphor into it and said, \"I drink Dr. Pepper ...\" And pretty soon, we're swilling that stuff by the lake-ful, by the billions of gallons. It doesn't even have real prunes! Doesn't even keep you regular.(Laughter)My oh my, that makes it worse. And we get sucked into that faster than anything.Then, a man named Jean-Paul Sartre wrote a book titled \"Being and Nothingness.\" It's a pretty quick read. You can snap through it in maybe \u2014(Laughter)maybe two years, if you read eight hours a day. In there, he talked about the divided self. He said human beings act differently when they know they're alone than when they know somebody else is around. So if I'm eating spaghetti, and I know I'm alone, I can eat like a backhoe. I can wipe my mouth on my sleeve, napkin on the table, chew with my mouth open, make little noises, scratch wherever I want.(Laughter)But as soon as you walk in, I go, \"Oops! Lil' spaghetti sauce there.\" Napkin in my lap, half-bites, chew with my mouth closed, no scratching. Now, what I'm doing is fulfilling your expectations of how I should live my life. I feel that expectation, and so I accommodate it, and I'm living my life according to what you expect me to do. That happens in the building industry as well. That's why all subdivisions look the same. Sometimes, we even have these formalized cultural expectations. I'll bet all your shoes match. Sure enough, we all buy into that ...(Laughter)And with gated communities, we have a formalized expectation, with a homeowners' association. Sometimes those guys are Nazis, my oh my. That exacerbates and continues this model.The last thing is gregariousness. Human beings are a social species. We like to hang together in groups, just like wildebeests, just like lions. Wildebeests don't hang with lions, because lions eat wildebeests. Human beings are like that. We do what that group does that we're trying to identify with. You see this in junior high a lot. Those kids, they'll work all summer long \u2014 kill themselves \u2014 so that they can afford one pair of designer jeans. So along about September, they can stride in and go, \"I'm important today. See? Don't touch my designer jeans! I see you don't have designer jeans. You're not one of the beautiful \u2014 See, I'm one of the beautiful people. See my jeans?\" Right there is reason enough to have uniforms. And so that happens in the building industry as well.We have confused Maslow's hierarchy of needs, just a little bit. On the bottom tier, we have basic needs: shelter, clothing, food, water, mating and so forth. Second: security. Third: relationships. Fourth: status, self-esteem \u2014 that is, vanity \u2014 and we're taking vanity and shoving it down here. And so we end up with vain decisions, and we can't even afford our mortgage. We can't afford to eat anything except beans;that is, our housing has become a commodity. And it takes a little bit of nerve to dive into those primal, terrifying parts of ourselves and make our own decisions and not make our housing a commodity, but make it something that bubbles up from seminal sources. That takes a little bit of nerve, and, darn it, once in a while, you fail. But that's okay. If failure destroys you, then you can't do this. I fail all the time, every day, and I've had some whopping failures, I promise \u2014 big, public, humiliating, embarrassing failures.Everybody points and laughs, and they say, \"He tried it a fifth time, and it still didn't work! What a moron!\" Early on, contractors come by and say, \"Dan, you're a cute little bunny, but you know, this just isn't going to work. What don't you do this? Why don't you do that?\" And your instinct is to say, \"Well, why don't you suck an egg?\"(Laughter)But you don't say that, because they're the guys you're targeting.And so what we've done \u2014 and this isn't just in housing; it's in clothing and food and our transportation needs, our energy \u2014 we sprawl just a little bit. And when I get a little bit of press, I hear from people all over the world. And we may have invented excess, but the problem of waste is worldwide. We're in trouble. And I don't wear ammo belts crisscrossing my chest and a red bandana. But we're clearly in trouble. And what we need to do is reconnect with those really primal parts of ourselves and make some decisions and say, \"You know, I think I would like to put CDs across the wall there. What do you think, honey?\" If it doesn't work, take it down. What we need to do is reconnect with who we really are, and that's thrilling indeed.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1015, "subtitle":

design\nworked up into the eaves,\n\n00:02:55.187 --> 00:02:58.935\nthen the dentil work comes directly\noff the can's red, white, blue and silver.\n\n00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.397\nThen, these corbels going\ndown underneath the eaves\n\n00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:03.599\nare that little design\nthat comes off the can.\n\n00:03:03.623 --> 00:03:06.242\nI just put a can on a copier\nand kept enlarging it\n\n00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:07.782\nuntil I got the size I want.\n\n00:03:07.806 --> 00:03:10.353\nThen, on the can it says,\n\n00:03:10.377 --> 00:03:12.084\n\"This is the famous Budweiser beer,\n\n00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:14.166\nwe know of no other beer,\nblah, blah, blah.\"\n\n00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.483\nSo we changed that and put,\n\n00:03:15.507 --> 00:03:19.006\n\"This is the famous Budweiser house.\nWe don't know of any other house ...\"\n\n00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.182\nand so forth and so on.\n\n00:03:20.206 --> 00:03:21.363\nThis is a deadbolt.\n\n00:03:21.387 --> 00:03:25.129\nIt's a fence from a 1930s shaper,\nwhich is a very angry woodworking machine.\n\n00:03:25.153 --> 00:03:28.129\nAnd they gave me the fence,\nbut they didn't give me the shaper,\n\n00:03:28.153 --> 00:03:29.824\nso we made a deadbolt out of it.\n\n00:03:29.848 --> 00:03:32.089\nThat'll keep bull elephants\nout, I promise.\n\n00:03:32.113 --> 00:03:33.118\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:33.142 --> 00:03:35.996\nAnd sure enough, we've had\nno problems with bull elephants.\n\n00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.182\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:37.206 -->

My name is Birke Baehr, and I'm 11 years old. I came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system. First of all, I would like to say that I'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe all the marketing and advertising on TV, at public schools and pretty much everywhere else you look. It seems to me like corporations are always trying to get kids, like me, to get their parents to buy stuff that really isn't good for us or the planet. Little kids, especially, are attracted by colorful packaging and plastic toys. I must admit, I used to be one of them. I also used to think that all of our food came from these happy, little farms where pigs rolled in mud and cows grazed on grass all day.What I discovered was this is not true. I began to look into this stuff on the Internet, in books and in documentary films, in my travels with my family. I discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system. First, there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms. That is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory to do something not intended by nature \u2014 like taking the DNA of a fish and putting it into the DNA of a tomato. Yuck. Don't get me wrong, I like fish and tomatoes, but this is just creepy. (Laughter) The seeds are then planted, then grown. The food they produce have been proven to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals, and people have been eating food produced this way since the 1990s. And most folks don't even know they exist. Did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity? These include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight. Yet almost all the corn we eat has been altered genetically in some way. And let me tell you, corn is in everything. And don't even get me started on the Confined Animal Feeding Operations called CAFOS.(Laughter)Conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers made from fossil fuels that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow. They do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients from growing the same crop over and over again. Next, more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables, like pesticides and herbicides, to kill weeds and bugs. When it rains, these chemicals seep into the ground, or run off into our waterways, poisoning our water too. Then they irradiate our food, trying to make it last longer, so it can travel thousands of miles from where it's grown to the supermarkets.So I ask myself, how can I change? How can I change these things? This is what I found out. I discovered that there's a movement for a better way. Now a while back, I wanted to be an NFL football player. I decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead. (Applause) Thank you. And that way I can have a greater impact on the world. This man, Joel Salatin, they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system. Since I'm home-schooled, I went to go hear him speak one day. This man, this \"lunatic farmer,\" doesn't use any pesticides, herbicides, or genetically modified seeds. And so for that, he's called crazy by the system.I want you to know that we can all make a difference by making different choices, by buying our food directly from local farmers, or our neighbors who we know in real life. Some people say organic or local food is more expensive, but is it really? With all these things I've been learning about the food system, it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer, or we can pay the hospital. (Applause) Now I know definitely which one I would choose. I want you to know that there are farms out there \u2014 like Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee \u2014 whose cows do eat grass and whose pigs do roll in the mud, just like I thought. Sometimes I go to Bill's farm and volunteer, so I can see up close and personal where the meat I eat comes from. I want you to know that I believe kids will eat fresh vegetables and good food if they know more about it and where it really comes from. I want you to know that there are farmers' markets in every community popping up. I want you to know that me, my brother and sister actually like eating baked kale chips. I try to share this everywhere I go.Not too long ago, my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal. He asked him if he wanted organic Toasted O's or the sugarcoated flakes \u2014 you know, the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front. My little cousin told his dad that he would rather have the organic Toasted O's cereal because Birke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal. And that, my friends, is how we can make a difference one kid at a time.So next time you're at the grocery store, think local, choose organic, know your farmer and know your food. Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1016, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nHello.

To the first son, he left half the camels; to the second son, he left a third of the camels; and to the youngest son, he left a ninth of the camels. The three sons got into a negotiation \u2014 17 doesn't divide by two. It doesn't divide by three. It doesn't divide by nine. Brotherly tempers started to get strained. Finally, in desperation, they went and they consulted a wise old woman. The wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time, and finally she came back and said, \"Well, I don't know if I can help you, but at least, if you want, you can have my camel.\" So then, they had 18 camels. The first son took his half \u2014 half of 18 is nine. The second son took his third \u2014 a third of 18 is six. The youngest son took his ninth \u2014 a ninth of 18 is two. You get 17. They had one camel left over. They gave it back to the wise old woman.(Laughter)Now, if you think about that story for a moment, I think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in. They start off like 17 camels, no way to resolve it. Somehow, what we need to do is step back from those situations, like that wise old woman, look at the situation through fresh eyes and come up with an 18th camel. Finding that 18th camel in the world's conflicts has been my life passion.I basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers. We're all one family. We know that scientifically, thanks to the communications revolution, all the tribes on the planet \u2014 all 15,000 tribes \u2014 are in touch with each other. And it's a big family reunion. And yet, like many family reunions, it's not all peace and light. There's a lot of conflict, and the question is: How do we deal with our differences? How do we deal with our deepest differences, given the human propensity for conflict and the human genius at devising weapons of enormous destruction? That's the question.As I've spent the last better part of three decades, almost four, traveling the world, trying to work, getting involved in conflicts ranging from Yugoslavia to the Middle East to Chechnya to Venezuela \u2014 some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet \u2014 I've been asking myself that question. And I think I've found, in some ways, what is the secret to peace. It's actually surprisingly simple. It's not easy, but it's simple. It's not even new. It may be one of our most ancient human heritages. The secret to peace is us. It's us who act as a surrounding community around any conflict, who can play a constructive role.Let me give you just a story, an example. About 20 years ago, I was in South Africa, working with the parties in that conflict, and I had an extra month, so I spent some time living with several groups of San Bushmen. I was curious about them, about the way in which they resolve conflict. Because, after all, within living memory, they were hunters and gatherers, living pretty much like our ancestors lived for maybe 99 percent of the human story. And all the men have these poison arrows that they use for hunting \u2014 absolutely fatal. So how do they deal with their differences? Well, what I learned is, whenever tempers rise in those communities, someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush, and then everyone sits around in a circle like this, and they sit and they talk and they talk. It may take two days, three days, four days, but they don't rest until they find a resolution or better yet \u2014 a reconciliation. And if tempers are still too high, then they send someone off to visit some relatives, as a cooling-off period.Well, that system is, I think, probably the system that kept us alive to this point, given our human tendencies. That system, I call \"the third side.\" Because if you think about it, normally when we think of conflict, when we describe it, there's always two sides \u2014 it's Arabs versus Israelis, labor versus management, husband versus wife, Republicans versus Democrats. But what we don't often see is that there's always a third side, and the third side of the conflict is us, it's the surrounding community, it's the friends, the allies, the family members, the neighbors. And we can play an incredibly constructive role.Perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what's really at stake. For the sake of the kids, for the sake of the family, for the sake of the community, for the sake of the future, let's stop fighting for a moment and start talking. Because, the thing is, when we're involved in conflict, it's very easy to lose perspective. It's very easy to react. Human beings \u2014 we're reaction machines. And as the saying goes, when angry, you will make the best speech you will ever regret.(Laughter)And so the third side reminds us of that. The third side helps us go to the balcony, which is a metaphor for a place of perspective, where we can keep our eyes on the prize.Let me tell you a little story from my own negotiating experience. Some years ago, I was involved as a facilitator in some very tough talks between the leaders of Russia and the leaders of Chechnya. There was a war going on, as you know. And we met in the Hague, in the Peace Palace, in the same room where the Yugoslav war-crimes tribunal was taking place. And the talks got off to a rather rocky start when the vice president of Chechnya began by pointing at the Russians and said, \"You should stay right here in your seats, because you're going to be on trial for war crimes.\" And then he turned to me and said, \"You're an American. Look at what you Americans are doing in Puerto Rico.\" And my mind started racing, \"Puerto Rico? What do I know about Puerto Rico?\" I started reacting.(Laughter)But then, I tried to remember to go to the balcony. And then when he paused and everyone looked at me for a response, from a balcony perspective, I was able to thank him for his remarks and say, \"I appreciate your criticism of my country and I take it as a sign that we're among friends and can speak candidly to one another.\"(Laughter)\"And what we're here to do is not to talk about Puerto Rico or the past. We're here to see if we can figure out a way to stop the suffering and the bloodshed in Chechnya.\" The conversation got back on track. That's the role of the third side, to help the parties go to the balcony.Now let me take you, for a moment, to what's widely regarded as the world's most difficult conflict, or the most impossible conflict, the Middle East. Question is: where's the third side there? How could we possibly go to the balcony? Now, I don't pretend to have an answer to the Middle East conflict, but I think I've got a first step \u2014 literally, a first step \u2014 something that any one of us could do as third-siders. Let me just ask you one question first. How many of you in the last years have ever found yourself worrying about the Middle East and wondering what anyone could do? Just out of curiosity, how many of you? OK, so the great majority of us. And here, it's so far away. Why do we pay so much attention to this conflict? Is it the number of deaths? There are a hundred times more people who die in a conflict in Africa than in the Middle East. No, it's because of the story, because we feel personally involved in that story. Whether we're Christians, Muslims or Jews, religious or non-religious, we feel we have a personal stake in it.Stories matter; as an anthropologist, I know that. Stories are what we use to transmit knowledge. They give meaning to our lives. That's what we tell here at TED, we tell stories. Stories are the key. And so my question is \u2014 yes, let's try and resolve the politics there in the Middle East, but let's also take a look at the story. Let's try to get at the root of what it's all about. Let's see if we can apply the third side to it. What would that mean? What is the story there?Now, as anthropologists, we know that every culture has an origin story. What's the origin story of the Middle East? In a phrase, it's: Four thousand years ago, a man and his family walked across the Middle East, and the world has never been the same since. That man, of course, was Abraham. And what he stood for was unity, the unity of the family; he's the father of us all. But it's not just what he stood for, it's what his message was. His basic message was unity too, the interconnectedness of it all, the unity of it all. And his basic value was respect, was kindness toward strangers. That's what he's known for, his hospitality. So in that sense, he's the symbolic third side of the Middle East. He's the one who reminds us that we're all part of a greater whole. Now, think about that for a moment.Today, we face the scourge of terrorism. What is terrorism? Terrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger and treating them as an enemy whom you kill in order to create fear. What's the opposite of terrorism? It's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home, in order to sow and create understanding or respect, or love.So what if, then, you took the story of Abraham, which is a third-side story, what if that could be \u2014 because Abraham stands for hospitality \u2014 what if that could be an antidote to terrorism? What if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance? How would you bring that story to life? Now, it's not enough just to tell a story. That's powerful, but people need to experience the story. They need to be able to live the story. How would you do that? And that was my thinking of how would you do that. And that's what comes to the first step here. Because the simple way to do that is: you go for a walk. You go for a walk in the footsteps of Abraham. You retrace the footsteps of Abraham. Because walking has a real power. You know, as an anthropologist, walking is what made us human. It's funny \u2014 when you walk, you walk side-by-side, in the same common direction. Now if I were to come to you face-to-face and come this close to you, you would feel threatened. But if I walk shoulder-to-shoulder, even touching shoulders, it's no problem. Who fights while they walk? That's why in negotiations, often, when things get tough, people go for walks in the woods.So the idea came to me of, what about inspiring a path, a route \u2014 think the Silk Route, think the Appalachian Trail \u2014 that followed in the footsteps of Abraham? People said, \"That's crazy. You can't. You can't retrace the footsteps of Abraham \u2014 it's too insecure, you've got to cross all these borders, it goes across 10 different countries in the Middle East, because it unites them all.\" And so we studied the idea at Harvard. We did our due diligence. And then a few years ago, a group of us, about 25 of us from 10 different countries, decided to see if we could retrace the footsteps of Abraham, going from his initial birthplace in the city of Urfa in Southern Turkey, Northern Mesopotamia. And we then took a bus and took some walks and went to Harran, where, in the Bible, he sets off on his journey. Then we crossed the border into Syria, went to Aleppo, which, turns out, is named after Abraham. We went to Damascus, which has a long history associated with Abraham. We then came to Northern Jordan, to Jerusalem \u2014 which is all about Abraham \u2014 to Bethlehem, and finally, to the place where he's buried, in Hebron. So effectively, we went from womb to tomb. We showed it could be done. It was an amazing journey.Let me ask you a question. How many of you have had the experience of being in a strange neighborhood or strange land, and a total stranger, perfect stranger, comes up to you and shows you some kindness \u2014 maybe invites you into their home, gives you a drink, gives you a coffee, gives you a meal? How many of you have ever had that experience? That's the essence of the Abraham Path. That's what you discover as you go into these villages in the Middle East where you expect hostility, and you get the most amazing hospitality, all associated with Abraham: \"In the name of Father Ibrahim, let me offer you some food.\" So what we discovered is that Abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people; he's alive, he's a living presence.And to make a long story short, in the last couple of years now, thousands of people have begun to walk parts of the path of Abraham in the Middle East, enjoying the hospitality of the people there. They've begun to walk in Israel and Palestine, in Jordan, in Turkey, in Syria. It's an amazing experience. Men, women, young people, old people \u2014 more women than men, actually, interestingly.For those who can't walk, who are unable to get there right now, people started to organize walks in cities, in their own communities. In Cincinnati, for instance, they organized a walk from a church to a mosque to a synagogue and all had an Abrahamic meal together. It was Abraham Path Day. In S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, it's become an annual event for thousands of people to run in a virtual Abraham Path Run, uniting the different communities. The media love it; they really adore it. They lavish attention on it because it's visual and it spreads the idea, this idea of Abrahamic hospitality, of kindness towards strangers. And just a couple weeks ago, there was an NPR story on it. Last month, there was a piece in the Manchester Guardian about it, two whole pages. And they quoted a villager who said, \"This walk connects us to the world.\" He said, \"It was like a light that went on in our lives \u2014 it brought us hope.\" And so that's what it's about.But it's not just about psychology; it's about economics. Because as people walk, they spend money. And this woman right here, Um Ahmad, is a woman who lives on the path in Northern Jordan. She's desperately poor. She's partially blind, her husband can't work, she's got seven kids. But what she can do is cook. And so she's begun to cook for some groups of walkers who come through the village and have a meal in her home. They sit on the floor \u2014 she doesn't even have a tablecloth. She makes the most delicious food, that's fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside. And so more and more walkers have come, and lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family. And so she told our team there, she said, \"You have made me visible in a village where people were once ashamed to look at me.\" That's the potential of the Abraham Path.There are literally hundreds of those kinds of communities across the Middle East, across the path. The potential is basically to change the game. And to change the game, you have to change the frame, the way we see things \u2014 to change the frame from hostility to hospitality, from terrorism to tourism. And in that sense, the Abraham Path is a game-changer.Let me just show you one thing. I have a little acorn here that I picked up while I was walking on the path earlier this year. Now, the acorn is associated with the oak tree, of course \u2014 grows into an oak tree, which is associated with Abraham. The path right now is like an acorn; it's still in its early phase. What would the oak tree look like? When I think back to my childhood, a good part of which I spent, after being born here in Chicago, I spent in Europe. If you had been in the ruins of, say, London in 1945, or Berlin, and you had said, \"Sixty years from now, this is going to be the most peaceful, prosperous part of the planet,\" people would have thought you were certifiably insane. But they did it, thanks to a common identity, Europe, and a common economy. So my question is, if it can be done in Europe, why not in the Middle East? Why not, thanks to a common identity, which is the story of Abraham, and thanks to a common economy that would be based, in good part, on tourism?So let me conclude, then, by saying that in the last 35 years, as I've worked in some of the most dangerous, difficult and intractable conflicts around the planet, I have yet to see one conflict that I felt could not be transformed. It's not easy, of course. But it's possible. It was done in South Africa. It was done in Northern Ireland. It could be done anywhere. It simply depends on us. It depends on us taking the third side. So let me invite you to consider taking the third side, even as a very small step. We're about to take a break in a moment. Just go up to someone who's from a different culture, a different country, a different ethnicity \u2014 some difference \u2014 and engage them in a conversation. Listen to them. That's a third-side act. That's walking Abraham's Path. After a TED Talk, why not a TED Walk?(Laughter)So let me just leave you with three things. One is, the secret to peace is the third side. The third side is us. Each of us, with a single step, can take the world, can bring the world a step closer to peace. There's an old African proverb that goes: \"When spiderwebs unite, they can halt even the lion.\" If we're able to unite our third-side webs of peace, we can even halt the lion of war.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1017, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:15.132\nWell, the subject of difficult negotiation\n\n00:00:15.156 --> 00:00:18.934\nreminds me of one of my favorite stories\nfrom the Middle East,\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:22.712\nof a man who left\nto his three sons, 17 camels.\n\n00:00:22.736 --> 00:00:24.934\nTo the first son, he left half the camels;\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.348\nto the second son,\nhe left a third of the camels;\n\n00:00:27.372 --> 00:00:29.967\nand to the youngest son,\nhe left a ninth of the camels.\n\n00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:33.805\nThe three sons got into a negotiation --\n17 doesn't divide by two.\n\n00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.567\nIt doesn't divide by three.\n\n00:00:35.591 --> 00:00:37.130\nIt doesn't divide by nine.\n\n00:00:37.154 --> 00:00:39.400\nBrotherly tempers started to get strained.\n\n00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:40.703\nFinally, in desperation,\n\n00:00:40.727 --> 00:00:44.388\nthey went and they consulted\na wise old woman.\n\n00:00:44.412 --> 00:00:47.387\nThe wise old woman thought\nabout their problem for a long time,\n\n00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:50.915\nand finally she came back and said,\n\"Well, I don't know if I can help you,\n\n00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:53.316\nbut at least, if you want,\nyou can have my camel.\"\n\n00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.808\nSo then, they had 18 camels.\n\n00:00:54.832 --> 00:00:57.690\nThe first son took his half --\nhalf of 18 is nine.\n\n00:00:57.714 --> 00:01:00.408\nThe second son took his third --\na third of 18 is six.\n\n00:01:00.432 --> 00:01:03.934\nThe youngest son took his ninth --\na ninth of 18 is two.\n\n00:01:04.328 --> 00:01:06.517\nYou get 17.\n\n00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:08.351\nThey had one camel left over.\n\n00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:10.303\nThey gave it back to the wise old woman.\n\n00:01:10.327 --> 00:01:11.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.197\nNow, if you think\nabout that story for a moment,\n\n00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:17.792\nI think it resembles a lot\nof the difficult negotiations\n\n00:01:17.816 --> 00:01:19.030\nwe get involved in.\n\n00:01:19.054 --> 00:01:21.530\nThey start off like 17 camels,\nno way to resolve it.\n\n00:01:21.554 --> 00:01:22.990\nSomehow, what we need to do\n\n00:01:23.014 --> 00:01:26.695\nis step back from those situations,\nlike that wise old woman,\n\n00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.751\nlook at the situation through fresh eyes\n\n00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:30.712\nand come up with an 18th camel.\n\n00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:34.597\nFinding that 18th camel\nin the world's conflicts\n\n00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:36.779\nhas been my life passion.\n\n00:01:36.803 --> 00:01:39.934\nI basically see humanity\na bit like those three brothers.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.548\nWe're all one family.\n\n00:01:42.103 --> 00:01:44.052\nWe know that scientifically,\n\n00:01:44.076 --> 00:01:46.022\nthanks to the communications revolution,\n\n00:01:46.046 --> 00:01:49.614\nall the tribes on the planet --\nall 15,000 tribes --\n\n00:01:49.638 --> 00:01:51.249\nare in touch with each other.\n\n00:01:52.241 --> 00:01:54.634\nAnd it's a big family reunion.\n\n00:01:54.658 --> 00:01:56.340\nAnd yet, like many family reunions,\n\n00:01:56.364 --> 00:01:58.587\nit's not all peace and light.\n\n00:01:58.611 --> 00:02:00.512\nThere's a lot of conflict,\n\n00:02:00.536 --> 00:02:03.934\nand the question is:\nHow do we deal with our differences?\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.054\nHow do we deal with\nour deepest differences,\n\n00:02:06.078 --> 00:02:08.787\ngiven the human propensity for conflict\n\n00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:13.338\nand the human genius at devising\nweapons of enormous destruction?\n\n00:02:13.362 --> 00:02:15.111\nThat's the question.\n\n00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:19.934\nAs I've spent the last better part\nof three decades, almost four,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.013\ntraveling the world,\n\n00:02:22.037 --> 00:02:25.406\ntrying to work, getting\ninvolved in conflicts\n\n00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.810\nranging from Yugoslavia to the Middle East\n\n00:02:28.834 --> 00:02:30.558\nto Chechnya to Venezuela --\n\n00:02:30.582 --> 00:02:33.655\nsome of the most difficult conflicts\non the face of the planet --\n\n00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:35.770\nI've been asking myself that question.\n\n00:02:35.794 --> 00:02:39.190\nAnd I think I've found, in some ways,\nwhat is the secret to peace.\n\n00:02:39.214 --> 00:02:41.934\nIt's actually surprisingly simple.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:45.134\nIt's not easy, but it's simple.\n\n00:02:45.158 --> 00:02:46.389\nIt's not even new.\n\n00:02:46.413 --> 00:02:49.787\nIt may be one of our most\nancient human heritages.\n\n00:02:49.811 --> 00:02:52.128\nThe secret to peace is us.\n\n00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.762\nIt's us who act as a surrounding\ncommunity around any conflict,\n\n00:02:57.786 --> 00:02:59.934\nwho can play a constructive role.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nLet me give you just a story, an example.\n\n00:03:03.902 --> 00:03:05.054\nAbout 20 years ago,\n\n00:03:05.078 --> 00:03:08.319\nI was in South Africa,\nworking with the parties in that conflict,\n\n00:03:08.343 --> 00:03:09.606\nand I had an extra month,\n\n00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.196\nso I spent some time living\nwith several groups of San Bushmen.\n\n00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.164\nI was curious about them, about the way\nin which they resolve conflict.\n\n00:03:18.188 --> 00:03:21.934\nBecause, after all, within living memory,\nthey were hunters and gatherers,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.314\nliving pretty much\nlike our ancestors lived\n\n00:03:24.338 --> 00:03:26.600\nfor maybe 99 percent of the human story.\n\n00:03:27.171 --> 00:03:30.534\nAnd all the men have these poison arrows\nthat they use for hunting --\n\n00:03:30.558 --> 00:03:32.076\nabsolutely fatal.\n\n00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.394\nSo how do they deal\nwith their differences?\n\n00:03:34.418 --> 00:03:39.007\nWell, what I learned is, whenever\ntempers rise in those communities,\n\n00:03:39.031 --> 00:03:42.602\nsomeone goes and hides\nthe poison arrows out in the bush,\n\n00:03:42.626 --> 00:03:46.261\nand then everyone sits around\nin a circle like this,\n\n00:03:46.285 --> 00:03:49.237\nand they sit and they talk and they talk.\n\n00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:51.572\nIt may take two days,\nthree days, four days,\n\n00:03:51.596 --> 00:03:54.934\nbut they don't rest\nuntil they find a resolution\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.934\nor better yet -- a reconciliation.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.991\nAnd if tempers are still too high,\n\n00:03:59.015 --> 00:04:01.554\nthen they send someone\noff to visit some relatives,\n\n00:04:01.578 --> 00:04:02.934\nas a cooling-off period.\n\n00:04:03.356 --> 00:04:06.341\nWell, that system is, I think,\nprobably the system\n\n00:04:06.365 --> 00:04:08.101\nthat kept us alive to this point,\n\n00:04:08.125 --> 00:04:09.934\ngiven our human tendencies.\n\n00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.990\nThat system, I call \"the third side.\"\n\n00:04:14.014 --> 00:04:17.133\nBecause if you think about it,\nnormally when we think of conflict,\n\n00:04:17.157 --> 00:04:18.308\nwhen we describe it,\n\n00:04:18.332 --> 00:04:19.705\nthere's always two sides --\n\n00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.435\nit's Arabs versus Israelis,\nlabor versus management,\n\n00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:25.610\nhusband versus wife,\nRepublicans versus Democrats.\n\n00:04:25.634 --> 00:04:27.419\nBut what we don't often see\n\n00:04:27.443 --> 00:04:29.809\nis that there's always a third side,\n\n00:04:29.833 --> 00:04:33.505\nand the third side of the conflict is us,\nit's the surrounding community,\n\n00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:34.934\nit's the friends, the allies,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.766\nthe family members, the neighbors.\n\n00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.718\nAnd we can play\nan incredibly constructive role.\n\n00:04:40.178 --> 00:04:44.993\nPerhaps the most fundamental way\nin which the third side can help\n\n00:04:45.017 --> 00:04:47.934\nis to remind the parties\nof what's really at stake.\n\n00:04:48.294 --> 00:04:50.798\nFor the sake of the kids,\nfor the sake of the family,\n\n00:04:50.822 --> 00:04:53.592\nfor the sake of the community,\nfor the sake of the future,\n\n00:04:53.616 --> 00:04:56.057\nlet's stop fighting for a moment\nand start talking.\n\n00:04:56.764 --> 00:04:58.239\nBecause, the thing is,\n\n00:04:58.263 --> 00:04:59.836\nwhen we're involved in conflict,\n\n00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.419\nit's very easy to lose perspective.\n\n00:05:02.443 --> 00:05:04.482\nIt's very easy to react.\n\n00:05:04.506 --> 00:05:07.379\nHuman beings -- we're reaction machines.\n\n00:05:07.403 --> 00:05:08.776\nAnd as the saying goes,\n\n00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.323\nwhen angry, you will make the best speech\n\n00:05:11.347 --> 00:05:12.832\nyou will ever regret.\n\n00:05:12.856 --> 00:05:14.514\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:14.538 --> 00:05:17.534\nAnd so the third side reminds us of that.\n\n00:05:17.558 --> 00:05:19.583\nThe third side helps us go to the balcony,\n\n00:05:19.607 --> 00:05:22.313\nwhich is a metaphor\nfor a place of perspective,\n\n00:05:22.337 --> 00:05:24.743\nwhere we can keep our eyes on the prize.\n\n00:05:24.767 --> 00:05:28.347\nLet me tell you a little story\nfrom my own negotiating experience.\n\n00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:33.442\nSome years ago, I was involved\nas a facilitator in some very tough talks\n\n00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:36.689\nbetween the leaders of Russia\nand the leaders of Chechnya.\n\n00:05:37.387 --> 00:05:39.364\nThere was a war going on, as you know.\n\n00:05:39.753 --> 00:05:42.934\nAnd we met in the Hague,\nin the Peace Palace,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:48.065\nin the same room where the Yugoslav\nwar-crimes tribunal was taking place.\n\n00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:50.961\nAnd the talks got off\nto a rather rocky start\n\n00:05:50.985 --> 00:05:54.393\nwhen the vice president of Chechnya\nbegan by pointing at the Russians\n\n00:05:54.417 --> 00:05:56.934\nand said, \"You should stay\nright here in your seats,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.769\nbecause you're going\nto be on trial for war crimes.\"\n\n00:05:59.793 --> 00:06:01.603\nAnd then he turned to me and said,\n\n00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:02.809\n\"You're an American.\n\n00:06:02.833 --> 00:06:06.059\nLook at what you Americans\nare doing in Puerto Rico.\"\n\n00:06:06.083 --> 00:06:09.706\nAnd my mind started racing, \"Puerto Rico?\nWhat do I know about Puerto Rico?\"\n\n00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:10.882\nI started reacting.\n\n00:06:10.906 --> 00:06:11.907\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:14.767\nBut then, I tried to remember\nto go to the balcony.\n\n00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:15.989\nAnd then when he paused\n\n00:06:16.013 --> 00:06:18.094\nand everyone looked at me for a response,\n\n00:06:18.118 --> 00:06:21.496\nfrom a balcony perspective,\nI was able to thank him for his remarks\n\n00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.297\nand say, \"I appreciate\nyour criticism of my country\n\n00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:26.768\nand I take it as a sign\nthat we're among friends\n\n00:06:26.792 --> 00:06:28.683\nand can speak candidly to one another.\"\n\n00:06:28.707 --> 00:06:29.708\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:29.732 --> 00:06:33.113\n\"And what we're here to do is not\nto talk about Puerto Rico or the past.\n\n00:06:33.137 --> 00:06:35.318\nWe're here to see\nif we can figure out a way\n\n00:06:35.342 --> 00:06:37.934\nto stop the suffering\nand the bloodshed in Chechnya.\"\n\n00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:41.124\nThe conversation got back on track.\n\n00:06:41.148 --> 00:06:42.807\nThat's the role of the third side,\n\n00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:44.912\nto help the parties go to the balcony.\n\n00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.007\nNow let me take you, for a moment,\n\n00:06:48.031 --> 00:06:51.096\nto what's widely regarded as the world's\nmost difficult conflict,\n\n00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.661\nor the most impossible conflict,\nthe Middle East.\n\n00:06:53.685 --> 00:06:56.934\nQuestion is: where's the third side there?\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.122\nHow could we possibly go to the balcony?\n\n00:06:59.463 --> 00:07:03.440\nNow, I don't pretend to have an answer\nto the Middle East conflict,\n\n00:07:03.464 --> 00:07:07.424\nbut I think I've got a first step --\nliterally, a first step --\n\n00:07:07.448 --> 00:07:10.435\nsomething that any one of us\ncould do as third-siders.\n\n00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:12.666\nLet me just ask you one question first.\n\n00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.683\nHow many of you in the last years\n\n00:07:16.707 --> 00:07:19.742\nhave ever found yourself\nworrying about the Middle East\n\n00:07:19.766 --> 00:07:21.518\nand wondering what anyone could do?\n\n00:07:21.542 --> 00:07:23.659\nJust out of curiosity, how many of you?\n\n00:07:23.683 --> 00:07:26.175\nOK, so the great majority of us.\n\n00:07:26.675 --> 00:07:28.279\nAnd here, it's so far away.\n\n00:07:28.303 --> 00:07:31.219\nWhy do we pay so much attention\nto this conflict?\n\n00:07:31.243 --> 00:07:32.934\nIs it the number of deaths?\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:36.355\nThere are a hundred times more people\nwho die in a conflict in Africa\n\n00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:37.530\nthan in the Middle East.\n\n00:07:37.554 --> 00:07:39.641\nNo, it's because of the story,\n\n00:07:39.665 --> 00:07:43.373\nbecause we feel personally\ninvolved in that story.\n\n00:07:43.397 --> 00:07:47.226\nWhether we're Christians, Muslims or Jews,\nreligious or non-religious,\n\n00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.123\nwe feel we have a personal stake in it.\n\n00:07:49.147 --> 00:07:50.298\nStories matter;\n\n00:07:50.322 --> 00:07:52.080\nas an anthropologist, I know that.\n\n00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:55.722\nStories are what we use\nto transmit knowledge.\n\n00:07:55.746 --> 00:07:57.267\nThey give meaning to our lives.\n\n00:07:57.291 --> 00:07:59.988\nThat's what we tell here\nat TED, we tell stories.\n\n00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:01.166\nStories are the key.\n\n00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.761\nAnd so my question is --\n\n00:08:04.428 --> 00:08:08.604\nyes, let's try and resolve the politics\nthere in the Middle East,\n\n00:08:08.628 --> 00:08:11.152\nbut let's also take a look at the story.\n\n00:08:11.176 --> 00:08:13.620\nLet's try to get at the root\nof what it's all about.\n\n00:08:13.644 --> 00:08:15.864\nLet's see if we can apply\nthe third side to it.\n\n00:08:15.888 --> 00:08:18.692\nWhat would that mean?\nWhat is the story there?\n\n00:08:18.716 --> 00:08:22.934\nNow, as anthropologists, we know\nthat every culture has an origin story.\n\n00:08:23.454 --> 00:08:25.555\nWhat's the origin story\nof the Middle East?\n\n00:08:25.579 --> 00:08:26.934\nIn a phrase, it's:\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.549\nFour thousand years ago,\n\n00:08:28.573 --> 00:08:32.563\na man and his family walked\nacross the Middle East,\n\n00:08:32.587 --> 00:08:35.158\nand the world has never\nbeen the same since.\n\n00:08:35.769 --> 00:08:38.204\nThat man, of course, was Abraham.\n\n00:08:39.267 --> 00:08:42.934\nAnd what he stood for was unity,\nthe unity of the family;\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.934\nhe's the father of us all.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.947\nBut it's not just what he stood for,\nit's what his message was.\n\n00:08:47.971 --> 00:08:49.934\nHis basic message was unity too,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:53.168\nthe interconnectedness of it all,\nthe unity of it all.\n\n00:08:53.192 --> 00:08:56.502\nAnd his basic value was respect,\n\n00:08:56.526 --> 00:08:58.394\nwas kindness toward strangers.\n\n00:08:58.418 --> 00:09:01.435\nThat's what he's known for,\nhis hospitality.\n\n00:09:02.006 --> 00:09:03.633\nSo in that sense,\n\n00:09:03.657 --> 00:09:07.617\nhe's the symbolic third side\nof the Middle East.\n\n00:09:07.641 --> 00:09:12.064\nHe's the one who reminds us\nthat we're all part of a greater whole.\n\n00:09:12.405 --> 00:09:15.698\nNow, think about that for a moment.\n\n00:09:16.372 --> 00:09:18.820\nToday, we face the scourge of terrorism.\n\n00:09:19.249 --> 00:09:20.527\nWhat is terrorism?\n\n00:09:21.106 --> 00:09:24.365\nTerrorism is basically\ntaking an innocent stranger\n\n00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:28.934\nand treating them as an enemy\nwhom you kill in order to create fear.\n\n00:09:29.561 --> 00:09:31.347\nWhat's the opposite of terrorism?\n\n00:09:31.934 --> 00:09:33.654\nIt's taking an innocent stranger\n\n00:09:33.678 --> 00:09:38.065\nand treating them as a friend\nwhom you welcome into your home,\n\n00:09:38.089 --> 00:09:40.781\nin order to sow and create understanding\n\n00:09:40.805 --> 00:09:42.593\nor respect, or love.\n\n00:09:43.551 --> 00:09:48.211\nSo what if, then, you took\nthe story of Abraham,\n\n00:09:48.235 --> 00:09:49.868\nwhich is a third-side story,\n\n00:09:49.892 --> 00:09:51.934\nwhat if that could be --\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.279\nbecause Abraham stands for hospitality --\n\n00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:58.517\nwhat if that could be\nan antidote to terrorism?\n\n00:09:58.541 --> 00:10:02.363\nWhat if that could be a vaccine\nagainst religious intolerance?\n\n00:10:02.387 --> 00:10:04.934\nHow would you bring that story to life?\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.720\nNow, it's not enough just to tell a story.\n\n00:10:07.744 --> 00:10:11.138\nThat's powerful, but people need\nto experience the story.\n\n00:10:11.162 --> 00:10:13.116\nThey need to be able to live the story.\n\n00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.416\nHow would you do that?\n\n00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.934\nAnd that was my thinking\nof how would you do that.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.101\nAnd that's what comes\nto the first step here.\n\n00:10:19.125 --> 00:10:21.848\nBecause the simple way to do that is:\n\n00:10:21.872 --> 00:10:23.657\nyou go for a walk.\n\n00:10:23.681 --> 00:10:27.096\nYou go for a walk\nin the footsteps of Abraham.\n\n00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.048\nYou retrace the footsteps of Abraham.\n\n00:10:30.072 --> 00:10:32.981\nBecause walking has a real power.\n\n00:10:33.368 --> 00:10:36.425\nYou know, as an anthropologist,\nwalking is what made us human.\n\n00:10:36.449 --> 00:10:40.644\nIt's funny -- when you walk,\nyou walk side-by-side,\n\n00:10:40.668 --> 00:10:42.934\nin the same common direction.\n\n00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.371\nNow if I were to come to you face-to-face\n\n00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:47.641\nand come this close to you,\n\n00:10:47.665 --> 00:10:51.064\nyou would feel threatened.\n\n00:10:51.675 --> 00:10:53.730\nBut if I walk shoulder-to-shoulder,\n\n00:10:53.754 --> 00:10:55.635\neven touching shoulders,\n\n00:10:55.659 --> 00:10:56.934\nit's no problem.\n\n00:10:57.366 --> 00:10:58.934\nWho fights while they walk?\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.934\nThat's why in negotiations,\noften, when things get tough,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.353\npeople go for walks in the woods.\n\n00:11:04.377 --> 00:11:09.799\nSo the idea came to me\nof, what about inspiring a path,\n\n00:11:09.823 --> 00:11:13.461\na route -- think the Silk Route,\nthink the Appalachian Trail --\n\n00:11:13.485 --> 00:11:17.711\nthat followed in the footsteps of Abraham?\n\n00:11:17.735 --> 00:11:19.560\nPeople said, \"That's crazy. You can't.\n\n00:11:19.584 --> 00:11:22.596\nYou can't retrace the footsteps\nof Abraham -- it's too insecure,\n\n00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.478\nyou've got to cross all these borders,\n\n00:11:24.502 --> 00:11:27.184\nit goes across 10 different countries\nin the Middle East,\n\n00:11:27.208 --> 00:11:28.605\nbecause it unites them all.\"\n\n00:11:29.048 --> 00:11:30.884\nAnd so we studied the idea at Harvard.\n\n00:11:30.908 --> 00:11:32.138\nWe did our due diligence.\n\n00:11:32.162 --> 00:11:33.361\nAnd then a few years ago,\n\n00:11:33.385 --> 00:11:36.115\na group of us, about 25 of us\nfrom 10 different countries,\n\n00:11:36.139 --> 00:11:39.319\ndecided to see if we could retrace\nthe footsteps of Abraham,\n\n00:11:39.343 --> 00:11:41.843\ngoing from his initial birthplace\nin the city of Urfa\n\n00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:44.038\nin Southern Turkey, Northern Mesopotamia.\n\n00:11:44.546 --> 00:11:47.506\nAnd we then took a bus and took some walks\n\n00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:51.687\nand went to Harran, where, in the Bible,\nhe sets off on his journey.\n\n00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:54.264\nThen we crossed the border\ninto Syria, went to Aleppo,\n\n00:11:54.288 --> 00:11:56.636\nwhich, turns out, is named after Abraham.\n\n00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.934\nWe went to Damascus,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.702\nwhich has a long history\nassociated with Abraham.\n\n00:12:00.726 --> 00:12:03.488\nWe then came to Northern Jordan,\n\n00:12:03.512 --> 00:12:08.538\nto Jerusalem -- which is all\nabout Abraham -- to Bethlehem,\n\n00:12:08.562 --> 00:12:11.933\nand finally, to the place\nwhere he's buried, in Hebron.\n\n00:12:11.957 --> 00:12:14.240\nSo effectively, we went from womb to tomb.\n\n00:12:14.264 --> 00:12:15.565\nWe showed it could be done.\n\n00:12:15.589 --> 00:12:16.958\nIt was an amazing journey.\n\n00:12:17.292 --> 00:12:18.934\nLet me ask you a question.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:23.321\nHow many of you have had the experience\nof being in a strange neighborhood\n\n00:12:23.345 --> 00:12:25.561\nor strange land,\n\n00:12:25.585 --> 00:12:28.750\nand a total stranger, perfect stranger,\n\n00:12:28.774 --> 00:12:31.496\ncomes up to you\nand shows you some kindness --\n\n00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.019\nmaybe invites you into their home,\ngives you a drink,\n\n00:12:34.043 --> 00:12:35.822\ngives you a coffee, gives you a meal?\n\n00:12:35.846 --> 00:12:38.016\nHow many of you have ever\nhad that experience?\n\n00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.831\nThat's the essence of the Abraham Path.\n\n00:12:40.855 --> 00:12:44.372\nThat's what you discover as you go\ninto these villages in the Middle East\n\n00:12:44.396 --> 00:12:45.731\nwhere you expect hostility,\n\n00:12:45.755 --> 00:12:48.302\nand you get the most amazing hospitality,\n\n00:12:48.326 --> 00:12:49.735\nall associated with Abraham:\n\n00:12:49.759 --> 00:12:53.519\n\"In the name of Father Ibrahim,\nlet me offer you some food.\"\n\n00:12:53.543 --> 00:12:54.726\nSo what we discovered\n\n00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.958\nis that Abraham is not just a figure\nout of a book for those people;\n\n00:12:57.982 --> 00:13:01.138\nhe's alive, he's a living presence.\n\n00:13:01.162 --> 00:13:03.289\nAnd to make a long story short,\n\n00:13:03.313 --> 00:13:05.375\nin the last couple of years now,\n\n00:13:05.399 --> 00:13:10.235\nthousands of people have begun to walk\nparts of the path of Abraham\n\n00:13:10.259 --> 00:13:11.592\nin the Middle East,\n\n00:13:11.616 --> 00:13:14.671\nenjoying the hospitality\nof the people there.\n\n00:13:14.695 --> 00:13:17.934\nThey've begun to walk\nin Israel and Palestine,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.678\nin Jordan, in Turkey, in Syria.\n\n00:13:20.702 --> 00:13:22.011\nIt's an amazing experience.\n\n00:13:22.035 --> 00:13:24.320\nMen, women, young people, old people --\n\n00:13:24.344 --> 00:13:27.175\nmore women than men,\nactually, interestingly.\n\n00:13:27.199 --> 00:13:29.134\nFor those who can't walk,\n\n00:13:29.158 --> 00:13:31.673\nwho are unable to get there right now,\n\n00:13:31.697 --> 00:13:35.317\npeople started to organize walks\nin cities, in their own communities.\n\n00:13:35.341 --> 00:13:37.715\nIn Cincinnati, for instance,\nthey organized a walk\n\n00:13:37.739 --> 00:13:41.581\nfrom a church to a mosque to a synagogue\nand all had an Abrahamic meal together.\n\n00:13:41.605 --> 00:13:43.067\nIt was Abraham Path Day.\n\n00:13:43.091 --> 00:13:45.497\nIn S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil,\nit's become an annual event\n\n00:13:45.521 --> 00:13:49.349\nfor thousands of people to run\nin a virtual Abraham Path Run,\n\n00:13:49.373 --> 00:13:51.144\nuniting the different communities.\n\n00:13:51.168 --> 00:13:54.148\nThe media love it; they really adore it.\n\n00:13:54.172 --> 00:13:57.626\nThey lavish attention on it\nbecause it's visual\n\n00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:59.314\nand it spreads the idea,\n\n00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:03.720\nthis idea of Abrahamic hospitality,\nof kindness towards strangers.\n\n00:14:03.744 --> 00:14:07.934\nAnd just a couple weeks ago,\nthere was an NPR story on it.\n\n00:14:08.547 --> 00:14:09.715\nLast month,\n\n00:14:09.739 --> 00:14:15.656\nthere was a piece\nin the Manchester Guardian about it,\n\n00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.545\ntwo whole pages.\n\n00:14:18.307 --> 00:14:21.527\nAnd they quoted a villager\n\n00:14:21.551 --> 00:14:24.638\nwho said, \"This walk connects\nus to the world.\"\n\n00:14:24.662 --> 00:14:27.479\nHe said, \"It was like a light\nthat went on in our lives --\n\n00:14:27.503 --> 00:14:28.934\nit brought us hope.\"\n\n00:14:29.394 --> 00:14:31.476\nAnd so that's what it's about.\n\n00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.306\nBut it's not just about psychology;\n\n00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:34.806\nit's about economics.\n\n00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.934\nBecause as people walk, they spend money.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.934\nAnd this woman right here, Um Ahmad,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:44.108\nis a woman who lives on the path\nin Northern Jordan.\n\n00:14:44.132 --> 00:14:45.934\nShe's desperately poor.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:49.603\nShe's partially blind,\nher husband can't work,\n\n00:14:49.627 --> 00:14:51.579\nshe's got seven kids.\n\n00:14:52.071 --> 00:14:53.934\nBut what she can do is cook.\n\n00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:57.170\nAnd so she's begun to cook\nfor some groups of walkers\n\n00:14:57.194 --> 00:15:00.798\nwho come through the village\nand have a meal in her home.\n\n00:15:00.822 --> 00:15:04.122\nThey sit on the floor --\nshe doesn't even have a tablecloth.\n\n00:15:04.146 --> 00:15:05.934\nShe makes the most delicious food,\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:09.080\nthat's fresh from the herbs\nin the surrounding countryside.\n\n00:15:09.104 --> 00:15:11.231\nAnd so more and more walkers have come,\n\n00:15:11.255 --> 00:15:15.149\nand lately she's begun to earn an income\nto support her family.\n\n00:15:15.173 --> 00:15:18.050\nAnd so she told our team there, she said,\n\n00:15:18.074 --> 00:15:21.240\n\"You have made me visible\n\n00:15:21.264 --> 00:15:24.934\nin a village where people\nwere once ashamed to look at me.\"\n\n00:15:25.713 --> 00:15:27.934\nThat's the potential of the Abraham Path.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.720\nThere are literally hundreds\nof those kinds of communities\n\n00:15:30.744 --> 00:15:33.210\nacross the Middle East, across the path.\n\n00:15:34.154 --> 00:15:37.060\nThe potential is basically\nto change the game.\n\n00:15:37.417 --> 00:15:41.123\nAnd to change the game, you have to change\nthe frame, the way we see things --\n\n00:15:41.147 --> 00:15:46.465\nto change the frame\nfrom hostility to hospitality,\n\n00:15:46.489 --> 00:15:48.934\nfrom terrorism to tourism.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.695\nAnd in that sense, the Abraham Path\n\n00:15:51.719 --> 00:15:53.330\nis a game-changer.\n\n00:15:53.845 --> 00:15:55.623\nLet me just show you one thing.\n\n00:15:55.647 --> 00:15:57.257\nI have a little acorn here\n\n00:15:57.281 --> 00:16:00.768\nthat I picked up while I was walking\non the path earlier this year.\n\n00:16:01.324 --> 00:16:04.171\nNow, the acorn is associated\nwith the oak tree, of course --\n\n00:16:04.195 --> 00:16:07.273\ngrows into an oak tree,\nwhich is associated with Abraham.\n\n00:16:07.297 --> 00:16:09.240\nThe path right now is like an acorn;\n\n00:16:09.264 --> 00:16:10.934\nit's still in its early phase.\n\n00:16:11.351 --> 00:16:13.271\nWhat would the oak tree look like?\n\n00:16:13.295 --> 00:16:14.934\nWhen I think back to my childhood,\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.911\na good part of which I spent,\nafter being born here in Chicago,\n\n00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:19.290\nI spent in Europe.\n\n00:16:19.769 --> 00:16:26.475\nIf you had been in the ruins of, say,\nLondon in 1945, or Berlin,\n\n00:16:26.499 --> 00:16:27.698\nand you had said,\n\n00:16:27.722 --> 00:16:29.405\n\"Sixty years from now,\n\n00:16:29.429 --> 00:16:32.754\nthis is going to be the most peaceful,\nprosperous part of the planet,\"\n\n00:16:32.778 --> 00:16:36.092\npeople would have thought\nyou were certifiably insane.\n\n00:16:36.116 --> 00:16:39.934\nBut they did it, thanks\nto a common identity, Europe,\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.934\nand a common economy.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:45.267\nSo my question is,\nif it can be done in Europe,\n\n00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:46.934\nwhy not in the Middle East?\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:51.645\nWhy not, thanks to a common identity,\nwhich is the story of Abraham,\n\n00:16:51.669 --> 00:16:56.363\nand thanks to a common economy that\nwould be based, in good part, on tourism?\n\n00:16:57.148 --> 00:16:59.355\nSo let me conclude, then,\n\n00:16:59.379 --> 00:17:02.728\nby saying that in the last 35 years,\n\n00:17:02.752 --> 00:17:05.169\nas I've worked\nin some of the most dangerous,\n\n00:17:05.193 --> 00:17:08.120\ndifficult and intractable conflicts\naround the planet,\n\n00:17:08.144 --> 00:17:13.749\nI have yet to see one conflict\nthat I felt could not be transformed.\n\n00:17:14.296 --> 00:17:16.149\nIt's not easy, of course.\n\n00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:17.934\nBut it's possible.\n\n00:17:18.424 --> 00:17:20.364\nIt was done in South Africa.\n\n00:17:20.388 --> 00:17:22.273\nIt was done in Northern Ireland.\n\n00:17:22.297 --> 00:17:23.814\nIt could be done anywhere.\n\n00:17:23.838 --> 00:17:26.464\nIt simply depends on us.\n\n00:17:26.488 --> 00:17:29.340\nIt depends on us taking the third side.\n\n00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.492\nSo let me invite you to consider\ntaking the third side,\n\n00:17:33.516 --> 00:17:35.182\neven as a very small step.\n\n00:17:35.206 --> 00:17:37.428\nWe're about to take a break in a moment.\n\n00:17:37.452 --> 00:17:39.429\nJust go up to someone\n\n00:17:39.453 --> 00:17:42.096\nwho's from a different culture,\na different country,\n\n00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.475\na different ethnicity --\nsome difference --\n\n00:17:44.499 --> 00:17:46.136\nand engage them in a conversation.\n\n00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.394\nListen to them.\n\n00:17:47.418 --> 00:17:48.934\nThat's a third-side act.\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:51.242\nThat's walking Abraham's Path.\n\n00:17:51.266 --> 00:17:52.791\nAfter a TED Talk,\n\n00:17:52.815 --> 00:17:54.264\nwhy not a TED Walk?\n\n00:17:54.288 --> 00:17:55.709\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:55.733 --> 00:17:59.896\nSo let me just leave you\nwith three things.\n\n00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.629\nOne is, the secret to peace\nis the third side.\n\n00:18:05.344 --> 00:18:07.764\nThe third side is us.\n\n00:18:07.788 --> 00:18:11.359\nEach of us, with a single step,\n\n00:18:11.383 --> 00:18:14.103\ncan take the world, can bring the world\n\n00:18:14.127 --> 00:18:16.033\na step closer to peace.\n\n00:18:17.276 --> 00:18:19.332\nThere's an old African proverb that goes:\n\n00:18:19.356 --> 00:18:21.522\n\"When spiderwebs unite,\n\n00:18:21.546 --> 00:18:24.109\nthey can halt even the lion.\"\n\n00:18:24.628 --> 00:18:28.903\nIf we're able to unite\nour third-side webs of peace,\n\n00:18:28.927 --> 00:18:31.935\nwe can even halt the lion of war.\n\n00:18:31.959 --> 00:18:33.110\nThank you very much.\n\n00:18:33.134 --> 00:18:36.453\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why not eat insects?", "duration": "994", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/marcel_dicke_why_not_eat_insects", "transcript": "Okay, I'm going to show you again something about our diets. And I would like to know what the audience is, and so who of you ever ate insects? That's quite a lot. (Laughter) But still, you're not representing the overall population of the Earth. (Laughter) Because there's 80 percent out there that really eats insects. But this is quite good.Why not eat insects? Well first, what are insects? Insects are animals that walk around on six legs. And here you see just a selection. There's six million species of insects on this planet, six million species. There's a few hundreds of mammals \u2014 six million species of insects. In fact, if we count all the individual organisms, we would come at much larger numbers. In fact, of all animals on Earth, of all animal species, 80 percent walks on six legs. But if we would count all the individuals, and we take an average weight of them, it would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms for each of you and me on Earth. That means that in terms of biomass, insects are more abundant than we are, and we're not on a planet of men, but we're on a planet of insects. Insects are not only there in nature, but they also are involved in our economy, usually without us knowing.There was an estimation, a conservative estimation, a couple of years ago that the U.S. economy benefited by 57 billion dollars per year. It's a number \u2014 very large \u2014 a contribution to the economy of the United States for free. And so I looked up what the economy was paying for the war in Iraq in the same year. It was 80 billion U.S. dollars. Well we know that that was not a cheap war. So insects, just for free, contribute to the economy of the United States with about the same order of magnitude, just for free, without everyone knowing. And not only in the States, but in any country, in any economy.What do they do? They remove dung, they pollinate our crops. A third of all the fruits that we eat are all a result of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants. They control pests, and they're food for animals. They're at the start of food chains. Small animals eat insects. Even larger animals eat insects. But the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals, still larger animals. And at the end of the food chain, we are eating them as well. There's quite a lot of people that are eating insects. And here you see me in a small, provincial town in China, Lijiang \u2014 about two million inhabitants. If you go out for dinner, like in a fish restaurant, where you can select which fish you want to eat, you can select which insects you would like to eat. And they prepare it in a wonderful way. And here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars, locusts, bee pupae \u2014 delicacies. And you can eat something new everyday. There's more than 1,000 species of insects that are being eaten all around the globe. That's quite a bit more than just a few mammals that we're eating, like a cow or a pig or a sheep. More than 1,000 species \u2014 an enormous variety. And now you may think, okay, in this provincial town in China they're doing that, but not us.Well we've seen already that quite some of you already ate insects maybe occasionally, but I can tell you that every one of you is eating insects, without any exception. You're eating at least 500 grams per year. What are you eating? Tomato soup, peanut butter, chocolate, noodles \u2014 any processed food that you're eating contains insects, because insects are here all around us, and when they're out there in nature they're also in our crops. Some fruits get some insect damage. Those are the fruits, if they're tomato, that go to the tomato soup. If they don't have any damage, they go to the grocery. And that's your view of a tomato. But there's tomatoes that end up in a soup, and as long as they meet the requirements of the food agency, there can be all kinds of things in there, no problem. In fact, why would we put these balls in the soup, there's meat in there anyway? (Laughter) In fact, all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of. So anything is a good protein source already.Now you may say, \"Okay, so we're eating 500 grams just by accident.\" We're even doing this on purpose. In a lot of food items that we have \u2014 I have only two items here on the slide \u2014 pink cookies or surimi sticks or, if you like, Campari \u2014 a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye. The surimi sticks [of] crabmeat, or is being sold as crab meat, is white fish that's being dyed with cochineal. Cochineal is a product of an insect that lives off these cacti. It's being produced in large amounts, 150 to 180 metric tons per year in the Canary Islands in Peru, and it's big business. One gram of cochineal costs about 30 euros. One gram of gold is 30 euros. So it's a very precious thing that we're using to dye our foods.Now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me, for everyone on this Earth. The human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially. Where, at the moment, we have something between six and seven billion people, it will grow to about nine billion in 2050. That means that we have a lot more mouths to feed, and this is something that worries more and more people. There was an FAO conference last October that was completely devoted to this. How are we going to feed this world? And if you look at the figures up there, it says that we have a third more mouths to feed, but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent. And that's especially because this world population is increasing, and it's increasing, not only in numbers, but we're also getting wealthier, and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more and also starts to eat more meat. And meat, in fact, is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production.Our diet consists, [in] some part, of animal proteins, and at the moment, most of us here get it from livestock, from fish, from game. And we eat quite a lot of it. In the developed world it's on average 80 kilograms per person per year, which goes up to 120 in the United States and a bit lower in some other countries, but on average 80 kilograms per person per year. In the developing world it's much lower. It's 25 kilograms per person per year. But it's increasing enormously. In China in the last 20 years, it increased from 20 to 50, and it's still increasing. So if a third of the world population is going to increase its meat consumption from 25 to 80 on average, and a third of the world population is living in China and in India, we're having an enormous demand on meat. And of course, we are not there to say that's only for us, it's not for them. They have the same share that we have.Now to start with, I should say that we are eating way too much meat in the Western world. We could do with much, much less \u2014 and I know, I've been a vegetarian for a long time, and you can easily do without anything. You'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway. But then there's a lot of problems that come with meat production, and we're being faced with that more and more often. The first problem that we're facing is human health. Pigs are quite like us. They're even models in medicine, and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human. That means that pigs also share diseases with us. And a pig disease, a pig virus, and a human virus can both proliferate, and because of their kind of reproduction, they can combine and produce a new virus. This has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s during the classical swine fever outbreak. You get a new disease that can be deadly. We eat insects \u2014 they're so distantly related from us that this doesn't happen. So that's one point for insects.(Laughter)And there's the conversion factor. You take 10 kilograms of feed, you can get one kilogram of beef, but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat. So if you would be an entrepreneur, what would you do? With 10 kilograms of input, you can get either one or nine kg. of output. So far we're taking the one, or up to five kilograms of output. We're not taking the bonus yet. We're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet. So that's two points for insects.(Laughter)And there's the environment. If we take 10 kilograms of food \u2014 (Laughter) and it results in one kilogram of beef, the other nine kilograms are waste, and a lot of that is manure. If you produce insects, you have less manure per kilogram of meat that you produce. So less waste. Furthermore, per kilogram of manure, you have much, much less ammonia and fewer greenhouse gases when you have insect manure than when you have cow manure. So you have less waste, and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung. So that's three points for insects.(Laughter)Now there's a big \"if,\" of course, and it is if insects produce meat that is of good quality. Well there have been all kinds of analyses and in terms of protein, or fat, or vitamins, it's very good. In fact, it's comparable to anything we eat as meat at the moment. And even in terms of calories, it is very good. One kilogram of grasshoppers has the same amount of calories as 10 hot dogs, or six Big Macs. So that's four points for insects.(Laughter)I can go on, and I could make many more points for insects, but time doesn't allow this. So the question is, why not eat insects? I gave you at least four arguments in favor. We'll have to. Even if you don't like it, you'll have to get used to this because at the moment, 70 percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock. That's not only the land where the livestock is walking and feeding, but it's also other areas where the feed is being produced and being transported. We can increase it a bit at the expense of rainforests, but there's a limitation very soon. And if you remember that we need to increase agricultural production by 70 percent, we're not going to make it that way. We could much better change from meat, from beef, to insects. And then 80 percent of the world already eats insects, so we are just a minority \u2014 in a country like the U.K., the USA, the Netherlands, anywhere. On the left-hand side, you see a market in Laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night. On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper. So people there are eating them, not because they're hungry, but because they think it's a delicacy. It's just very good food. You can vary enormously. It has many benefits.In fact, we have delicacy that's very much like this grasshopper: shrimps, a delicacy being sold at a high price. Who wouldn't like to eat a shrimp? There are a few people who don't like shrimp, but shrimp, or crabs, or crayfish, are very closely related. They are delicacies. In fact, a locust is a \"shrimp\" of the land, and it would make very good into our diet. So why are we not eating insects yet? Well that's just a matter of mindset. We're not used to it, and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us. That's why we're changing the perception of insects. And I'm working very hard with my colleague, Arnold van Huis, in telling people what insects are, what magnificent things they are, what magnificent jobs they do in nature. And in fact, without insects, we would not be here in this room, because if the insects die out, we will soon die out as well. If we die out, the insects will continue very happily.(Laughter)So we have to get used to the idea of eating insects. And some might think, well they're not yet available. Well they are. There are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them, and one of them is here in the audience, Marian Peeters, who's in the picture. I predict that later this year, you'll get them in the supermarkets \u2014 not visible, but as animal protein in the food. And maybe by 2020, you'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat. And they're being made in the most wonderful ways. A Dutch chocolate maker. (Music) (Applause) So there's even a lot of design to it.(Laughter)Well in the Netherlands, we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture, and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry. And when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U. over to the Hague recently, she went to a high-class restaurant, and they ate insects all together. It's not something that is a hobby of mine. It's really taken off the ground. So why not eat insects? You should try it yourself. A couple of years ago, we had 1,750 people all together in a square in Wageningen town, and they ate insects at the same moment, and this was still big, big news. I think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects, because it's just a normal way of doing.So you can try it yourself today, and I would say, enjoy. And I'm going to show to Bruno some first tries, and he can have the first bite.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Look at them first. Look at them first.Marcel Dicke: It's all protein.BG: That's exactly the same [one] you saw in the video actually. And it looks delicious.

come at much larger numbers.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nIn fact, of all animals on Earth,\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nof all animal species,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\n80 percent

00:01:39.958\nusually without us knowing.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nThere was an estimation,\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\na conservative estimation, a couple of years ago\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nthat the U.S. economy\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nbenefited by 57 billion\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\ndollars per year.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nIt's a number -- very large --\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\na contribution to the economy of the United States for free.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nAnd so I looked up what the economy was paying\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nfor the war in Iraq\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nin the same year.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nIt was 80 billion U.S. dollars.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nWell we know that that\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nwas not a cheap war.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nSo insects, just for free,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\ncontribute to the economy of the United States\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nwith about the same order of magnitude,\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\njust for free, without everyone knowing.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nAnd not only in the States,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nbut in any country, in any economy.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nWhat do they do?\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nThey remove dung, they pollinate our crops.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nA third of all the fruits that we eat\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nare all a result\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nof insects taking care of the reproduction of plants.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nThey control pests,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nand they're food for animals.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nThey're at the start of food chains.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nSmall animals eat insects.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nEven larger animals eat insects.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nBut the small animals that eat insects\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nare being eaten by larger animals,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nstill larger animals.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nAnd at the end of the food chain, we are eating them as well.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nThere's quite a lot of people that are eating insects.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nAnd here you see me\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nin a small, provincial town in China, Lijiang --\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nabout two million inhabitants.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nIf you go out for dinner, like in a fish restaurant,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nwhere you can select which fish you want to eat,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nyou can select which insects you would like to eat.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nAnd they prepare it in a wonderful way.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nAnd here you see me enjoying a meal\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nwith caterpillars, locusts,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nbee pupae -- delicacies.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd you can eat something new everyday.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nThere's more than 1,000 species of insects\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nthat are being eaten all around the globe.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nThat's quite a bit more\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nthan just a few mammals that we're eating,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nlike a cow or a pig\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nor a sheep.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nMore than 1,000 species --\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nan enormous variety.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nAnd now you may think, okay,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nin this provincial town in China they're doing that, but not us.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nWell we've seen already that quite some of you\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nalready ate insects maybe occasionally,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nbut I can tell you that every one of you\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nis eating insects, without any exception.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nYou're eating at least\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\n500 grams per year.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nWhat are you eating?\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nTomato soup, peanut butter,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nchocolate, noodles --\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nany processed food that you're eating\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\ncontains insects,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nbecause insects are here all around us,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nand when they're out there in nature\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nthey're also in our crops.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nSome fruits get some insect damage.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nThose are the fruits, if they're tomato,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nthat go to the tomato soup.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nIf they don't have any damage, they go to the grocery.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nAnd that's your view of a tomato.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nBut there's tomatoes that end up in a soup,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand as long as they meet\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nthe requirements of the food agency,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nthere can be all kinds of things in there,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nno problem.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nIn fact, why would we put these balls in the soup,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nthere's meat in there anyway?\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nIn fact, all our processed foods\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\ncontain more proteins\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nthan we would be aware of.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nSo anything is a good protein source already.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nNow you may say,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\n\"Okay, so we're eating 500 grams just by accident.\"\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nWe're even doing this on purpose.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nIn a lot of food items that we have --\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nI have only two items\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nhere on the slide --\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\npink cookies or surimi sticks\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nor, if you like, Campari --\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\na lot of our food products that are of a red color\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nare dyed with a natural dye.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nThe surimi sticks\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\n[of] crabmeat, or is being sold as crab meat,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nis white fish\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nthat's being dyed with cochineal.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nCochineal is a product\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nof an insect that lives off these cacti.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nIt's being produced in large amounts,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\n150 to 180 metric tons per year\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nin the Canary Islands in Peru,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nand it's big business.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nOne gram of cochineal\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\ncosts about 30 euros.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nOne gram of gold\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nis 30 euros.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nSo it's a very precious thing\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nthat we're using to dye our foods.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nNow the situation in the world is going to change\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nfor you and me, for everyone on this Earth.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nThe human population is growing very rapidly\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nand is growing exponentially.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nWhere, at the moment, we have\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nsomething between six and seven billion people,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nit will grow to about nine billion\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nin 2050.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nThat means that we have a lot more mouths to feed,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nand this is something that worries more and more people.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nThere was an FAO conference last October\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nthat was completely devoted to this.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nHow are we going to feed this world?\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nAnd if you look at the figures up there,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nit says that we have a third more mouths to feed,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nbut we need an agricultural production increase\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nof 70 percent.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd that's especially because this world population\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nis increasing,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nand it's increasing, not only in numbers,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nbut we're also getting wealthier,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nand anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nand also starts to eat more meat.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nAnd meat, in fact, is something\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nthat costs a lot\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nof our agricultural production.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nOur diet consists, [in] some part, of animal proteins,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nand at the moment, most of us here\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nget it from livestock,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nfrom fish, from game.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nAnd we eat quite a lot of it.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nIn the developed world it's on average\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\n80 kilograms per person per year,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nwhich goes up to 120\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nin the United States\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nand a bit lower in some other countries,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nbut on average 80 kilograms\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nper person per year.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nIn the developing world it's much lower.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nIt's 25 kilograms per person per year.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nBut it's increasing enormously.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nIn China in the last 20 years,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nit increased from 20 to 50,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nand it's still increasing.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nSo if a third of the world population\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nis going to increase its meat consumption\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nfrom 25 to 80 on average,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nand a third of the world population\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nis living in China and in India,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nwe're having an enormous demand on meat.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nAnd of course, we are not there to say\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nthat's only for us, it's not for them.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nThey have the same share that we have.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nNow to start with, I should say\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nthat we are eating way too much meat\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nin the Western world.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nWe could do with much, much less --\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nand I know, I've been a vegetarian for a long time,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nand you can easily do without anything.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nYou'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nBut then there's a lot of problems\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nthat come with meat production,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nand we're being faced with that more and more often.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nThe first problem that we're facing is human health.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nPigs are quite like us.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nThey're even models in medicine,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nand we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nThat means that pigs also share diseases with us.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nAnd a pig disease,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\na pig virus, and a human virus\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\ncan both proliferate,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nand because of their kind of reproduction,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nthey can combine and produce a new virus.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nThis has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nduring the classical swine fever outbreak.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nYou get a new disease that can be deadly.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nWe eat insects -- they're so distantly related from us\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nthat this doesn't happen.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nSo that's one point for insects.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nAnd there's the conversion factor.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nYou take 10 kilograms of feed,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nyou can get one kilogram of beef,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nbut you can get nine kilograms of locust meat.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nSo if you would be an entrepreneur,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nwhat would you do?\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nWith 10 kilograms of input,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nyou can get either one or nine kg. of output.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nSo far we're taking\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nthe one, or up to five kilograms of output.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nWe're not taking the bonus yet.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nWe're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nSo that's two points for insects.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nAnd there's the environment.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nIf we take 10 kilograms of food --\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nand it results in one kilogram of beef,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nthe other nine kilograms are waste,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nand a lot of that is manure.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nIf you produce insects, you have less manure\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nper kilogram of meat that you produce.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nSo less waste.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nFurthermore, per kilogram of manure,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nyou have much, much less ammonia\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nand fewer greenhouse gases\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nwhen you have insect manure\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nthan when you have cow manure.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nSo you have less waste,\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nand the waste that you have is not as environmental malign\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nas it is with cow dung.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nSo that's three points for insects.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nNow there's a big \"if,\" of course,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nand it is if insects produce meat\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nthat is of good quality.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nWell there have been all kinds of analyses\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nand in terms of protein, or fat, or vitamins,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nit's very good.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nIn fact, it's comparable\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nto anything we eat as meat at the moment.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nAnd even in terms of calories, it is very good.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nOne kilogram of grasshoppers\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nhas the same amount of calories\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nas 10 hot dogs, or six Big Macs.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nSo that's four points for insects.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nI can go on,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nand I could make many more points for insects,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nbut time doesn't allow this.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nSo the question is, why not eat insects?\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nI gave you at least four arguments in favor.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nWe'll have to.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nEven if you don't like it,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nyou'll have to get used to this\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nbecause at the moment,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\n70 percent of all our agricultural land\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nis being used to produce livestock.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nThat's not only the land\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nwhere the livestock is walking and feeding,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nbut it's also other areas\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nwhere the feed is being produced and being transported.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nWe can increase it a bit\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nat the expense of rainforests,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nbut there's a limitation very soon.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nAnd if you remember that we need to increase\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nagricultural production by 70 percent,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nwe're not going to make it that way.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nWe could much better change\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nfrom meat, from beef,\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nto insects.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nAnd then 80 percent of the world\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nalready eats insects,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nso we are just a minority --\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nin a country like the U.K., the USA,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nthe Netherlands, anywhere.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nOn the left-hand side, you see a market in Laos\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nwhere they have abundantly present\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nall kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nOn the right-hand side you see a grasshopper.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nSo people there are eating them,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nnot because they're hungry,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nbut because they think it's a delicacy.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nIt's just very good food.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nYou can vary enormously.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nIt has many benefits.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nIn fact, we have delicacy\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nthat's very much like this grasshopper:\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nshrimps, a delicacy\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nbeing sold at a high price.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nWho wouldn't like to eat a shrimp?\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nThere are a few people who don't like shrimp,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nbut shrimp, or crabs,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nor crayfish,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nare very closely related.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nThey are delicacies.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nIn fact, a locust is a \"shrimp\" of the land,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nand it would make very good into our diet.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nSo why are we not eating insects yet?\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nWell that's just a matter of mindset.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nWe're not used to it,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nand we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nThat's why we're changing the perception of insects.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nAnd I'm working very hard with my colleague, Arnold van Huis,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nin telling people what insects are,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nwhat magnificent things they are,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nwhat magnificent jobs they do in nature.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd in fact, without insects,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nwe would not be here in this room,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nbecause if the insects die out,\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nwe will soon die out as well.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nIf we die out, the insects will continue very happily.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nSo we have to get used to the idea of eating insects.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nAnd some might think, well they're not yet available.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nWell they are.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nThere are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nand one of them is here in the audience,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nMarian Peeters, who's in the picture.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nI predict that later this year, you'll get them in the supermarkets --\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nnot visible, but as animal protein\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nin the food.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nAnd maybe by 2020,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nyou'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nAnd they're being made in the most wonderful ways.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nA Dutch chocolate maker.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\n(Music)\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nSo there's even a lot of design to it.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nWell in the Netherlands, we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nand she puts the insects on the menu\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nin her restaurant in her ministry.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nAnd when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nover to the Hague recently,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nshe went to a high-class restaurant,\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nand they ate insects all together.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nIt's not something that is a hobby of mine.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nIt's really taken off the ground.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nSo why not eat insects?\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nYou should try it yourself.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nA couple of years ago, we had 1,750 people all together\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nin a square in Wageningen town,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nand they ate insects at the same moment,\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nand this was still big, big news.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nI think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects,\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nbecause it's just a normal way of doing.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nSo you can try it yourself today,\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nand I would say, enjoy.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nAnd I'm going to show to Bruno some first tries,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nand he can have the first bite.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:16:03.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nBruno Giussani: Look at them first. Look at them first.\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nMarcel Dicke: It's all protein.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nBG: That's exactly the same [one] you saw in the video actually.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nAnd it looks delicious.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nThey just make it [with] nuts or something.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nMD: Thank you.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How I taught rats to sniff out land mines", "duration": "731", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/bart_weetjens_how_i_taught_rats_to_sniff_out_land_mines", "transcript": "I'm here today to share with you an extraordinary journey - extraordinarily rewarding journey, actually - which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis. As a child, I had two passions. One was a passion for rodents. I had all kinds of rats, mice, hamsters, gerbils, squirrels. You name it, I bred it, and I sold them to pet shops. (Laughter) I also had a passion for Africa. Growing up in a multicultural environment, we had African students in the house, and I learned about their stories, so different backgrounds, dependency on imported know-how, goods, services, exuberant cultural diversity. Africa was truly fascinating for me.I became an industrial engineer, engineer in product development, and I focused on appropriate detection technologies, actually the first appropriate technologies for developing countries. I started working in the industry, but I wasn't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear, extracting and manufacturing mode. I quit my job to focus on the real world problem: landmines. We're talking '95 now. Princess Diana is announcing on TV that landmines form a structural barrier to any development, which is really true. As long as these devices are there, or there is suspicion of landmines, you can't really enter into the land. Actually, there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where they're needed to produce, which is mainly in the developing world. We chose rats.Why would you choose rats? Because, aren't they vermin? Well, actually rats are, in contrary to what most people think about them, rats are highly sociable creatures. And actually, our product \u2014 what you see here. There's a target somewhere here. You see an operator, a trained African with his rats in front who actually are left and right. There, the animal finds a mine. It scratches on the soil. And the animal comes back for a food reward. Very, very simple. Very sustainable in this environment. Here, the animal gets its food reward. And that's how it works. Very, very simple.Now why would you use rats? Rats have been used since the '50s last century, in all kinds of experiments. Rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species. They're extremely sensitive to smell. Moreover, they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it. Now how do we communicate with rats? Well don't talk rat, but we have a clicker, a standard method for animal training, which you see there. A clicker, which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors. First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward, which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe. Once the animal knows click, food, click, food, click, food \u2014 so click is food \u2014 we bring it in a cage with a hole, and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed, and to do that for five seconds \u2014 five seconds, which is long for a rat. Once the animal knows this, we make the task a bit more difficult. It learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes.Then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets. In the next step, animals learn to find real mines in real minefields. They are tested and accredited according to International Mine Action Standards, just like dogs have to pass a test. This consists of 400 square meters. There's a number of mines placed blindly, and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets. If the animal does that, it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field \u2014 just like dogs, by the way. Maybe one slight difference: we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog.This is our team in Mozambique: one Tanzanian trainer, who transfers the skills to these three Mozambican fellows. And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people. They have a skill, which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid. Moreover, this small team together with, of course, you need the heavy vehicles and the manual de-miners to follow-up. But with this small investment in a rat capacity, we have demonstrated in Mozambique that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter up to 60 percent of what is currently normal \u2014 two dollars per square meter, we do it at $1.18, and we can still bring that price down. Question of scale. If you can bring in more rats, we can actually make the output even bigger. We have a demonstration site in Mozambique. Eleven African governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology. They have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the Great Lakes region, and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines.But let me bring you to a very different problem. And there's about 6,000 people last year that walked on a landmine, but worldwide last year, almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection. Especially in Africa where T.B. and HIV are strongly linked, there is a huge common problem. Microscopy, the standard WHO procedure, reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability. In Tanzania \u2014 the numbers don't lie \u2014 45 percent of people \u2014 T.B. patients \u2014 get diagnosed with T.B. before they die. It means that, if you have T.B., you have more chance that you won't be detected, but will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on. And if, however, you are detected very early, diagnosed early, treatment can start, and even in HIV-positives, it makes sense. You can actually cure T.B., even in HIV-positives.So in our common language, Dutch, the name for T.B. is \"tering,\" which, etymologically, refers to the smell of tar. Already the old Chinese and the Greek, Hippocrates, have actually published, documented, that T.B. can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients. So what we did is we collected some samples \u2014 just as a way of testing \u2014 from hospitals, trained rats on them and see if this works, and wonder, well, we can reach 89 percent sensitivity, 86 percent specificity using multiple rats in a row. This is how it works, and really, this is a generic technology. We're talking now explosives, tuberculosis, but can you imagine, you can actually put anything under there.So how does it work? You have a cassette with 10 samples. You put these 10 samples at once in the cage. An animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent, so it goes extremely fast. Here it's already at the third sample. This is a positive sample. It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward. And by doing so, very fast, we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive, which are negative. Just as an indication, whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day, a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only. A cage like this \u2014 (Applause) A cage like this \u2014 provided that you have rats, and we have now currently 25 tuberculosis rats \u2014 a cage like this, operating throughout the day, can process 1,680 samples. Can you imagine the potential offspring applications \u2014 environmental detection of pollutants in soils, customs applications, detection of illicit goods in containers and so on.But let's stick first to tuberculosis. I just want to briefly highlight, the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam on a population of 500,000 people, where 15,000 reported to get a test done. Microscopy for 1,800 patients. And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back, we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent. Throughout last year, we've been \u2014 depending on which intervals you take \u2014 we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam between 30 and 40 percent. So this is really considerable. Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to 15 people, healthy people, per year, you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives. At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives.The way forward for us is now to standardize this technology. And there are simple things like, for instance, we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds. So, to standardize this. Also, to standardize the pellets, the food rewards, and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people. To conclude, there are also other applications at the horizon. Here is a first prototype of our camera rat, which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on. This is in a prototype stage. We don't have a working system here yet.To conclude, I would actually like to say, you may think this is about rats, these projects, but in the end it is about people. It is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult, expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks, and doing that with a local resource, plenty available. So something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you, whether they are environmental, technological, animal, or human. And to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable world.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1019, "subtitle":

-\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nextraordinarily rewarding journey,\nactually -\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nwhich brought me into\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.958\ntraining rats\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nto save human lives\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nby detecting landmines\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nand tuberculosis.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nAs a child, I had two passions.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nOne was a passion for rodents.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nI had all kinds of rats,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nmice, hamsters,\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\ngerbils, squirrels.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nYou name it, I bred it, and I sold them to pet shops.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nI also had a passion for Africa.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nGrowing up in a multicultural environment,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nwe had African students in the house,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nand I learned about their stories,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nso different backgrounds,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\ndependency on imported know-how,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\ngoods, services,\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nexuberant cultural diversity.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nAfrica was truly fascinating for me.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nI became an industrial engineer,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nengineer in product development,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nand I focused on appropriate detection technologies,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nactually the first appropriate technologies\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nfor developing countries.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nI started working in the industry,\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nbut I wasn't really happy to contribute\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nto a material consumer society\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nin a linear, extracting\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nand manufacturing mode.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nI quit my job to focus on the real world problem:\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nlandmines.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nWe're talking '95 now.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nPrincess Diana is announcing on TV\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nthat landmines form a structural barrier\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nto any development, which is really true.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nAs long as these devices are there,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nor there is suspicion of landmines,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nyou can't really enter into the land.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nActually, there was an appeal worldwide\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nfor new detectors\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nsustainable in the environments\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nwhere they're needed to produce,\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nwhich is mainly in the developing world.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nWe chose rats.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nWhy would you choose rats?\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nBecause, aren't they vermin?\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nWell, actually rats are,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nin contrary to what most people think about them,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nrats are highly sociable creatures.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nAnd actually, our product -- what you see here.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nThere's a target somewhere here.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nYou see an operator, a trained African\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nwith his rats in front\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nwho actually are left and right.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nThere, the animal finds a mine.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nIt scratches on the soil.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nAnd the animal comes back for a food reward.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nVery, very simple.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nVery sustainable in this environment.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nHere, the animal gets its food reward.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nAnd that's how it works.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nVery, very simple.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nNow why would you use rats?\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nRats have been used since the '50s last century,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nin all kinds of experiments.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nRats have more genetic material\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nallocated to olfaction\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nthan any other mammal species.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nThey're extremely sensitive to smell.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nMoreover, they have the mechanisms to map all these smells\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nand to communicate about it.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nNow how do we communicate with rats?\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nWell don't talk rat,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nbut we have a clicker,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\na standard method for animal training,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nwhich you see there.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nA clicker, which makes a particular sound\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nwith which you can reinforce particular behaviors.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nFirst of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nwhich is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nOnce the animal knows click, food,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nclick, food, click, food --\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nso click is food --\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nwe bring it in a cage with a hole,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nand actually the animal learns\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nto stick the nose in the hole\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nunder which a target scent is placed,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nand to do that for five seconds --\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nfive seconds, which is long for a rat.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nOnce the animal knows this, we make the task a bit more difficult.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nIt learns how to find the target smell\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nin a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nThen the animal learns\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nto walk on a leash in the open\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nand find targets.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nIn the next step, animals learn\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nto find real mines in real minefields.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nThey are tested and accredited\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\naccording to International Mine Action Standards,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\njust like dogs have to pass a test.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nThis consists of 400 square meters.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nThere's a number of mines\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nplaced blindly,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nand the team of trainer and their rat\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nhave to find all the targets.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nIf the animal does that, it gets a license\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nas an accredited animal\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nto be operational in the field --\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\njust like dogs, by the way.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nMaybe one slight difference:\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nwe can train rats at a fifth of the price\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nof training the mining dog.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nThis is our team in Mozambique:\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\none Tanzanian trainer,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nwho transfers the skills\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nto these three Mozambican fellows.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nAnd you should see the pride in the eyes of these people.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nThey have a skill,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nwhich makes them much less dependent\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\non foreign aid.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nMoreover, this small team\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\ntogether with, of course, you need the heavy vehicles\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nand the manual de-miners to follow-up.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nBut with this small investment in a rat capacity,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nwe have demonstrated in Mozambique\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nthat we can reduce the cost-price per square meter\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nup to 60 percent\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nof what is currently normal --\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\ntwo dollars per square meter, we do it at $1.18,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nand we can still bring that price down.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nQuestion of scale.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nIf you can bring in more rats,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nwe can actually make the output even bigger.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nWe have a demonstration site in Mozambique.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nEleven African governments\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nhave seen that they can become less dependent\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nby using this technology.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nThey have signed the pact for peace\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nand treaty in the Great Lakes region,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nand they endorse hero rats\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nto clear their common borders of landmines.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nBut let me bring you to a very different problem.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nAnd there's about 6,000 people last year\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthat walked on a landmine,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nbut worldwide last year,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nalmost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nas a first cause of infection.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nEspecially in Africa\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nwhere T.B. and HIV are strongly linked,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nthere is a huge common problem.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nMicroscopy, the standard WHO procedure,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nreaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nIn Tanzania -- the numbers don't lie --\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\n45 percent of people -- T.B. patients --\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nget diagnosed with T.B. before they die.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nIt means that, if you have T.B.,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nyou have more chance that you won't be detected,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nbut will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nAnd if, however,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nyou are detected very early, diagnosed early,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\ntreatment can start,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nand even in HIV-positives, it makes sense.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nYou can actually cure T.B.,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\neven in HIV-positives.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nSo in our common language, Dutch,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nthe name for T.B.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nis \"tering,\"\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nwhich, etymologically,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nrefers to the smell of tar.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nAlready the old Chinese\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nand the Greek, Hippocrates,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nhave actually published,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\ndocumented, that T.B. can be diagnosed\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nbased on the volatiles\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nexuding from patients.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nSo what we did is we collected some samples --\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\njust as a way of testing --\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nfrom hospitals,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\ntrained rats on them\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nand see if this works,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nand wonder, well,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nwe can reach 89 percent sensitivity,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\n86 percent specificity\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nusing multiple rats in a row.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nThis is how it works,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nand really, this is a generic technology.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nWe're talking now explosives, tuberculosis,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nbut can you imagine,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nyou can actually put anything under there.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nSo how does it work?\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nYou have a cassette with 10 samples.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nYou put these 10 samples at once in the cage.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nAn animal only needs two hundredths of a second\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nto discriminate the scent, so it goes extremely fast.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nHere it's already at the third sample.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nThis is a positive sample.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nIt gets a click sound and comes for the food reward.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nAnd by doing so, very fast,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nwe can have like a second-line opinion\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nto see which patients are positive,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nwhich are negative.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nJust as an indication,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nwhereas a microscopist can process\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\n40 samples in a day,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\na rat can process\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nthe same amount of samples\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nin seven minutes only.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nA cage like this --\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:02.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nA cage like this -- provided that you have rats,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nand we have now currently\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\n25 tuberculosis rats --\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\na cage like this, operating throughout the day,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\ncan process 1,680 samples.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nCan you imagine the potential offspring applications --\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nenvironmental detection\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nof pollutants in soils,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\ncustoms applications,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\ndetection of illicit goods in containers and so on.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nBut let's stick first to tuberculosis.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nI just want to briefly highlight,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nthe blue rods\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nare the scores of microscopy only\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nat the five clinics in Dar es Salaam\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\non a population of 500,000 people,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nwhere 15,000 reported to get a test done.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nMicroscopy for 1,800 patients.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nAnd by just presenting the samples once more to the rats\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nand looping those results back,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nwe were able to increase case detection rates\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nby over 30 percent.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nThroughout last year,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nwe've been -- depending on which intervals you take --\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nwe've been consistently\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nincreasing case detection rates\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nin five hospitals in Dar es Salaam\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nbetween 30 and 40 percent.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nSo this is really considerable.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nKnowing that a missed patient by microscopy\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\ninfects up to 15 people,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nhealthy people, per year,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nyou can be sure\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nthat we have saved lots of lives.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nAt least our hero rats have saved lots of lives.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nThe way forward for us\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nis now to standardize this technology.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nAnd there are simple things\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nlike, for instance, we have a small laser in the sniffer hole\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nwhere the animal has to stick for five seconds.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nSo, to standardize this.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAlso, to standardize the pellets,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nthe food rewards,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nand to semi-automate this\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nin order to replicate this on a much larger scale\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nand affect the lives of many more people.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nTo conclude, there are also other applications at the horizon.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nHere is a first prototype\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nof our camera rat,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nwhich is a rat with a rat backpack\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nwith a camera that can go under rubble\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nto detect for victims\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nafter earthquake and so on.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nThis is in a prototype stage.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nWe don't have a working system here yet.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nTo conclude, I would actually like to say,\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nyou may think this is about rats, these projects,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nbut in the end it is about people.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nIt is about empowering vulnerable communities\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nto tackle difficult, expensive\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nand dangerous humanitarian detection tasks,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nand doing that with a local resource,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nplenty available.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nSo something completely different\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nis to keep on challenging your perception\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nabout the resources surrounding you,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nwhether they are environmental,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\ntechnological, animal, or human.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nAnd to respectfully harmonize with them\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nin order to foster a sustainable world.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A vision for sustainable restaurants", "duration": "529", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/arthur_potts_dawson_a_vision_for_sustainable_restaurants", "transcript": "Restaurants and the food industry in general are pretty much the most wasteful industry in the world. For every calorie of food that we consume here in Britain today, 10 calories are taken to produce it. That's a lot. I want to take something rather humble to discuss. I found this in the farmers' market today, and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later, you're very welcome to. The humble potato \u2014 and I've spent a long time, 25 years, preparing these. And it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime. First of all, it's planted, and that takes energy. It grows and is nurtured. It's then harvested. It's then distributed, and distribution is a massive issue. It's then sold and bought, and it's then delivered to me. I basically take it, prepare it, and then people consume it \u2014 hopefully they enjoy it. The last stage is basically waste, and this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it. There are different types of waste. There's a waste of time; there's a waste of space; there's a waste of energy; and there's a waste of waste. And every business I've been working on over the past five years, I'm trying to lower each one of these elements.Okay, so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like. Basically a restaurant just like any other. This is the restaurant, Acorn House. Front and back. So let me run you through a few ideas. Floor: sustainable, recyclable. Chairs: recycled and recyclable. Tables: Forestry Commission. This is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood. This bench, although it was uncomfortable for my mom \u2014 she didn't like sitting on it, so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale \u2014 reusing, a job that was pretty good. I hate waste, especially walls. If they're not working, put a shelf on it, which I did, and that shows all the customers my products. The whole business is run on sustainable energy. This is powered by wind. All of the lights are daylight bulbs. Paint is all low-volume chemical, which is very important when you're working in the room all the time. I was experimenting with these \u2014 I don't know if you can see it \u2014 but there's a work surface there. And that's a plastic polymer. And I was thinking, well I'm trying to think nature, nature, nature. But I thought, no, no, experiment with resins, experiment with polymers. Will they outlive me? They probably might. Right, here's a reconditioned coffee machine. It actually looks better than a brand new one \u2014 so looking good there. Now reusing is vital. And we filter our own water. We put them in bottles, refrigerate them, and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again. Here's a great little example. If you can see this orange tree, it's actually growing in a car tire, which has been turned inside out and sewn up. It's got my compost in it, which is growing an orange tree, which is great.This is the kitchen, which is in the same room. I basically created a menu that allowed people to choose the amount and volume of food that they wanted to consume. Rather than me putting a dish down, they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted. Okay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters. It serves 220 people a day. We generate quite a lot of waste. This is the waste room. You can't get rid of waste. But this story's not about eliminating it, it's about minimizing it. In here, I have produce and boxes that are unavoidable. I put my food waste into this dehydrating, desiccating macerator \u2014 turns food into an inner material, which I can store and then compost later.I compost it in this garden. All of the soil you can see there is basically my food, which is generated by the restaurant, and it's growing in these tubs, which I made out of storm-felled trees and wine casks and all kinds of things. Three compost bins \u2014 go through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week \u2014 really good, makes fantastic compost. A couple of wormeries in there too. And actually one of the wormeries was a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it. And I tried taking the dried food waste, putting it to the worms, going, \"There you go, dinner.\" It was like vegetable jerky, and killed all of them. I don't know how many worms [were] in there, but I've got some heavy karma coming, I tell you. (Laughter) What you're seeing here is a water filtration system. This takes the water out of the restaurant, runs it through these stone beds \u2014 this is going to be mint in there \u2014 and I sort of water the garden with it. And I ultimately want to recycle that, put it back into the loos, maybe wash hands with it, I don't know.So, water is a very important aspect. I started meditating on that and created a restaurant called Waterhouse. If I could get Waterhouse to be a no-carbon restaurant that is consuming no gas to start with, that would be great. I managed to do it. This restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House \u2014 same chairs, same tables. They're all English and a little bit more sustainable. But this is an electrical restaurant. The whole thing is electric, the restaurant and the kitchen. And it's run on hydroelectricity, so I've gone from air to water. Now it's important to understand that this room is cooled by water, heated by water, filters its own water, and it's powered by water. It literally is Waterhouse. The air handling system inside it \u2014 I got rid of air-conditioning because I thought there was too much consumption going on there. This is basically air-handling. I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside, pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism, it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof, and that, in turn, is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant, cooling them, or heating them, as the need may be. And this is an English willow air diffuser, and that's softly moving that air current through the room. Very advanced, no air-conditioning \u2014 I love it. In the canal, which is just outside the restaurant, there is hundreds of meters of coil piping. This takes the temperature of the canal and turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange. I have no idea how it works, but I paid a lot of money for it. (Laughter) And what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant lives on this boat \u2014 it's off-grid; it generates all its own power. He's growing all his own fruit, and that's fantastic.There's no accident in names of these restaurants. Acorn House is the element of wood; Waterhouse is the element of water; and I'm thinking, well, I'm going to be making five restaurants based on the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities. I've got water and wood. I'm just about to do fire. I've got metal and earth to come. So you've got to watch your space for that. Okay. So this is my next project. Five weeks old, it's my baby, and it's hurting real bad. The People's Supermarket. So basically, the restaurants only really hit people who believed in what I was doing anyway. What I needed to do was get food out to a broader spectrum of people. So people \u2014 i.e., perhaps, more working-class \u2014 or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative. This is a social enterprise, not-for-profit cooperative supermarket. It really is about the social disconnect between food, communities in urban settings and their relationship to rural growers \u2014 connecting communities in London to rural growers. Really important. So I'm committing to potatoes; I'm committing to milk; I'm committing to leeks and broccoli \u2014 all very important stuff. I've kept the tiles; I've kept the floors; I've kept the trunking; I've got in some recycled fridges; I've got some recycled tills; I've got some recycled trolleys. I mean, the whole thing is is super-sustainable. In fact, I'm trying and I'm going to make this the most sustainable supermarket in the world. That's zero food waste. And no one's doing that just yet. In fact, Sainsbury's, if you're watching, let's have a go. Try it on. I'm going to get there before you.So nature doesn't create waste doesn't create waste as such. Everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle with waste being the end of the beginning, and that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time, and it's an important statement to understand. If we don't stand up and make a difference and think about sustainable food, think about the sustainable nature of it, then we may fail. But, I wanted to get up and show you that we can do it if we're more responsible. Environmentally conscious businesses are doable. They're here. You can see I've done three so far; I've got a few more to go. The idea is embryonic. I think it's important. I think that if we reduce, reuse, refuse and recycle \u2014 right at the end there \u2014 recycling is the last point I want to make; but it's the four R's, rather than the three R's \u2014 then I think we're going to be on our way. So these three are not perfect \u2014 they're ideas. I think that there are many problems to come, but with help, I'm sure I'm going to find solutions. And I hope you all take part.Thank you very much.

All of the lights are daylight bulbs.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nPaint is all low-volume chemical,\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nwhich is very important when you're working in the room all the time.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nI was experimenting with these -- I don't know if you can see it --\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nbut there's a work surface there.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nAnd that's a plastic polymer.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nAnd I was thinking, well I'm trying to think nature, nature, nature.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nBut I thought, no, no, experiment with resins,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nexperiment with polymers.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nWill they outlive me? They probably might.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nRight, here's a reconditioned coffee machine.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nIt actually looks better than a brand new one -- so looking good there.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nNow reusing is vital.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nAnd we filter our own water.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nWe put them in bottles, refrigerate them,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nand then we reuse that bottle again and again and again.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nHere's a great little example.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nIf you can see this orange tree, it's actually growing in a car tire,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nwhich has been turned inside out and sewn up.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nIt's got my compost in it, which is growing an orange tree, which is great.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThis is the kitchen, which is in the same room.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nI basically created a menu that allowed people\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nto choose the amount and volume of food\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nthat they wanted to consume.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nRather than me putting a dish down,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nthey were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nOkay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nIt serves 220 people a day.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nWe generate quite a lot of waste.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nThis is the waste room.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nYou can't get rid of waste.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nBut this story's not about eliminating it, it's about minimizing it.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nIn here, I have produce and boxes\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nthat are unavoidable.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nI put my food waste into this dehydrating, desiccating macerator --\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nturns food into an inner material,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nwhich I can store and then compost later.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nI compost it in this garden.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nAll of the soil you can see there is basically my food,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nwhich is generated by the restaurant,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nand it's growing in these tubs, which I made out of storm-felled trees\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nand wine casks and all kinds of things.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nThree compost bins --\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\ngo through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week --\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nreally good, makes fantastic compost.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nA couple of wormeries in there too.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nAnd actually one of the wormeries\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nwas a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nAnd I tried taking the dried food waste,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nputting it to the worms, going, \"There you go, dinner.\"\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nIt was like vegetable jerky,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nand killed all of them.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nI don't know how many worms [were] in there,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nbut I've got some heavy karma coming, I tell you.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nWhat you're seeing here is a water filtration system.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nThis takes the water out of the restaurant,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nruns it through these stone beds -- this is going to be mint in there --\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nand I sort of water the garden with it.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nAnd I ultimately want to recycle that, put it back into the loos,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nmaybe wash hands with it, I don't know.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nSo, water is a very important aspect.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nI started meditating on that\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nand created a restaurant called Waterhouse.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nIf I could get Waterhouse to be a no-carbon restaurant\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nthat is consuming no gas to start with, that would be great.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nI managed to do it.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nThis restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House --\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nsame chairs, same tables.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nThey're all English and a little bit more sustainable.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nBut this is an electrical restaurant.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nThe whole thing is electric, the restaurant and the kitchen.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nAnd it's run on hydroelectricity,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nso I've gone from air to water.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nNow it's important to understand\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nthat this room\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nis cooled by water, heated by water,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nfilters its own water,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nand it's powered by water.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nIt literally is Waterhouse.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nThe air handling system inside it --\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nI got rid of air-conditioning\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nbecause I thought there was too much consumption going on there.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nThis is basically air-handling.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nI'm taking the temperature of the canal outside,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\npumping it through the heat exchange mechanism,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nit's turning through these amazing sails on the roof,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nand that, in turn, is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\ncooling them, or heating them, as the need may be.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nAnd this is an English willow air diffuser,\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nand that's softly moving\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nthat air current through the room.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nVery advanced, no air-conditioning -- I love it.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nIn the canal, which is just outside the restaurant,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nthere is hundreds of meters of coil piping.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nThis takes the temperature of the canal\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nand turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nI have no idea how it works, but I paid a lot of money for it.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nAnd what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nlives on this boat -- it's off-grid; it generates all its own power.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nHe's growing all his own fruit, and that's fantastic.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nThere's no accident in names of these restaurants.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nAcorn House is the element of wood; Waterhouse is the element of water;\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nand I'm thinking, well, I'm going to be making\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nfive restaurants based\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:11.958\non the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nI've got water and wood. I'm just about to do fire.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nI've got metal and earth to come.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nSo you've got to watch your space for that.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nOkay. So this is my next project.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nFive weeks old,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nit's my baby, and it's hurting real bad.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nThe People's Supermarket.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nSo basically, the restaurants only really hit\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\npeople who believed in what I was doing anyway.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nWhat I needed to do was get food out\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nto a broader spectrum of people.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nSo people -- i.e., perhaps, more working-class --\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nor perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nThis is a social enterprise,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nnot-for-profit cooperative supermarket.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nIt really is about the social disconnect\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nbetween food, communities\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nin urban settings\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nand their relationship to rural growers --\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nconnecting communities in London to rural growers.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nReally important.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nSo I'm committing to potatoes; I'm committing to milk;\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nI'm committing to leeks and broccoli -- all very important stuff.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nI've kept the tiles; I've kept the floors;\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nI've kept the trunking; I've got in some recycled fridges;\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nI've got some recycled tills; I've got some recycled trolleys.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nI mean, the whole thing is is super-sustainable.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nIn fact, I'm trying and I'm going to make this\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nthe most sustainable supermarket in the world.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nThat's zero food waste.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nAnd no one's doing that just yet.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nIn fact, Sainsbury's, if you're watching,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nlet's have a go. Try it on.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nI'm going to get there before you.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nSo nature doesn't create waste\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\ndoesn't create waste as such.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nEverything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nwith waste being the end of the beginning,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nand that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nand it's an important statement to understand.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nIf we don't stand up\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nand make a difference\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nand think about sustainable food,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nthink about the sustainable nature of it,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nthen we may fail.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nBut, I wanted to get up and show you\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nthat we can do it if we're more responsible.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nEnvironmentally conscious businesses are doable.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nThey're here. You can see I've done three so far;\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nI've got a few more to go.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nThe idea is embryonic.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nI think it's important.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nI think that if we reduce, reuse, refuse\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nand recycle -- right at the end there --\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nrecycling is the last point I want to make;\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nbut it's the four R's, rather than the three R's --\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nthen I think we're going to be on our way.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nSo these three are not perfect -- they're ideas.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nI think that there are many problems to come,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nbut with help, I'm sure I'm going to find solutions.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nAnd I hope you all take part.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nThank you very much.

But in the last couple of years we've become infamous for a couple of things. First, of course, the economic meltdown. It actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale on eBay. (Laughter) Ninety-nine pence was the starting price and no reserve. Then there was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends, including President Obama. By the way, the pronunciation is \"Eyjafjallajokull.\" None of your media got it right.(Laughter)But I'm not here to share these stories about these two things exactly. I'm here to tell you the story of Audur Capital, which is a financial firm founded by me and Kristin \u2014 who you see in the picture \u2014 in the spring of 2007, just over a year before the economic collapse hit. Why would two women who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking in the corporate sector leave to found a financial services firm? Well let it suffice to say that we felt a bit overwhelmed with testosterone. And I'm not here to say that men are to blame for the crisis and what happened in my country. But I can surely tell you that in my country, much like on Wall Street and the city of London and elsewhere, men were at the helm of the game of the financial sector, and that kind of lack of diversity and sameness leads to disastrous problems.(Applause)So we decided, a bit fed-up with this world and also with the strong feeling in our stomach that this wasn't sustainable, to found a financial services firm based on our values, and we decided to incorporate feminine values into the world of finance. Raised quite a few eyebrows in Iceland. We weren't known as the typical \"women\" women in Iceland up until then. So it was almost like coming out of the closet to actually talk about the fact that we were women and that we believed that we had a set of values and a way of doing business that would be more sustainable than what we had experienced until then. And we got a great group of people to join us \u2014 principled people with great skills, and investors with a vision and values to match ours. And together we got through the eye of the financial storm in Iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients. And although I want to thank the talented people of our company foremost for that \u2014 and also there's a factor of luck and timing \u2014 we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values.So let me share with you our values. We believe in risk awareness. What does that mean? We believe that you should always understand the risks that you're taking, and we will not invest in things we don't understand. Not a complicated thing. But in 2007, at the height of the sub-prime and all the complicated financial structures, it was quite opposite to the reckless risk-taking behaviors that we saw on the market. We also believe in straight-talking, telling it as it is, using simple language that people understand, telling people about the downsides as well as the potential upsides, and even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter, like our lack of belief in the sustainability of the Icelandic financial sector that already we had months before the collapse hit us. And, although we do work in the financial sector, where Excel is king, we believe in emotional capital. And we believe that doing emotional due diligence is just as important as doing financial due diligence. It is actually people that make money and lose money, not Excel spreadsheets.(Applause)Last, but not least, we believe in profit with principles. We care how we make our profit. So while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers, we are willing to do it with a long-term view, and we like to have a wider definition of profits than just the economic profit in the next quarter. So we like to see profits, plus positive social and environmental benefits, when we invest.But it wasn't just about the values, although we are convinced that they matter. It was also about a business opportunity. It's the female trend, and it's the sustainability trend, that are going to create some of the most interesting investment opportunities in the years to come. The whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men; it is actually about women being different from men, bringing different values and different ways to the table. So what do you get? You get better decision-making, and you get less herd behavior, and both of those things hit your bottom line with very positive results.But one has to wonder, now that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland \u2014 and by the way, Europe looks pretty bad right now, and many would say that you in America are heading for some more trouble as well. Now that we've had all that happen, and we have all this data out there telling us that it's much better to have diversity around the decision-making tables, will we see business and finance change? Will government change?Well I'll give you my straight talk about this. I have days that I believe, but I have days that I'm full of doubt. Have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us? (Applause) Einstein said that this was the definition of insanity \u2014 to do the same things over and over again, hoping for a different outcome. So I guess the world is insane, because I see entirely too much of doing the same things over and over again, hoping that this time it's not going to collapse upon us. I want to see more revolutionary thinking, and I remain hopeful. Like TED, I believe in people. And I know that consumers are becoming more conscious, and they are going to start voting with their wallets, and they are going to change the face of business and finance from the outside, if they don't do it from the inside.But I'm more of the revolutionary, and I should be; I'm from Iceland. We have a long history of strong, courageous, independent women, ever since the Viking age. And I want to tell you when I first realized that women matter to the economy and to the society, I was seven \u2014 it happened to be my mother's birthday \u2014 October 24, 1975. Women in Iceland took the day off. From work or from home, they took the day off, and nothing worked in Iceland. (Laughter) They marched into the center of Reykjavik, and they put women's issues onto the agenda. And some say this was the start of a global movement. For me it was the start of a long journey, but I decided that day to matter. Five years later, Iceland elected Vigdis Finnbogadottir as their president \u2014 first female to become head of state, single mom, a breast cancer survivor who had had one of her breasts removed. And at one of the campaign sessions, she had one of her male contenders allude to the fact that she couldn't become president \u2014 she was a woman, and even half a woman. That night she won the election, because she came back \u2014 not just because of his crappy behavior \u2014 but she came back and said, \"Well, I'm actually not going to breastfeed the Icelandic nation; I'm going to lead it.\"(Applause)So I've had incredibly many women role models that have influenced who I am and where I am today. But in spite of that, I went through the first 10 or 15 years of my career mostly in denial of being a woman. Started in corporate America, and I was absolutely convinced that it was just about the individual, that women and men would have just the same opportunities. But I've come to conclude lately that it isn't like that. We are not the same, and it's great. Because of our differences, we create and sustain life. So we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge.The final thought I want to leave with you is that I'm fed up with this tyranny of either/or choices in life \u2014 either it's men or it's women. We need to start embracing the beauty of balance. So let's move away from thinking about business here and philanthropy there, and let's start thinking about doing good business. That's how we change the world. That's the only sustainable future.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1030, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nIt sure used to be a lot

market.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nWe also believe in straight-talking,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\ntelling it as it is,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nusing simple language that people understand,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\ntelling people about the downsides\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nas well as the potential upsides,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nand even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nlike our lack of belief in the sustainability\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nof the Icelandic financial sector\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nthat already we had\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nmonths before the collapse hit us.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nAnd, although we do work in the financial sector,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nwhere Excel is king,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nwe believe in emotional capital.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nAnd we believe\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nthat doing emotional due diligence\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nis just as important\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nas doing financial due diligence.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nIt is actually people\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nthat make money and lose money,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nnot Excel

principles.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nWe care how we make our profit.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nSo while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nwe are willing to do it with a long-term view,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nand we like to have a wider definition of profits\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nthan just the economic profit in the next quarter.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nSo we like to see profits,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nplus positive social\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nand environmental benefits, when we invest.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nBut it wasn't just about the values,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nalthough we are convinced that they matter.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nIt was also about a business opportunity.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nIt's the female trend, and it's the sustainability trend,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nthat are going to create\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nsome of the most interesting investment opportunities\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nin the years to come.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nThe whole thing about the female trend\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nis not about women being better than men;\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nit is actually about\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nwomen being different from men,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nbringing different values and different ways to the table.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nSo what do you get? You get better decision-making,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nand you get less herd behavior,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nand both of those things hit your bottom line\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nwith very positive results.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nBut one has to wonder,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nnow that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland --\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nand by the way, Europe looks pretty bad right now,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nand many would say that you in America\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nare heading for some more trouble as well.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nNow that we've had all that happen,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nand we have all this data out there\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\ntelling us that it's much better to have diversity\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\naround the decision-making tables,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nwill we see business and finance change?\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nWill government change?\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nWell I'll give you my straight talk about this.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nI have days that I believe,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nbut I have days that I'm full of doubt.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nHave you seen the incredible urge out there\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nto rebuild the very things that failed us?\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nEinstein said\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nthat this was the definition of insanity --\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nto do the same things\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nover and over again,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nhoping for a different outcome.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nSo I guess the world is insane,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nbecause I see entirely too much\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nof doing the same things over and over again,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nhoping that this time it's not going to collapse upon us.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nI want to see more revolutionary thinking,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nand I remain hopeful.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nLike TED, I believe in people.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nAnd I know that consumers\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nare becoming more conscious,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nand they are going to start voting with their wallets,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nand they are going to change the face\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nof business and finance from the outside,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nif they don't do it from the inside.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nBut I'm more of the revolutionary,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nand I should be;

Growing up as a boy, we were taught that men had to be tough, had to be strong, had to be courageous, dominating \u2014 no pain, no emotions, with the exception of anger \u2014 and definitely no fear; that men are in charge, which means women are not; that men lead, and you should just follow and do what we say; that men are superior; women are inferior; that men are strong; women are weak; that women are of less value, property of men, and objects, particularly sexual objects. I've later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men, better known as the \"man box.\" See this man box has in it all the ingredients of how we define what it means to be a man. Now I also want to say, without a doubt, there are some wonderful, wonderful, absolutely wonderful things about being a man. But at the same time, there's some stuff that's just straight up twisted, and we really need to begin to challenge, look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing, redefining, what we come to know as manhood.This is my two at home, Kendall and Jay. They're 11 and 12. Kendall's 15 months older than Jay. There was a period of time when my wife \u2014 her name is Tammie \u2014 and I, we just got real busy and whip, bam, boom: Kendall and Jay. (Laughter) And when they were about five and six, four and five, Jay could come to me, come to me crying. It didn't matter what she was crying about, she could get on my knee, she could snot my sleeve up, just cry, cry it out. Daddy's got you. That's all that's important.Now Kendall on the other hand \u2014 and like I said, he's only 15 months older than her \u2014 he'd come to me crying, it's like as soon as I would hear him cry, a clock would go off. I would give the boy probably about 30 seconds, which means, by the time he got to me, I was already saying things like, \"Why are you crying? Hold your head up. Look at me. Explain to me what's wrong. Tell me what's wrong. I can't understand you. Why are you crying?\" And out of my own frustration of my role and responsibility of building him up as a man to fit into these guidelines and these structures that are defining this man box, I would find myself saying things like, \"Just go in your room. Just go on, go on in your room. Sit down, get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a \u2014\" what? (Audience: Man.) Like a man. And he's five years old. And as I grow in life, I would say to myself, \"My God, what's wrong with me? What am I doing? Why would I do this?\" And I think back. I think back to my father.There was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family. My brother, Henry, he died tragically when we were teenagers. We lived in New York City, as I said. We lived in the Bronx at the time, and the burial was in a place called Long Island, it was about two hours outside of the city. And as we were preparing to come back from the burial, the cars stopped at the bathroom to let folks take care of themselves before the long ride back to the city. And the limousine empties out. My mother, my sister, my auntie, they all get out, but my father and I stayed in the limousine, and no sooner than the women got out, he burst out crying. He didn't want cry in front of me, but he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city, and it was better me than to allow himself to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women. And this is a man who, 10 minutes ago, had just put his teenage son in the ground \u2014 something I just can't even imagine. The thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me for crying in front of me, and at the same time, he was also giving me props, lifting me up, for not crying.I come to also look at this as this fear that we have as men, this fear that just has us paralyzed, holding us hostage to this man box. I can remember speaking to a 12-year-old boy, a football player, and I asked him, I said, \"How would you feel if, in front of all the players, your coach told you you were playing like a girl?\" Now I expected him to say something like, I'd be sad; I'd be mad; I'd be angry, or something like that. No, the boy said to me \u2014 the boy said to me, \"It would destroy me.\" And I said to myself, \"God, if it would destroy him to be called a girl, what are we then teaching him about girls?\"(Applause)It took me back to a time when I was about 12 years old. I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city. At this time we're living in the Bronx, and in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny. He was about 16 years old, and we were all about 12 years old \u2014 younger guys. And he was hanging out with all us younger guys. And this guy, he was up to a lot of no good. He was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder, \"What is this 16-year-old boy doing with these 12-year-old boys?\" And he did spend a lot of time up to no good. He was a troubled kid. His mother had died from a heroin overdose. He was being raised by his grandmother. His father wasn't on the set. His grandmother had two jobs. He was home alone a lot. But I've got to tell you, we young guys, we looked up to this dude, man. He was cool. He was fine. That's what the sisters said, \"He was fine.\" He was having sex. We all looked up to him.So one day, I'm out in front of the house doing something \u2014 just playing around, doing something \u2014 I don't know what. He looks out his window; he calls me upstairs; he said, \"Hey Anthony.\" They called me Anthony growing up as a kid. \"Hey Anthony, come on upstairs.\" Johnny call, you go. So I run right upstairs. As he opens the door, he says to me, \"Do you want some?\" Now I immediately knew what he meant. Because for me growing up at that time, and our relationship with this man box, \"Do you want some?\" meant one of two things: sex or drugs \u2014 and we weren't doing drugs. Now my box, my card, my man box card, was immediately in jeopardy. Two things: One, I never had sex. We don't talk about that as men. You only tell your dearest, closest friend, sworn to secrecy for life, the first time you had sex. For everybody else, we go around like we've been having sex since we were two. There ain't no first time. (Laughter) The other thing I couldn't tell him is that I didn't want any. That's even worse. We're supposed to always be on the prowl. Women are objects, especially sexual objects.Anyway, so I couldn't tell him any of that. So, like my mother would say, make a long story short, I just simply said to Johnny, \"Yes.\" He told me to go in his room. I go in his room. On his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named Sheila. She's 16 years old. She's nude. She's what I know today to be mentally ill, higher-functioning at times than others. We had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her. Anyway, Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her. Well actually, he raped her, but he would say he had sex with her. Because, while Sheila never said no, she also never said yes.So he was offering me the opportunity to do the same. So when I go in the room, I close the door. Folks, I'm petrified. I stand with my back to the door so Johnny can't bust in the room and see that I'm not doing anything, and I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something. So now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do; I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room. So in my 12 years of wisdom, I zip my pants down, I walk out into the room, and lo and behold to me, while I was in the room with Sheila, Johnny was back at the window calling guys up. So now there's a living room full of guys. It was like the waiting room in the doctor's office. And they asked me how was it, and I say to them, \"It was good,\" and I zip my pants up in front of them, and I head for the door.Now I say this all with remorse, and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time, but I was conflicted, because, while I was feeling remorse, I was excited, because I didn't get caught. But I knew I felt bad about what was happening. This fear, getting outside the man box, totally enveloped me. It was way more important to me, about me and my man box card than about Sheila and what was happening to her.See collectively, we as men are taught to have less value in women, to view them as property and the objects of men. We see that as an equation that equals violence against women. We as men, good men, the large majority of men, we operate on the foundation of this whole collective socialization. We kind of see ourselves separate, but we're very much a part of it. You see, we have to come to understand that less value, property and objectification is the foundation and the violence can't happen without it. So we're very much a part of the solution as well as the problem. The center for disease control says that men's violence against women is at epidemic proportions, is the number one health concern for women in this country and abroad.So quickly, I'd like to just say, this is the love of my life, my daughter Jay. The world I envision for her \u2014 how do I want men to be acting and behaving? I need you on board. I need you with me. I need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men \u2014 that it's okay to not be dominating, that it's okay to have feelings and emotions, that it's okay to promote equality, that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it, that it's okay to be whole, that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman.

It's an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey. Let me begin with my parents. I'm a product of this visionary mother and father. Many years ago, when I was born in the '50s \u2014 '50s and '60s didn't belong to girls in India. They belonged to boys. They belonged to boys who would join business and inherit business from parents, and girls would be dolled up to get married. My family, in my city, and almost in the country, was unique. We were four of us, not one, and fortunately no boys. We were four girls and no boys. And my parents were part of a landed property family. My father defied his own grandfather, almost to the point of disinheritance, because he decided to educate all four of us. He sent us to one of the best schools in the city and gave us the best education. As I've said, when we're born, we don't choose our parents, and when we go to school, we don't choose our school. Children don't choose a school. They just get the school which parents choose for them. So this is the foundation time which I got. I grew up like this, and so did my other three sisters. And my father used to say at that time, \"I'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world.\" I don't know if he really meant [that], but it happened. I'm the only one who's left in India. One is a British, another is an American and the third is a Canadian. So we are four of us in four corners of the world.And since I said they're my role models, I followed two things which my father and mother gave me. One, they said, \"Life is on an incline. You either go up, or you come down.\" And the second thing, which has stayed with me, which became my philosophy of life, which made all the difference, is: 100 things happen in your life, good or bad. Out of 100, 90 are your creation. They're good. They're your creation. Enjoy it. If they're bad, they're your creation. Learn from it. Ten are nature-sent over which you can't do a thing. It's like a death of a relative, or a cyclone, or a hurricane, or an earthquake. You can't do a thing about it. You've got to just respond to the situation. But that response comes out of those 90 points. Since I'm a product of this philosophy, of 90/10, and secondly, \"life on an incline,\" that's the way I grew up to be valuing what I got. I'm a product of opportunities, rare opportunities in the '50s and the '60s, which girls didn't get, and I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me was something unique. Because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up to get married with a lot of dowry, and here I was with a tennis racket and going to school and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities. I thought I must tell you this. Why I said this, is the background.This is what comes next. I joined the Indian Police Service as a tough woman, a woman with indefatigable stamina, because I used to run for my tennis titles, etc. But I joined the Indian Police Service, and then it was a new pattern of policing. For me the policing stood for power to correct, power to prevent and power to detect. This is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India \u2014 the power to prevent. Because normally it was always said, power to detect, and that's it, or power to punish. But I decided no, it's a power to prevent, because that's what I learned when I was growing up. How do I prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10? So this was how it came into my service, and it was different from the men. I didn't want to make it different from the men, but it was different, because this was the way I was different. And I redefined policing concepts in India. I'm going to take you on two journeys, my policing journey and my prison journey. What you see, if you see the title called \"PM's car held.\" This was the first time a prime minister of India was given a parking ticket. (Laughter) That's the first time in India, and I can tell you, that's the last time you're hearing about it. It'll never happen again in India, because now it was once and forever. And the rule was, because I was sensitive, I was compassionate, I was very sensitive to injustice, and I was very pro-justice. That's the reason, as a woman, I joined the Indian Police Service. I had other options, but I didn't choose them.So I'm going to move on. This is about tough policing, equal policing. Now I was known as \"here's a woman that's not going to listen.\" So I was sent to all indiscriminate postings, postings which others would say no. I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer. Normally police officers don't want to do prison. They sent me to prison to lock me up, thinking, \"Now there will be no cars and no VIPs to be given tickets to. Let's lock her up.\" Here I got a prison assignment. This was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals. Obviously, it was. But 10,000 men, of which only 400 were women \u2014 10,000 \u2014 9,000 plus about 600 were men. Terrorists, rapists, burglars, gangsters \u2014 some of them I'd sent to jail as a police officer outside. And then how did I deal with them? The first day when I went in, I didn't know how to look at them. And I said, \"Do you pray?\" When I looked at the group, I said, \"Do you pray?\" They saw me as a young, short woman wearing a pathan suit. I said, \"Do you pray?\" And they didn't say anything. I said, \"Do you pray? Do you want to pray?\" They said, \"Yes.\" I said, \"All right, let's pray.\" I prayed for them, and things started to change. This is a visual of education inside the prison.Friends, this has never happened, where everybody in the prison studies. I started this with community support. Government had no budget. It was one of the finest, largest volunteerism in any prison in the world. This was initiated in Delhi prison. You see one sample of a prisoner teaching a class. These are hundreds of classes. Nine to eleven, every prisoner went into the education program \u2014 the same den in which they thought they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten. We converted this into an ashram \u2014 from a prison to an ashram through education. I think that's the bigger change. It was the beginning of a change. Teachers were prisoners. Teachers were volunteers. Books came from donated schoolbooks. Stationery was donated. Everything was donated, because there was no budget of education for the prison. Now if I'd not done that, it would have been a hellhole.That's the second landmark. I want to show you some moments of history in my journey, which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world. One, the numbers you'll never get to see. Secondly, this concept. This was a meditation program inside the prison of over 1,000 prisoners. One thousand prisoners who sat in meditation. This was one of the most courageous steps I took as a prison governor. And this is what transformed. You want to know more about this, go and see this film, \"Doing Time, Doing Vipassana.\" You will hear about it, and you will love it. And write to me on KiranBedi.com, and I'll respond to you. Let me show you the next slide. I took the same concept of mindfulness, because, why did I bring meditation into the Indian prison? Because crime is a product of a distorted mind. It was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control. Not by preaching, not by telling, not by reading, but by addressing your mind. I took the same thing to the police, because police, equally, were prisoners of their minds, and they felt as if it was \"we\" and \"they,\" and that the people don't cooperate. This worked.This is a feedback box called a petition box. This is a concept which I introduced to listen to complaints, listen to grievances. This was a magic box. This was a sensitive box. This is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison. If you see somebody in the blue \u2014 yeah, this guy \u2014 he was a prisoner, and he was a teacher. And you see, everybody's busy. There was no time to waste.Let me wrap it up. I'm currently into movements, movements of education of the under-served children, which is thousands \u2014 India is all about thousands. Secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in India. That's a big way we, as a small group of activists, have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of India. Friends, you will hear a lot about it. That's the movement at the moment I'm driving, and that's the movement and ambition of my life.Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you very much.

In my mother's day, she didn't go to college. Not a lot of women did. And now, for every two men who get a college degree, three women will do the same. Women, for the first time this year, became the majority of the American workforce. And they're starting to dominate lots of professions \u2014 doctors, lawyers, bankers, accountants. Over 50 percent of managers are women these days, and in the 15 professions projected to grow the most in the next decade, all but two of them are dominated by women. So the global economy is becoming a place where women are more successful than men, believe it or not, and these economic changes are starting to rapidly affect our culture \u2014 what our romantic comedies look like, what our marriages look like, what our dating lives look like, and our new set of superheroes.For a long time, this is the image of American manhood that dominated \u2014 tough, rugged, in control of his own environment. A few years ago, the Marlboro Man was retired and replaced by this much less impressive specimen, who is a parody of American manhood, and that's what we have in our commercials today. The phrase \"first-born son\" is so deeply ingrained in our consciousness that this statistic alone shocked me. In American fertility clinics, 75 percent of couples are requesting girls and not boys. And in places where you wouldn't think, such as South Korea, India and China, the very strict patriarchal societies are starting to break down a little, and families are no longer strongly preferring first-born sons.If you think about this, if you just open your eyes to this possibility and start to connect the dots, you can see the evidence everywhere. You can see it in college graduation patterns, in job projections, in our marriage statistics, you can see it in the Icelandic elections, which you'll hear about later, and you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference, that something amazing and unprecedented is happening with women. Certainly this is not the first time that we've had great progress with women. The '20s and the '60s also come to mind. But the difference is that, back then, it was driven by a very passionate feminist movement that was trying to project its own desires, whereas this time, it's not about passion, and it's not about any kind of movement. This is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in. The 200,000-year period in which men have been top dog is truly coming to an end, believe it or not, and that's why I talk about the \"end of men.\"Now all you men out there, this is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes, because the point is that this is happening to all of us. I myself have a husband and a father and two sons whom I dearly love. And this is why I like to talk about this, because if we don't acknowledge it, then the transition will be pretty painful. But if we do take account of it, then I think it will go much more smoothly. I first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago. I was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else, and I started to notice a distinct pattern \u2014 that the recession was affecting men much more deeply than it was affecting women. And I remembered back to about 10 years ago when I read a book by Susan Faludi called \"Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man,\" in which she described how hard the recession had hit men, and I started to think about whether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession. And I realized that two things were different this time around. The first was that these were no longer just temporary hits that the recession was giving men \u2014 that this was reflecting a deeper underlying shift in our global economy. And second, that the story was no longer just about the crisis of men, but it was also about what was happening to women.And now look at this second set of slides. These are headlines about what's been going on with women in the next few years. These are things we never could have imagined a few years ago. Women, a majority of the workplace. And labor statistics: women take up most managerial jobs. This second set of headlines \u2014 you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift. And look at that last headline \u2014 young women earning more than young men. That particular headline comes to me from a market research firm. They were basically asked by one of their clients who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future. And they expected that it would be young families, or young men, just like it had always been. But in fact, they found something very surprising. It was young, single women who were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood. And so they decided, because they were intrigued by this finding, to do a nationwide survey. So they spread out all the census data, and what they found, the guy described to me as a shocker, which is that in 1,997 out of 2,000 communities, women, young women, were making more money than young men. So here you have a generation of young women who grow up thinking of themselves as being more powerful earners than the young men around them.Now, I've just laid out the picture for you, but I still haven't explained to you why this is happening. And in a moment, I'm going to show you a graph, and what you'll see on this graph \u2014 it begins in 1973, just before women start flooding the workforce, and it brings us up to our current day. And basically what you'll see is what economists talk about as the polarization of the economy. Now what does that mean? It means that the economy is dividing into high-skill, high-wage jobs and low-skill, low-wage jobs \u2014 and that the middle, the middle-skill jobs, and the middle-earning jobs, are starting to drop out of the economy. This has been going on for 40 years now. But this process is affecting men very differently than it's affecting women. You'll see the women in red, and you'll see the men in blue. You'll watch them both drop out of the middle class, but see what happens to women and see what happens to men. There we go. So watch that. You see them both drop out of the middle class. Watch what happens to the women. Watch what happens to the men. The men sort of stagnate there, while the women zoom up in those high-skill jobs. So what's that about? It looks like women got some power boost on a video game, or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills that lets them shoot up high. But of course, it's not about that.What it's about is that the economy has changed a lot. We used to have a manufacturing economy, which was about building goods and products, and now we have a service economy and an information and creative economy. Those two economies require very different skills, and as it happens, women have been much better at acquiring the new set of skills than men have been. It used to be that you were a guy who went to high school who didn't have a college degree, but you had a specific set of skills, and with the help of a union, you could make yourself a pretty good middle-class life. But that really isn't true anymore. This new economy is pretty indifferent to size and strength, which is what's helped men along all these years. What the economy requires now is a whole different set of skills. You basically need intelligence, you need an ability to sit still and focus, to communicate openly, to be able to listen to people and to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be, and those are things that women do extremely well, as we're seeing.If you look at management theory these days, it used to be that our ideal leader sounded something like General Patton, right? You would be issuing orders from above. You would be very hierarchical. You would tell everyone below you what to do. But that's not what an ideal leader is like now. If you read management books now, a leader is somebody who can foster creativity, who can get his \u2014 get the employees \u2014 see, I still say \"his\" \u2014 who can get the employees to talk to each other, who can basically build teams and get them to be creative. And those are all things that women do very well.And then on top of that, that's created a kind of cascading effect. Women enter the workplace at the top, and then at the working class, all the new jobs that are created are the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home. So that's childcare, elder care and food preparation. So those are all the jobs that are growing, and those are jobs that women tend to do. Now one day it might be that mothers will hire an out-of-work, middle-aged, former steelworker guy to watch their children at home, and that would be good for the men, but that hasn't quite happened yet.To see what's going to happen, you can't just look at the workforce that is now, you have to look at our future workforce. And here the story is fairly simple. Women are getting college degrees at a faster rate than men. Why? This is a real mystery. People have asked men, why don't they just go back to college, to community college, say, and retool themselves, learn a new set of skills? Well it turns out that they're just very uncomfortable doing that. They're used to thinking of themselves as providers, and they can't seem to build the social networks that allow them to get through college. So for some reason men just don't end up going back to college. And what's even more disturbing is what's happening with younger boys. There's been about a decade of research about what people are calling the \"boy crisis.\" Now the boy crisis is this idea that very young boys, for whatever reason, are doing worse in school than very young girls, and people have theories about that. Is it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum, and little girls are better at that than little boys? Or that we require kids to sit still too much, and so boys initially feel like failures? And some people say it's because, in 9th grade, boys start dropping out of school. Because I'm writing a book about all this, I'm still looking into it, so I don't have the answer. But in the mean time, I'm going to call on the worldwide education expert, who's my 10-year-old daughter, Noa, to talk to you about why the boys in her class do worse.(Video) Noa: The girls are obviously smarter. I mean they have much larger vocabulary. They learn much faster. They are more controlled. On the board today for losing recess tomorrow, only boys.Hanna Rosin: And why is that?Noa: Why? They were just not listening to the class while the girls sat there very nicely.HR: So there you go. This whole thesis really came home to me when I went to visit a college in Kansas City \u2014 working-class college. Certainly, when I was in college, I had certain expectations about my life \u2014 that my husband and I would both work, and that we would equally raise the children. But these college girls had a completely different view of their future. Basically, the way they said it to me is that they would be working 18 hours a day, that their husband would maybe have a job, but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies. And this was kind of a shocker to me. And then here's my favorite quote from one of the girls: \"Men are the new ball and chain.\"(Laughter)Now you laugh, but that quote has kind of a sting to it, right? And I think the reason it has a sting is because thousands of years of history don't reverse themselves without a lot of pain, and that's why I talk about us all going through this together. The night after I talked to these college girls, I also went to a men's group in Kansas, and these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy which I spoke to you about earlier. They were men who had been contractors, or they had been building houses and they had lost their jobs after the housing boom, and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support. And the instructor was up there in the class explaining to them all the ways in which they had lost their identity in this new age. He was telling them they no longer had any moral authority, that nobody needed them for emotional support anymore, and they were not really the providers. So who were they? And this was very disheartening for them. And what he did was he wrote down on the board \"$85,000,\" and he said, \"That's her salary,\" and then he wrote down \"$12,000.\" \"That's your salary. So who's the man now?\" he asked them. \"Who's the damn man? She's the man now.\" And that really sent a shudder through the room. And that's part of the reason I like to talk about this, because I think it can be pretty painful, and we really have to work through it.And the other reason it's kind of urgent is because it's not just happening in the U.S. It's happening all over the world. In India, poor women are learning English faster than their male counterparts in order to staff the new call centers that are growing in India. In China, a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship is happening because women are starting businesses, small businesses, faster than men. And here's my favorite example, which is in South Korea. Over several decades, South Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about. They basically enshrined the second-class status of women in the civil code. And if women failed to birth male children, they were basically treated like domestic servants. And sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child so they could have a male child. But over the '70s and '80s, the South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize, and so what they did was, they started to push women into the workforce. Now they've been asking a question since 1985: \"How strongly do you prefer a first-born son?\" And now look at the chart. That's from 1985 to 2003. How much do you prefer a first-born son?So you can see that these economic changes really do have a strong effect on our culture. Now because we haven't fully processed this information, it's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways, where you can see that the stereotypes are changing. And so we have on the male side what one of my colleagues likes to call the \"omega males\" popping up, who are the males who are romantically challenged losers who can't find a job. And they come up in lots of different forms. So we have the perpetual adolescent. We have the charmless misanthrope. Then we have our Bud Light guy who's the happy couch potato. And then here's a shocker: even America's most sexiest man alive, the sexiest man alive gets romantically played these days in a movie. And then on the female side, you have the opposite, in which you have these crazy superhero women. You've got Lady Gaga. You've got our new James Bond, who's Angelina Jolie. And it's not just for the young, right? Even Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days. And so it feels like we have to move from this place where we've got these uber-exaggerated images into something that feels a little more normal.So for a long time in the economic sphere, we've lived with the term \"glass ceiling.\" Now I've never really liked this term. For one thing, it puts men and women in a really antagonistic relationship with one another, because the men are these devious tricksters up there who've put up this glass ceiling. And we're always below the glass ceiling, the women. And we have a lot of skill and experience, but it's a trick, so how are you supposed to prepare to get through that glass ceiling? And also, \"shattering the glass ceiling\" is a terrible phrase. What crazy person would pop their head through a glass ceiling?So the image that I like to think of, instead of glass ceiling, is the high bridge. It's definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge, but it's also pretty exhilarating, because it's beautiful up there, and you're looking out on a beautiful view. And the great thing is there's no trick like with the glass ceiling. There's no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the cables. There's no hole in the middle that you're going to fall through. And the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you. You can bring your husband along. You can bring your friends, or your colleagues, or your babysitter to walk along with you. And husbands can drag their wives across, if their wives don't feel ready. But the point about the high bridge is that you have to have the confidence to know that you deserve to be on that bridge, that you have all the skills and experience you need in order to walk across the high bridge, but you just have to make the decision to take the first step and do it.Thanks very much.(Applause)", "id": 1033, "subtitle":

--\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\ndoctors, lawyers,\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nbankers, accountants.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nOver 50 percent of managers are women these days,\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nand in the 15 professions\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nprojected to grow the most in the next decade,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nall but two of them are dominated by women.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nSo the global economy is becoming a place\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nwhere women are more successful than men,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nbelieve it or not,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nand these economic changes\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nare starting to rapidly affect our culture --\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nwhat our romantic comedies look like,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nwhat our marriages look like,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nwhat our dating lives look like,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nand our new set of superheroes.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nFor a long time, this is the image of American manhood that dominated --\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\ntough, rugged,\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nin control of his own environment.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nA few years ago, the Marlboro Man was retired\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nand replaced by this\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nmuch less impressive specimen,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nwho is a parody of American manhood,\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nand that's what we have in our commercials today.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nThe phrase \"first-born son\"\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nis so deeply ingrained in our consciousness\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nthat this statistic alone shocked me.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nIn American fertility clinics,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\n75 percent of couples\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nare requesting girls and not boys.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nAnd in places where you wouldn't think,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nsuch as South Korea, India and China,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nthe very strict patriarchal societies\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nare starting to break down a little,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nand families are no longer\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nstrongly preferring first-born sons.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nIf you think about this, if you just open your eyes to this possibility\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nand start to connect the dots,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nyou can see the evidence everywhere.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nYou can see it in college graduation patterns,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nin job projections,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nin our marriage statistics,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nyou can see it in the Icelandic elections, which you'll hear about later,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nand you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nthat something amazing and unprecedented\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nis happening with women.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nCertainly this is not the first time that we've had great progress with women.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nThe '20s and the '60s also come to mind.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nBut the difference is that, back then,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nit was driven by a very passionate feminist movement\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nthat was trying to project its own desires,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nwhereas this time, it's not about passion,\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nand it's not about any kind of movement.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nThis is really just about the facts\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nof this economic moment that we live in.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nThe 200,000-year period\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nin which men have been top dog\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nis truly coming to an end, believe it or not,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nand that's why I talk about the \"end of men.\"\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nNow all you men out there,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nthis is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nbecause the point is that this\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nis happening to all of us.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nI myself have a husband and a father\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nand two sons whom I dearly love.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nAnd this is why I like to talk about this,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nbecause if we don't acknowledge it,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nthen the transition will be pretty painful.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nBut if we do take account of it,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nthen I think it will go much more smoothly.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nI first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nI was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nand I started to notice a distinct pattern --\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nthat the recession was affecting men\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nmuch more deeply than it was affecting women.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAnd I remembered back to about 10 years ago\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nwhen I read a book by Susan Faludi\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\ncalled \"Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man,\"\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nin which she described how hard the recession had hit men,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nand I started to think about\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nwhether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nAnd I realized that two things were different this time around.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nThe first was that\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nthese were no longer just temporary hits\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nthat the recession was giving men --\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthat this was reflecting a deeper\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nunderlying shift in our global economy.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nAnd second, that the story was no longer\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\njust about the crisis of men,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nbut it was also about what was happening to women.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nAnd now look at this second set of slides.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nThese are headlines about what's been going on with women in the next few years.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nThese are things we never could have imagined a few years ago.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nWomen, a majority of the workplace.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nAnd labor statistics: women take up most managerial jobs.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nThis second set of headlines --\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nyou can see that families and marriages are starting to shift.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nAnd look at that last headline --\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nyoung women earning more than young men.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nThat particular headline comes to me from a market research firm.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nThey were basically asked by one of their clients\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nwho was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nAnd they expected that it would be young families,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nor young men, just like it had always been.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nBut in fact, they found something very surprising.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nIt was young, single women\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nwho were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nAnd so they decided, because they were intrigued by this finding,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nto do a nationwide survey.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nSo they spread out all the census data,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nand what they found, the guy described to me as a shocker,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nwhich is that in 1,997\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nout of 2,000 communities,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nwomen, young women,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nwere making more money than young men.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nSo here you have a generation of young women\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nwho grow up thinking of themselves\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nas being more powerful earners\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nthan the young men around them.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nNow, I've just laid out the picture for you,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nbut I still haven't explained to you why this is happening.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nAnd in a moment, I'm going to show you a graph,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nand what you'll see on this graph --\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nit begins in 1973,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\njust before women start flooding the workforce,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nand it brings us up to our current day.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nAnd basically what you'll see\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nis what economists talk about\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nas the polarization of the economy.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nNow what does that mean?\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nIt means that the economy is dividing into high-skill, high-wage jobs\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nand low-skill, low-wage jobs --\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nand that the middle, the middle-skill jobs,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nand the middle-earning jobs, are starting to drop out of the economy.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nThis has been going on for 40 years now.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nBut this process is affecting men\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nvery differently than it's affecting women.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nYou'll see the women in red, and you'll see the men in blue.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nYou'll watch them both drop out of the middle class,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nbut see what happens to women and see what happens to men.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nThere we go.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nSo watch that. You see them both drop out of the middle class.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nWatch what happens to the women. Watch what happens to the men.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nThe men sort of stagnate there,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nwhile the women zoom up in those high-skill jobs.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nSo what's that about?\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nIt looks like women got some power boost on a video game,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nor like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nthat lets them shoot up high.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nBut of course, it's not about that.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nWhat it's about is that the economy has changed a lot.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nWe used to have a manufacturing economy,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nwhich was about building goods and products,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nand now we have a service economy\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nand an information and creative economy.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nThose two economies require very different skills,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand as it happens, women have been much better\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nat acquiring the new set of skills than men have been.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nIt used to be that you were\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\na guy who went to high school\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nwho didn't have a college degree,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nbut you had a specific set of skills,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nand with the help of a union,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nyou could make yourself a pretty good middle-class life.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nBut that really isn't true anymore.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nThis new economy is pretty indifferent\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nto size and strength,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nwhich is what's helped men along all these years.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nWhat the economy requires now\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nis a whole different set of skills.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nYou basically need intelligence,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nyou need an ability to sit still and focus,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nto communicate openly,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nto be able to listen to people\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nand to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nand those are things that women do extremely well,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nas we're seeing.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nIf you look at management theory these days,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nit used to be that our ideal leader\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nsounded something like General Patton, right?\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nYou would be issuing orders from above.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nYou would be very hierarchical.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nYou would tell everyone below you what to do.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nBut that's not what an ideal leader is like now.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nIf you read management books now,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\na leader is somebody who can foster creativity,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nwho can get his -- get the employees -- see, I still say \"his\" --\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nwho can get the employees to talk to each other,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nwho can basically build teams and get them to be creative.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nAnd those are all things that women do very well.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nAnd then on top of that, that's created a kind of cascading effect.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nWomen enter the workplace at the top,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nand then at the working class,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nall the new jobs that are created\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nare the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nSo that's childcare,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nelder care and food preparation.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nSo those are all the jobs that are growing,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nand those are jobs that women tend to do.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nNow one day it might be\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nthat mothers will hire an out-of-work,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nmiddle-aged, former steelworker guy\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nto watch their children at home,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nand that would be good for the men, but that hasn't quite happened yet.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nTo see what's going to happen, you can't just look at the workforce that is now,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nyou have to look at our future workforce.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nAnd here the story is fairly simple.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nWomen are getting college degrees\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nat a faster rate than men.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nWhy? This is a real mystery.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nPeople have asked men, why don't they just go back to college,\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nto community college, say, and retool themselves,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nlearn a new set of skills?\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nWell it turns out that they're just very uncomfortable doing that.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nThey're used to thinking of themselves as providers,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nand they can't seem to build the social networks\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nthat allow them to get through college.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nSo for some reason\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nmen just don't end up going back to college.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nAnd what's even more disturbing\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nis what's happening with younger boys.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nThere's been about a decade of research\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nabout what people are calling the \"boy crisis.\"\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nNow the boy crisis is this idea\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nthat very young boys, for whatever reason,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nare doing worse in school than very young girls,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nand people have theories about that.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nIs it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nand little girls are better at that than little boys?\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nOr that we require kids to sit still too much,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nand so boys initially feel like failures?\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nAnd some people say it's because,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nin 9th grade, boys start dropping out of school.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nBecause I'm writing a book about all this, I'm still looking into it,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nso I don't have the answer.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nBut in the mean time, I'm going to call on the worldwide education expert,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nwho's my 10-year-old daughter, Noa,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nto talk to you about\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nwhy the boys in her class do worse.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\n(Video) Noa: The girls are obviously smarter.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nI mean they have much larger vocabulary.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nThey learn much faster.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nThey are more controlled.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nOn the board today for losing recess tomorrow, only boys.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nHanna Rosin: And why is that?\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nNoa: Why? They were just not listening to the class\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nwhile the girls sat there very nicely.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nHR: So there you go.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nThis whole thesis really came home to me\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nwhen I went to visit a college in Kansas City --\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nworking-class college.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nCertainly, when I was in college, I had certain expectations about my life --\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nthat my husband and I would both work,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nand that we would equally raise the children.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nBut these college girls\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nhad a completely different view of their future.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nBasically, the way they said it to me is\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nthat they would be working 18 hours a day,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nthat their husband would maybe have a job,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nbut that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nAnd this was kind of a shocker to me.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAnd then here's my favorite quote from one of the girls:\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\n\"Men are the new ball and chain.\"\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nNow you laugh,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nbut that quote has kind of a sting to it, right?\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nAnd I think the reason it has a sting\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nis because thousands of years of history\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\ndon't reverse themselves\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nwithout a lot of pain,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nand that's why I talk about\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nus all going through this together.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nThe night after I talked to these college girls,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nI also went to a men's group in Kansas,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nand these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nwhich I spoke to you about earlier.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nThey were men who had been contractors,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nor they had been building houses\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nand they had lost their jobs after the housing boom,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nand they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nAnd the instructor was up there in the class\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nexplaining to them all the ways\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nin which they had lost their identity in this new age.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nHe was telling them they no longer had any moral authority,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nthat nobody needed them for emotional support anymore,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nand they were not really the providers.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nSo who were they?\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nAnd this was very disheartening for them.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nAnd what he did was he wrote down on the board\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\n\"$85,000,\"\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nand he said, \"That's her salary,\"\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nand then he wrote down \"$12,000.\"\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\n\"That's your salary.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nSo who's the man now?\" he asked them.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\n\"Who's the damn man?\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nShe's the man now.\"\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAnd that really sent a shudder through the room.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nAnd that's part of the reason I like to talk about this,\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nbecause I think it can be pretty painful,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand we really have to work through it.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nAnd the other reason it's kind of urgent\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nis because it's not just happening in the U.S.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nIt's happening all over the world.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nIn India, poor women are learning English\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nfaster than their male counterparts\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nin order to staff the new call centers\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nthat are growing in India.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nIn China, a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nis happening because women are starting businesses,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nsmall businesses, faster than men.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nAnd here's my favorite example, which is in South Korea.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nOver several decades,\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nSouth Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nThey basically enshrined the second-class status of women\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nin the civil code.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nAnd if women failed to birth male children,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nthey were basically treated like domestic servants.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nAnd sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nso they could have a male child.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nBut over the '70s and '80s,\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nthe South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize,\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nand so what they did was,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nthey started to push women into the workforce.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nNow they've been asking a question since 1985:\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\n\"How strongly do you prefer a first-born son?\"\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nAnd now look at the chart.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nThat's from 1985 to 2003.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nHow much do you prefer a first-born son?\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nSo you can see that these economic changes\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nreally do have a strong effect on our culture.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nNow because we haven't fully processed this information,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nit's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nin these kind of weird and exaggerated ways,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nwhere you can see that the stereotypes are changing.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nAnd so we have on the male side\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nwhat one of my colleagues likes to call the \"omega males\" popping up,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nwho are the males who are romantically challenged losers\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nwho can't find a job.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nAnd they come up in lots of different forms.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nSo we have the perpetual adolescent.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nWe have the charmless misanthrope.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nThen we have our Bud Light guy\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nwho's the happy couch potato.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nAnd then here's a shocker: even America's most sexiest man alive,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nthe sexiest man alive\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\ngets romantically played these days in a movie.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nAnd then on the female side, you have the opposite,\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nin which you have these crazy superhero women.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nYou've got Lady Gaga.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nYou've got our new James Bond, who's Angelina Jolie.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nAnd it's not just for the young, right?\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nEven Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nAnd so it feels like we have to move from this place\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nwhere we've got these uber-exaggerated images\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\ninto something that feels a little more normal.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nSo for a long time in the economic sphere,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nwe've lived with the term \"glass ceiling.\"\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nNow I've never really liked this term.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nFor one thing, it puts men and women\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nin a really antagonistic relationship with one another,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nbecause the men are these devious tricksters up there\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nwho've put up this glass ceiling.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nAnd we're always below the glass ceiling, the women.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nAnd we have a lot of skill and experience,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nbut it's a trick, so how are you supposed to prepare\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nto get through that glass ceiling?\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nAnd also, \"shattering the glass ceiling\" is a terrible phrase.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nWhat crazy person\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nwould pop their head through a glass ceiling?\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nSo the image that I like to think of,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\ninstead of glass ceiling,\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nis the high bridge.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nIt's definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nbut it's also pretty exhilarating,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nbecause it's beautiful up there,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nand you're looking out on a beautiful view.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nAnd the great thing is there's no trick like with the glass ceiling.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nThere's no man or woman standing in the middle\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nabout to cut the cables.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nThere's no hole in the middle that you're going to fall through.\n\n00:15:23.958 -->

From mistakes", "duration": "605", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/diana_laufenberg_3_ways_to_teach", "transcript": "I have been teaching for a long time, and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students. In 1931, my grandmother \u2014 bottom left for you guys over here \u2014 graduated from the eighth grade. She went to school to get the information because that's where the information lived. It was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head; and she needed to go there to get the information, because that's how you learned. Fast-forward a generation: this is the one-room schoolhouse, Oak Grove, where my father went to a one-room schoolhouse. And he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher, stored it in the only portable memory he has, which is inside his own head, and take it with him, because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world. When I was a kid, we had a set of encyclopedias at my house. It was purchased the year I was born, and it was extraordinary, because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information. The information was inside my house and it was awesome. This was different than either generation had experienced before, and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level. But the information was closer to me. I could get access to it.In the time that passes between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teaching, we really see the advent of the Internet. Right about the time that the Internet gets going as an educational tool, I take off from Wisconsin and move to Kansas, small town Kansas, where I had an opportunity to teach in a lovely, small-town, rural Kansas school district, where I was teaching my favorite subject, American government. My first year \u2014 super gung-ho \u2014 going to teach American government, loved the political system. Kids in the 12th grade: not exactly all that enthusiastic about the American government system. Year two: learned a few things \u2014 had to change my tactic. And I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves. I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it. I posed a problem in front of them, which was to put on an election forum for their own community.They produced flyers. They called offices. They checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries. They produced an election forum booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates. They invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and whether or not the streets were done well, and really had this robust experiential learning. The older teachers \u2014 more experienced \u2014 looked at me and went, \"Oh, there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done.\" (Laughter) \"She doesn't know what she's in for.\" But I knew that the kids would show up, and I believed it, and I told them every week what I expected out of them. And that night, all 90 kids \u2014 dressed appropriately, doing their job, owning it. I had to just sit and watch. It was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic. It meant something to them. And they will step up.From Kansas, I moved on to lovely Arizona, where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years, this time with middle school students. Luckily, I didn't have to teach them American government. Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography. Again, \"thrilled\" to learn. But what was interesting about this position I found myself in in Arizona, was I had this really extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school, and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities. And one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina, which is the gentleman that the movie \"Hotel Rwanda\" is based after. And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us. We could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses. There was no expense cost. Perfect field trip.The problem then becomes how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful, and they know what to do with it. And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive. I then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life, or in their own story, or in their own world, that they could identify that had done a similar thing. I asked them to produce a little movie about it. It's the first time we'd done this. Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer, but they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it. It was the most awesome moment of revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves, what they're willing to share. The last question of the assignment is: how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people? The things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary.Fast-forward to Pennsylvania, where I find myself today. I teach at the Science Leadership Academy, which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute and the school district of Philadelphia. We are a nine through 12 public school, but we do school quite differently. I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learned, and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past, of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school, and to a moment when we have information surplus. So what do you do when the information is all around you? Why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information?In Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program, so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday, taking them home, getting access to information. And here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you've given the tool to acquire information to students, is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process. We deal right now in the educational landscape with an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test, and I am here to share with you: it is not learning. That is the absolute wrong thing to ask, to tell kids to never be wrong. To ask them to always have the right answer doesn't allow them to learn. So we did this project, and this is one of the artifacts of the project. I almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure.My students produced these info-graphics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill. I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the info-graphics that existed in a lot of mass media, and take a look at what were the interesting components of it, and produce one for themselves of a different man-made disaster from American history. And they had certain criteria to do it. They were a little uncomfortable with it, because we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it. They can talk \u2014 they're very smooth, and they can write very, very well, but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them. But I gave them the room to just do the thing. Go create. Go figure it out. Let's see what we can do. And the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint. This was done in like two or three days. And this is the work of the student that consistently did it.And when I sat the students down, I said, \"Who's got the best one?\" And they immediately went, \"There it is.\" Didn't read anything. \"There it is.\" And I said, \"Well what makes it great?\" And they're like, \"Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color. And there's some ... \" And they went through all that we processed out loud. And I said, \"Go read it.\" And they're like, \"Oh, that one wasn't so awesome.\" And then we went to another one \u2014 it didn't have great visuals, but it had great information \u2014 and spent an hour talking about the learning process, because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect, or whether or not it was what I could create. It asked them to create for themselves, and it allowed them to fail, process, learn from. And when we do another round of this in my class this year, they will do better this time, because learning has to include an amount of failure, because failure is instructional in the process.There are a million pictures that I could click through here, and had to choose carefully \u2014 this is one of my favorites \u2014 of students learning, of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information, but instead, ask them what they can do with it. Ask them really interesting questions. They will not disappoint. Ask them to go to places, to see things for themselves, to actually experience the learning, to play, to inquire. This is one of my favorite photos, because this was taken on Tuesday, when I asked the students to go to the polls. This is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting, and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that. But this is learning too, because we asked them to go out into real spaces.The main point is that, if we continue to look at education as if it's about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning, empowering student voice and embracing failure, we're missing the mark. And everything that everybody is talking about today isn't possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities, because we won't get there with a standardized test, and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer. We know how to do this better, and it's time to do better.(Applause)", "id": 1034, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nI have been teaching for a long time,\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nand in doing so\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nhave acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nthat I really wish more people would understand\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nabout the potential of students.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nIn 1931, my grandmother --\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nbottom left for you guys over here --\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\ngraduated from the eighth grade.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nShe went to school to get the information\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nbecause that's where the information lived.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nIt was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head;\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nand she needed to go there to get the information,\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nbecause that's how you learned.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nFast-forward a generation:\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nthis is the one-room schoolhouse, Oak Grove,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nwhere my father went to a one-room schoolhouse.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nAnd he again had to travel to the school\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nto get the information from the teacher,\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nstored it in the only portable memory he has, which is inside his own head,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nand take it with him,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nbecause that is how information was being transported\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nfrom teacher to student and then used in the world.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nWhen I was a kid,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nwe had a set of encyclopedias at my house.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nIt was purchased the year I was born,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nand it was extraordinary,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nbecause I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nThe information was inside my house\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nand it was awesome.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nThis was different\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nthan either generation had experienced before,\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nand it changed the way I interacted with information\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\neven at just a small level.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nBut the information was closer to me.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nI could get access to it.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nIn the time that passes\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nbetween when I was a kid in high school\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nand when I started teaching,\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nwe really see the advent of the Internet.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nRight about the time that the Internet gets going\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nas an educational tool,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nI take off from Wisconsin\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nand move to Kansas, small town Kansas,\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nwhere I had an opportunity to teach\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nin a lovely, small-town,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nrural Kansas school district,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nwhere I was teaching my favorite subject,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nAmerican government.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nMy first year -- super gung-ho -- going to teach American government,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nloved the political system.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nKids in the 12th grade:\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nnot exactly all that enthusiastic\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nabout the American government system.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nYear two: learned a few things -- had to change my tactic.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nAnd I put in front of them an authentic experience\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nthat allowed them to learn for themselves.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nI didn't tell them what to do or how to do it.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nI posed a problem in front of them,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nwhich was to put on an election forum for their own community.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nThey produced flyers.

Perfect field trip.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nThe problem then becomes\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nhow do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nand deal with the subject in a way\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nthat is responsible and respectful,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nand they know what to do with it.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nAnd so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nas an example of a gentleman\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nwho singularly used his life to do something positive.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nI then challenged the kids to identify\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nsomeone in their own life, or in their own story, or in their own world,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nthat they could identify that had done a similar thing.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nI asked them to produce a little movie about it.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nIt's the first time we'd done this.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nNobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nbut they were into it.

00:05:04.958\nFast-forward to Pennsylvania, where I find myself today.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nI teach at the Science Leadership Academy,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nwhich is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nand the school district of Philadelphia.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nWe are a nine through 12 public school,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nbut we do school quite differently.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nI moved there primarily\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nto be part of a learning environment\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nthat validated the way that I knew that kids learned,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nand that really wanted to investigate\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nwhat was possible\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nwhen you are willing to let go\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nof some of the paradigms of the past,\n\n00:05:31.958 -->

00:05:39.958\nand to a moment when we have information surplus.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nSo what do you do when the information is all around you?\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nWhy do you have kids come to school\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nif they no longer have to come there to get the information?\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nIn Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program,\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nso the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\ntaking them home, getting access to information.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nAnd here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nwhen you've given the tool\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nto acquire information to students,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nis that you have to be comfortable with this idea\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nof allowing kids to fail\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nas part of

culture of one right answer\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nthat can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nand I am here to share with you:\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nit is not learning.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nThat is the absolute wrong thing to ask,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nto tell kids to never be wrong.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nTo ask them to always have the right answer\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\ndoesn't allow them to learn.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nSo we did this project,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nand this is one of the artifacts of the project.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nI almost never show them off\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nbecause of the issue of the idea of failure.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nMy students produced these info-graphics\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nas a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nresponding to the oil spill.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nI asked them to take the examples that we were seeing\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nof the info-graphics that existed\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nin a lot of mass media,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nand take a look at what were the interesting components of it,\n\n00:06:58.958

criteria to do it.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nThey were a little uncomfortable with it,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nbecause we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nThey can talk -- they're very smooth,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nand they can write very, very well,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nbut asking them to communicate ideas in a different way\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nwas a little uncomfortable for them.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nBut I gave them the room to just do the thing.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nGo create. Go figure it out.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nLet's see what we can do.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nAnd the student that persistently\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nturns out the best visual product did not disappoint.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nThis was done in like two or three days.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nAnd this is the work of the student that consistently did it.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nAnd when I sat the students down, I said, \"Who's got the best one?\"\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nAnd they immediately went, \"There it is.\"\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nDidn't read anything. \"There it is.\"\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nAnd I said, \"Well what makes it great?\"\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd they're like, \"Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nAnd there's some ... \" And they went through all that we processed out loud.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nAnd I said, \"Go read it.\"\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nAnd they're like, \"Oh, that one wasn't so awesome.\"\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAnd then we went to another one --\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nit didn't have great visuals, but it had great information --\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nand spent an hour talking about the learning process,\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nbecause it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nor whether or not it was what I could create.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nIt asked them to create for themselves,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nand it allowed them to fail,\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nprocess, learn from.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nAnd when we do another round of this in my class this year,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nthey will do better this time,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nbecause learning\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nhas to include an amount of failure,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nbecause failure is instructional\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nin the process.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nThere are a million pictures\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nthat I could click through here,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nand had to choose carefully -- this is one of my favorites --\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nof students learning,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nof what learning can look like\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nin a landscape where we let go of the idea\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nthat kids have to come to school to get the information,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nbut instead, ask them what they can do with it.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nAsk them really interesting questions.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nThey will not disappoint.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nAsk them to go to places,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nto see things for themselves,\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nto actually experience the learning,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nto play, to inquire.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nThis is one of my favorite photos,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nbecause this was taken on Tuesday,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nwhen I asked the students to go to the polls.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nThis is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nand he wanted to share that with everybody and do that.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nBut this is learning too,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nbecause we asked them to go out into real spaces.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nThe main point\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nis that, if we continue to look at education\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nas if it's about coming to school\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nto get the information\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nand not about experiential learning,\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nempowering student voice and embracing failure,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nwe're missing the mark.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nAnd everything that everybody is talking about today\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nisn't possible if we keep having an educational system\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nthat does not value these qualities,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nbecause we won't get there with a standardized test,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nand we won't get there with a culture of one right answer.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nWe know how to do this better,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nand it's time to do better.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:54.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Let's talk parenting taboos", "duration": "1028", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/rufus_griscom_alisa_volkman_let_s_talk_parenting_taboos", "transcript": "Alisa Volkman: So this is where our story begins \u2014 the dramatic moments of the birth of our first son, Declan. Obviously a really profound moment, and it changed our lives in many ways. It also changed our lives in many unexpected ways, and those unexpected ways we later reflected on, that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us, and a year later, we launched Babble, a website for parents.Rufus Griscom: Now I think of our story as starting a few years earlier. AV: That's true.RG: You may remember, we fell head over heels in love.AV: We did.RG: We were at the time running a very different kind of website. It was a website called Nerve.com, the tagline of which was \"literate smut.\" It was in theory, and hopefully in practice, a smart online magazine about sex and culture.AV: That spawned a dating site. But you can understand the jokes that we get. Sex begets babies. You follow instructions on Nerve and you should end up on Babble, which we did. And we might launch a geriatric site as our third. We'll see.RG: But for us, the continuity between Nerve and Babble was not just the life stage thing, which is, of course, relevant, but it was really more about our desire to speak very honestly about subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about. It seems to us that when people start dissembling, people start lying about things, that's when it gets really interesting. That's a subject that we want to dive into. And we've been surprised to find, as young parents, that there are almost more taboos around parenting than there are around sex.AV: It's true. So like we said, the early years were really wonderful, but they were also really difficult. And we feel like some of that difficulty was because of this false advertisement around parenting. (Laughter) We subscribed to a lot of magazines, did our homework, but really everywhere you look around, we were surrounded by images like this. And we went into parenting expecting our lives to look like this. The sun was always streaming in, and our children would never be crying. I would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested, and in fact, it was not like that at all.RG: When we lowered the glossy parenting magazine that we were looking at, with these beautiful images, and looked at the scene in our actual living room, it looked a little bit more like this. These are our three sons. And of course, they're not always crying and screaming, but with three boys, there's a decent probability that at least one of them will not be comporting himself exactly as he should.AV: Yes, you can see where the disconnect was happening for us. We really felt like what we went in expecting had nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing, and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight. We really wanted to let them understand what the realities of parenting were in an honest way.RG: So today, what we would love to do is share with you four parenting taboos. And of course, there are many more than four things you can't say about parenting, but we would like to share with you today four that are particularly relevant for us personally. So the first, taboo number one: you can't say you didn't fall in love with your baby in the very first minute. I remember vividly, sitting there in the hospital. We were in the process of giving birth to our first child.AV: We, or I?RG: I'm sorry. Misuse of the pronoun. Alisa was very generously in the process of giving birth to our first child \u2014 (AV: Thank you.) \u2014 and I was there with a catcher's mitt. And I was there with my arms open. The nurse was coming at me with this beautiful, beautiful child, and I remember, as she was approaching me, the voices of friends saying, \"The moment they put the baby in your hands, you will feel a sense of love that will come over you that is [on] an order of magnitude more powerful than anything you've ever experienced in your entire life.\" So I was bracing myself for the moment. The baby was coming, and I was ready for this Mack truck of love to just knock me off my feet. And instead, when the baby was placed in my hands, it was an extraordinary moment. This picture is from literally a few seconds after the baby was placed in my hands and I brought him over. And you can see, our eyes were glistening. I was overwhelmed with love and affection for my wife, with deep, deep gratitude that we had what appeared to be a healthy child. And it was also, of course, surreal. I mean, I had to check the tags and make sure. I was incredulous, \"Are you sure this is our child?\" And this was all quite remarkable. But what I felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection, but nothing like what I feel for him now, five years later.And so we've done something here that is heretical. We have charted our love for our child over time. (Laughter) This, as you know, is an act of heresy. You're not allowed to chart love. The reason you're not allowed to chart love is because we think of love as a binary thing. You're either in love, or you're not in love. You love, or you don't love. And I think the reality is that love is a process, and I think the problem with thinking of love as something that's binary is that it causes us to be unduly concerned that love is fraudulent, or inadequate, or what have you. And I think I'm speaking obviously here to the father's experience. But I think a lot of men do go through this sense in the early months, maybe their first year, that their emotional response is inadequate in some fashion.AV: Well, I'm glad Rufus is bringing this up, because you can notice where he dips in the first years where I think I was doing most of the work. But we like to joke, in the first few months of all of our children's lives, this is Uncle Rufus. (Laughter)RG: I'm a very affectionate uncle, very affectionate uncle.AV: Yes, and I often joke with Rufus when he comes home that I'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line-up amongst other babies. So I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus.RG: Uh oh.AV: I don't want to embarrass him too much. But I am going to give him three seconds.RG: That is not fair. This is a trick question. He's not up there, is he?AV: Our eight-week-old son is somewhere in here, and I want to see if Rufus can actually quickly identify him.RG: The far left. AV: No!(Laughter)RG: Cruel.AV: Nothing more to be said.(Laughter)I'll move on to taboo number two. You can't talk about how lonely having a baby can be. I enjoyed being pregnant. I loved it. I felt incredibly connected to the community around me. I felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy, all around me, tracking it down till the actual due-date. I felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity. That continued into the the hospital. It was really exhilarating. I was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors. It was a really wonderful experience, but when I got home, I suddenly felt very disconnected and suddenly shut in and shut out, and I was really surprised by those feelings. I did expect it to be difficult, have sleepless nights, constant feedings, but I did not expect the feelings of isolation and loneliness that I experienced, and I was really surprised that no one had talked to me, that I was going to be feeling this way. And I called my sister whom I'm very close to \u2014 and had three children \u2014 and I asked her, \"Why didn't you tell me I was going to be feeling this way, that I was going to have these \u2014 feeling incredibly isolated?\" And she said \u2014 I'll never forget \u2014 \"It's just not something you want to say to a mother that's having a baby for the first time.\"RG: And of course, we think it's precisely what you really should be saying to mothers who have kids for the first time. And that this, of course, one of the themes for us is that we think that candor and brutal honesty is critical to us collectively being great parents. And it's hard not to think that part of what leads to this sense of isolation is our modern world. So Alisa's experience is not isolated. So your 58 percent of mothers surveyed report feelings of loneliness. Of those, 67 percent are most lonely when their kids are zero to five \u2014 probably really zero to two. In the process of preparing this, we looked at how some other cultures around the world deal with this period of time, because here in the Western world, less than 50 percent of us live near our family members, which I think is part of why this is such a tough period. So to take one example among many: in Southern India there's a practice known as jholabhari, in which the pregnant woman, when she's seven or eight months pregnant, moves in with her mother and goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies, give birth and returns home to her nuclear family several months after the child is born. And this is one of many ways that we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period.AV: So taboo number three: you can't talk about your miscarriage \u2014 but today I'll talk about mine. So after we had Declan, we kind of recalibrated our expectations. We thought we actually could go through this again and thought we knew what we would be up against. And we were grateful that I was able to get pregnant, and I soon learned that we were having a boy, and then when I was five months, we learned that we had lost our child. This is actually the last little image we have of him. And it was obviously a very difficult time \u2014 really painful. As I was working through that mourning process, I was amazed that I didn't want to see anybody. I really wanted to crawl into a hole, and I didn't really know how I was going to work my way back into my surrounding community. And I realize, I think, the way I was feeling that way, is on a really deep gut level, I was feeling a lot of shame and embarrassed, frankly, that, in some respects, I had failed at delivering what I'm genetically engineered to do. And of course, it made me question, if I wasn't able to have another child, what would that mean for my marriage, and just me as a woman. So it was a very difficult time. As I started working through it more, I started climbing out of that hole and talking with other people. I was really amazed by all the stories that started flooding in. People I interacted with daily, worked with, was friends with, family members that I had known a long time, had never shared with me their own stories. And I just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork, and I felt like I happened upon this secret society of women that I now was a part of, which was reassuring and also really concerning. And I think, miscarriage is an invisible loss. There's not really a lot of community support around it. There's really no ceremony, rituals, or rites. And I think, with a death, you have a funeral, you celebrate the life, and there's a lot of community support, and it's something women don't have with miscarriage.RG: Which is too bad because, of course, it's a very common and very traumatic experience. Fifteen to 20 percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage, and I find this astounding. In a survey, 74 percent of women said that miscarriage, they felt, was partly their fault, which is awful. And astoundingly, 22 percent said they would hide a miscarriage from their spouse.So taboo number four: you can't say that your average happiness has declined since having a child. The party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since I participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family. I'll never forget, I remember vividly to this day, our first son, Declan, was nine months old, and I was sitting there on the couch, and I was reading Daniel Gilbert's wonderful book, \"Stumbling on Happiness.\" And I got about two-thirds of the way through, and there was a chart on the right-hand side \u2014 on the right-hand page \u2014 that we've labeled here \"The Most Terrifying Chart Imaginable for a New Parent.\" This chart is comprised of four completely independent studies. Basically, there's this precipitous drop of marital satisfaction, which is closely aligned, we all know, with broader happiness, that doesn't rise again until your first child goes to college. So I'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life, this chasm of happiness that we're driving our proverbial convertible straight into. We were despondent.AV: So you can imagine, I mean again, the first few months were difficult, but we'd come out of it, and were really shocked to see this study. So we really wanted to take a deeper look at it in hopes that we would find a silver lining.RG: And that's when it's great to be running a website for parents, because we got this incredible reporter to go and interview all the scientists who conducted these four studies. We said, something is wrong here. There's something missing from these studies. It can't possibly be that bad. So Liz Mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece, and she interviewed four scientists, and she also interviewed Daniel Gilbert, and we did indeed find a silver lining. So this is our guess as to what this baseline of average happiness arguably looks like throughout life. Average happiness is, of course, inadequate, because it doesn't speak to the moment-by-moment experience, and so this is what we think it looks like when you layer in moment-to-moment experience. And so we all remember as children, the tiniest little thing \u2014 and we see it on the faces of our children \u2014 the teeniest little thing can just rocket them to these heights of just utter adulation, and then the next teeniest little thing can cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair. And it's just extraordinary to watch, and we remember it ourselves. And then, of course, as you get older, it's almost like age is a form of lithium.As you get older, you become more stable. And part of what happens, I think, in your '20s and '30s, is you start to learn to hedge your happiness. You start to realize that \"Hey, I could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps, but it's more likely that I'll feel claustrophobic and I won't be able to get a beer. So I'm not going to go. I've got a good stereo at home. So, I'm not going to go.\" So your average happiness goes up, but you lose those transcendent moments.AV: Yeah, and then you have your first child, and then you really resubmit yourself to these highs and lows \u2014 the highs being the first steps, the first smile, your child reading to you for the first time \u2014 the lows being, our house, any time from six to seven every night. But you realize you resubmit yourself to losing control in a really wonderful way, which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives and is quite gratifying.RG: And so in effect, we trade average happiness. We trade the sort of security and safety of a certain level of contentment for these transcendent moments. So where does that leave the two of us as a family with our three little boys in the thick of all this? There's another factor in our case. We have violated yet another taboo in our own lives, and this is a bonus taboo.AV: A quick bonus taboo for you, that we should not be working together, especially with three children \u2014 and we are.RG: And we had reservations about this on the front end. Everybody knows, you should absolutely not work with your spouse. In fact, when we first went out to raise money to start Babble, the venture capitalists said, \"We categorically don't invest in companies founded by husbands and wives, because there's an extra point of failure. It's a bad idea. Don't do it.\" And we obviously went forward. We did. We raised the money, and we're thrilled that we did, because in this phase of one's life, the incredibly scarce resource is time. And if you're really passionate about what you do every day \u2014 which we are \u2014 and you're also passionate about your relationship, this is the only way we know how to do it. And so the final question that we would ask is: can we collectively bend that happiness chart upwards? It's great that we have these transcendent moments of joy, but they're sometimes pretty quick. And so how about that average baseline of happiness? Can we move that up a little bit?AV: And we kind of feel that the happiness gap, which we talked about, is really the result of walking into parenting \u2014 and really any long-term partnership for that matter \u2014 with the wrong expectations. And if you have the right expectations and expectation management, we feel like it's going to be a pretty gratifying experience.RG: And so this is what \u2014 And we think that a lot of parents, when you get in there \u2014 in our case anyway \u2014 you pack your bags for a trip to Europe, and you're really excited to go. Get out of the airplane, it turns out you're trekking in Nepal. And trekking in Nepal is an extraordinary experience, particularly if you pack your bags properly and you know what you're getting in for and you're psyched. So the point of all this for us today is not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty, but a hope that by being more honest and candid about these experiences, that we can all collectively bend that happiness baseline up a little bit.RG + AV: Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1036, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nAlisa Volkman: So this is where our story begins --\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nthe dramatic moments of the birth\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nof our first son, Declan.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nObviously a really profound moment,\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nand it changed our lives in many ways.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nIt also changed our lives in many unexpected ways,\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nand those unexpected ways we later reflected on,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nthat eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us,\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nand a year later, we launched Babble,\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\na website for parents.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nRufus Griscom: Now I think of our story\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nas starting a few years earlier. AV: That's true.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nRG: You may remember, we fell head over heels in love.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nAV: We did.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nRG: We were at the time running a very different kind of website.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nIt was a website called Nerve.com,\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nthe tagline of which was \"literate smut.\"\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nIt was in theory, and hopefully in practice,\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\na smart online magazine\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nabout sex and culture.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nAV: That spawned a dating site.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nBut you can understand the jokes that we get. Sex begets babies.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nYou follow instructions on Nerve and you should end up on Babble,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nwhich we did.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nAnd we might launch a geriatric site as our third. We'll see.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nRG: But for us, the continuity between Nerve and Babble\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nwas not just the life stage thing,\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nwhich is, of course, relevant,\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nbut it was really more about\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nour desire to speak very honestly\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nabout subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nIt seems to us that\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nwhen people start dissembling, people start lying about things,\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nthat's when it gets really interesting.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nThat's a subject that we want to dive into.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nAnd we've been surprised to find, as young parents,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nthat there are almost more taboos around parenting\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nthan there are around sex.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nAV: It's true. So like we said,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nthe early years were really wonderful,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nbut they were also really difficult.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nAnd we feel like some of that difficulty\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nwas because of this false advertisement around parenting.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nWe subscribed to a lot of magazines, did our homework,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nbut really everywhere you look around, we were surrounded by images like this.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nAnd we went into parenting\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nexpecting our lives to look like this.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nThe sun was always streaming in, and our children would never be crying.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nI would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nand in fact, it was not like that at all.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nRG: When we lowered the glossy parenting magazine\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nthat we were looking at, with these beautiful images,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nand looked at the scene in our actual living room,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nit looked a little bit more like this.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nThese are our three sons.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nAnd of course, they're not always crying and screaming,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nbut with three boys, there's a decent probability\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nthat at least one of them will not be comporting himself\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nexactly as he should.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAV: Yes, you can see where the disconnect was happening for us.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nWe really felt like what we went in expecting\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nhad nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nand so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nWe really wanted to let them understand\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nwhat the realities of parenting were in an honest way.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nRG: So today, what we would love to do\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nis share with you four parenting taboos.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nAnd of course, there are many more than four things\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nyou can't say about parenting,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nbut we would like to share with you today\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nfour that are particularly relevant for us personally.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nSo the first, taboo number one:\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nyou can't say you didn't fall in love with your baby\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nin the very first minute.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nI remember vividly, sitting there in the hospital.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nWe were in the process of giving birth to our first child.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nAV: We, or I?\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nRG: I'm sorry.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nMisuse of the pronoun.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAlisa was very generously in the process\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nof giving birth to our first child -- (AV: Thank you.)\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\n-- and I was there with a catcher's mitt.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd I was there with my arms open.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nThe nurse was coming at me\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nwith this beautiful, beautiful child,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nand I remember, as she was approaching me,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nthe voices of friends saying,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\n\"The moment they put the baby in your hands,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nyou will feel a sense of love that will come over you\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nthat is [on] an order of magnitude more powerful\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthan anything you've ever experienced in your entire life.\"\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nSo I was bracing myself for the moment.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nThe baby was coming,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nand I was ready for this Mack truck of love\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nto just knock me off my feet.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nAnd instead, when the baby was placed in my hands,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nit was an extraordinary moment.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nThis picture is from literally a few seconds after\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nthe baby was placed in my hands and I brought him over.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nAnd you can see, our eyes were glistening.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nI was overwhelmed with love and affection for my wife,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nwith deep, deep gratitude\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nthat we had what appeared to be a healthy child.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nAnd it was also, of course, surreal.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nI mean, I had to check the tags and make sure.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nI was incredulous, \"Are you sure this is our child?\"\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd this was all quite remarkable.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nBut what I felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nbut nothing like what I feel for him now, five years later.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nAnd so we've done something here\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nthat is heretical.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nWe have charted\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nour love for our child over time.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nThis, as you know, is an act of heresy.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nYou're not allowed to chart love.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nThe reason you're not allowed to chart love\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nis because we think of love as a binary thing.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nYou're either in love, or you're not in love.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nYou love, or you don't love.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nAnd I think the reality is that love is a process,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nand I think the problem with thinking of love\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nas something that's binary\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nis that it causes us\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nto be unduly concerned\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nthat love is fraudulent, or inadequate, or what have you.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nAnd I think I'm speaking obviously here to the father's experience.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nBut I think a lot of men do go through this sense\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nin the early months, maybe their first year,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nthat their emotional response is inadequate in some fashion.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nAV: Well, I'm glad Rufus is bringing this up,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nbecause you can notice where he dips in the first years\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nwhere I think I was doing most of the work.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nBut we like to joke,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nin the first few months of all of our children's lives,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nthis is Uncle Rufus.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nRG: I'm a very affectionate uncle, very affectionate uncle.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nAV: Yes, and I often joke with Rufus when he comes home\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nthat I'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line-up\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\namongst other babies.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nSo I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nRG: Uh oh.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nAV: I don't want to embarrass him too much. But I am going to give him three seconds.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nRG: That is not fair. This is a trick question. He's not up there, is he?\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nAV: Our eight-week-old son is somewhere in here,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nand I want to see if Rufus can actually quickly identify him.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nRG: The far left. AV: No!\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:19.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nRG: Cruel.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nAV: Nothing more to be said.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nI'll move on to taboo number two.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nYou can't talk about how lonely having a baby can be.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nI enjoyed being pregnant. I loved it.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nI felt incredibly connected to the community around me.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nI felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy, all around me,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\ntracking it down till the actual due-date.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nI felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nThat continued into the the hospital. It was really exhilarating.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nI was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nIt was a really wonderful experience,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nbut when I got home,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nI suddenly felt very disconnected\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nand suddenly shut in and shut out,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nand I was really surprised by those feelings.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nI did expect it to be difficult,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nhave sleepless nights, constant feedings,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nbut I did not expect the feelings\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nof isolation and loneliness that I experienced,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nand I was really surprised that no one had talked to me,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nthat I was going to be feeling this way.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nAnd I called my sister\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nwhom I'm very close to -- and had three children --\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nand I asked her, \"Why didn't you tell me\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nI was going to be feeling this way,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nthat I was going to have these -- feeling incredibly isolated?\"\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nAnd she said -- I'll never forget --\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\n\"It's just not something you want to say to a mother\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nthat's having a baby for the first time.\"\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nRG: And of course, we think\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nit's precisely what you really should be saying\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nto mothers who have kids for the first time.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nAnd that this, of course, one of the themes for us\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nis that we think\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nthat candor and brutal honesty\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nis critical to us collectively\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nbeing great parents.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nAnd it's hard not to think\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nthat part of what leads to this sense of isolation\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nis our modern world.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nSo Alisa's experience is not isolated.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nSo your 58 percent of mothers surveyed\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nreport feelings of loneliness.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nOf those, 67 percent are most lonely\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nwhen their kids are zero to five -- probably really zero to two.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nIn the process of preparing this,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nwe looked at how some other cultures around the world\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\ndeal with this period of time,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nbecause here in the Western world,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nless than 50 percent of us live near our family members,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nwhich I think is part of why this is such a tough period.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nSo to take one example among many:\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nin Southern India\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nthere's a practice known as jholabhari,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nin which the pregnant woman, when she's seven or eight months pregnant,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nmoves in with her mother\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\ngive birth and returns home to her nuclear family\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nseveral months after the child is born.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nAnd this is one of many ways\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nthat we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nAV: So taboo number three:\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nyou can't talk about your miscarriage -- but today I'll talk about mine.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nSo after we had Declan,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nwe kind of recalibrated our expectations.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nWe thought we actually could go through this again\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nand thought we knew what we would be up against.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nAnd we were grateful that I was able to get pregnant,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nand I soon learned that we were having a boy,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nand then when I was five months,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nwe learned that we had lost our child.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nThis is actually the last little image we have of him.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nAnd it was obviously a very difficult time --\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nreally painful.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nAs I was working through that mourning process,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nI was amazed that I didn't want to see anybody.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nI really wanted to crawl into a hole,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nand I didn't really know how I was going\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nto work my way back into my surrounding community.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nAnd I realize, I think, the way I was feeling that way,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nis on a really deep gut level,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nI was feeling a lot of shame\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nand embarrassed, frankly,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nthat, in some respects, I had failed\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nat delivering what I'm genetically engineered to do.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nAnd of course, it made me question,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nif I wasn't able to have another child,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nwhat would that mean for my marriage,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nand just me as a woman.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nSo it was a very difficult time.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nAs I started working through it more,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nI started climbing out of that hole and talking with other people.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nI was really amazed\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nby all the stories that started flooding in.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nPeople I interacted with daily,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nworked with, was friends with,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nfamily members that I had known a long time,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nhad never shared with me their own stories.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nAnd I just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork,\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nand I felt like I happened upon\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nthis secret society of women that I now was a part of,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nwhich was reassuring and also really concerning.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nAnd I think,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nmiscarriage is an invisible loss.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nThere's not really a lot of community support around it.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nThere's really no ceremony,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nrituals, or rites.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAnd I think, with a death, you have a funeral, you celebrate the life,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nand there's a lot of community support,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nand it's something women don't have with miscarriage.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nRG: Which is too bad because, of course,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nit's a very common and very traumatic experience.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nFifteen to 20 percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nand I find this astounding.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nIn a survey, 74 percent of women said\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nthat miscarriage, they felt, was partly their fault, which is awful.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nAnd astoundingly, 22 percent\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nsaid they would hide a miscarriage from their spouse.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nSo taboo number four:\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nyou can't say that your average happiness\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nhas declined since having a child.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nThe party line is that every single aspect of my life\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nhas just gotten dramatically better\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\never since I participated\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nin the miracle that is childbirth and family.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nI'll never forget, I remember vividly to this day,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nour first son, Declan, was nine months old,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nand I was sitting there on the couch,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nand I was reading Daniel Gilbert's wonderful book, \"Stumbling on Happiness.\"\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nAnd I got about two-thirds of the way through,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nand there was a chart on the right-hand side --\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\non the right-hand page --\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nthat we've labeled here\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\n\"The Most Terrifying Chart Imaginable\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nfor a New Parent.\"\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nThis chart is comprised of four completely independent studies.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nBasically, there's this precipitous drop\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nof marital satisfaction,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nwhich is closely aligned, we all know, with broader happiness,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nthat doesn't rise again\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nuntil your first child goes to college.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nSo I'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nthis chasm of happiness\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nthat we're driving our proverbial convertible straight into.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nWe were despondent.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nAV: So you can imagine, I mean again, the first few months were difficult,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nbut we'd come out of it,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nand were really shocked to see this study.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nSo we really wanted to take a deeper look at it\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nin hopes that we would find a silver lining.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nRG: And that's when it's great to be running a website for parents,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nbecause we got this incredible reporter\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nto go and interview all the scientists\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nwho conducted these four studies.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nWe said, something is wrong here.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nThere's something missing from these studies.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nIt can't possibly be that bad.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nSo Liz Mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nand she interviewed four scientists,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nand she also interviewed Daniel Gilbert,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nand we did indeed find a silver lining.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nSo this is our guess\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nas to what this baseline of average happiness\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\narguably looks like throughout life.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nAverage happiness is, of course, inadequate,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nbecause it doesn't speak\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nto the moment-by-moment experience,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nand so this is what we think it looks like\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nwhen you layer in\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nmoment-to-moment experience.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nAnd so we all remember as children,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nthe tiniest little thing -- and we see it on the faces of our children --\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nthe teeniest little thing\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\ncan just rocket them to these heights\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nof just utter adulation,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nand then the next teeniest little thing\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\ncan cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nAnd it's just extraordinary to watch, and we remember it ourselves.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nAnd then, of course, as you get older,\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nit's almost like age is a form of lithium.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nAs you get older, you become more stable.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nAnd part of what happens, I think, in your '20s and '30s,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nis you start to learn to hedge your happiness.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nYou start to realize that\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.958\n\"Hey, I could go to this live music event\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nand have an utterly transforming

I'm going to explain what it is and try and convince you \u2014 in just 15 minutes \u2014 that this isn't a flimsy idea, or a short-term trend, but a powerful cultural and economic force reinventing not just what we consume, but how we consume.Now I'm going to start with a deceptively simple example. Hands up \u2014 how many of you have books, CDs, DVDs, or videos lying around your house that you probably won't use again, but you can't quite bring yourself to throw away? Can't see all the hands, but it looks like all of you, right? On our shelves at home, we have a box set of the DVD series \"24,\" season six to be precise. I think it was bought for us around three years ago for a Christmas present. Now my husband, Chris, and I love this show. But let's face it, when you've watched it once maybe, or twice, you don't really want to watch it again, because you know how Jack Bauer is going to defeat the terrorists. So there it sits on our shelves obsolete to us, but with immediate latent value to someone else. Now before we go on, I have a confession to make. I lived in New York for 10 years, and I am a big fan of \"Sex and the City.\" Now I'd love to watch the first movie again as sort of a warm-up to the sequel coming out next week. So how easily could I swap our unwanted copy of \"24\" for a wanted copy of \"Sex and the City?\" Now you may have noticed there's a new sector emerging called swap-trading. Now the easiest analogy for swap-trading is like an online dating service for all your unwanted media. What it does is use the Internet to create an infinite marketplace to match person A's \"haves\" with person C's \"wants,\" whatever they may be.The other week, I went on one of these sites, appropriately called Swaptree, and there were over 59,300 items that I could instantly swap for my copy of \"24.\" Lo and behold, there in Reseda, CA was Rondoron who wanted swap his or her \"like new\" copy of \"Sex and the City\" for my copy of \"24.\" So in other words, what's happening here is that Swaptree solves my carrying company's sugar rush problem, a problem the economists call \"the coincidence of wants,\" in approximately 60 seconds. What's even more amazing is it will print out a postage label on the spot, because it knows the way of the item. Now there are layers of technical wonder behind sites such as Swaptree, but that's not my interest, and nor is swap trading, per se.My passion, and what I've spent the last few years dedicated to researching, is the collaborative behaviors and trust-mechanics inherent in these systems. When you think about it, it would have seemed like a crazy idea, even a few years ago, that I would swap my stuff with a total stranger whose real name I didn't know and without any money changing hands. Yet 99 percent of trades on Swaptree happen successfully, and the one percent that receive a negative rating, it's for relatively minor reasons, like the item didn't arrive on time.So what's happening here? An extremely powerful dynamic that has huge commercial and cultural implications is at play. Namely, that technology is enabling trust between strangers. We now live in a global village where we can mimic the ties that used to happen face to face, but on a scale and in ways that have never been possible before. So what's actually happening is that social networks and real-time technologies are taking us back. We're bartering, trading, swapping, sharing, but they're being reinvented into dynamic and appealing forms. What I find fascinating is that we've actually wired our world to share, whether that's our neighborhood, our school, our office, or our Facebook network, and that's creating an economy of \"what's mine is yours.\" From the mighty eBay, the grandfather of exchange marketplaces, to car-sharing companies such as GoGet, where you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour, to social lending platforms such as Zopa, that will take anyone in this audience with 100 dollars to lend, and match them with a borrower anywhere in the world, we're sharing and collaborating again in ways that I believe are more hip than hippie. I call this \"groundswell collaborative consumption.\"Now before I dig into the different systems of collaborative consumption, I'd like to try and answer the question that every author rightfully gets asked, which is, where did this idea come from? Now I'd like to say I woke up one morning and said, \"I'm going to write about collaborative consumption,\" but actually it was a complicated web of seemingly disconnected ideas. Over the next minute, you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display of all the dots that went on in my head. The first thing I began to notice: how many big concepts were emerging \u2014 from the wisdom of crowds to smart mobs \u2014 around how ridiculously easy it is to form groups for a purpose. And linked to this crowd mania were examples all around the world \u2014 from the election of a president to the infamous Wikipedia, and everything in between \u2014 on what the power of numbers could achieve.Now, you know when you learn a new word, and then you start to see that word everywhere? That's what happened to me when I noticed that we are moving from passive consumers to creators, to highly enabled collaborators. What's happening is the Internet is removing the middleman, so that anyone from a T-shirt designer to a knitter can make a living selling peer-to-peer. And the ubiquitous force of this peer-to-peer revolution means that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates. I mean, it's amazing to think that, in every single minute of this speech, 25 hours of YouTube video will be loaded. Now what I find fascinating about these examples is how they're actually tapping into our primate instincts. I mean, we're monkeys, and we're born and bred to share and cooperate. And we were doing so for thousands of years, whether it's when we hunted in packs, or farmed in cooperatives, before this big system called hyper-consumption came along and we built these fences and created out own little fiefdoms. But things are changing, and one of the reasons why is the digital natives, or Gen-Y. They're growing up sharing \u2014 files, video games, knowledge. It's second nature to them. So we, the millennials \u2014 I am just a millennial \u2014 are like foot soldiers, moving us from a culture of \"me\" to a culture of \"we.\"The reason why it's happening so fast is because of mobile collaboration. We now live in a connected age where we can locate anyone, anytime, in real-time, from a small device in our hands. All of this was going through my head towards the end of 2008, when, of course, the great financial crash happened. Thomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists, and he poignantly commented that 2008 is when we hit a wall, when Mother Nature and the market both said, \"No more.\" Now we rationally know that an economy built on hyper-consumption is a Ponzi scheme. It's a house of cards. Yet, it's hard for us to individually know what to do.So all of this is a lot of twittering, right? Well it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head, until actually I realized it was happening because of four key drivers. One, a renewed belief in the importance of community, and a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means. A torrent of peer-to-peer social networks and real-time technologies, fundamentally changing the way we behave. Three, pressing unresolved environmental concerns. And four, a global recession that has fundamentally shocked consumer behaviors. These four drivers are fusing together and creating the big shift \u2014 away from the 20th century, defined by hyper-consumption, towards the 21st century, defined by collaborative consumption. I generally believe we're at an inflection point where the sharing behaviors \u2014 through sites such as Flickr and Twitter that are becoming second nature online \u2014 are being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives. From morning commutes to the way fashion is designed to the way we grow food, we are consuming and collaborating once again.So my co-author, Roo Rogers, and I have actually gathered thousands of examples from all around the world of collaborative consumption. And although they vary enormously in scale, maturity and purpose, when we dived into them, we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems. The first is redistribution markets. Redistribution markets, just like Swaptree, are when you take a used, or pre-owned, item and move it from where it's not needed to somewhere, or someone, where it is. They're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R' \u2014 reduce, reuse, recycle, repair and redistribute \u2014 because they stretch the life cycle of a product and thereby reduce waste.The second is collaborative lifestyles. This is the sharing of resources of things like money, skills and time. I bet, in a couple of years, that phrases like \"coworking\" and \"couchsurfing\" and \"time banks\" are going to become a part of everyday vernacular. One of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles is called Landshare. It's a scheme in the U.K. that matches Mr. Jones, with some spare space in his back garden, with Mrs. Smith, a would-be grower. Together they grow their own food. It's one of those ideas that's so simple, yet brilliant, you wonder why it's never been done before.Now, the third system is product-service systems. This is where you pay for the benefit of the product \u2014 what it does for you \u2014 without needing to own the product outright. This idea is particularly powerful for things that have high-idling capacity. And that can be anything from baby goods to fashions to \u2014 how many of you have a power drill, own a power drill? Right. That power drill will be used around 12 to 13 minutes in its entire lifetime. (Laughter) It's kind of ridiculous, right? Because what you need is the hole, not the drill. (Laughter) (Applause) So why don't you rent the drill, or, even better, rent out your own drill to other people and make some money from it? These three systems are coming together, allowing people to share resources without sacrificing their lifestyles, or their cherished personal freedoms. I'm not asking people to share nicely in the sandpit.So I want to just give you an example of how powerful collaborative consumption can be to change behaviors. The average car costs 8,000 dollars a year to run. Yet, that car sits idle for 23 hours a day. So when you consider these two facts, it starts to make a little less sense that we have to own one outright. So this is where car-sharing companies such as Zipcar and GoGet come in. In 2009, Zipcar took 250 participants from across 13 cities \u2014 and they're all self-confessed car addicts and car-sharing rookies \u2014 and got them to surrender their keys for a month. Instead, these people had to walk, bike, take the train, or other forms of public transport. They could only use their Zipcar membership when absolutely necessary. The results of this challenge after just one month was staggering. It's amazing that 413 lbs were lost just from the extra exercise. But my favorite statistic is that 100 out of the 250 participants did not want their keys back. In other words, the car addicts had lost their urge to own.Now products-service systems have been around for years. Just think of libraries and laundrettes. But I think they're entering a new age, because technology makes sharing frictionless and fun. There's a great quote that was written in the New York Times that said, \"Sharing is to ownership what the iPod is to the 8-track, what solar power is to the coal mine.\" I believe also, our generation, our relationship to satisfying what we want is far less tangible than any other previous generation. I don't want the DVD; I want the movie it carries. I don't want a clunky answering machine; I want the message it saves. I don't want a CD; I want the music it plays. In other words, I don't want stuff; I want the needs or experiences it fulfills. This is fueling a massive shift from where usage trumps possessions \u2014 or as Kevin Kelly, the editor of Wired magazine, puts it, \"where access is better than ownership.\"Now as our possessions dematerialize into the cloud, a blurry line is appearing between what's mine, what's yours, and what's ours. I want to give you one example that shows how fast this evolution is happening. This represents an eight-year time span. We've gone from traditional car-ownership to car-sharing companies, such as Zipcar and GoGet, to ride-sharing platforms that match rides to the newest entry, which is peer-to-peer car rental, where you can actually make money out of renting that car that sits idle for 23 hours a day to your neighbor. Now all of these systems require a degree of trust, and the cornerstone to this working is reputation.Now in the old consumer system, our reputation didn't matter so much, because our credit history was far more important that any kind of peer-to-peer review. But now with the Web, we leave a trail. With every spammer we flag, with every idea we post, comment we share, we're actually signaling how well we collaborate, and whether we can or can't be trusted. Let's go back to my first example, Swaptree. I can see that Rondoron has completed 553 trades with a 100 percent success rate. In other words, I can trust him or her. Now mark my words, it's only a matter of time before we're going to be able to perform a Google-like search and see a cumulative picture of our reputation capital. And this reputation capital will determine our access to collaborative consumption. It's a new social currency, so to speak, that could become as powerful as our credit rating.Now as a closing thought, I believe we're actually in a period where we're waking up from this humongous hangover of emptiness and waste, and we're taking a leap to create a more sustainable system built to serve our innate needs for community and individual identity. I believe it will be referred to as a revolution, so to speak \u2014 when society, faced with great challenges, made a seismic shift from individual getting and spending towards a rediscovery of collective good. I'm on a mission to make sharing cool. I'm on a mission to make sharing hip. Because I really believe it can disrupt outdated modes of business, help us leapfrog over wasteful forms of hyper-consumption and teach us when enough really is enough.Thank you very much.(Applause)",

sequel coming out next week.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nSo how easily could I swap\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nour unwanted copy of \"24\"\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nfor a wanted copy of \"Sex and the City?\"\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nNow you may have noticed\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nthere's a new sector emerging called swap-trading.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nNow the easiest analogy for swap-trading\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nis like an online dating service\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nfor all your unwanted media.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nWhat it does is use the Internet\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nto create an infinite marketplace\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nto match person A's \"haves\"\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nwith person C's \"wants,\"\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nwhatever they may be.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nThe other week, I went on one of these sites,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nappropriately called Swaptree,\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nand there were over 59,300 items\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nthat I could instantly swap\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nfor my copy of \"24.\"\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nLo and behold,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nthere in Reseda, CA was Rondoron\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nwho wanted swap his or her\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\n\"like new\" copy of \"Sex and the City\"\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nfor my copy of \"24.\"\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nSo in other words, what's happening here\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nis that Swaptree\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nsolves my carrying company's sugar rush problem,\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\na problem the economists call \"the coincidence of wants,\"\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nin approximately 60 seconds.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nWhat's even more amazing is it will print out a postage label on the spot,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nbecause it knows the way of the item.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nNow there are layers of technical wonder\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nbehind sites such as Swaptree,\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nbut that's not my interest,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nand nor is swap trading, per se.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nMy passion, and what I've spent the last few years\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\ndedicated to researching,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nis the collaborative behaviors and trust-mechanics\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\ninherent in these systems.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nWhen you think about it,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nit would have seemed like a crazy idea, even a few years ago,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nthat I would swap my stuff with a total stranger\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nwhose real name I didn't know\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nand without any money changing hands.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nYet 99 percent of trades on Swaptree\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nhappen successfully,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nand the one percent that receive a negative rating,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nit's for relatively minor reasons,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nlike the item didn't arrive on time.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nSo what's happening here?\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nAn extremely powerful dynamic\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nthat has huge commercial and cultural implications\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nis at play.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nNamely, that technology\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nis enabling\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\ntrust between strangers.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nWe now live in a global village\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nwhere we can mimic the ties\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nthat used to happen face to face,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nbut on a scale and in ways\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthat have never been possible before.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nSo what's actually happening\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nis that social networks and real-time technologies\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nare taking us back.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nWe're bartering, trading,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nswapping, sharing,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nbut they're being reinvented\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\ninto dynamic and appealing forms.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nWhat I find fascinating\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nis that we've actually wired our world to share,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nwhether that's our neighborhood, our school,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nour office, or our Facebook network,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nand that's creating an economy\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nof \"what's mine is yours.\"\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nFrom the mighty eBay,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nthe grandfather of exchange marketplaces,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nto car-sharing companies such as GoGet,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nwhere you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nto social lending platforms such as Zopa,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nthat will take anyone in this audience\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nwith 100 dollars to lend,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nand match them with a borrower anywhere in the world,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nwe're sharing and collaborating again\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nin ways that I believe\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nare more hip than hippie.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nI call this \"groundswell collaborative consumption.\"\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nNow before I dig into the different systems\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nof collaborative consumption,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nI'd like to try and answer the question\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nthat every author rightfully gets asked,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nwhich is, where did this idea come from?\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nNow I'd like to say I woke up one morning\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nand said, \"I'm going to write about collaborative consumption,\"\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nbut actually it was a complicated web\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nof seemingly disconnected ideas.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nOver the next minute,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nyou're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nof all the dots that went on in my head.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nThe first thing I began to notice:\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nhow many big concepts were emerging --\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nfrom the wisdom of crowds to smart mobs --\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\naround how ridiculously easy it is\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nto form groups for a purpose.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nAnd linked to this crowd mania\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nwere examples all around the world --\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nfrom the election of a president\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nto the infamous Wikipedia, and everything in between --\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\non what the power of numbers could achieve.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nNow, you know when you learn a new word,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand then you start to see that word everywhere?\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nThat's what happened to me\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nwhen I noticed that we are moving\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nfrom passive consumers\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nto creators,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nto highly enabled collaborators.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nWhat's happening\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nis the Internet is removing the middleman,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nso that anyone from a T-shirt designer\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nto a knitter\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\ncan make a living selling peer-to-peer.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd the ubiquitous force\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nof this peer-to-peer revolution\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nmeans that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nI mean, it's amazing to think\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nthat, in every single minute of this speech,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\n25 hours\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nof YouTube video will be loaded.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nNow what I find fascinating about these examples\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nis how they're actually tapping into\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nour primate instincts.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nI mean, we're monkeys,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nand we're born and bred to share and cooperate.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nAnd we were doing so for thousands of years,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nwhether it's when we hunted in packs,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nor farmed in cooperatives,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nbefore this big system called hyper-consumption came along\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nand we built these fences\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nand created out own little fiefdoms.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nBut things are changing,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nand one of the reasons why\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nis the digital natives, or Gen-Y.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nThey're growing up sharing --\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nfiles, video games, knowledge.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nIt's second nature to them.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nSo we, the millennials -- I am just a millennial --\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nare like foot soldiers,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nmoving us from a culture of \"me\" to a culture of \"we.\"\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nThe reason why it's happening so fast\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nis because of mobile collaboration.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nWe now live in a connected age\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nwhere we can locate anyone, anytime, in real-time,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nfrom a small device in our hands.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nAll of this was going through my head\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\ntowards the end of 2008,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nwhen, of course, the great financial crash happened.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nThomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nand he poignantly commented\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nthat 2008 is when we hit a wall,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nwhen Mother Nature and the market\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nboth said, \"No more.\"\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nNow we rationally know\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nthat an economy built on hyper-consumption\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nis a Ponzi scheme. It's a house of cards.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nYet, it's hard for us to individually know what to do.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nSo all of this is a lot of twittering, right?\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nWell it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nuntil actually I realized it was happening\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nbecause of four key drivers.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nOne, a renewed belief in the importance of community,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nand a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nA torrent of peer-to-peer social networks\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nand real-time technologies,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nfundamentally changing the way we behave.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nThree, pressing unresolved environmental concerns.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nAnd four, a global recession\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nthat has fundamentally shocked\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nconsumer behaviors.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nThese four drivers\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nare fusing together\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nand creating the big shift --\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\naway from the 20th century,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\ndefined by hyper-consumption,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\ntowards the 21st century,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\ndefined by collaborative consumption.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nI generally believe we're at an inflection point\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nwhere the sharing behaviors --\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nthrough sites such as Flickr and Twitter\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nthat are becoming second nature online --\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nare being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nFrom morning commutes to the way fashion is designed\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nto the way we grow food,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nwe are consuming and collaborating once again.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nSo my co-author, Roo Rogers, and I\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nhave actually gathered thousands of examples\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nfrom all around the world of collaborative consumption.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nAnd although they vary enormously\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nin scale, maturity and purpose,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nwhen we dived into them,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nwe realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nThe first is redistribution markets.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nRedistribution markets, just like Swaptree,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nare when you take a used, or pre-owned, item\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nand move it from where it's not needed\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nto somewhere, or someone, where it is.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nThey're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R' --\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nreduce, reuse, recycle, repair\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nand redistribute --\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nbecause they stretch the life cycle of a product\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nand thereby reduce waste.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nThe second is collaborative lifestyles.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nThis is the sharing of resources\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nof things like money, skills and time.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nI bet, in a couple of years,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nthat phrases like \"coworking\"\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nand \"couchsurfing\" and \"time banks\"\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nare going to become a part of everyday vernacular.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nOne of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nis called Landshare.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nIt's a scheme in the U.K.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nthat matches Mr. Jones,\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nwith some spare space in his back garden,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nwith Mrs. Smith, a would-be grower.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nTogether they grow their own food.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nIt's one of those ideas that's so simple, yet brilliant,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nyou wonder why it's never been done before.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nNow, the third system\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nis product-service systems.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nThis is where you pay for the benefit of the product --\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nwhat it does for you --\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nwithout needing to own the product outright.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nThis idea is particularly powerful\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nfor things that have\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nhigh-idling capacity.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nAnd that can be anything from baby goods\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nto fashions to --\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nhow many of you have a power drill,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nown a power drill? Right.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nThat power drill will be used around 12 to 13 minutes\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nin its entire lifetime.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nIt's kind of ridiculous, right?\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nBecause what you need is the hole, not the drill.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nSo why don't you rent the drill,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nor, even better, rent out your own drill to other people\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nand make some money from it?\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nThese three systems are coming together,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nallowing people to share resources\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nwithout sacrificing their lifestyles,\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nor their cherished personal freedoms.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nI'm not asking people\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nto share nicely in the sandpit.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nSo I want to just give you an example\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nof how powerful collaborative consumption can be\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nto change behaviors.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nThe average car\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\ncosts 8,000 dollars a year to run.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nYet, that car sits idle\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nfor 23 hours a day.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nSo when you consider these two facts,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nit starts to make a little less sense\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nthat we have to own one outright.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nSo this is where car-sharing companies\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nsuch as Zipcar and GoGet come in.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nIn 2009,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nZipcar took 250 participants\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nfrom across 13 cities --\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nand they're all self-confessed car addicts\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand car-sharing rookies --\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nand got them to surrender their keys for a month.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nInstead, these people had to walk,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nbike, take the train,\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nor other forms of public transport.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nThey could only use their Zipcar membership\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nwhen absolutely necessary.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nThe results of this challenge after just one month\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nwas staggering.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nIt's amazing that 413 lbs were lost\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\njust from the extra exercise.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nBut my favorite statistic\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nis that 100\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nout of the 250 participants\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\ndid not want their keys back.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nIn other words, the car addicts\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nhad lost their urge to own.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nNow products-service systems have been around for years.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nJust think of libraries and laundrettes.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nBut I think they're entering a new age,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nbecause technology makes sharing\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nfrictionless and fun.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nThere's a great quote that was written in the New York Times\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nthat said, \"Sharing is to ownership\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nwhat the iPod is to the 8-track,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nwhat solar power is to the coal mine.\"\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nI believe also, our generation,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nour relationship to satisfying what we want\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nis far less tangible\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nthan any other previous generation.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nI don't want the DVD; I want the movie it carries.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nI don't want a clunky answering machine;\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nI want the message it saves.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nI don't want a CD; I want the music it plays.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nIn other words, I don't want stuff;\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nI want the needs or experiences it fulfills.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nThis is fueling a massive shift\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nfrom where usage trumps possessions --\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nor as Kevin Kelly, the editor of Wired magazine, puts it,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\n\"where access is better than ownership.\"\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nNow as our possessions\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\ndematerialize into the cloud,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\na blurry line is appearing\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nbetween what's mine, what's yours,\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nand what's ours.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nI want to give you one example\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nthat shows how fast this evolution is happening.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nThis represents an eight-year time span.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nWe've gone from traditional car-ownership\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nto car-sharing companies, such as Zipcar and GoGet,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nto ride-sharing platforms that match rides\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nto the newest entry, which is peer-to-peer car rental,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nwhere you can actually make money\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nout of renting that car that sits idle for 23 hours a day\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nto your neighbor.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nNow all of these systems\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nrequire a degree of trust,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nand the cornerstone to this working\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nis reputation.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nNow in the old consumer system,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nour reputation didn't matter so much,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nbecause our credit history was far more important\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nthat any kind of peer-to-peer review.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nBut now with the Web, we leave a trail.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nWith every spammer we flag,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nwith every idea we post, comment we share,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nwe're actually signaling how well we collaborate,\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nand whether we can or can't be trusted.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nLet's go back to my first example,\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nSwaptree.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nI can see that Rondoron\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nhas completed 553 trades\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nwith a 100 percent success rate.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nIn other words, I can trust him or her.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nNow mark my words,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nit's only a matter of time\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nbefore we're going to be able to perform a Google-like search\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nand see a cumulative picture\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nof our reputation capital.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nAnd this reputation capital\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nwill determine our access to collaborative consumption.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nIt's a new social currency, so to speak,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nthat could become as powerful as our credit rating.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nNow as a closing thought,\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nI believe we're actually in a period\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nwhere we're waking up\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nfrom this humongous hangover\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nof emptiness and waste,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nand we're taking a leap\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nto create a more sustainable system\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nbuilt to serve our innate needs\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nfor community and individual identity.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nI believe it will be referred to\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nas a revolution, so to speak --\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nwhen society, faced with great challenges,\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nmade a seismic shift\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nfrom individual getting and spending\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\ntowards a rediscovery of collective good.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nI'm on a mission to make sharing cool.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nI'm on a mission to make sharing hip.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nBecause I really believe\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nit can disrupt outdated modes of business,\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nhelp us leapfrog\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nover wasteful forms of hyper-consumption\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nand teach us when enough really is enough.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Life lessons from big cats", "duration": "1040", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/beverly_dereck_joubert_life_lessons_from_big_cats", "transcript": "Beverly Joubert: We are truly passionate about the African wilderness and protecting the African wilderness, and so what we've done is we've focused on iconic cats. And I know, in the light of human suffering and poverty and even climate change, one would wonder, why worry about a few cats? Well today we're here to share with you a message that we have learned from a very important and special character \u2014 this leopard.Dereck Joubert: Well, our lives have basically been like a super long episode of \"CSI\" \u2014 something like 28 years. In essence, what we've done is we've studied the science, we've looked at the behavior, we've seen over 2,000 kills by these amazing animals. But one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality, that individual personality that these animals have. And here's a prime example. We found this leopard in a 2,000-year-old baobab tree in Africa, the same tree that we found her mother in and her grandmother. And she took us on a journey and revealed something very special to us \u2014 her own daughter, eight days old. And the minute we found this leopard, we realized that we needed to move in, and so we basically stayed with this leopard for the next four-and-a-half years \u2014 following her every day, getting to know her, that individual personality of hers, and really coming to know her. Now I'm destined to spend a lot of time with some unique, very, very special, individualistic and often seductive female characters. (Laughter) Beverly's clearly one of them, and this little leopard, Legadema, is another, and she changed our lives.BJ: Well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her \u2014 in fact, more time than even her mother did. When her mother would go off hunting, we would stay and film. And early on, a lightning bolt hit a tree 20 paces away from us. It was frightening, and it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell. And of course, we were stunned for a while, but when we managed to get our wits about us, we looked at it and said, \"My gosh, what's going to happen with that little cub? She's probably going to forever associate that deafening crash with us.\" Well, we needn't have worried. She came charging out of the thicket straight towards us, sat next to us, shivering, with her back towards Dereck, and looking out. And actually from that day on, she's been comfortable with us. So we felt that that day was the day that she really earned her name. We called her Legadema, which means, \"light from the sky.\"DJ: Now we've found these individualisms in all sorts of animals, in particular in the cats. This particular one is called Eetwidomayloh, \"he who greets with fire,\" and you can just see that about him, you know \u2014 that's his character. But only by getting up close to these animals and spending time with them can we actually even reach out and dig out these personal characters that they have.BJ: But through our investigation, we have to seek the wildest places in Africa. And right now this is in the Okavango Delta in Botswana. Yes, it is swamp. We live in the swamp in a tent, but I must tell you, every day is exhilarating. But also, our hearts are in our throats a huge amount of the time, because we're driving through water, and it's an unknown territory. But we're really there seeking and searching and filming the iconic cats.DJ: Now one of the big things, of course, everybody knows that cats hate water, and so this was a real revelation for us. And we could only find this by pushing ourselves, by going where no sane person should go \u2014 not without some prompting, by the way, from Beverly \u2014 and just pushing the envelope, going out there, pushing our vehicle, pushing ourselves. But we've managed to find that these lions are 15 percent bigger than any others, and they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water.BJ: And then of course, the challenge is knowing when to turn around. We don't always get that right, and on this particular day, we seriously underestimated the depth. We got deeper and deeper, until it was at Dereck's chest-height. Well then we hit a deep depression, and we seriously submerged the vehicle. We actually managed to drown two million dollars' worth of camera gear. We drowned our pride, I must tell you, which was really serious, and we seized the engine.DJ: And of course, one of the rules that we have in the vehicle is that he who drowns the vehicle gets to swim with the crocodiles. (Laughter) You will notice also that all of these images here are taken from the top angle by Beverly \u2014 the dry top angle, by the way. (Laughter) But all the places we get stuck in really have great views. And it wasn't a moment, and these lions came back towards us, and Beverly was able to get a great photograph.BJ: But we truly do spend day and night trying to capture unique footage. And 20 years ago, we did a film called \"Eternal Enemies\" where we managed to capture this unusual disturbing behavior across two species \u2014 lions and hyenas. And surprisingly, it became a cult film. And we can only work that out as people were seeing parallels between the thuggish side of nature and gang warfare.DJ: It was amazing, because you can see that this lion is doing exactly what his name, Eetwidomayloh, represents. He's focused on this hyena, and he is going to get it. (Animal sounds) But that's, I think, what this is all about, is that these individuals have these personalities and characters. But for us to get them, not only do we push ourselves, but we live by certain rules of engagement, which mean we can't interfere. This sort of behavior has been going on for three, four, five million years, and we can't step in and say, \"That's wrong, and that's right.\" But that's not always easy for us.BJ: So, as Dereck says, we have to work through extremes \u2014 extreme temperatures, push ourselves at night. Sleep deprivation is extreme. We're on the edge through a large part of the time. But, for 10 years, we tried to capture lions and elephants together \u2014 and never ever managed until this particular night. And I have to tell you that it was a disturbing night for me. I had tears rolling down my cheeks. I was shaking with anxiety, but I knew that [I had] to capture something that had never been seen before, had never been documented. And I do believe you should stay with us.DJ: The amazing thing about these moments \u2014 and this is probably a highlight of our career \u2014 is that you never know how it's going to end. Many people believe, in fact, that death begins in the eyes, not in the heart, not in the lungs, and that's when people give up hope, or when any life form gives up hope. And you can see the start of it here. This elephant, against overwhelming odds, simply gives up hope. But by the same token, you can get your hope back again. So just when you think it's all over, something else happens, some spark gets into you, some sort of will to fight \u2014 that iron will that we all have, that this elephant has, that conservation has, that big cats have. Everything has that will to survive, to fight, to push through that mental barrier and to keep going. And for us, in many ways, this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration for us, a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work.(Applause)Now back to the leopard. We were spending so much time with this leopard and getting to understand her individualism, her personal character, that maybe we were taking it a little bit far. We were perhaps taking her for granted, and maybe she didn't like that that much. This is about couples working together, and so I do need to say that within the vehicle we have quite strict territories, Beverly and I. Beverly sits on the one side where all her camera gear is, and I'm on the other side where my space is. These are precious to us, these divides.BJ: But when this little cub saw that I had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear, she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate. It was phenomenal, and we felt grateful that she trusted us to that extent. But at the same time, we were concerned that if she created this as a habit and jumped into somebody else's car, it might not turn out the same way \u2014 she might get shot for that. So we knew we had to react quickly. And the only way we thought we could without scaring her is to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make \u2014 a hiss and a sound. So Dereck turned on the heater fan in the car \u2014 very innovative.DJ: It was the only way for me to save the marriage, because Beverly felt she was being replaced, you see. (Laughter) But really and truly, this was how this little leopard was displaying her individual personality. But nothing prepared us for what happened next in our relationship with her, when she started hunting.BJ: And on this first hunt, we truly were excited. It was like watching a graduation ceremony. We felt like we were surrogate parents. And of course, we knew now that she was going to survive. But only when we saw the tiny baby baboon clinging to the mother's fur did we realize that something very unique was taking place here with Legadema. And of course, the baby baboon was so innocent, it didn't turn and run. So what we watched over the next couple of hours was very unique. It was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety, protecting it from the hyena. And over the next five hours, she took care of it. We realized that we actually don't know everything, and that nature is so unpredictable, we have to be open at all times.DJ: Okay, so she was a little bit rough. (Laughter) But in fact, what we were seeing here was interesting. Because she is a cub wanting to play, but she was also a predator needing to kill, and yet conflicted in some way, because she was also an emerging mother. She had this maternal instinct, much like a young girl on her way to womanhood, and so this really took us to this new level of understanding that personality.BJ: And of course, through the night, they lay together. They ended up sleeping for hours. But I have to tell you \u2014 everybody always asks, \"What happened to the baby baboon?\" It did die, and we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights.DJ: So at this stage, I guess, we had very, very firm ideas on what conservation meant. We had to deal with these individual personalities. We had to deal with them with respect and celebrate them. And so we, with the National Geographic, formed the Big Cats Initiative to march forward into conservation, taking care of the big cats that we loved \u2014 and then had an opportunity to look back over the last 50 years to see how well we had all collectively been doing. So when Beverly and I were born, there were 450,000 lions, and today there are 20,000. Tigers haven't fared any better \u2014 45,000 down to maybe 3,000.BJ: And then cheetahs have crashed all the way down to 12,000. Leopards have plummeted from 700,000 down to a mere 50,000. Now in the extraordinary time that we have worked with Legadema \u2014 which is really over a five-year period \u2014 10,000 leopards were legally shot by safari hunters. And that's not the only leopards that were being killed through that period. There's an immense amount of poaching as well, and so possibly the same amount. It's simply not sustainable. We admire them, and we fear them, and yet, as man, we want to steal their power. It used to be the time where only kings wore a leopard skin, but now throughout rituals and ceremonies, traditional healers and ministers. And of course, looking at this lion paw that has been skinned, it eerily reminds me of a human hand, and that's ironic, because their fate is in our hands.DJ: There's a burgeoning bone trade. South Africa just released some lion bones onto the market. Lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same, and so in a stroke, the lion bone industry is going to wipe out all the tigers. So we have a real problem here, no more so than the lions do, the male lions. So the 20,000 lion figure that you just saw is actually a red herring, because there may be 3,000 or 4,000 male lions, and they all are actually infected with the same disease. I call it complacency \u2014 our complacency. Because there's a sport, there's an activity going on that we're all aware of, that we condone. And that's probably because we haven't seen it like we are today.BJ: And you have to know that, when a male lion is killed, it completely disrupts the whole pride. A new male comes into the area and takes over the pride, and, of course, first of all kills all the cubs and possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs. So we've estimated that between 20 [and] 30 lions are killed when one lion is hanging on a wall somewhere in a far-off place.DJ: So what our investigations have shown is that these lions are essential. They're essential to the habitat. If they disappear, whole ecosystems in Africa disappear. There's an 80-billion-dollar-a-year ecotourism revenue stream into Africa. So this is not just a concern about lions; it's a concern about communities in Africa as well. If they disappear, all of that goes away. But what I'm more concerned about in many ways is that, as we de-link ourselves from nature, as we de-link ourselves spiritually from these animals, we lose hope, we lose that spiritual connection, our dignity, that thing within us that keeps us connected to the planet.BJ: So you have to know, looking into the eyes of lions and leopards right now, it is all about critical awareness. And so what we are doing, in February, we're bringing out a film called \"The Last Lion,\" and \"The Last Lion\" is exactly what is happening right now. That is the situation we're in \u2014 the last lions. That is, if we don't take action and do something, these plains will be completely devoid of big cats, and then, in turn, everything else will disappear. And simply, if we can't protect them, we're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well.DJ: And in fact, that original thing that we spoke about and designed our lives by \u2014 that conservation was all about respect and celebration \u2014 is probably true. That's really what it needs. We need it. We respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman, as a community and as part of this planet, and we need to continue that.And Legadema? Well we can report, in fact, that we're grandparents.(Laughter)BJ/DJ: Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1039, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958

wilderness,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nand so what we've done\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nis we've focused on iconic cats.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nAnd I know,\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nin the light of human suffering and poverty\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nand even climate change,\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\none would wonder,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nwhy worry about a few cats?\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nWell today we're here\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nto share with you a message that we have learned\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nfrom a very important and special character --\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nthis leopard.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nDereck Joubert: Well, our lives have basically been\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nlike a super long episode of \"CSI\" --\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nsomething like 28 years.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nIn essence, what we've done\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nis we've studied the science, we've looked at the behavior,\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nwe've seen over 2,000 kills\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nby these amazing animals.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nBut one of the things that science really lets us down on\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nis that personality,\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nthat individual personality that these animals have.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nAnd here's a prime example.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nWe found this leopard in a 2,000-year-old\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nbaobab tree in Africa,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nthe same tree that we found her mother in\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nand her grandmother.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nAnd she took us on a journey\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nand revealed something very special to us --\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nher own daughter, eight days old.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nAnd the minute we found this leopard,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nwe realized that we needed to move in,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nand so we basically stayed with this leopard\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nfor the next four-and-a-half years --\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nfollowing her every day,\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\ngetting to know her,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nthat individual personality of hers,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nand really coming to know her.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nNow I'm destined\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nto spend a lot of time\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nwith some unique,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nvery, very special,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nindividualistic\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nand often seductive female characters.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nBeverly's clearly one of them,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nand this little leopard, Legadema, is another,\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nand she changed our lives.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nBJ: Well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her --\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nin fact, more time than even her mother did.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nWhen her mother would go off hunting,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nwe would stay and film.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nAnd early on, a lightning bolt hit a tree\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\n20 paces away from us.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nIt was frightening,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nand it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nAnd of course, we were stunned for a while,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nbut when we managed to get our wits about us,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nwe looked at it and said, \"My gosh,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nwhat's going to happen with that little cub?\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nShe's probably going to forever associate\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nthat deafening crash with us.\"\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nWell, we needn't have worried.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nShe came charging out of the thicket straight towards us,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nsat next to us, shivering,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nwith her back towards Dereck, and looking out.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nAnd actually from that day on,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nshe's been comfortable with us.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nSo we felt that that day\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nwas the day that she really earned her name.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nWe called her Legadema,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nwhich means, \"light from the sky.\"\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nDJ: Now we've found these individualisms\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nin all sorts of animals,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nin particular in the cats.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nThis particular one is called Eetwidomayloh,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\n\"he who greets with fire,\"\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nand you can just see that about him, you know -- that's his character.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nBut only by getting up close to these animals\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nand spending time with them\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\ncan we actually even reach out\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nand dig out these personal characters that they have.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nBJ: But through our investigation,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nwe have to seek the wildest places in Africa.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nAnd right now this is in the Okavango Delta\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nin Botswana.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nYes, it is swamp. We live in the swamp in a tent,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nbut I must tell you, every day is exhilarating.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nBut also, our hearts are in our throats\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\na huge amount of the time,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nbecause we're driving through water,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nand it's an unknown territory.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nBut we're really there\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nseeking and searching and filming the iconic cats.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nDJ: Now one of the big things, of course,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\neverybody knows that cats hate water,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nand so this was a real revelation for us.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nAnd we could only find this by pushing ourselves,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nby going where no sane person should go --\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nnot without some prompting, by the way, from Beverly --\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nand just pushing the envelope,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\ngoing out there, pushing our vehicle, pushing ourselves.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nBut we've managed to find that these lions\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nare 15 percent bigger than any others,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nand they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nBJ: And then of course, the challenge\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nis knowing when to turn around.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nWe don't always get that right,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nand on this particular day,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nwe seriously underestimated the depth.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nWe got deeper and deeper,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nuntil it was at Dereck's chest-height.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nWell then we hit a deep depression,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nand we seriously submerged the vehicle.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nWe actually managed to drown\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\ntwo million dollars' worth of camera gear.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nWe drowned our pride, I must tell you,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nwhich was really serious,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nand we seized the engine.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nDJ: And of course, one of the rules that we have in the vehicle\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nis that he who drowns the vehicle\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\ngets to swim with the crocodiles.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nYou will notice also that all of these images here\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nare taken from the top angle by Beverly --\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nthe dry top angle, by the way.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nBut all the places we get stuck in really have great views.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nAnd it wasn't a moment, and these lions came back towards us,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nand Beverly was able to get a great photograph.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nBJ: But we truly do\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nspend day and night\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\ntrying to capture unique footage.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nAnd 20 years ago,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nwe did a film called \"Eternal Enemies\"\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nwhere we managed to capture\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nthis unusual disturbing behavior across two species --\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nlions and hyenas.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nAnd surprisingly, it became a cult film.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nAnd we can only work that out\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nas people were seeing parallels\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nbetween the thuggish side of nature\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nand gang warfare.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nDJ: It was amazing, because you can see that this lion\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nis doing exactly what his name,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nEetwidomayloh, represents.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nHe's focused on this hyena,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nand he is going to get it.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.958\n(Animal sounds)\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nBut that's, I think, what this is all about,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nis that these individuals have these personalities and characters.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nBut for us to get them, not only do we push ourselves,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nbut we live by certain rules of engagement,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nwhich mean we can't interfere.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nThis sort of behavior has been going on\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nfor three, four, five million years,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nand we can't step in and say, \"That's wrong, and that's right.\"\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nBut that's not always easy for us.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nBJ: So, as Dereck says,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nwe have to work through extremes --\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nextreme temperatures, push ourselves at night.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nSleep deprivation is extreme.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nWe're on the edge\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nthrough a large part of the time.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nBut, for 10 years, we tried to capture\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nlions and elephants together --\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nand never ever managed\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nuntil this particular night.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nAnd I have to tell you\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nthat it was a disturbing night for me.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nI had tears rolling down my cheeks.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nI was shaking with anxiety,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nbut I knew that [I had] to capture something\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nthat had never been seen before, had never been documented.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nAnd I do believe you should stay with us.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nDJ: The amazing thing about these moments --\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nand this is probably a highlight of our career --\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nis that you never know how it's going to end.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nMany people believe, in fact,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nthat death begins in the eyes, not in the heart,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nnot in the lungs,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nand that's when people give up hope,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nor when any life form gives up hope.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nAnd you can see the start of it here.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nThis elephant, against overwhelming odds,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nsimply gives up hope.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nBut by the same token,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nyou can get your hope back again.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nSo just when you think it's all over, something else happens,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nsome spark gets into you,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nsome sort of will to fight --\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nthat iron will that we all have,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nthat this elephant has,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nthat conservation has, that big cats have.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nEverything has that will to survive,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nto fight, to push through that mental barrier\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nand to keep going.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nAnd for us, in many ways,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nthis elephant has become\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\na symbol of inspiration for us,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\na symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:47.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nNow back to the leopard.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nWe were spending so much time with this leopard\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nand getting to understand her individualism,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nher personal character,\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nthat maybe we were taking it a little bit far.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nWe were perhaps taking her for granted,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nand maybe she didn't like that that much.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nThis is about couples working together,\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nand so I do need to say that within the vehicle\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nwe have quite strict territories, Beverly and I.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nBeverly sits on the one side\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nwhere all her camera gear is,\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nand I'm on the other side where my space is.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nThese are precious to us, these divides.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nBJ: But when this little cub saw\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nthat I had vacated my seat\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nand climbed to the back to get some camera gear,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nshe came in like a curious cat\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nto come and investigate.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nIt was phenomenal, and we felt grateful\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nthat she trusted us to that extent.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nBut at the same time, we were concerned\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nthat if she created this as a habit\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nand jumped into somebody else's car,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nit might not turn out the same way --\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nshe might get shot for that.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nSo we knew we had to react quickly.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nAnd the only way we thought we could\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nwithout scaring her\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nis to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make --\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\na hiss and a sound.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nSo Dereck turned on the heater fan in the car --\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nvery innovative.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nDJ: It was the only way for me to save the marriage,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nbecause Beverly felt she was being replaced, you see.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nBut really and truly, this was how\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nthis little leopard was displaying\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nher individual personality.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nBut nothing prepared us\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nfor what happened next in our relationship with her,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nwhen she started hunting.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nBJ: And on this first hunt, we truly were excited.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nIt was like watching a graduation ceremony.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nWe felt like we were surrogate parents.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nAnd of course, we knew now\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nthat she was going to survive.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nBut only when we saw the tiny baby baboon\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nclinging to the mother's fur\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\ndid we realize that something very unique\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nwas taking place here with Legadema.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAnd of course, the baby baboon was so innocent,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nit didn't turn and run.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nSo what we watched\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nover the next couple of hours\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nwas very unique.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nIt was absolutely amazing\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nwhen she picked it up to safety,\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nprotecting it from the hyena.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nAnd over the next five hours,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nshe took care of it.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nWe realized that we actually don't know everything,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nand that nature is so unpredictable,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nwe have to be open at all times.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nDJ: Okay, so she was a little bit rough.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nBut in fact,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nwhat we were seeing here was interesting.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nBecause she is a cub wanting to play,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nbut she was also a predator needing to kill,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand yet conflicted in some way,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nbecause she was also an emerging mother.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nShe had this maternal instinct,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nmuch like a young girl on her way to womanhood,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nand so this really took us to this new level\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nof understanding that personality.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nBJ: And of course, through the night, they lay together.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nThey ended up sleeping for hours.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nBut I have to tell you --\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\neverybody always asks, \"What happened to the baby baboon?\"\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nIt did die,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nDJ: So at this stage, I guess,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nwe had very, very firm ideas\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\non what conservation meant.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nWe had to deal with these individual personalities.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nWe had to deal with them with respect\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand celebrate them.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nAnd so we, with the National Geographic, formed the Big Cats Initiative\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nto march forward into conservation,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\ntaking care of the big cats that we loved --\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nand then had an opportunity to look back over the last 50 years\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nto see how well we had all collectively been doing.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nSo when Beverly and I were born,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nthere were 450,000 lions,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nand today there are 20,000.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nTigers haven't fared any better --\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\n45,000\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\ndown to maybe 3,000.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nBJ: And then cheetahs have crashed\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nall the way down to 12,000.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nLeopards have plummeted\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nfrom 700,000\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\ndown to a mere 50,000.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nNow in the extraordinary time\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nthat we have worked with Legadema --\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nwhich is really over a five-year period --\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\n10,000 leopards were legally shot\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nby safari hunters.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nAnd that's not the only leopards\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nthat were being killed through that period.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nThere's an immense amount of poaching as well,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nand so possibly the same amount.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nIt's simply not sustainable.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nWe admire them,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nand we fear them,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nand yet, as man, we want to steal their power.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nIt used to be the time\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nwhere only kings wore a leopard skin,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nbut now throughout rituals and ceremonies,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\ntraditional healers and ministers.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nAnd of course, looking at this lion paw\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nthat has been skinned,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nit eerily reminds me\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nof a human hand,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nand that's ironic, because their fate is in our hands.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nDJ: There's a burgeoning bone trade.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nSouth Africa just released some lion bones onto the market.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nLion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nand so in a stroke, the lion bone industry\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nis going to wipe out all the tigers.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nSo we have a real problem here,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nno more so than the lions do, the male lions.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nSo the 20,000 lion figure that you just saw\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nis actually a red herring,\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nbecause there may be 3,000 or 4,000 male lions,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nand they all are actually\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\ninfected with the same disease.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nI call it complacency --\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nour complacency.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nBecause there's a sport, there's an activity going on\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nthat we're all aware of, that we condone.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nAnd that's probably because we haven't seen it\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nlike we are today.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nBJ: And you have to know\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nthat, when a male lion is killed,\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nit completely disrupts the whole pride.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nA new male comes into the area\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nand takes over the pride,\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nand, of course, first of all kills all the cubs\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nand possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nSo we've estimated\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nthat between 20 [and] 30 lions are killed\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nwhen one lion is hanging on a wall\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nsomewhere in a far-off place.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nDJ: So what our investigations have shown\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nis that these lions are essential.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nThey're essential to the habitat.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nIf they disappear,\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nwhole ecosystems in Africa disappear.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nThere's an 80-billion-dollar-a-year\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\necotourism revenue stream into Africa.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nSo this is not just a concern about lions;\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nit's a concern about communities in Africa as well.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nIf they disappear, all of that goes away.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nBut what I'm more concerned about in many ways\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nis that, as we de-link ourselves from nature,\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nas we de-link ourselves spiritually\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nfrom these animals,\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nwe lose hope,\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nwe lose that spiritual connection,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nour dignity, that thing within us\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nthat keeps us connected to the planet.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nBJ: So you have to know, looking into the eyes\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nof lions and leopards right now,\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nit is all about critical awareness.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nAnd so what we are doing,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nin February, we're bringing out a film called \"The Last Lion,\"\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nand \"The Last Lion\" is exactly\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nwhat is happening right now.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nThat is the situation we're in --\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nthe last lions.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nThat is, if we don't take action and do something,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nthese plains will be completely devoid\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nof big cats,\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nand then, in turn, everything else will disappear.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nAnd simply, if we can't protect them,\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nwe're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nDJ: And in fact, that original thing that we spoke about\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nand designed our lives by --\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nthat conservation was all about respect\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nand celebration --\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nis probably true. That's really what it needs.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nWe need it. We respect and celebrate each other\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nas a man and a woman, as a community\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nand as part of this planet,\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nand we need to continue that.\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nAnd Legadema?\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nWell we can report, in fact,\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nthat we're grandparents.\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nBJ/DJ: Thank you very much.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:09.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why we have too few women leaders", "duration": "898", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/sheryl_sandberg_why_we_have_too_few_women_leaders", "transcript": "So for any of us in this room today, let's start out by admitting we're lucky. We don't live in the world our mothers lived in, our grandmothers lived in, where career choices for women were so limited. And if you're in this room today, most of us grew up in a world where we have basic civil rights, and amazingly, we still live in a world where some women don't have them. But all that aside, we still have a problem, and it's a real problem. And the problem is this: Women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world. The numbers tell the story quite clearly. 190 heads of state \u2014 nine are women. Of all the people in parliament in the world, 13 percent are women. In the corporate sector, women at the top, C-level jobs, board seats \u2014 tops out at 15, 16 percent. The numbers have not moved since 2002 and are going in the wrong direction. And even in the non-profit world, a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women, women at the top: 20 percent.We also have another problem, which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment. A recent study in the U.S. showed that, of married senior managers, two-thirds of the married men had children and only one-third of the married women had children. A couple of years ago, I was in New York, and I was pitching a deal, and I was in one of those fancy New York private equity offices you can picture. And I'm in the meeting \u2014 it's about a three-hour meeting \u2014 and two hours in, there needs to be that bio break, and everyone stands up, and the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarrassed. And I realized he doesn't know where the women's room is in his office. So I start looking around for moving boxes, figuring they just moved in, but I don't see any. And so I said, \"Did you just move into this office?\" And he said, \"No, we've been here about a year.\" And I said, \"Are you telling me that I am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year?\" And he looked at me, and he said, \"Yeah. Or maybe you're the only one who had to go to the bathroom.\"(Laughter)So the question is, how are we going to fix this? How do we change these numbers at the top? How do we make this different? I want to start out by saying, I talk about this \u2014 about keeping women in the workforce \u2014 because I really think that's the answer. In the high-income part of our workforce, in the people who end up at the top \u2014 Fortune 500 CEO jobs, or the equivalent in other industries \u2014 the problem, I am convinced, is that women are dropping out. Now people talk about this a lot, and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring and programs companies should have to train women. I want to talk about none of that today, even though that's all really important. Today I want to focus on what we can do as individuals. What are the messages we need to tell ourselves? What are the messages we tell the women that work with and for us? What are the messages we tell our daughters?Now, at the outset, I want to be very clear that this speech comes with no judgments. I don't have the right answer. I don't even have it for myself. I left San Francisco, where I live, on Monday, and I was getting on the plane for this conference. And my daughter, who's three, when I dropped her off at preschool, did that whole hugging-the-leg, crying, \"Mommy, don't get on the plane\" thing. This is hard. I feel guilty sometimes. I know no women, whether they're at home or whether they're in the workforce, who don't feel that sometimes. So I'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone.My talk today is about what the messages are if you do want to stay in the workforce, and I think there are three. One, sit at the table. Two, make your partner a real partner. And three, don't leave before you leave. Number one: sit at the table. Just a couple weeks ago at Facebook, we hosted a very senior government official, and he came in to meet with senior execs from around Silicon Valley. And everyone kind of sat at the table. He had these two women who were traveling with him pretty senior in his department, and I kind of said to them, \"Sit at the table. Come on, sit at the table,\" and they sat on the side of the room. When I was in college, my senior year, I took a course called European Intellectual History. Don't you love that kind of thing from college? I wish I could do that now. And I took it with my roommate, Carrie, who was then a brilliant literary student \u2014 and went on to be a brilliant literary scholar \u2014 and my brother \u2014 smart guy, but a water-polo-playing pre-med, who was a sophomore.The three of us take this class together. And then Carrie reads all the books in the original Greek and Latin, goes to all the lectures. I read all the books in English and go to most of the lectures. My brother is kind of busy. He reads one book of 12 and goes to a couple of lectures, marches himself up to our room a couple days before the exam to get himself tutored. The three of us go to the exam together, and we sit down. And we sit there for three hours \u2014 and our little blue notebooks \u2014 yes, I'm that old. We walk out, we look at each other, and we say, \"How did you do?\" And Carrie says, \"Boy, I feel like I didn't really draw out the main point on the Hegelian dialectic.\" And I say, \"God, I really wish I had really connected John Locke's theory of property with the philosophers that follow.\" And my brother says, \"I got the top grade in the class.\"(Laughter)\"You got the top grade in the class? You don't know anything.\"(Laughter)The problem with these stories is that they show what the data shows: women systematically underestimate their own abilities. If you test men and women, and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like GPAs, men get it wrong slightly high, and women get it wrong slightly low. Women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce. A study in the last two years of people entering the workforce out of college showed that 57 percent of boys entering, or men, I guess, are negotiating their first salary, and only seven percent of women. And most importantly, men attribute their success to themselves, and women attribute it to other external factors. If you ask men why they did a good job, they'll say, \"I'm awesome. Obviously. Why are you even asking?\" If you ask women why they did a good job, what they'll say is someone helped them, they got lucky, they worked really hard. Why does this matter? Boy, it matters a lot. Because no one gets to the corner office by sitting on the side, not at the table, and no one gets the promotion if they don't think they deserve their success, or they don't even understand their own success.I wish the answer were easy. I wish I could go tell all the young women I work for, these fabulous women, \"Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself. Own your own success.\" I wish I could tell that to my daughter. But it's not that simple. Because what the data shows, above all else, is one thing, which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women. And everyone's nodding, because we all know this to be true.There's a really good study that shows this really well. There's a famous Harvard Business School study on a woman named Heidi Roizen. And she's an operator in a company in Silicon Valley, and she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture capitalist. In 2002 \u2014 not so long ago \u2014 a professor who was then at Columbia University took that case and made it [Howard] Roizen. And he gave the case out, both of them, to two groups of students. He changed exactly one word: \"Heidi\" to \"Howard.\" But that one word made a really big difference. He then surveyed the students, and the good news was the students, both men and women, thought Heidi and Howard were equally competent, and that's good. The bad news was that everyone liked Howard. He's a great guy. You want to work for him. You want to spend the day fishing with him. But Heidi? Not so sure. She's a little out for herself. She's a little political. You're not sure you'd want to work for her. This is the complication. We have to tell our daughters and our colleagues, we have to tell ourselves to believe we got the A, to reach for the promotion, to sit at the table, and we have to do it in a world where, for them, there are sacrifices they will make for that, even though for their brothers, there are not.The saddest thing about all of this is that it's really hard to remember this. And I'm about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me, but I think important. I gave this talk at Facebook not so long ago to about 100 employees, and a couple hours later, there was a young woman who works there sitting outside my little desk, and she wanted to talk to me. I said, okay, and she sat down, and we talked. And she said, \"I learned something today. I learned that I need to keep my hand up.\" \"What do you mean?\" She said, \"You're giving this talk, and you said you would take two more questions. I had my hand up with many other people, and you took two more questions. I put my hand down, and I noticed all the women did the same, and then you took more questions, only from the men.\" And I thought to myself, \"Wow, if it's me \u2014 who cares about this, obviously \u2014 giving this talk \u2014 and during this talk, I can't even notice that the men's hands are still raised, and the women's hands are still raised, how good are we as managers of our companies and our organizations at seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities more than women?\" We've got to get women to sit at the table.(Cheers)(Applause)Message number two: Make your partner a real partner. I've become convinced that we've made more progress in the workforce than we have in the home. The data shows this very clearly. If a woman and a man work full-time and have a child, the woman does twice the amount of housework the man does, and the woman does three times the amount of childcare the man does. So she's got three jobs or two jobs, and he's got one. Who do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more? The causes of this are really complicated, and I don't have time to go into them. And I don't think Sunday football-watching and general laziness is the cause.I think the cause is more complicated. I think, as a society, we put more pressure on our boys to succeed than we do on our girls. I know men that stay home and work in the home to support wives with careers, and it's hard. When I go to the Mommy-and-Me stuff and I see the father there, I notice that the other mommies don't play with him. And that's a problem, because we have to make it as important a job, because it's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home, for people of both genders, if we're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce.(Applause)Studies show that households with equal earning and equal responsibility also have half the divorce rate. And if that wasn't good enough motivation for everyone out there, they also have more \u2014 how shall I say this on this stage? They know each other more in the biblical sense as well.(Cheers)Message number three: Don't leave before you leave. I think there's a really deep irony to the fact that actions women are taking \u2014 and I see this all the time \u2014 with the objective of staying in the workforce actually lead to their eventually leaving. Here's what happens: We're all busy. Everyone's busy. A woman's busy. And she starts thinking about having a child, and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child, she starts thinking about making room for that child. \"How am I going to fit this into everything else I'm doing?\" And literally from that moment, she doesn't raise her hand anymore, she doesn't look for a promotion, she doesn't take on the new project, she doesn't say, \"Me. I want to do that.\" She starts leaning back. The problem is that \u2014 let's say she got pregnant that day, that day \u2014 nine months of pregnancy, three months of maternity leave, six months to catch your breath \u2014 Fast-forward two years, more often \u2014 and as I've seen it \u2014 women start thinking about this way earlier \u2014 when they get engaged, or married, when they start thinking about having a child, which can take a long time. One woman came to see me about this. She looked a little young. And I said, \"So are you and your husband thinking about having a baby?\" And she said, \"Oh no, I'm not married.\" She didn't even have a boyfriend.(Laughter)I said, \"You're thinking about this just way too early.\"But the point is that what happens once you start kind of quietly leaning back? Everyone who's been through this \u2014 and I'm here to tell you, once you have a child at home, your job better be really good to go back, because it's hard to leave that kid at home. Your job needs to be challenging. It needs to be rewarding. You need to feel like you're making a difference. And if two years ago you didn't take a promotion and some guy next to you did, if three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities, you're going to be bored because you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal. Don't leave before you leave. Stay in. Keep your foot on the gas pedal, until the very day you need to leave to take a break for a child \u2014 and then make your decisions. Don't make decisions too far in advance, particularly ones you're not even conscious you're making.My generation really, sadly, is not going to change the numbers at the top. They're just not moving. We are not going to get to where 50 percent of the population \u2014 in my generation, there will not be 50 percent of [women] at the top of any industry. But I'm hopeful that future generations can. I think a world where half of our countries and our companies were run by women, would be a better world. It's not just because people would know where the women's bathrooms are, even though that would be very helpful. I think it would be a better world. I have two children. I have a five-year-old son and a two-year-old daughter. I want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home, and I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed, but to be liked for her accomplishments.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1040, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:17.299\nSo for any of us in this room today,\nlet's start out by admitting we're lucky.\n\n00:00:17.323 --> 00:00:20.150\nWe don't live in the world\nour mothers lived in,\n\n00:00:20.174 --> 00:00:21.413\nour grandmothers lived in,\n\n00:00:21.437 --> 00:00:23.925\nwhere career choices\nfor women were so limited.\n\n00:00:24.326 --> 00:00:25.934\nAnd if you're in this room today,\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:30.702\nmost of us grew up in a world\nwhere we have basic civil rights,\n\n00:00:30.726 --> 00:00:34.649\nand amazingly, we still live in a world\nwhere some women don't have them.\n\n00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.044\nBut all that aside,\nwe still have a problem,\n\n00:00:38.068 --> 00:00:39.283\nand it's a real problem.\n\n00:00:39.307 --> 00:00:40.934\nAnd the problem is this:\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:45.130\nWomen are not making it\nto the top of any profession\n\n00:00:45.154 --> 00:00:46.526\nanywhere in the world.\n\n00:00:47.052 --> 00:00:49.485\nThe numbers tell the story quite clearly.\n\n00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:52.547\n190 heads of state --\nnine are women.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:55.424\nOf all the people\nin parliament in the world,\n\n00:00:55.448 --> 00:00:57.297\n13 percent are women.\n\n00:00:57.756 --> 00:01:00.600\nIn the corporate sector, women at the top,\n\n00:01:00.624 --> 00:01:02.934\nC-level jobs, board seats --\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.699\ntops out at 15, 16 percent.\n\n00:01:05.723 --> 00:01:08.675\nThe numbers have not moved since 2002\n\n00:01:08.699 --> 00:01:10.648\nand are going in the wrong direction.\n\n00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.302\nAnd even in the non-profit world,\n\n00:01:13.326 --> 00:01:16.598\na world we sometimes think of\nas being led by more women,\n\n00:01:16.622 --> 00:01:18.934\nwomen at the top: 20 percent.\n\n00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.398\nWe also have another problem,\n\n00:01:21.422 --> 00:01:23.812\nwhich is that women face harder choices\n\n00:01:23.836 --> 00:01:26.934\nbetween professional success\nand personal fulfillment.\n\n00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:32.479\nA recent study in the U.S.\nshowed that, of married senior managers,\n\n00:01:32.503 --> 00:01:34.934\ntwo-thirds of the married men had children\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:37.664\nand only one-third\nof the married women had children.\n\n00:01:38.627 --> 00:01:40.637\nA couple of years ago, I was in New York,\n\n00:01:40.661 --> 00:01:42.117\nand I was pitching a deal,\n\n00:01:42.141 --> 00:01:45.492\nand I was in one of those fancy\nNew York private equity offices\n\n00:01:45.516 --> 00:01:46.689\nyou can picture.\n\n00:01:46.713 --> 00:01:49.523\nAnd I'm in the meeting --\nit's about a three-hour meeting --\n\n00:01:49.547 --> 00:01:52.706\nand two hours in,\nthere needs to be that bio break,\n\n00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.537\nand everyone stands up,\n\n00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:57.847\nand the partner running the meeting\nstarts looking really embarrassed.\n\n00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.492\nAnd I realized he doesn't know\nwhere the women's room is in his office.\n\n00:02:02.516 --> 00:02:05.059\nSo I start looking\naround for moving boxes,\n\n00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:07.369\nfiguring they just moved in,\nbut I don't see any.\n\n00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:10.337\nAnd so I said, \"Did you just\nmove into this office?\"\n\n00:02:10.718 --> 00:02:12.957\nAnd he said, \"No,\nwe've been here about a year.\"\n\n00:02:13.587 --> 00:02:17.688\nAnd I said, \"Are you telling me\nthat I am the only woman\n\n00:02:17.712 --> 00:02:20.494\nto have pitched a deal\nin this office in a year?\"\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.544\nAnd he looked at me, and he said,\n\n00:02:22.568 --> 00:02:26.149\n\"Yeah.

I feel guilty sometimes.\n\n00:03:47.405 --> 00:03:48.934\nI know no women,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.768\nwhether they're at home\nor whether they're in the workforce,\n\n00:03:51.792 --> 00:03:53.331\nwho don't feel that sometimes.\n\n00:03:53.355 --> 00:03:55.934\nSo I'm not saying\nthat staying in the workforce\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.783\nis the right thing for everyone.\n\n00:03:58.286 --> 00:04:00.934\nMy talk today is about\nwhat the messages are\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.315\nif you do want to stay in the workforce,\n\n00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:04.934\nand I think there are three.\n\n00:04:05.473 --> 00:04:07.461\nOne, sit at the table.\n\n00:04:07.862 --> 00:04:10.272\nTwo, make your partner a real partner.\n\n00:04:11.164 --> 00:04:14.934\nAnd three, don't leave before you leave.\n\n00:04:15.754 --> 00:04:17.216\nNumber one: sit at the table.\n\n00:04:17.812 --> 00:04:19.637\nJust a couple weeks ago at Facebook,\n\n00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:21.934\nwe hosted a very senior\ngovernment official,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.179\nand he came in to meet with senior execs\n\n00:04:25.203 --> 00:04:26.804\nfrom around Silicon Valley.\n\n00:04:27.312 --> 00:04:29.494\nAnd everyone kind of sat at the table.\n\n00:04:29.518 --> 00:04:32.090\nHe had these two women\nwho were traveling with him\n\n00:04:32.114 --> 00:04:33.934\npretty senior in his department,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.244\nand I kind of said to them,\n\n00:04:35.268 --> 00:04:37.482\n\"Sit at the table.\nCome on, sit at the table,\"\n\n00:04:37.506 --> 00:04:39.269\nand they sat on the side of the room.\n\n00:04:40.491 --> 00:04:42.443\nWhen I was in college, my senior year,\n\n00:04:42.467 --> 00:04:44.966\nI took a course called\nEuropean Intellectual History.\n\n00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.197\nDon't you love that kind\nof thing from college?\n\n00:04:47.221 --> 00:04:48.934\nI wish I could do that now.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.934\nAnd I took it with my roommate, Carrie,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.498\nwho was then a brilliant\nliterary student --\n\n00:04:53.522 --> 00:04:55.832\nand went on to be a brilliant\nliterary scholar --\n\n00:04:55.856 --> 00:04:57.873\nand my brother -- smart guy,\n\n00:04:57.897 --> 00:04:59.512\nbut a water-polo-playing pre-med,\n\n00:04:59.536 --> 00:05:00.934\nwho was a sophomore.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.934\nThe three of us take this class together.\n\n00:05:03.516 --> 00:05:07.692\nAnd then Carrie reads all the books\nin the original Greek and Latin,\n\n00:05:07.716 --> 00:05:09.408\ngoes to all the lectures.\n\n00:05:09.432 --> 00:05:11.482\nI read all the books in English\n\n00:05:11.506 --> 00:05:13.163\nand go to most of the lectures.\n\n00:05:13.187 --> 00:05:14.934\nMy brother is kind of busy.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.670\nHe reads one book of 12\nand goes to a couple of lectures,\n\n00:05:18.694 --> 00:05:21.741\nmarches himself up to our room\n\n00:05:21.765 --> 00:05:24.242\na couple days before the exam\nto get himself tutored.\n\n00:05:24.815 --> 00:05:27.496\nThe three of us go to the exam\ntogether, and we sit down.\n\n00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.679\nAnd we sit there for three hours --\n\n00:05:29.703 --> 00:05:32.084\nand our little blue notebooks\n-- yes, I'm that old.\n\n00:05:32.108 --> 00:05:35.323\nWe walk out, we look at each other,\nand we say, \"How did you do?\"\n\n00:05:35.347 --> 00:05:38.824\nAnd Carrie says, \"Boy, I feel like\nI didn't really draw out the main point\n\n00:05:38.848 --> 00:05:40.423\non the Hegelian dialectic.\"\n\n00:05:40.447 --> 00:05:43.372\nAnd I say, \"God, I really\nwish I had really connected\n\n00:05:43.396 --> 00:05:46.611\nJohn Locke's theory of property\nwith the philosophers that follow.\"\n\n00:05:46.635 --> 00:05:48.139\nAnd my brother says,\n\n00:05:48.163 --> 00:05:50.078\n\"I got the top grade in the class.\"\n\n00:05:50.102 --> 00:05:52.047\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:52.071 --> 00:05:54.167\n\"You got the top grade in the class?\n\n00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:55.741\nYou don't know

00:06:05.251\nwomen systematically\nunderestimate their own abilities.\n\n00:06:05.275 --> 00:06:06.934\nIf you test men and women,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:10.552\nand you ask them questions\non totally objective criteria like GPAs,\n\n00:06:10.576 --> 00:06:12.440\nmen get it wrong slightly high,\n\n00:06:12.464 --> 00:06:14.551\nand women get it wrong slightly low.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.934\nWomen do not negotiate\nfor themselves in the workforce.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.934\nA study in the last two years\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.575\nof people entering\nthe

themselves,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.612\nand women attribute it\nto other external factors.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.331\nIf you ask men why they did a good job,\n\n00:06:42.355 -->

Why are you even asking?\"\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.934\nIf you ask women why they did a good job,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.934\nwhat they'll say is someone helped them,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.934\nthey got lucky, they worked really hard.\n\n00:06:54.604 --> 00:06:55.934\nWhy does this matter?\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.934\nBoy, it matters a lot.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.934\nBecause no one gets to the corner office\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.512\nby sitting on the side, not at the table,\n\n00:07:03.536 --> 00:07:05.539\nand no one gets the promotion\n\n00:07:05.563 --> 00:07:08.118\nif they don't think\nthey deserve their success,\n\n00:07:08.142 --> 00:07:10.934\nor they don't even understand\ntheir own success.\n\n00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.574\nI wish the answer were easy.\n\n00:07:13.598 --> 00:07:16.210\nI wish I could go tell\nall the young women I work for,\n\n00:07:16.234 --> 00:07:17.248\nthese fabulous women,\n\n00:07:17.272 --> 00:07:19.522\n\"Believe in yourself\nand negotiate for yourself.\n\n00:07:19.546 --> 00:07:20.934\nOwn your own success.\"\n\n00:07:21.324 --> 00:07:23.360\nI wish I could tell that to my daughter.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.563\nBut it's not that simple.\n\n00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.438\nBecause what the data shows,\nabove all else, is one thing,\n\n00:07:29.462 --> 00:07:33.763\nwhich is that success and likeability\nare positively correlated for men\n\n00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:35.773\nand negatively correlated for women.\n\n00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:39.813\nAnd everyone's nodding,\nbecause we all know this to be true.\n\n00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.934\nThere's a really good study\nthat shows this really well.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.149\nThere's a famous Harvard\nBusiness School study\n\n00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:46.806\non a woman named Heidi Roizen.\n\n00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:51.234\nAnd she's an operator\nin a company in Silicon Valley,\n\n00:07:51.258 --> 00:07:52.934\nand she uses her contacts\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.494\nto become a very successful\nventure capitalist.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.934\nIn 2002 -- not so long ago --\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.197\na professor who was then\nat Columbia University\n\n00:08:00.221 --> 00:08:02.604\ntook that case\nand made it [Howard] Roizen.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:06.461\nAnd he gave the case out, both of them,\nto two groups of students.\n\n00:08:06.485 --> 00:08:09.417\nHe changed exactly one word:\n\n00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:10.934\n\"Heidi\" to \"Howard.\"\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.934\nBut that one word made\na really big difference.\n\n00:08:14.505 --> 00:08:16.136\nHe then surveyed the students,\n\n00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.826\nand the good news was the students,\nboth men and women,\n\n00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.244\nthought Heidi and Howard\nwere equally competent,\n\n00:08:21.268 --> 00:08:22.546\nand that's good.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.641\nThe bad news was\nthat everyone liked Howard.\n\n00:08:25.665 --> 00:08:27.665\nHe's a great guy.\nYou want to work for him.\n\n00:08:27.689 --> 00:08:29.689\nYou want to spend the day\nfishing with him.\n\n00:08:29.713 --> 00:08:31.275\nBut Heidi? Not so sure.\n\n00:08:31.299 --> 00:08:34.164\nShe's a little out for herself.\nShe's a little political.\n\n00:08:34.188 --> 00:08:36.235\nYou're not sure\nyou'd want to work for her.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.583\nThis is the complication.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.268\nWe have to tell our daughters\nand our colleagues,\n\n00:08:41.292 --> 00:08:43.976\nwe have to tell ourselves\nto believe we got the A,\n\n00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.934\nto reach for the promotion,\nto sit at the table,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.737\nand we have to do it in a world\n\n00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:52.356\nwhere, for them, there are sacrifices\nthey will make for that,\n\n00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.667\neven though for their brothers,\nthere are not.\n\n00:08:55.775 --> 00:08:59.442\nThe saddest thing about all of this\nis that it's really hard to remember this.\n\n00:08:59.466 --> 00:09:02.514\nAnd I'm about to tell a story\nwhich is truly embarrassing for me,\n\n00:09:02.538 --> 00:09:03.845\nbut I think important.\n\n00:09:04.228 --> 00:09:07.425\nI gave this talk at Facebook\nnot so long ago\n\n00:09:07.449 --> 00:09:09.938\nto about 100 employees,\n\n00:09:09.962 --> 00:09:13.010\nand a couple hours later,\nthere was a young woman who works there\n\n00:09:13.034 --> 00:09:16.373\nsitting outside my little desk,\nand she wanted to talk to me.\n\n00:09:16.397 --> 00:09:18.540\nI said, okay, and she sat down,\nand we talked.\n\n00:09:18.564 --> 00:09:20.517\nAnd she said, \"I learned something today.\n\n00:09:20.541 --> 00:09:22.596\nI learned that I need to keep my hand up.\"\n\n00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:23.969\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n00:09:23.993 --> 00:09:25.787\nShe said, \"You're giving this talk,\n\n00:09:25.811 --> 00:09:28.108\nand you said you would take\ntwo more questions.\n\n00:09:28.132 --> 00:09:30.212\nI had my hand up with many other people,\n\n00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:31.831\nand you took two more questions.\n\n00:09:31.855 --> 00:09:34.765\nI put my hand down, and I noticed\nall the women did the same,\n\n00:09:34.789 --> 00:09:36.718\nand then you took more questions,\n\n00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:37.934\nonly from the men.\"\n\n00:09:39.114 --> 00:09:40.405\nAnd I thought to myself,\n\n00:09:40.429 --> 00:09:43.234\n\"Wow, if it's me -- who cares\nabout this, obviously --\n\n00:09:43.258 --> 00:09:45.192\ngiving this talk --\n\n00:09:45.216 --> 00:09:50.934\nand during this talk, I can't even notice\nthat the men's hands are still raised,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.934\nand the women's hands are still raised,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.136\nhow good are we\n\n00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.864\nas managers of our companies\nand our organizations\n\n00:09:56.888 --> 00:09:59.413\nat seeing that the

partner.\n\n00:10:11.164 --> 00:10:14.355\nI've become convinced that we've made\nmore progress in the workforce\n\n00:10:14.379 --> 00:10:15.934\nthan we have in the home.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.169\nThe data shows this very clearly.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:23.137\nIf a woman and a man\nwork full-time and have a child,\n\n00:10:23.161 --> 00:10:26.514\nthe woman does twice the amount\nof housework the man does,\n\n00:10:26.538 --> 00:10:30.934\nand the woman does three times\nthe amount of childcare the man does.\n\n00:10:31.405 --> 00:10:35.155\nSo she's got three jobs\nor two jobs, and he's got one.\n\n00:10:35.179 --> 00:10:38.206\nWho do you think drops out\nwhen someone needs to be home more?\n\n00:10:38.772 --> 00:10:42.582\nThe causes of this are really complicated,\nand I don't have time to go into them.\n\n00:10:42.606 --> 00:10:46.542\nAnd I don't think Sunday football-watching\nand general laziness is the cause.\n\n00:10:46.566 --> 00:10:48.780\nI think the cause is more complicated.\n\n00:10:48.804 --> 00:10:50.293\nI think, as a society,\n\n00:10:50.317 --> 00:10:52.534\nwe put more pressure\non our boys to succeed\n\n00:10:52.558 --> 00:10:53.934\nthan we do on our girls.\n\n00:10:54.412 --> 00:10:56.440\nI know men that stay home\n\n00:10:56.464 --> 00:10:59.531\nand work in the home\nto support wives with careers,\n\n00:10:59.555 --> 00:11:00.582\nand it's hard.\n\n00:11:00.606 --> 00:11:03.934\nWhen I go to the Mommy-and-Me stuff\nand I see the father there,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.477\nI notice that the other mommies\ndon't play with him.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.934\nAnd that's a problem,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:13.144\nbecause we have to make it\nas important a job,\n\n00:11:13.168 --> 00:11:16.547\nbecause it's the hardest job\nin the world to work inside the home,\n\n00:11:16.571 --> 00:11:18.051\nfor people of both genders,\n\n00:11:18.075 --> 00:11:21.569\nif we're going to even things out and let\nwomen stay in the workforce.\n\n00:11:21.593 --> 00:11:22.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.197\nStudies show that households\nwith equal earning\n\n00:11:25.221 --> 00:11:27.163\nand equal responsibility\n\n00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:29.348\nalso have half the divorce rate.\n\n00:11:29.372 --> 00:11:32.556\nAnd if that wasn't good enough motivation\nfor everyone out there,\n\n00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.393\nthey also have more --\n\n00:11:34.417 --> 00:11:36.227\nhow shall I say this on this stage?\n\n00:11:36.251 -->

00:11:44.934\nDon't leave before you leave.\n\n00:11:45.497 --> 00:11:47.240\nI think there's a really deep irony\n\n00:11:47.264 --> 00:11:49.349\nto the fact that actions\nwomen are taking --\n\n00:11:49.373 --> 00:11:50.934\nand I see this all the time --\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:54.084\nwith the objective\nof staying in the workforce\n\n00:11:54.108 --> 00:11:56.673\nactually lead to

The first one is happening right here in Chicago. Brenda Palms-Farber was hired to help ex-convicts reenter society and keep them from going back into prison. Currently, taxpayers spend about 60,000 dollars per year sending a person to jail. We know that two-thirds of them are going to go back. I find it interesting that, for every one dollar we spend, however, on early childhood education, like Head Start, we save 17 dollars on stuff like incarceration in the future. Or \u2014 think about it \u2014 that 60,000 dollars is more than what it costs to send one person to Harvard as well.But Brenda, not being phased by stuff like that, took a look at her challenge and came up with a not-so-obvious solution: create a business that produces skin care products from honey. Okay, it might be obvious to some of you; it wasn't to me. It's the basis of growing a form of social innovation that has real potential. She hired seemingly unemployable men and women to care for the bees, harvest the honey and make value-added products that they marketed themselves, and that were later sold at Whole Foods. She combined employment experience and training with life skills they needed, like anger-management and teamwork, and also how to talk to future employers about how their experiences actually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned and their eagerness to learn more. Less than four percent of the folks that went through her program actually go back to jail. So these young men and women learned job-readiness and life skills through bee keeping and became productive citizens in the process. Talk about a sweet beginning.Now, I'm going to take you to Los Angeles, and lots of people know that L.A. has its issues. But I'm going to talk about L.A.'s water issues right now. They have not enough water on most days and too much to handle when it rains. Currently, 20 percent of California's energy consumption is used to pump water into mostly Southern California. Their spending loads, loads, to channel that rainwater out into the ocean when it rains and floods as well. Now Andy Lipkis is working to help L.A. cut infrastructure costs associated with water management and urban heat island \u2014 linking trees, people and technology to create a more livable city. All that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water, also helps cool our cities. Because, come to think about it, do you really want air-conditioning, or is it a cooler room that you want? How you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference.So a few years ago, L.A. County decided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars to repair the city schools. And Andy and his team discovered that they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars on asphalt to surround the schools themselves. And by presenting a really strong economic case, they convinced the L.A. government that replacing that asphalt with trees and other greenery, that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy than they spend on horticultural infrastructure. So ultimately, 20 million square feet of asphalt was replaced or avoided, and electrical consumption for air-conditioning went down, while employment for people to maintain those grounds went up, resulting in a net-savings to the system, but also healthier students and schools system employees as well.Now Judy Bonds is a coal miner's daughter. Her family has eight generations in a town called Whitesville, West Virginia. And if anyone should be clinging to the former glory of the coal mining history, and of the town, it should be Judy. But the way coal is mined right now is different from the deep mines that her father and her father's father would go down into and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people. Now, two dozen men can tear down a mountain in several months, and only for about a few years' worth of coal. That kind of technology is called \"mountaintop removal.\" It can make a mountain go from this to this in a few short months. Just imagine that the air surrounding these places \u2014 it's filled with the residue of explosives and coal. When we visited, it gave some of the people we were with this strange little cough after being only there for just a few hours or so \u2014 not just miners, but everybody.And Judy saw her landscape being destroyed and her water poisoned. And the coal companies just move on after the mountain was emptied, leaving even more unemployment in their wake. But she also saw the difference in potential wind energy on an intact mountain, and one that was reduced in elevation by over 2,000 feet. Three years of dirty energy with not many jobs, or centuries of clean energy with the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency based on technical skills, and developing local knowledge about how to get the most out of that region's wind. She calculated the up-front cost and the payback over time, and it's a net-plus on so many levels for the local, national and global economy. It's a longer payback than mountaintop removal, but the wind energy actually pays back forever. Now mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals, and it gives them a lot of misery. The water is turned into goo. Most people are still unemployed, leading to most of the same kinds of social problems that unemployed people in inner cities also experience \u2014 drug and alcohol abuse, domestic abuse, teen pregnancy and poor heath, as well.Now Judy and I \u2014 I have to say \u2014 totally related to each other. Not quite an obvious alliance. I mean, literally, her hometown is called Whitesville, West Virginia. I mean, they are not \u2014 they ain't competing for the birthplace of hip hop title or anything like that. But the back of my T-shirt, the one that she gave me, says, \"Save the endangered hillbillies.\" So homegirls and hillbillies we got it together and totally understand that this is what it's all about. But just a few months ago, Judy was diagnosed with stage-three lung cancer. Yeah. And it has since moved to her bones and her brain. And I just find it so bizarre that she's suffering from the same thing that she tried so hard to protect people from. But her dream of Coal River Mountain Wind is her legacy. And she might not get to see that mountaintop. But rather than writing yet some kind of manifesto or something, she's leaving behind a business plan to make it happen. That's what my homegirl is doing. So I'm so proud of that.(Applause)But these three people don't know each other, but they do have an awful lot in common. They're all problem solvers, and they're just some of the many examples that I really am privileged to see, meet and learn from in the examples of the work that I do now. I was really lucky to have them all featured on my Corporation for Public Radio radio show called ThePromisedLand.org. Now they're all very practical visionaries. They take a look at the demands that are out there \u2014 beauty products, healthy schools, electricity \u2014 and how the money's flowing to meet those demands. And when the cheapest solutions involve reducing the number of jobs, you're left with unemployed people, and those people aren't cheap. In fact, they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens, and they include generationally impoverished, traumatized vets returning from the Middle East, people coming out of jail. And for the veterans in particular, the V.A. said there's a six-fold increase in mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since 2003. I think that number's probably going to go up. They're not the largest number of people, but they are some of the most expensive \u2014 and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse, drug and alcohol abuse, poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stress. So these three guys all understand how to productively channel dollars through our local economies to meet existing market demands, reduce the social problems that we have now and prevent new problems in the future.And there are plenty of other examples like that. One problem: waste handling and unemployment. Even when we think or talk about recycling, lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills and leaving many municipalities, diversion rates \u2014 they leave much to be recycled. And where is this waste handled? Usually in poor communities. And we know that eco-industrial business, these kinds of business models \u2014 there's a model in Europe called the eco-industrial park, where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another, or you use recycled materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell. We can create these local markets and incentives for recycled materials to be used as raw materials for manufacturing. And in my hometown, we actually tried to do one of these in the Bronx, but our mayor decided what he wanted to see was a jail on that same spot. Fortunately \u2014 because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs \u2014 but after many years, the city wanted to build a jail. They've since abandoned that project, thank goodness.Another problem: unhealthy food systems and unemployment. Working-class and poor urban Americans are not benefiting economically from our current food system. It relies too much on transportation, chemical fertilization, big use of water and also refrigeration. Mega agricultural operations often are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land, and it produces this incredibly unhealthy product that costs us billions in healthcare and lost productivity. And so we know \"urban ag\" is a big buzz topic this time of the year, but it's mostly gardening, which has some value in community building \u2014 lots of it \u2014 but it's not in terms of creating jobs or for food production. The numbers just aren't there. Part of my work now is really laying the groundwork to integrate urban ag and rural food systems to hasten the demise of the 3,000-mile salad by creating a national brand of urban-grown produce in every city, that uses regional growing power and augments it with indoor growing facilities, owned and operated by small growers, where now there are only consumers. This can support seasonal farmers around metro areas who are losing out because they really can't meet the year-round demand for produce. It's not a competition with rural farm; it's actually reinforcements. It allies in a really positive and economically viable food system.The goal is to meet the cities' institutional demands for hospitals, senior centers, schools, daycare centers, and produce a network of regional jobs, as well. This is smart infrastructure. And how we manage our built environment affects the health and well-being of people every single day. Our municipalities, rural and urban, play the operational course of infrastructure \u2014 things like waste disposal, energy demand, as well as social costs of unemployment, drop-out rates, incarceration rates and the impacts of various public health costs. Smart infrastructure can provide cost-saving ways for municipalities to handle both infrastructure and social needs. And we want to shift the systems that open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens to become part of the tax base. And imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability. So I'm hoping you can see a little theme here.These examples indicate a trend. I haven't created it, and it's not happening by accident. I'm noticing that it's happening all over the country, and the good news is that it's growing. And we all need to be invested in it. It is an essential pillar to this country's recovery. And I call it \"hometown security.\" The recession has us reeling and fearful, and there's something in the air these days that is also very empowering. It's a realization that we are the key to our own recovery. Now is the time for us to act in our own communities where we think local and we act local. And when we do that, our neighbors \u2014 be they next-door, or in the next state, or in the next country \u2014 will be just fine. The sum of the local is the global. Hometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses, putting people to work, restoring our natural systems. Hometown security means creating wealth here at home, instead of destroying it overseas. Tackling social and environmental problems at the same time with the same solution yields great cost savings, wealth generation and national security. Many great and inspiring solutions have been generated across America. The challenge for us now is to identify and support countless more.Now, hometown security is about taking care of your own, but it's not like the old saying, \"charity begins at home.\" I recently read a book called \"Love Leadership\" by John Hope Bryant. And it's about leading in a world that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear. And reading that book made me reexamine that theory because I need to explain what I mean by that. See, my dad was a great, great man in many ways. He grew up in the segregated South, escaped lynching and all that during some really hard times, and he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times. But, like all of us, he had some problems. (Laughter) And his was gambling, compulsively. To him that phrase, \"Charity begins at home,\" meant that my payday \u2014 or someone else's \u2014 would just happen to coincide with his lucky day. So you need to help him out. And sometimes I would loan him money from my after-school or summer jobs, and he always had the great intention of paying me back with interest, of course, after he hit it big. And he did sometimes, believe it or not, at a racetrack in Los Angeles \u2014 one reason to love L.A. \u2014 back in the 1940s. He made 15,000 dollars cash and bought the house that I grew up in. So I'm not that unhappy about that. But listen, I did feel obligated to him, and I grew up \u2014 then I grew up. And I'm a grown woman now, and I have learned a few things along the way.To me, charity often is just about giving, because you're supposed to, or because it's what you've always done, or it's about giving until it hurts. I'm about providing the means to build something that will grow and intensify its original investment and not just require greater giving next year \u2014 I'm not trying to feed the habit. I spent some years watching how good intentions for community empowerment, that were supposed to be there to support the community and empower it, actually left people in the same, if not worse, position that they were in before. And over the past 20 years, we've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars on social problems, yet educational outcomes, malnutrition, incarceration, obesity, diabetes, income disparity, they've all gone up with some exceptions \u2014 in particular, infant mortality among people in poverty \u2014 but it's a great world that we're bringing them into as well.And I know a little bit about these issues, because, for many years, I spent a long time in the non-profit industrial complex, and I'm a recovering executive director, two years clean. (Laughter) But during that time, I realized that it was about projects and developing them on the local level that really was going to do the right thing for our communities. But I really did struggle for financial support. The greater our success, the less money came in from foundations. And I tell you, being on the TED stage and winning a MacArthur in the same exact year gave everyone the impression that I had arrived. And by the time I'd moved on, I was actually covering a third of my agency's budget deficit with speaking fees. And I think because early on, frankly, my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time. But since then, the park that was just a dump and was featured at a TED2006 Talk became this little thing. But I did in fact get married in it. Over here. There goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding. The South Bronx Greenway was also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006. Since then, we got about 50 million dollars in stimulus package money to come and get here. And we love this, because I love construction now, because we're watching these things actually happen.So I want everyone to understand the critical importance of shifting charity into enterprise. I started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people. Hometown security is next on my to-do list. What we need are people who see the value in investing in these types of local enterprises, who will partner with folks like me to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation as well as understand the growing social costs of business as usual. We need to work together to embrace and repair our land, repair our power systems and repair ourselves. It's time to stop building the shopping malls, the prisons, the stadiums and other tributes to all of our collective failures. It is time that we start building living monuments to hope and possibility.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1041, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nSo today, I'm going to tell you about some people\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nwho didn't move out of their neighborhoods.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nThe first one is happening right here in Chicago.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nBrenda Palms-Farber was hired\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nto help ex-convicts reenter society\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nand keep them from going back into prison.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nCurrently, taxpayers spend\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nabout 60,000 dollars per year\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nsending a person to jail.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nWe know that two-thirds of them are going to go back.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nI find it interesting that, for every one dollar\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nwe spend, however, on early childhood education,\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nlike Head Start,\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nwe save 17 dollars\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.958\non stuff like incarceration in the future.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nOr -- think about it -- that 60,000 dollars\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nis more than what it costs\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nto send one person to Harvard as well.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nBut Brenda, not being phased by stuff like that,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\ntook a look at her challenge\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nand came up\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nwith a not-so-obvious solution:\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\ncreate a business\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nthat produces skin care products from honey.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nOkay, it might be obvious to some of you; it wasn't to me.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nIt's the basis of growing a form of social innovation\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nthat has real potential.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nShe hired seemingly unemployable men and women\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nto care for the bees, harvest the honey\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nand make value-added products\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nthat they marketed themselves,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nand that were later sold at Whole Foods.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nShe combined employment experience and training\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nwith life skills they needed,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nlike anger-management and teamwork,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nand also how to talk to future employers\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nabout how their experiences\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nactually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nand their eagerness to learn more.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nLess than four percent\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nof the folks that went through her program\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nactually go back to jail.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nSo these young men and women learned job-readiness\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nand life skills through bee keeping\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nand became productive citizens in the process.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nTalk about a sweet beginning.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nNow, I'm going to take you to Los Angeles,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nand lots of people know\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nthat L.A. has its issues.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nBut I'm going to talk about L.A.'s water issues right now.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nThey have not enough water on most days\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nand too much to handle when it rains.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nCurrently, 20 percent\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nof California's energy consumption\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nis used to pump water\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\ninto mostly Southern California.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nTheir spending loads, loads,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nto channel that rainwater out into the ocean\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nwhen it rains and floods as well.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nNow Andy Lipkis is working to help\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nL.A. cut infrastructure costs\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nassociated with water management and urban heat island --\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nlinking trees, people and technology\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nto create a more livable city.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nAll that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nalso helps cool our cities.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nBecause, come to think about it,\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\ndo you really want air-conditioning,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nor is it a cooler room that you want?\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nHow you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nSo a few years ago,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nL.A. County\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\ndecided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nto repair the city schools.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nAnd Andy and his team discovered\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nthat they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\non asphalt to surround the schools themselves.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nAnd by presenting a really strong economic case,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nthey convinced the L.A. government\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nthat replacing that asphalt\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nwith trees and other greenery,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nthat the schools themselves would save the system more on energy\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nthan they spend on horticultural infrastructure.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nSo ultimately, 20 million square feet of asphalt\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nwas replaced or avoided,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nand electrical consumption for air-conditioning went down,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nwhile employment\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nfor people to maintain those grounds went up,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nresulting in a net-savings to the system,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nbut also healthier students and schools system employees as well.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nNow Judy Bonds\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nis a coal miner's daughter.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nHer family has eight generations\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nin a town called Whitesville, West Virginia.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nAnd if anyone should be clinging\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nto the former glory of the coal mining history,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nand of the town,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nit should be Judy.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nBut the way coal is mined right now is different\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nfrom the deep mines that her father\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nand her father's father would go down into\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nand that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nNow, two dozen men\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\ncan tear down a mountain in several months,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nand only for about a few years' worth of coal.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nThat kind of technology is called \"mountaintop removal.\"\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nIt can make a mountain go from this to this\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nin a few short months.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nJust imagine that the air surrounding these places --\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nit's filled with the residue of explosives and coal.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nWhen we visited, it gave some of the people we were with\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nthis strange little cough\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nafter being only there for just a few hours or so --\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nnot just miners, but everybody.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nAnd Judy saw her landscape being destroyed\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nand her water poisoned.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nAnd the coal companies just move on\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nafter the mountain was emptied,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nleaving even more unemployment in their wake.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nBut she also saw the difference in potential wind energy\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\non an intact mountain,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nand one that was reduced in elevation\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nby over 2,000 feet.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nThree years of dirty energy with not many jobs,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nor centuries of clean energy\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nwith the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nbased on technical skills,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nand developing local knowledge\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nabout how to get the most out of that region's wind.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nShe calculated the up-front cost\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nand the payback over time,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nand it's a net-plus on so many levels\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nfor the local, national and global economy.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nIt's a longer payback than mountaintop removal,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nbut the wind energy actually pays back forever.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nNow mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nand it gives them a lot of misery.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nThe water is turned into goo.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nMost people are still unemployed,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nleading to most of the same kinds of social problems\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nthat unemployed people in inner cities also experience --\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\ndrug and alcohol abuse,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\ndomestic abuse, teen pregnancy and poor heath, as well.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nNow Judy and I -- I have to say --\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\ntotally related to each other.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nNot quite an obvious alliance.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nI mean, literally, her hometown is called Whitesville, West Virginia.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nI mean, they are not --\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nthey ain't competing for the birthplace of hip hop title\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nor anything like that.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nBut the back of my T-shirt, the one that she gave me,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nsays, \"Save the endangered hillbillies.\"\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nSo homegirls and hillbillies we got it together\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nand totally understand that this is what it's all about.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nBut just a few months ago,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nJudy was diagnosed\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nwith stage-three lung cancer.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nYeah.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nAnd it has since moved to her bones and her brain.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nAnd I just find it so bizarre\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nthat she's suffering from the same thing\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nthat she tried so hard to protect people from.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nBut her dream\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nof Coal River Mountain Wind\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nis her legacy.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nAnd she might not\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nget to see that mountaintop.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nBut rather than writing\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nyet some kind of manifesto or something,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nshe's leaving behind\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\na business plan to make it happen.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nThat's what my homegirl is doing.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nSo I'm so proud of that.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:06.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nBut these three people\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\ndon't know each other,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nbut they do have an awful lot in common.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nThey're all problem solvers,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nand they're just some of the many examples\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nthat I really am privileged to see, meet and learn from\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nin the examples of the work that I do now.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nI was really lucky to have them all featured\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\non my Corporation for Public Radio radio show\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\ncalled ThePromisedLand.org.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nNow they're all very practical visionaries.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nThey take a look at the demands that are out there --\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nbeauty products, healthy schools, electricity --\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nand how the money's flowing to meet those demands.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nAnd when the cheapest solutions\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\ninvolve reducing the number of jobs,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nyou're left with unemployed people,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nand those people aren't cheap.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nIn fact, they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nand they include generationally impoverished,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\ntraumatized vets returning from the Middle East,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\npeople coming out of jail.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nAnd for the veterans in particular,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nthe V.A. said there's a six-fold increase\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nin mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since 2003.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nI think that number's probably going to go up.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nThey're not the largest number of people,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nbut they are some of the most expensive --\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nand in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse, drug and alcohol abuse,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\npoor performance by their kids in schools\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nand also poor health as a result of stress.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nSo these three guys all understand\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nhow to productively channel dollars\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nthrough our local economies\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nto meet existing market demands,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nreduce the social problems that we have now\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nand prevent new problems in the future.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nAnd there are plenty of other examples like that.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nOne problem: waste handling and unemployment.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nEven when we think or talk about recycling,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nlots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand leaving many municipalities, diversion rates --\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nthey leave much to be recycled.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nAnd where is this waste handled? Usually in poor communities.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nAnd we know that eco-industrial business, these kinds of business models --\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nthere's a model in Europe called the eco-industrial park,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nwhere either the waste of one company is the raw material for another,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nor you use recycled materials\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nto make goods that you can actually use and sell.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nWe can create these local markets and incentives\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nfor recycled materials\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nto be used as raw materials for manufacturing.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nAnd in my hometown, we actually tried to do one of these in the Bronx,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nbut our mayor decided what he wanted to see\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nwas a jail on that same spot.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nFortunately -- because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs --\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nbut after many years,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nthe city wanted to build a jail.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nThey've since abandoned that project, thank goodness.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nAnother problem: unhealthy food systems and unemployment.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nWorking-class and poor urban Americans\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nare not benefiting economically\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nfrom our current food system.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nIt relies too much on transportation,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nchemical fertilization, big use of water\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nand also refrigeration.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nMega agricultural operations\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\noften are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nand it produces this incredibly unhealthy product\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nthat costs us billions in healthcare\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nand lost productivity.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nAnd so we know \"urban ag\"\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nis a big buzz topic this time of the year,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nbut it's mostly gardening,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nwhich has some value in community building -- lots of it --\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nbut it's not in terms of creating jobs\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nor for food production.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nThe numbers just aren't there.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nPart of my work now is really laying the groundwork\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nto integrate urban ag and rural food systems\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nto hasten the demise of the 3,000-mile salad\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nby creating a national brand of urban-grown produce\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nin every city,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nthat uses regional growing power\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nand augments it with indoor growing facilities,\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nowned and operated by small growers,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nwhere now there are only consumers.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nThis can support seasonal farmers around metro areas\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nwho are losing out because they really can't meet\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nthe year-round demand for produce.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nIt's not a competition with rural farm;\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nit's actually reinforcements.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nIt allies in a really positive\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nand economically viable food system.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nThe goal is to meet the cities' institutional demands\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nfor hospitals,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nsenior centers, schools, daycare centers,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nand produce a network of regional jobs, as well.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nThis is smart infrastructure.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nAnd how we manage our built environment\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\naffects the health and well-being of people every single day.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nOur municipalities, rural and urban,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nplay the operational course of infrastructure --\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nthings like waste disposal, energy demand,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nas well as social costs of unemployment, drop-out rates, incarceration rates\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nand the impacts of various public health costs.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nSmart infrastructure can provide cost-saving ways\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nfor municipalities to handle\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nboth infrastructure and social needs.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nAnd we want to shift the systems\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nthat open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nto become part of the tax base.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nAnd imagine a national business model\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nthat creates local jobs and smart infrastructure\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nto improve local economic stability.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nSo I'm hoping you can see a little theme here.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nThese examples indicate a trend.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nI haven't created it, and it's not happening by accident.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nI'm noticing that it's happening all over the country,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nand the good news is that it's growing.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nAnd we all need to be invested in it.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nIt is an essential pillar to this country's recovery.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nAnd I call it \"hometown security.\"\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nThe recession has us reeling and fearful,\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nand there's something in the air these days\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nthat is also very empowering.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nIt's a realization\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nthat we are the key\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nto our own recovery.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nNow is the time for us to act in our own communities\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nwhere we think local and we act local.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nAnd when we do that, our neighbors --\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nbe they next-door, or in the next state,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nor in the next country --\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nwill be just fine.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nThe sum of the local is the global.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nHometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nputting people to work,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nrestoring our natural systems.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nHometown security means creating wealth here at home,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\ninstead of destroying it overseas.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nTackling social and environmental problems\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nat the same time with the same solution\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nyields great cost savings,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nwealth generation and national security.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nMany great and inspiring solutions\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nhave been generated across America.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nThe challenge for us now\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nis to identify and support countless more.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nNow, hometown security is about taking care of your own,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nbut it's not like the old saying,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\n\"charity begins at home.\"\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nI recently read a book called \"Love Leadership\" by John Hope Bryant.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nAnd it's about leading in a world\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nthat really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nAnd reading that book made me reexamine that theory\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nbecause I need to explain what I mean by that.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nSee, my dad\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nwas a great, great man in many ways.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nHe grew up in the segregated South,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nescaped lynching and all that\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nduring some really hard times,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nand he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nand a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nBut, like all of us, he had some problems.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nAnd his was gambling,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\ncompulsively.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nTo him that phrase, \"Charity begins at home,\"\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nmeant that my payday -- or someone else's --\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nwould just happen to coincide with his lucky day.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nSo you need to help him out.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nAnd sometimes I would loan him money\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nfrom my after-school or summer jobs,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nand he always had the great intention\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nof paying me back with interest,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nof course, after he hit it big.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nAnd he did sometimes, believe it or not,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nat a racetrack in Los Angeles --\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\none reason to love L.A. -- back in the 1940s.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nHe made 15,000 dollars cash\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nand bought the house that I grew up in.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nSo I'm not that unhappy about that.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nBut listen, I did feel obligated to him,\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nand I grew up -- then I grew up.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd I'm a grown woman now,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nand I have learned a few things along the way.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nTo me, charity\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\noften is just about giving,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nbecause you're supposed to,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nor because it's what you've always done,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nor it's about giving until it hurts.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nI'm about providing the means\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nto build something that will grow\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nand intensify its original investment\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nand not just require greater giving next year --\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nI'm not trying to feed the habit.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nI spent some years\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nwatching how good intentions for community empowerment,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nthat were supposed to be there\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nto support the community and empower it,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nactually left people\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nin the same, if not worse, position that they were in before.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nAnd over the past 20 years,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nwe've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\non social problems,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nyet educational outcomes,\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nmalnutrition, incarceration,\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nobesity, diabetes, income disparity,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nthey've all gone up with some exceptions --\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nin particular, infant mortality\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\namong people in poverty --\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nbut it's a great world that we're bringing them into as well.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nAnd I know a little bit about these issues,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nbecause, for many years, I spent a long time\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nin the non-profit industrial complex,\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nand I'm a recovering executive director,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\ntwo years clean.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nBut during that time, I realized that it was about projects\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nand developing them on the local level\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nthat really was going to do the right thing for our communities.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nBut I really did struggle for financial support.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nThe greater our success,\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nthe less money came in from foundations.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nAnd I tell you, being on the TED stage\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nand winning a MacArthur in the same exact year\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\ngave everyone the impression that I had arrived.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nAnd by the time I'd moved on,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nI was actually covering a third\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nof my agency's budget deficit with speaking fees.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nAnd I think because early on, frankly,\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nmy programs were just a little bit ahead of their time.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nBut since then,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nthe park that was just a dump and was featured at a TED2006 Talk\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nbecame this little thing.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nBut I did in fact get married in it.\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nOver here.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nThere goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nThe South Bronx Greenway\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nwas also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nSince then, we got\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nabout 50 million dollars in stimulus package money\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nto come and get here.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nAnd we love this, because I love construction now,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nbecause we're watching these things actually happen.\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nSo I want everyone to understand\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nthe critical importance\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nof shifting charity into enterprise.\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nI started my firm to help communities across the country\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nrealize their own potential\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nto improve everything about the quality of life for their people.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nHometown security\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nis next on my to-do list.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nWhat we need are people who see the value\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nin investing in these types of local enterprises,\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nwho will partner with folks like me\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nto identify the growth trends and climate adaptation\n\n00:17:18.958

"https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability", "transcript": "So, I'll start with this: a couple years ago, an event planner called me because I was going to do a speaking event. And she called, and she said, \"I'm really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer.\" And I thought, \"Well, what's the struggle?\" And she said, \"Well, I saw you speak, and I'm going to call you a researcher, I think, but I'm afraid if I call you a researcher, no one will come, because they'll think you're boring and irrelevant.\"(Laughter)And I was like, \"Okay.\" And she said, \"But the thing I liked about your talk is you're a storyteller. So I think what I'll do is just call you a storyteller.\" And of course, the academic, insecure part of me was like, \"You're going to call me a what?\" And she said, \"I'm going to call you a storyteller.\" And I was like, \"Why not 'magic pixie'?\"(Laughter)I was like, \"Let me think about this for a second.\" I tried to call deep on my courage. And I thought, you know, I am a storyteller. I'm a qualitative researcher. I collect stories; that's what I do. And maybe stories are just data with a soul. And maybe I'm just a storyteller. And so I said, \"You know what? Why don't you just say I'm a researcher-storyteller.\" And she went, \"Ha ha. There's no such thing.\"(Laughter)So I'm a researcher-storyteller, and I'm going to talk to you today \u2014 we're talking about expanding perception \u2014 and so I want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that I live and love and work and parent.And this is where my story starts. When I was a young researcher, doctoral student, my first year, I had a research professor who said to us, \"Here's the thing, if you cannot measure it, it does not exist.\" And I thought he was just sweet-talking me. I was like, \"Really?\" and he was like, \"Absolutely.\" And so you have to understand that I have a bachelor's and a master's in social work, and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work, so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the \"life's messy, love it.\" And I'm more of the, \"life's messy, clean it up, organize it and put it into a bento box.\"(Laughter)And so to think that I had found my way, to found a career that takes me \u2014 really, one of the big sayings in social work is, \"Lean into the discomfort of the work.\" And I'm like, knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all A's. That was my mantra. So I was very excited about this. And so I thought, you know what, this is the career for me, because I am interested in some messy topics. But I want to be able to make them not messy. I want to understand them. I want to hack into these things that I know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see.So where I started was with connection. Because, by the time you're a social worker for 10 years, what you realize is that connection is why we're here. It's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives. This is what it's all about. It doesn't matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice, mental health and abuse and neglect, what we know is that connection, the ability to feel connected, is \u2014 neurobiologically that's how we're wired \u2014 it's why we're here.So I thought, you know what, I'm going to start with connection. Well, you know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss, and she tells you 37 things that you do really awesome, and one \"opportunity for growth?\"(Laughter)And all you can think about is that opportunity for growth, right? Well, apparently this is the way my work went as well, because, when you ask people about love, they tell you about heartbreak. When you ask people about belonging, they'll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded. And when you ask people about connection, the stories they told me were about disconnection.So very quickly \u2014 really about six weeks into this research \u2014 I ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that I didn't understand or had never seen. And so I pulled back out of the research and thought, I need to figure out what this is. And it turned out to be shame. And shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection: Is there something about me that, if other people know it or see it, that I won't be worthy of connection?The things I can tell you about it: It's universal; we all have it. The only people who don't experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection. No one wants to talk about it, and the less you talk about it, the more you have it. What underpinned this shame, this \"I'm not good enough,\" \u2014 which, we all know that feeling: \"I'm not blank enough. I'm not thin enough, rich enough, beautiful enough, smart enough, promoted enough.\" The thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability. This idea of, in order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be seen, really seen.And you know how I feel about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability. And so I thought, this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick. I'm going in, I'm going to figure this stuff out, I'm going to spend a year, I'm going to totally deconstruct shame, I'm going to understand how vulnerability works, and I'm going to outsmart it. So I was ready, and I was really excited. As you know, it's not going to turn out well.(Laughter)You know this. So, I could tell you a lot about shame, but I'd have to borrow everyone else's time. But here's what I can tell you that it boils down to \u2014 and this may be one of the most important things that I've ever learned in the decade of doing this research.My one year turned into six years: Thousands of stories, hundreds of long interviews, focus groups. At one point, people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories \u2014 thousands of pieces of data in six years. And I kind of got a handle on it. I kind of understood, this is what shame is, this is how it works. I wrote a book, I published a theory, but something was not okay \u2014 and what it was is that, if I roughly took the people I interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness \u2014 that's what this comes down to, a sense of worthiness \u2014 they have a strong sense of love and belonging \u2014 and folks who struggle for it, and folks who are always wondering if they're good enough.There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it. And that was, the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they're worthy of love and belonging. That's it. They believe they're worthy. And to me, the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we're not worthy of connection, was something that, personally and professionally, I felt like I needed to understand better. So what I did is I took all of the interviews where I saw worthiness, where I saw people living that way, and just looked at those.What do these people have in common? I have a slight office supply addiction, but that's another talk. So I had a manila folder, and I had a Sharpie, and I was like, what am I going to call this research? And the first words that came to my mind were \"whole-hearted.\" These are whole-hearted people, living from this deep sense of worthiness. So I wrote at the top of the manila folder, and I started looking at the data. In fact, I did it first in a four-day, very intensive data analysis, where I went back, pulled the interviews, the stories, pulled the incidents. What's the theme? What's the pattern? My husband left town with the kids because I always go into this Jackson Pollock crazy thing, where I'm just writing and in my researcher mode.And so here's what I found. What they had in common was a sense of courage. And I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute. Courage, the original definition of courage, when it first came into the English language \u2014 it's from the Latin word \"cor,\" meaning \"heart\" \u2014 and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart. And so these folks had, very simply, the courage to be imperfect. They had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others, because, as it turns out, we can't practice compassion with other people if we can't treat ourselves kindly. And the last was they had connection, and \u2014 this was the hard part \u2014 as a result of authenticity, they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were, which you have to absolutely do that for connection.The other thing that they had in common was this: They fully embraced vulnerability. They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful. They didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable, nor did they really talk about it being excruciating \u2014 as I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing. They just talked about it being necessary. They talked about the willingness to say, \"I love you\" first ... the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees ... the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram. They're willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out. They thought this was fundamental.I personally thought it was betrayal. I could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research, where our job \u2014 you know, the definition of research is to control and predict, to study phenomena for the explicit reason to control and predict. And now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting. This led to a little breakdown \u2014(Laughter)\u2014 which actually looked more like this.(Laughter)And it did.I call it a breakdown; my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening.(Laughter)A spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown, but I assure you, it was a breakdown. And I had to put my data away and go find a therapist. Let me tell you something: you know who you are when you call your friends and say, \"I think I need to see somebody. Do you have any recommendations?\" Because about five of my friends were like, \"Wooo, I wouldn't want to be your therapist.\"(Laughter)I was like, \"What does that mean?\" And they're like, \"I'm just saying, you know. Don't bring your measuring stick.\"(Laughter)I was like, \"Okay.\" So I found a therapist. My first meeting with her, Diana \u2014 I brought in my list of the way the whole-hearted live, and I sat down. And she said, \"How are you?\" And I said, \"I'm great. I'm okay.\" She said, \"What's going on?\" And this is a therapist who sees therapists, because we have to go to those, because their B.S. meters are good.(Laughter)And so I said, \"Here's the thing, I'm struggling.\" And she said, \"What's the struggle?\" And I said, \"Well, I have a vulnerability issue. And I know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness, but it appears that it's also the birthplace of joy, of creativity, of belonging, of love. And I think I have a problem, and I need some help.\" And I said, \"But here's the thing: no family stuff, no childhood shit.\"(Laughter)\"I just need some strategies.\"(Laughter)(Applause)Thank you. So she goes like this.(Laughter)And then I said, \"It's bad, right?\" And she said, \"It's neither good nor bad.\"(Laughter)\"It just is what it is.\" And I said, \"Oh my God, this is going to suck.\"(Laughter)And it did, and it didn't. And it took about a year. And you know how there are people that, when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important, that they surrender and walk into it. A: that's not me, and B: I don't even hang out with people like that.(Laughter)For me, it was a yearlong street fight. It was a slugfest. Vulnerability pushed, I pushed back. I lost the fight, but probably won my life back.And so then I went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they, the whole-hearted, what choices they were making, and what we are doing with vulnerability. Why do we struggle with it so much? Am I alone in struggling with vulnerability? No.So this is what I learned. We numb vulnerability \u2014 when we're waiting for the call. It was funny, I sent something out on Twitter and on Facebook that says, \"How would you define vulnerability? What makes you feel vulnerable?\" And within an hour and a half, I had 150 responses. Because I wanted to know what's out there. Having to ask my husband for help because I'm sick, and we're newly married; initiating sex with my husband; initiating sex with my wife; being turned down; asking someone out; waiting for the doctor to call back; getting laid off; laying off people. This is the world we live in. We live in a vulnerable world. And one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability.And I think there's evidence \u2014 and it's not the only reason this evidence exists, but I think it's a huge cause \u2014 We are the most in-debt ... obese ... addicted and medicated adult cohort in U.S. history. The problem is \u2014 and I learned this from the research \u2014 that you cannot selectively numb emotion. You can't say, here's the bad stuff. Here's vulnerability, here's grief, here's shame, here's fear, here's disappointment. I don't want to feel these. I'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin.(Laughter)I don't want to feel these. And I know that's knowing laughter. I hack into your lives for a living. God.(Laughter)You can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects, our emotions. You cannot selectively numb. So when we numb those, we numb joy, we numb gratitude, we numb happiness. And then, we are miserable, and we are looking for purpose and meaning, and then we feel vulnerable, so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. And it becomes this dangerous cycle.One of the things that I think we need to think about is why and how we numb. And it doesn't just have to be addiction. The other thing we do is we make everything that's uncertain certain. Religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty. \"I'm right, you're wrong. Shut up.\" That's it. Just certain. The more afraid we are, the more vulnerable we are, the more afraid we are. This is what politics looks like today. There's no discourse anymore. There's no conversation. There's just blame. You know how blame is described in the research? A way to discharge pain and discomfort. We perfect. If there's anyone who wants their life to look like this, it would be me, but it doesn't work. Because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks.(Laughter)Which just, I hope in 100 years, people will look back and go, \"Wow.\"(Laughter)And we perfect, most dangerously, our children. Let me tell you what we think about children. They're hardwired for struggle when they get here. And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand, our job is not to say, \"Look at her, she's perfect. My job is just to keep her perfect \u2014 make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh.\" That's not our job. Our job is to look and say, \"You know what? You're imperfect, and you're wired for struggle, but you are worthy of love and belonging.\" That's our job. Show me a generation of kids raised like that, and we'll end the problems, I think, that we see today. We pretend that what we do doesn't have an effect on people. We do that in our personal lives. We do that corporate \u2014 whether it's a bailout, an oil spill ... a recall. We pretend like what we're doing doesn't have a huge impact on other people. I would say to companies, this is not our first rodeo, people. We just need you to be authentic and real and say ... \"We're sorry. We'll fix it.\"But there's another way, and I'll leave you with this. This is what I have found: To let ourselves be seen, deeply seen, vulnerably seen ... to love with our whole hearts, even though there's no guarantee \u2014 and that's really hard, and I can tell you as a parent, that's excruciatingly difficult \u2014 to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror, when we're wondering, \"Can I love you this much? Can I believe in this this passionately? Can I be this fierce about this?\" just to be able to stop and, instead of catastrophizing what might happen, to say, \"I'm just so grateful, because to feel this vulnerable means I'm alive.\" And the last, which I think is probably the most important, is to believe that we're enough. Because when we work from a place, I believe, that says, \"I'm enough\" ... then we stop screaming and start listening, we're kinder and gentler to the people around us, and we're kinder and gentler to ourselves.That's all I have. Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1042, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.558 --> 00:00:17.019\nSo, I'll start with this: a couple\nyears ago, an event

parent.\n\n00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:48.923\nAnd this is where my story starts.\n\n00:01:49.688 --> 00:01:52.371\nWhen I was a young researcher,\ndoctoral student,\n\n00:01:52.395 --> 00:01:56.372\nmy first year, I had\na research professor who said to us,\n\n00:01:56.396 --> 00:02:00.342\n\"Here's the thing, if you cannot\nmeasure it, it does not exist.\"\n\n00:02:02.072 --> 00:02:04.664\nAnd I thought he was just\nsweet-talking me.\n\n00:02:05.037 --> 00:02:07.474\nI was like, \"Really?\"\nand he was like, \"Absolutely.\"\n\n00:02:07.498 --> 00:02:09.751\nAnd so you have to understand\n\n00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:12.355\nthat I have a bachelor's\nand a master's in social work,\n\n00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.753\nand I was getting my Ph.D. in social work,\nso my entire academic career\n\n00:02:15.777 --> 00:02:21.394\nwas surrounded by people who kind of\nbelieved in the \"life's messy, love it.\"\n\n00:02:22.172 --> 00:02:27.600\nAnd I'm more of the, \"life's messy,\nclean it up, organize it\n\n00:02:27.624 --> 00:02:29.401\nand put it into a bento box.\"\n\n00:02:29.425 --> 00:02:31.401\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:37.029\nAnd so to think that I had found my way,\nto found a career that takes me --\n\n00:02:37.053 --> 00:02:40.386\nreally, one of the big sayings\nin social work is,\n\n00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.505\n\"Lean into the discomfort of the work.\"\n\n00:02:43.235 --> 00:02:45.767\nAnd I'm like, knock discomfort\nupside the head\n\n00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:48.069\nand move it over and get all A's.\n\n00:02:48.093 --> 00:02:50.005\nThat was my mantra.\n\n00:02:51.688 --> 00:02:53.664\nSo I was very excited about this.\n\n00:02:53.688 --> 00:02:56.664\nAnd so I thought, you know what,\nthis is the career for me,\n\n00:02:56.688 --> 00:02:59.664\nbecause I am interested\nin some messy topics.\n\n00:02:59.688 --> 00:03:02.059\nBut I want to be able\nto make them not messy.\n\n00:03:02.083 --> 00:03:03.405\nI want to understand them.\n\n00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:07.006\nI want to hack into these things\nthat I know are important\n\n00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.006\nand lay the code out for everyone to see.\n\n00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:12.347\nSo where I started was with connection.\n\n00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:15.783\nBecause, by the time\nyou're a social worker for 10 years,\n\n00:03:15.807 --> 00:03:20.514\nwhat you realize is that connection\nis why we're here.\n\n00:03:20.538 --> 00:03:22.918\nIt's what gives purpose\nand meaning to our lives.\n\n00:03:23.774 --> 00:03:25.560\nThis is what it's all about.\n\n00:03:25.584 --> 00:03:27.681\nIt doesn't matter whether\nyou talk to people\n\n00:03:27.705 --> 00:03:30.797\nwho work in social justice,\nmental health and abuse and neglect,\n\n00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:36.162\nwhat we know is that connection,\nthe ability to feel connected, is --\n\n00:03:36.646 --> 00:03:38.664\nneurobiologically\nthat's how we're wired --\n\n00:03:38.688 --> 00:03:40.067\nit's why we're here.\n\n00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:43.104\nSo I thought, you know what,\nI'm going to start with connection.\n\n00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:45.662\nWell, you know that situation\n\n00:03:45.686 --> 00:03:48.194\nwhere you get an evaluation\nfrom your boss,\n\n00:03:48.218 --> 00:03:51.004\nand she tells you 37 things\nthat you do really awesome,\n\n00:03:51.028 --> 00:03:53.402\nand one \"opportunity for growth?\"\n\n00:03:53.426 --> 00:03:55.235\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:55.894 --> 00:03:59.362\nAnd all you can think about\nis that opportunity for growth, right?\n\n00:03:59.386 --> 00:04:02.084\nWell, apparently this is the way\nmy work went as well,\n\n00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:07.085\nbecause, when you ask people about love,\nthey tell you about heartbreak.\n\n00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.743\nWhen you ask people about belonging,\n\n00:04:09.767 --> 00:04:13.719\nthey'll tell you their most excruciating\nexperiences of being excluded.\n\n00:04:13.743 --> 00:04:16.244\nAnd when you ask people about connection,\n\n00:04:16.268 --> 00:04:18.806\nthe stories they told me\nwere about disconnection.\n\n00:04:19.816 --> 00:04:22.841\nSo very quickly -- really about six weeks\ninto this research --\n\n00:04:22.865 --> 00:04:28.887\nI ran into this unnamed thing\nthat absolutely unraveled connection\n\n00:04:28.911 --> 00:04:31.371\nin a way that I didn't understand\nor had never seen.\n\n00:04:31.807 --> 00:04:33.784\nAnd so I pulled back out of the research\n\n00:04:33.808 --> 00:04:36.038\nand thought, I need\nto figure out what this is.\n\n00:04:36.062 --> 00:04:38.241\nAnd it turned out to be shame.\n\n00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.188\nAnd shame is really easily understood\nas the fear of disconnection:\n\n00:04:43.911 --> 00:04:48.467\nIs there something about me that,\nif other people know it or see it,\n\n00:04:48.491 --> 00:04:51.657\nthat I won't be worthy of connection?\n\n00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:53.973\nThe things I can tell you about it:\n\n00:04:53.997 --> 00:04:55.664\nIt's universal; we all have it.\n\n00:04:55.688 --> 00:04:57.688\nThe only people who don't experience shame\n\n00:04:57.712 --> 00:05:00.046\nhave no capacity for human\nempathy or connection.\n\n00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.664\nNo one wants to talk about it,\n\n00:05:01.688 --> 00:05:04.259\nand the less you talk about it,\nthe more you have it.\n\n00:05:05.703 --> 00:05:10.869\nWhat underpinned this shame,\nthis \"I'm not good enough,\" --\n\n00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:12.497\nwhich, we all know that feeling:\n\n00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:14.570\n\"I'm not blank enough.\nI'm not thin enough,\n\n00:05:14.594 --> 00:05:17.848\nrich enough, beautiful enough,\nsmart enough, promoted enough.\"\n\n00:05:17.872 --> 00:05:22.848\nThe thing that underpinned this\nwas excruciating vulnerability.\n\n00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.664\nThis idea of, in order\nfor connection to happen,\n\n00:05:27.688 --> 00:05:31.434\nwe have to allow ourselves\nto be seen, really seen.\n\n00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.957\nAnd you know how I feel\nabout vulnerability. I hate vulnerability.\n\n00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:40.479\nAnd so I thought, this is my chance\nto beat it back with my measuring stick.\n\n00:05:40.503 --> 00:05:43.194\nI'm going in, I'm going\nto figure this stuff out,\n\n00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:46.528\nI'm going to spend a year,\nI'm going to totally deconstruct shame,\n\n00:05:46.552 --> 00:05:48.830\nI'm going to understand\nhow vulnerability works,\n\n00:05:48.854 --> 00:05:50.289\nand I'm going to outsmart it.\n\n00:05:51.338 --> 00:05:53.608\nSo I was ready, and I was really excited.\n\n00:05:56.937 --> 00:05:59.080\nAs you know,\nit's not going to turn out well.\n\n00:05:59.104 --> 00:06:01.617\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:03.235\nYou know this.\n\n00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:05.148\nSo, I could tell you a lot about shame,\n\n00:06:05.172 --> 00:06:07.269\nbut I'd have to borrow\neveryone else's time.\n\n00:06:07.293 --> 00:06:10.150\nBut here's what I can tell you\nthat it boils down to --\n\n00:06:10.174 --> 00:06:13.556\nand this may be one of the most important\nthings that I've ever learned\n\n00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.444\nin the decade of doing this research.\n\n00:06:16.766 --> 00:06:20.958\nMy one year turned into six years:\n\n00:06:20.982 --> 00:06:25.664\nThousands of stories, hundreds\nof long interviews, focus groups.\n\n00:06:25.688 --> 00:06:28.069\nAt one point, people were\nsending me journal pages\n\n00:06:28.093 --> 00:06:29.930\nand sending me their stories --\n\n00:06:29.954 --> 00:06:33.946\nthousands of pieces of data in six years.\n\n00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.664\nAnd I kind of got a handle on it.\n\n00:06:35.688 --> 00:06:38.787\nI kind of understood, this is\nwhat shame is, this is how it works.\n\n00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:46.397\nI wrote a book, I published a theory,\nbut something was not okay --\n\n00:06:46.421 --> 00:06:50.577\nand what it was is that, if I roughly\ntook the people I interviewed\n\n00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:57.173\nand divided them into people who really\nhave a sense of worthiness --\n\n00:06:57.197 --> 00:06:59.959\nthat's what this comes down to,\na sense of worthiness --\n\n00:06:59.983 --> 00:07:03.205\nthey have a strong sense\nof love and belonging --\n\n00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:04.880\nand folks who struggle for it,\n\n00:07:04.904 --> 00:07:08.004\nand folks who are always wondering\nif they're good enough.\n\n00:07:08.028 --> 00:07:10.267\nThere was only one variable that separated\n\n00:07:10.291 --> 00:07:13.031\nthe people who have a strong sense\nof love and belonging\n\n00:07:13.055 --> 00:07:15.314\nand the people who really struggle for it.\n\n00:07:15.338 --> 00:07:19.056\nAnd that was, the people who have\na strong sense of love and belonging\n\n00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.484\nbelieve they're worthy\nof love and belonging.\n\n00:07:22.402 --> 00:07:23.552\nThat's it.\n\n00:07:24.203 --> 00:07:25.691\nThey believe they're worthy.\n\n00:07:27.434 --> 00:07:33.252\nAnd to me, the hard part of the one thing\nthat keeps us out of connection\n\n00:07:33.276 --> 00:07:36.491\nis our fear that we're not\nworthy of connection,\n\n00:07:36.515 --> 00:07:38.918\nwas something that,\npersonally and professionally,\n\n00:07:38.942 --> 00:07:41.164\nI felt like I needed to understand better.\n\n00:07:41.505 --> 00:07:46.482\nSo what I did is I took\nall of the interviews\n\n00:07:46.506 --> 00:07:49.324\nwhere I saw worthiness,\nwhere I saw people living that way,\n\n00:07:49.348 --> 00:07:51.236\nand just looked at those.\n\n00:07:52.012 --> 00:07:54.060\nWhat do these people have in common?\n\n00:07:54.084 --> 00:07:58.727\nI have a slight office supply addiction,\nbut that's another talk.\n\n00:07:58.751 --> 00:08:02.228\nSo I had a manila folder,\nand I had a Sharpie,\n\n00:08:02.252 --> 00:08:04.872\nand I was like, what am I going\nto call this research?\n\n00:08:04.896 --> 00:08:07.886\nAnd the first words that came\nto my mind were \"whole-hearted.\"\n\n00:08:08.505 --> 00:08:12.021\nThese are whole-hearted people,\nliving from this deep sense of worthiness.\n\n00:08:12.045 --> 00:08:14.901\nSo I wrote at the top\nof the manila folder,\n\n00:08:14.925 --> 00:08:16.854\nand I started looking at the data.\n\n00:08:16.878 --> 00:08:22.871\nIn fact, I did it first in a four-day,\nvery intensive data analysis,\n\n00:08:22.895 --> 00:08:26.472\nwhere I went back, pulled the interviews,\nthe stories, pulled the incidents.\n\n00:08:26.496 --> 00:08:28.275\nWhat's the theme? What's the pattern?\n\n00:08:29.068 --> 00:08:32.045\nMy husband left town with the kids\n\n00:08:32.069 --> 00:08:35.046\nbecause I always go into this\nJackson Pollock crazy thing,\n\n00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.815\nwhere I'm just writing\nand in my researcher mode.\n\n00:08:40.323 --> 00:08:41.870\nAnd so here's what I found.\n\n00:08:44.812 --> 00:08:47.664\nWhat they had in common\nwas a sense of courage.\n\n00:08:48.322 --> 00:08:51.419\nAnd I want to separate courage\nand bravery for you for a minute.\n\n00:08:51.443 --> 00:08:53.884\nCourage, the original\ndefinition of courage,\n\n00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:56.147\nwhen it first came\ninto the English language --\n\n00:08:56.171 --> 00:08:58.524\nit's from the Latin word \"cor,\"\nmeaning \"heart\" --\n\n00:08:58.548 --> 00:09:01.559\nand the original definition was to tell\nthe story of who you are\n\n00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:02.997\nwith your whole heart.\n\n00:09:03.757 --> 00:09:07.931\nAnd so these folks had, very simply,\nthe courage to be imperfect.\n\n00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:15.307\nThey had the compassion to be kind\nto themselves first and then to others,\n\n00:09:15.331 --> 00:09:16.530\nbecause, as it turns out,\n\n00:09:16.554 --> 00:09:18.788\nwe can't practice compassion\nwith other people\n\n00:09:18.812 --> 00:09:20.555\nif we can't treat ourselves kindly.\n\n00:09:20.957 --> 00:09:25.354\nAnd the last was they had connection,\nand -- this was the hard part --\n\n00:09:25.378 --> 00:09:28.355\nas a result of authenticity,\n\n00:09:28.379 --> 00:09:31.664\nthey were willing to let go\nof who they thought they should be\n\n00:09:31.688 --> 00:09:36.292\nin order to be who they were,\nwhich you have to absolutely do that\n\n00:09:36.316 --> 00:09:37.489\nfor connection.\n\n00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:44.021\nThe other thing that they had\nin common was this:\n\n00:09:47.608 --> 00:09:50.688\nThey fully embraced vulnerability.\n\n00:09:52.377 --> 00:09:59.028\nThey believed that what made them\nvulnerable made them beautiful.\n\n00:10:02.839 --> 00:10:06.664\nThey didn't talk about vulnerability\nbeing comfortable,\n\n00:10:06.688 --> 00:10:09.514\nnor did they really talk\nabout it being excruciating --\n\n00:10:09.538 --> 00:10:12.016\nas I had heard it earlier\nin the shame interviewing.\n\n00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.270\nThey just talked about it being necessary.\n\n00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:19.307\nThey talked about the willingness\nto say, \"I love you\" first ...\n\n00:10:21.076 --> 00:10:26.449\nthe willingness to do something\nwhere there are no guarantees ...\n\n00:10:27.981 --> 00:10:32.316\nthe willingness to breathe\nthrough waiting for the doctor to call\n\n00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.623\nafter your mammogram.\n\n00:10:35.329 --> 00:10:38.594\nThey're willing to invest\nin a relationship\n\n00:10:38.618 --> 00:10:40.068\nthat may or may not work out.\n\n00:10:41.163 --> 00:10:43.033\nThey thought this was fundamental.\n\n00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.759\nI personally thought it was betrayal.\n\n00:10:47.545 --> 00:10:52.141\nI could not believe I had pledged\nallegiance to research, where our job --\n\n00:10:52.165 --> 00:10:56.229\nyou know, the definition of research\nis to control and predict,\n\n00:10:56.253 --> 00:11:00.896\nto study phenomena for the explicit\nreason to control and predict.\n\n00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.286\nAnd now my mission to control and predict\n\n00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.879\nhad turned up the answer\nthat the way to live is with vulnerability\n\n00:11:08.903 --> 00:11:11.001\nand to stop controlling and predicting.\n\n00:11:11.025 --> 00:11:12.802\nThis led to a little breakdown --\n\n00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.664\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:18.688 --> 00:11:21.664\n-- which actually looked more like this.\n\n00:11:21.688 --> 00:11:23.181\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:23.205 --> 00:11:25.182\nAnd it did.\n\n00:11:25.206 --> 00:11:28.386\nI call it a breakdown;

The second thing I want to do is introduce my co-author and dear friend and co-teacher. Ken and I have been working together for almost 40 years. That's Ken Sharpe over there.(Applause)So there is among many people \u2014 certainly me and most of the people I talk to \u2014 a kind of collective dissatisfaction with the way things are working, with the way our institutions run. Our kids' teachers seem to be failing them. Our doctors don't know who the hell we are, and they don't have enough time for us. We certainly can't trust the bankers, and we certainly can't trust the brokers. They almost brought the entire financial system down. And even as we do our own work, all too often, we find ourselves having to choose between doing what we think is the right thing and doing the expected thing, or the required thing, or the profitable thing. So everywhere we look, pretty much across the board, we worry that the people we depend on don't really have our interests at heart. Or if they do have our interests at heart, we worry that they don't know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to secure those interests. They don't understand us. They don't have the time to get to know us.There are two kinds of responses that we make to this sort of general dissatisfaction. If things aren't going right, the first response is: let's make more rules, let's set up a set of detailed procedures to make sure that people will do the right thing. Give teachers scripts to follow in the classroom, so even if they don't know what they're doing and don't care about the welfare of our kids, as long as they follow the scripts, our kids will get educated. Give judges a list of mandatory sentences to impose for crimes, so that you don't need to rely on judges using their judgment. Instead, all they have to do is look up on the list what kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime. Impose limits on what credit card companies can charge in interest and on what they can charge in fees. More and more rules to protect us against an indifferent, uncaring set of institutions we have to deal with.Or \u2014 or maybe and \u2014 in addition to rules, let's see if we can come up with some really clever incentives so that, even if the people we deal with don't particularly want to serve our interests, it is in their interest to serve our interest \u2014 the magic incentives that will get people to do the right thing even out of pure selfishness. So we offer teachers bonuses if the kids they teach score passing grades on these big test scores that are used to evaluate the quality of school systems.Rules and incentives \u2014 \"sticks\" and \"carrots.\" We passed a bunch of rules to regulate the financial industry in response to the recent collapse. There's the Dodd-Frank Act, there's the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency that is temporarily being headed through the backdoor by Elizabeth Warren. Maybe these rules will actually improve the way these financial services companies behave. We'll see. In addition, we are struggling to find some way to create incentives for people in the financial services industry that will have them more interested in serving the long-term interests even of their own companies, rather than securing short-term profits. So if we find just the right incentives, they'll do the right thing \u2014 as I said \u2014 selfishly, and if we come up with the right rules and regulations, they won't drive us all over a cliff. And Ken [Sharpe] and I certainly know that you need to reign in the bankers. If there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse it is that.But what we believe, and what we argue in the book, is that there is no set of rules, no matter how detailed, no matter how specific, no matter how carefully monitored and enforced, there is no set of rules that will get us what we need. Why? Because bankers are smart people. And, like water, they will find cracks in any set of rules. You design a set of rules that will make sure that the particular reason why the financial system \"almost-collapse\" can't happen again. It is naive beyond description to think that having blocked this source of financial collapse, you have blocked all possible sources of financial collapse. So it's just a question of waiting for the next one and then marveling at how we could have been so stupid as not to protect ourselves against that.What we desperately need, beyond, or along with, better rules and reasonably smart incentives, is we need virtue. We need character. We need people who want to do the right thing. And in particular, the virtue that we need most of all is the virtue that Aristotle called \"practical wisdom.\" Practical wisdom is the moral will to do the right thing and the moral skill to figure out what the right thing is. So Aristotle was very interested in watching how the craftsmen around him worked. And he was impressed at how they would improvise novel solutions to novel problems \u2014 problems that they hadn't anticipated. So one example is he sees these stonemasons working on the Isle of Lesbos, and they need to measure out round columns. Well if you think about it, it's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler. So what do they do? They fashion a novel solution to the problem. They created a ruler that bends, what we would call these days a tape measure \u2014 a flexible rule, a rule that bends. And Aristotle said, \"Hah, they appreciated that sometimes to design rounded columns, you need to bend the rule.\" And Aristotle said often in dealing with other people, we need to bend the rules.Dealing with other people demands a kind of flexibility that no set of rules can encompass. Wise people know when and how to bend the rules. Wise people know how to improvise. The way my co-author , Ken, and I talk about it, they are kind of like jazz musicians. The rules are like the notes on the page, and that gets you started, but then you dance around the notes on the page, coming up with just the right combination for this particular moment with this particular set of fellow players. So for Aristotle, the kind of rule-bending, rule exception-finding and improvisation that you see in skilled craftsmen is exactly what you need to be a skilled moral craftsman. And in interactions with people, almost all the time, it is this kind of flexibility that is required. A wise person knows when to bend the rules. A wise person knows when to improvise. And most important, a wise person does this improvising and rule-bending in the service of the right aims. If you are a rule-bender and an improviser mostly to serve yourself, what you get is ruthless manipulation of other people. So it matters that you do this wise practice in the service of others and not in the service of yourself. And so the will to do the right thing is just as important as the moral skill of improvisation and exception-finding. Together they comprise practical wisdom, which Aristotle thought was the master virtue.So I'll give you an example of wise practice in action. It's the case of Michael. Michael's a young guy. He had a pretty low-wage job. He was supporting his wife and a child, and the child was going to parochial school. Then he lost his job. He panicked about being able to support his family. One night, he drank a little too much, and he robbed a cab driver \u2014 stole 50 dollars. He robbed him at gunpoint. It was a toy gun. He got caught. He got tried. He got convicted. The Pennsylvania sentencing guidelines required a minimum sentence for a crime like this of two years, 24 months. The judge on the case, Judge Lois Forer thought that this made no sense. He had never committed a crime before. He was a responsible husband and father. He had been faced with desperate circumstances. All this would do is wreck a family. And so she improvised a sentence \u2014 11 months, and not only that, but release every day to go to work. Spend your night in jail, spend your day holding down a job. He did. He served out his sentence. He made restitution and found himself a new job. And the family was united.And it seemed on the road to some sort of a decent life \u2014 a happy ending to a story involving wise improvisation from a wise judge. But it turned out the prosecutor was not happy that Judge Forer ignored the sentencing guidelines and sort of invented her own, and so he appealed. And he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery. He did after all have a toy gun. The mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery is five years. He won the appeal. Michael was sentenced to five years in prison. Judge Forer had to follow the law. And by the way, this appeal went through after he had finished serving his sentence, so he was out and working at a job and taking care of his family and he had to go back into jail. Judge Forer did what she was required to do, and then she quit the bench. And Michael disappeared. So that is an example, both of wisdom in practice and the subversion of wisdom by rules that are meant, of course, to make things better.Now consider Ms. Dewey. Ms. Dewey's a teacher in a Texas elementary school. She found herself listening to a consultant one day who was trying to help teachers boost the test scores of the kids, so that the school would reach the elite category in percentage of kids passing big tests. All these schools in Texas compete with one another to achieve these milestones, and there are bonuses and various other treats that come if you beat the other schools. So here was the consultant's advice: first, don't waste your time on kids who are going to pass the test no matter what you do. Second, don't waste your time on kids who can't pass the test no matter what you do. Third, don't waste your time on kids who moved into the district too late for their scores to be counted. Focus all of your time and attention on the kids who are on the bubble, the so-called \"bubble kids\" \u2014 kids where your intervention can get them just maybe over the line from failing to passing. So Ms. Dewey heard this, and she shook her head in despair while fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other on and nodding approvingly. It's like they were about to go play a football game. For Ms. Dewey, this isn't why she became a teacher.Now Ken and I are not naive, and we understand that you need to have rules. You need to have incentives. People have to make a living. But the problem with relying on rules and incentives is that they demoralize professional activity, and they demoralize professional activity in two senses. First, they demoralize the people who are engaged in the activity. Judge Forer quits, and Ms. Dewey in completely disheartened. And second, they demoralize the activity itself. The very practice is demoralized, and the practitioners are demoralized. It creates people \u2014 when you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing \u2014 it creates people who are addicted to incentives. That is to say, it creates people who only do things for incentives.Now the striking thing about this is that psychologists have known this for 30 years. Psychologists have known about the negative consequences of incentivizing everything for 30 years. We know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures, they stop caring about the drawing and care only about the reward. If you reward kids for reading books, they stop caring about what's in the books and only care about how long they are. If you reward teachers for kids' test scores, they stop caring about educating and only care about test preparation. If you were to reward doctors for doing more procedures \u2014 which is the current system \u2014 they would do more. If instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures, they will do fewer. What we want, of course, is doctors who do just the right amount of procedures and do the right amount for the right reason \u2014 namely, to serve the welfare of their patients. Psychologists have known this for decades, and it's time for policymakers to start paying attention and listen to psychologists a little bit, instead of economists.And it doesn't have to be this way. We think, Ken and I, that there are real sources of hope. We identify one set of people in all of these practices who we call canny outlaws. These are people who, being forced to operate in a system that demands rule-following and creates incentives, find away around the rules, find a way to subvert the rules. So there are teachers who have these scripts to follow, and they know that if they follow these scripts, the kids will learn nothing. And so what they do is they follow the scripts, but they follow the scripts at double-time and squirrel away little bits of extra time during which they teach in the way that they actually know is effective. So these are little ordinary, everyday heroes, and they're incredibly admirable, but there's no way that they can sustain this kind of activity in the face of a system that either roots them out or grinds them down.So canny outlaws are better than nothing, but it's hard to imagine any canny outlaw sustaining that for an indefinite period of time. More hopeful are people we call system-changers. These are people who are looking not to dodge the system's rules and regulations, but to transform the system, and we talk about several. One in particular is a judge named Robert Russell. And one day he was faced with the case of Gary Pettengill. Pettengill was a 23-year-old vet who had planned to make the army a career, but then he got a severe back injury in Iraq, and that forced him to take a medical discharge. He was married, he had a third kid on the way, he suffered from PTSD, in addition to the bad back, and recurrent nightmares, and he had started using marijuana to ease some of the symptoms. He was only able to get part-time work because of his back, and so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table and take care of his family. So he started selling marijuana. He was busted in a drug sweep. His family was kicked out of their apartment, and the welfare system was threatening to take away his kids.Under normal sentencing procedures, Judge Russell would have had little choice but to sentence Pettengill to serious jail-time as a drug felon. But Judge Russell did have an alternative. And that's because he was in a special court. He was in a court called the Veterans' Court. In the Veterans' Court \u2014 this was the first of its kind in the United States. Judge Russell created the Veterans' Court. It was a court only for veterans who had broken the law. And he had created it exactly because mandatory sentencing laws were taking the judgment out of judging. No one wanted non-violent offenders \u2014 and especially non-violent offenders who were veterans to boot \u2014 to be thrown into prison. They wanted to do something about what we all know, namely the revolving door of the criminal justice system. And what the Veterans' Court did, was it treated each criminal as an individual, tried to get inside their problems, tried to fashion responses to their crimes that helped them to rehabilitate themselves, and didn't forget about them once the judgment was made. Stayed with them, followed up on them, made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan had been jointly developed to get them over the hump.There are now 22 cities that have Veterans' Courts like this. Why has the idea spread? Well, one reason is that Judge Russell has now seen 108 vets in his Veterans' Court as of February of this year, and out of 108, guess how many have gone back through the revolving door of justice into prison. None. None. Anyone would glom onto a criminal justice system that has this kind of a record. So here's is a system-changer, and it seems to be catching.There's a banker who created a for-profit community bank that encouraged bankers \u2014 I know this is hard to believe \u2014 encouraged bankers who worked there to do well by doing good for their low-income clients. The bank helped finance the rebuilding of what was otherwise a dying community. Though their loan recipients were high-risk by ordinary standards, the default rate was extremely low. The bank was profitable. The bankers stayed with their loan recipients. They didn't make loans and then sell the loans. They serviced the loans. They made sure that their loan recipients were staying up with their payments. Banking hasn't always been the way we read about it now in the newspapers. Even Goldman Sachs once used to serve clients, before it turned into an institution that serves only itself. Banking wasn't always this way, and it doesn't have to be this way.So there are examples like this in medicine \u2014 doctors at Harvard who are trying to transform medical education, so that you don't get a kind of ethical erosion and loss of empathy, which characterizes most medical students in the course of their medical training. And the way they do it is to give third-year medical students patients who they follow for an entire year. So the patients are not organ systems, and they're not diseases; they're people, people with lives. And in order to be an effective doctor, you need to treat people who have lives and not just disease. In addition to which there's an enormous amount of back and forth, mentoring of one student by another, of all the students by the doctors, and the result is a generation \u2014 we hope \u2014 of doctors who do have time for the people they treat. We'll see.So there are lots of examples like this that we talk about. Each of them shows that it is possible to build on and nurture character and keep a profession true to its proper mission \u2014 what Aristotle would have called its proper telos. And Ken and I believe that this is what practitioners actually want. People want to be allowed to be virtuous. They want to have permission to do the right thing. They don't want to feel like they need to take a shower to get the moral grime off their bodies everyday when they come home from work.Aristotle thought that practical wisdom was the key to happiness, and he was right. There's now a lot of research being done in psychology on what makes people happy, and the two things that jump out in study after study \u2014 I know this will come as a shock to all of you \u2014 the two things that matter most to happiness are love and work. Love: managing successfully relations with the people who are close to you and with the communities of which you are a part. Work: engaging in activities that are meaningful and satisfying. If you have that, good close relations with other people, work that's meaningful and fulfilling, you don't much need anything else.Well, to love well and to work well, you need wisdom. Rules and incentives don't tell you how to be a good friend, how to be a good parent, how to be a good spouse, or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer or a good teacher. Rules and incentives are no substitutes for wisdom. Indeed, we argue, there is no substitute for wisdom. And so practical wisdom does not require heroic acts of self-sacrifice on the part of practitioners. In giving us the will and the skill to do the right thing \u2014 to do right by others \u2014 practical wisdom also gives us the will and the skill to do right by ourselves.Thanks.(Applause)", "id":

dissatisfaction\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nwith the way things are working,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nwith the way our institutions run.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nOur kids' teachers seem to be failing them.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nOur doctors don't know who the hell we are,\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nand they don't have enough time for us.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nWe certainly can't trust the bankers,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nand we certainly can't trust the brokers.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nThey almost brought the entire financial system down.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nAnd even as we do our own work,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nall too often,\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nwe find ourselves having to choose\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nbetween doing what we think is the right thing\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nand doing the expected thing,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nor the required thing,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nor the profitable thing.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nSo everywhere we look,\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\npretty much across the board,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nwe worry that the people we depend on\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\ndon't really have our interests at heart.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nOr if they do have our interests at heart,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nwe worry that they don't know us well enough\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nto figure out what they need to do\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nin order to allow us\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nto secure those interests.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nThey don't understand us.\n\n00:01:38.958

00:01:54.958\nlet's make more rules,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nlet's set up a set\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nof detailed procedures\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nto make sure that people will do the right thing.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nGive teachers scripts\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nto follow in the classroom,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nso even if they

00:02:28.958\nis look up on the list\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nwhat kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nImpose limits\n\n00:02:33.958 -->

bonuses\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nif the kids they teach\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nscore passing grades on these big test scores\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nthat are used to

\"carrots.\"\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nWe passed a bunch of rules\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nto regulate the financial industry\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nin response to the recent collapse.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nThere's the Dodd-Frank Act,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nthere's the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nthat is temporarily being headed through the backdoor\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nby Elizabeth Warren.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nMaybe these rules\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nwill actually improve\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nthe way these financial services companies behave.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nWe'll see.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nIn addition, we are struggling\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nto find some way to create incentives\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nfor people in the financial services industry\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nthat will have them more interested\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nin serving the long-term interests\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\neven of their own companies,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nrather than securing short-term profits.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nSo if we find just the right incentives,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nthey'll do the right thing -- as I said -- selfishly,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nand if we come up with the right rules and regulations,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nthey won't drive us all over a cliff.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nAnd Ken [Sharpe] and I certainly know\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nthat you need to reign in the bankers.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nIf there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nit is that.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nBut what we believe,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nand what we argue in the book,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nis that there is no set of rules,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nno matter how detailed,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nno matter how specific,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nno matter how carefully monitored\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nand enforced,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nthere is no set of rules\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nthat will get us what we need.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nWhy? Because bankers are smart people.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nAnd, like water,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nthey will find cracks\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nin any set of rules.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nYou design a set of rules that will make sure\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nthat the particular reason\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nwhy the financial system \"almost-collapse\"\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\ncan't happen again.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nIt is naive beyond description\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nto think that having blocked\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nthis source of financial collapse,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nyou have blocked all possible sources of financial collapse.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nSo it's just a question of waiting for the next one\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nand then marveling at how we could have been so stupid\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nas not to protect ourselves against that.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nWhat we desperately need,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nbeyond, or along with, better rules\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nand reasonably smart incentives,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nis we need virtue.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nWe need character.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nWe need people who want to do the right thing.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nAnd in particular,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nthe virtue that we need most of all\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nis the virtue that Aristotle called\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\n\"practical wisdom.\"\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nPractical wisdom\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nis the moral will\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nto do the right thing\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nand the moral skill\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nto figure out what the right thing is.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nSo Aristotle was very interested in watching\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nhow the craftsmen around him worked.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd he was impressed\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nat how they would improvise\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nnovel solutions to novel problems --\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nproblems that they hadn't anticipated.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nSo one example is he sees these stonemasons\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nworking on the Isle of Lesbos,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nand they need to measure out\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nround columns.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nWell if you think about it,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nit's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nSo what do they do?\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nThey fashion a novel solution to the problem.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nThey created a ruler that bends,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nwhat we would call these days a tape measure --\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\na flexible rule,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\na rule that bends.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nAnd Aristotle said,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\n\"Hah, they appreciated that sometimes\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nto design rounded columns,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nyou need to bend the rule.\"\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nAnd Aristotle said\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\noften in dealing with other people,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nwe need to bend the rules.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nDealing with other people\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\ndemands a kind of flexibility\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nthat no set of rules can encompass.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nWise people know when and how\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nto bend the rules.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nWise people know how to improvise.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nThe way my co-author , Ken, and I talk about it,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nthey are kind of like jazz musicians.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nThe rules are like the notes on the page,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nand that gets you started,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nbut then you dance around the notes on the page,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\ncoming up with just the right combination\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nfor this particular moment\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nwith this particular set of fellow players.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nSo for Aristotle,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nthe kind\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nof rule-bending,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nrule exception-finding and improvisation\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nthat you see in skilled craftsmen\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nis exactly what you need\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nto be a skilled moral craftsman.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nAnd in interactions with people,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nalmost all the time,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nit is this kind of flexibility that is required.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nA wise person knows when to bend the rules.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nA wise person knows when to improvise.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nAnd most important,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\na wise person does this improvising and rule-bending\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nin the service of the right aims.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nIf you are a rule-bender and an improviser\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nmostly to serve yourself,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nwhat you get is ruthless manipulation of other people.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nSo it matters that you do this wise practice\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nin the service of others\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nand not in the service of yourself.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nAnd so the will to do the right thing\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nis just as important as the moral skill\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nof improvisation\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nand exception-finding.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nTogether they comprise practical wisdom,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nwhich Aristotle thought\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nwas the master virtue.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nSo I'll give you an example\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nof wise practice in action.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nIt's the case of Michael.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nMichael's a young guy.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nHe had a pretty low-wage job.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nHe was supporting his wife and a child,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nand the child was going to parochial school.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nThen he lost his job.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nHe panicked\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nabout being able to support his family.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nOne night, he drank a little too much,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nand he robbed a cab driver --\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nstole 50 dollars.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nHe robbed him at gunpoint.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nIt was a toy gun.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nHe got caught. He got tried.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nHe got convicted.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nThe Pennsylvania sentencing guidelines\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nrequired a minimum sentence for a crime like this\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nof two years, 24 months.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nThe judge on the case, Judge Lois Forer\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nthought that this made no sense.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nHe had never committed a crime before.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nHe was a responsible husband and father.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nHe had been faced with desperate circumstances.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nAll this would do is wreck a family.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nAnd so she improvised a sentence -- 11 months,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nand not only that,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nbut release every day to go to work.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nSpend your night in jail, spend your day holding down a job.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nHe did. He served out his sentence.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nHe made restitution\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nand found himself a new job.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nAnd the family was united.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nAnd it seemed on the road\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nto some sort of a decent life --\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\na happy ending to a story\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\ninvolving wise improvisation\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nfrom a wise judge.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nBut it turned out\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nthe prosecutor was not happy\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nthat Judge Forer ignored the sentencing guidelines\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nand sort of invented her own,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nand so he appealed.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nAnd he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nfor armed robbery.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nHe did after all have a toy gun.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nThe mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nis five years.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nHe won the appeal.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nMichael was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nJudge Forer had to follow the law.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nAnd by the way, this appeal went through\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nafter he had finished serving his sentence,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nso he was out and working at a job\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nand taking care of his family\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nand he had to go back into jail.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nJudge Forer did what she was required to do,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nand then she quit the bench.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nAnd Michael disappeared.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nSo that is an example,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nboth of wisdom in practice\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nand the subversion of wisdom\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nby rules that are meant, of course, to make things better.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nNow consider Ms. Dewey.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nMs. Dewey's a teacher in a Texas elementary school.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nShe found herself listening to a consultant one day\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nwho was trying to help teachers\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nboost the test scores of the kids,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nso that the school\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nwould reach the elite category\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nin percentage of kids passing big tests.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nAll these schools in Texas compete with one another\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nto achieve these milestones,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nand there are bonuses and various other treats\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nthat come if you beat the other schools.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nSo here was the consultant's advice:\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nfirst, don't waste your time on kids\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nwho are going to pass the test no matter what you do.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nSecond, don't waste your time\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\non kids who can't pass the test\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nno matter what you do.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nThird, don't waste your time\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\non kids who moved into the district\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\ntoo late for their scores to be counted.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nFocus all of your time and attention\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\non the kids who are on the bubble,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nthe so-called \"bubble kids\" --\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nkids where your intervention\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\ncan get them just maybe over the line\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nfrom failing to passing.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nSo Ms. Dewey heard this,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nand she shook her head in despair\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nwhile fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other on\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nand nodding approvingly.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nIt's like they were about to go play a football game.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nFor Ms. Dewey,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nthis isn't why she became a teacher.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nNow Ken and I are not naive,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nand we understand that you need to have rules.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nYou need to have incentives.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nPeople have to make a living.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nBut the problem\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nwith relying on rules and incentives\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nis that they demoralize\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nprofessional activity,\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nand they demoralize professional activity\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nin two senses.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nFirst, they demoralize the people\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nwho are engaged in the activity.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nJudge Forer quits,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nand Ms. Dewey in completely disheartened.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nAnd second,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nthey demoralize the activity itself.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nThe very practice is demoralized,\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nand the practitioners are demoralized.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nIt creates people --\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nwhen you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing --\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nit creates people\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nwho are addicted to incentives.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nThat is to say, it creates people\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nwho only do things for incentives.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nNow the striking thing about this\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nis that psychologists have known this\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nfor 30 years.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nPsychologists have known\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nabout the negative consequences of incentivizing everything\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nfor 30 years.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nWe know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures,\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nthey stop caring about the drawing\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nand care only about the reward.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nIf you reward kids for reading books,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nthey stop caring about what's in the books\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nand only care about how long they are.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nIf you reward teachers for kids' test scores,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nthey stop caring about educating\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nand only care about test preparation.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nIf you were to reward doctors\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nfor doing more procedures --\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nwhich is the current system -- they would do more.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nIf instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nthey will do fewer.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nWhat we want, of course,\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nis doctors who do just the right amount of procedures\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nand do the right amount for the right reason --\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nnamely, to serve the welfare of their patients.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nPsychologists have known this for decades,\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nand it's time for policymakers\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nto start paying attention\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nand listen to psychologists a little bit,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\ninstead of economists.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nAnd it doesn't have to be this way.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nWe think, Ken and I, that there are real sources of hope.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nWe identify one set of people\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nin all of these practices\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nwho we call canny outlaws.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nThese are people\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nwho, being forced to operate\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nin a system that demands rule-following\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nand creates incentives,\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nfind away around the rules,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nfind a way to subvert the rules.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nSo there are teachers who have these scripts to follow,\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nand they know that if they follow these scripts, the kids will learn nothing.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nAnd so what they do is they follow the scripts,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nbut they follow the scripts at double-time\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nand squirrel away little bits of extra time\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nduring which they teach in the way\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nthat they actually know is effective.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nSo these are little ordinary, everyday heroes,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nand they're incredibly admirable,\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nbut there's no way that they can sustain this kind of activity\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nin the face of a system\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nthat either roots them out\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nor grinds them down.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nSo canny outlaws are better than nothing,\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nbut it's hard to imagine any canny outlaw\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nsustaining that for an indefinite period of time.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nMore hopeful\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nare people we call system-changers.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nThese are people who are looking\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nnot to dodge the system's rules and regulations,\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nbut to transform the system,\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nand we talk about several.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nOne in particular\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nis a judge named Robert Russell.\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nAnd one day he was faced\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nwith the case of Gary Pettengill.\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nPettengill was a 23-year-old vet\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nwho had planned to make the army a career,\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nbut then he got a severe back injury in Iraq,\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nand that forced him to take a medical discharge.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nHe was married, he had a third kid on the way,\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nhe suffered from PTSD, in addition to the bad back,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nand recurrent nightmares,\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nand he had started using marijuana\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nto ease some of the symptoms.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nHe was only able to get part-time work because of his back,\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nand so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nand take care of his family.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nSo he started selling marijuana.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nHe was busted in a drug sweep.\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nHis family was kicked out of their apartment,\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nand the welfare system\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nwas threatening to take away his kids.\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nUnder normal sentencing procedures,\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nJudge Russell would have had little choice\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nbut to sentence Pettengill to serious jail-time\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nas a drug felon.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nBut Judge Russell did have an alternative.\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nAnd that's because he was in a special court.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nHe was in a court called the Veterans' Court.\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nIn the Veterans' Court --\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nthis was the first of its kind in the United States.\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nJudge Russell created the Veterans' Court.\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nIt was a court only for veterans\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nwho had broken the law.\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nAnd he had created it exactly because\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:48.958\nmandatory sentencing laws\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nwere taking the judgment out of judging.\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nNo one wanted non-violent offenders --\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nand especially non-violent offenders who were veterans to boot --\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nto be thrown into prison.\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nThey wanted to do something about what we all know,\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nnamely the revolving door of the criminal justice system.\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nAnd what the Veterans' Court did,\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nwas it treated each criminal as an individual,\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:13.958\ntried to get inside their problems,\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:16.958\ntried to fashion responses to their crimes\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nthat helped them to rehabilitate themselves,\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nand didn't forget about them once the judgment was made.\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nStayed with them, followed up on them,\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nmade sure that they were sticking to whatever plan\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nhad been jointly developed\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nto get them over the hump.\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nThere are now 22 cities\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nthat have Veterans' Courts like this.\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nWhy has the idea spread?\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nWell, one reason is\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nthat Judge Russell\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nhas now seen 108 vets\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nin his Veterans' Court\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nas of February of this year,\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nand out of 108,\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nguess how many have gone back through\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nthe revolving door of justice\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.958\ninto prison.\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nNone. None.\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nAnyone would glom onto\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.958\na criminal justice system\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:04.958\nthat has this kind of a record.\n\n00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nSo here's is a system-changer, and it seems to be catching.\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nThere's a banker\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nwho created a for-profit community bank\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nthat encouraged bankers -- I know this is hard to believe --\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nencouraged bankers who worked there to do well\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:20.958\nby doing good for their low-income clients.\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:23.958\nThe bank helped finance the rebuilding\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nof what was otherwise a dying community.\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:29.958\nThough their loan recipients were high-risk by ordinary standards,\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nthe default rate was extremely low.\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:35.958\nThe bank was profitable.\n\n00:19:35.958 --> 00:19:37.958\nThe bankers stayed with their loan recipients.\n\n00:19:37.958 --> 00:19:39.958\nThey didn't make loans and then sell the loans.\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:41.958\nThey serviced the loans.\n\n00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:43.958\nThey made sure that their loan recipients\n\n00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:46.958\nwere staying up with their payments.\n\n00:19:46.958 --> 00:19:49.958\nBanking hasn't always been\n\n00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:53.958\nthe way we read about it now in the newspapers.\n\n00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:55.958\nEven Goldman Sachs\n\n00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:58.958\nonce used to serve clients,\n\n00:19:58.958 --> 00:20:01.958\nbefore it turned into an institution\n\n00:20:01.958 --> 00:20:03.958\nthat serves only itself.\n\n00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:05.958\nBanking wasn't always this way,\n\n00:20:05.958 --> 00:20:08.958\nand it doesn't have to be this way.\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:13.958\nSo there are examples like this in medicine --\n\n00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:15.958\ndoctors at Harvard\n\n00:20:15.958 --> 00:20:17.958\nwho are trying to transform medical education,\n\n00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:19.958\nso that you don't get a kind of ethical erosion\n\n00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:21.958\nand loss of empathy,\n\n00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:23.958\nwhich characterizes most medical students\n\n00:20:23.958 --> 00:20:25.958\nin the course of their medical training.\n\n00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:28.958\nAnd the way they do it is to give third-year medical students\n\n00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:30.958\npatients who they follow for an entire year.\n\n00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:32.958\nSo the patients are not organ systems,\n\n00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:34.958\nand they're not diseases;\n\n00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:36.958\nthey're people, people with lives.\n\n00:20:36.958 --> 00:20:38.958\nAnd in order to be an effective doctor,\n\n00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:41.958\nyou need to treat people who have lives and not just disease.\n\n00:20:41.958 --> 00:20:44.958\nIn addition to which there's an enormous amount of back and forth,\n\n00:20:44.958 --> 00:20:46.958\nmentoring of one student by another,\n\n00:20:46.958 --> 00:20:49.958\nof all the students by the doctors,\n\n00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:52.958\nand the result is a generation -- we hope -- of doctors\n\n00:20:52.958 --> 00:20:54.958\nwho do have time for the people they treat.\n\n00:20:54.958 --> 00:20:56.958\nWe'll see.\n\n00:20:56.958 --> 00:20:59.958\nSo there are lots of examples like this that we talk about.\n\n00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:01.958\nEach of them shows that it is possible\n\n00:21:01.958 --> 00:21:04.958\nto build on and nurture character\n\n00:21:04.958 --> 00:21:06.958\nand keep a profession\n\n00:21:06.958 --> 00:21:08.958\ntrue to its proper mission --\n\n00:21:08.958 --> 00:21:11.958\nwhat Aristotle would have called its proper telos.\n\n00:21:12.958

00:21:21.958\nto be virtuous.\n\n00:21:21.958 --> 00:21:24.958\nThey want to have permission to do the right thing.\n\n00:21:24.958 --> 00:21:26.958\nThey don't want to feel\n\n00:21:26.958 -->

may have heard about the Koran's idea of paradise being 72 virgins, and I promise I will come back to those virgins. But in fact, here in the Northwest, we're living very close to the real Koranic idea of paradise, defined 36 times as \"gardens watered by running streams.\" Since I live on a houseboat on the running stream of Lake Union, this makes perfect sense to me. But the thing is, how come it's news to most people? I know many well-intentioned non-Muslims who've begun reading the Koran, but given up, disconcerted by its \"otherness.\" The historian Thomas Carlyle considered Muhammad one of the world's greatest heroes, yet even he called the Koran \"as toilsome reading as I ever undertook; a wearisome, confused jumble.\"(Laughter)Part of the problem, I think, is that we imagine that the Koran can be read as we usually read a book \u2014 as though we can curl up with it on a rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach, as though God \u2014 and the Koran is entirely in the voice of God speaking to Muhammad \u2014 were just another author on the best-seller list. Yet, the fact that so few people do actually read the Koran is precisely why it's so easy to quote \u2014 that is, to misquote.(Laughter)Phrases and snippets taken out of context in what I call the \"highlighter version,\" which is the one favored by both Muslim fundamentalists and anti-Muslim Islamophobes.So this past spring, as I was gearing up to begin writing a biography of Muhammad, I realized I needed to read the Koran properly \u2014 as properly as I could, that is. My Arabic is reduced by now to wielding a dictionary, so I took four well-known translations and decided to read them side by side, verse by verse, along with a transliteration and the original seventh-century Arabic. Now, I did have an advantage. My last book was about the story behind the Shi'a-Sunni split, and for that, I'd worked closely with the earliest Islamic histories, so I knew the events to which the Koran constantly refers, its frame of reference. I knew enough, that is, to know that I'd be a tourist in the Koran \u2014 an informed one, an experienced one, even, but still an outsider, an agnostic Jew reading someone else's holy book.(Laughter)So I read slowly.(Laughter)I'd set aside three weeks for this project, and that, I think, is what is meant by \"hubris\" \u2014(Laughter)because it turned out to be three months.(Laughter)I did resist the temptation to skip to the back, where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are. But every time I thought I was beginning to get a handle on the Koran \u2014 that feeling of \"I get it now\" \u2014 it would slip away overnight, and I'd come back in the morning, wondering if I wasn't lost in a strange land. And yet, the terrain was very familiar. The Koran declares that it comes to renew the message of the Torah and the Gospels. So one-third of it reprises the stories of Biblical figures like Abraham, Moses, Joseph, Mary, Jesus. God himself was utterly familiar from his earlier manifestation as Yahweh, jealously insisting on no other gods. The presence of camels, mountains, desert wells and springs took me back to the year I spent wandering the Sinai Desert. And then there was the language, the rhythmic cadence of it, reminding me of evenings spent listening to Bedouin elders recite hours-long narrative poems entirely from memory. And I began to grasp why it's said that the Koran is really the Koran only in Arabic.Take the Fatihah, the seven-verse opening chapter that is the Lord's Prayer and the Shema Yisrael of Islam combined. It's just 29 words in Arabic, but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation. And yet the more you add, the more seems to go missing. The Arabic has an incantatory, almost hypnotic quality that begs to be heard rather than read, felt more than analyzed. It wants to be chanted out loud, to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue. So the Koran in English is a kind of shadow of itself, or as Arthur Arberry called his version, \"an interpretation.\" But all is not lost in translation.As the Koran promises, patience is rewarded, and there are many surprises \u2014 a degree of environmental awareness, for instance, and of humans as mere stewards of God's creation, unmatched in the Bible. And where the Bible is addressed exclusively to men, using the second- and third-person masculine, the Koran includes women \u2014 talking, for instance, of believing men and believing women, honorable men and honorable women. Or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers. Yes, it does say that, but in a very specific context: the anticipated conquest of the sanctuary city of Mecca, where fighting was usually forbidden. And the permission comes hedged about with qualifiers. Not \"You must kill unbelievers in Mecca,\" but you can, you are allowed to, but only after a grace period is over, and only if there's no other pact in place, and only if they try to stop you getting to the Kaaba, and only if they attack you first. And even then \u2014 God is merciful; forgiveness is supreme \u2014 and so, essentially, better if you don't.(Laughter)This was perhaps the biggest surprise \u2014 how flexible the Koran is, at least in minds that are not fundamentally inflexible.\"Some of these verses are definite in meaning,\" it says, \"and others are ambiguous.\" The perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities, trying to create discord by pinning down meanings of their own. Only God knows the true meaning. The phrase \"God is subtle\" appears again and again, and indeed, the whole of the Koran is far more subtle than most of us have been led to believe. As in, for instance, that little matter of virgins and paradise. Old-fashioned orientalism comes into play here. The word used four times is \"houris,\" rendered as dark-eyed maidens with swelling breasts, or as fair, high-bosomed virgins. Yet all there is in the original Arabic is that one word: houris. Not a swelling breast or high bosom in sight.(Laughter)Now this may be a way of saying \"pure beings,\" like in angels, or it may be like the Greek \"kouros\" or \"kore,\" an eternal youth.But the truth is, nobody really knows. And that's the point. Because the Koran is quite clear when it says that you'll be \"a new creation in paradise,\" and that you will be \"recreated in a form unknown to you,\" which seems to me a far more appealing prospect than a virgin.(Laughter)And that number 72 never appears. There are no 72 virgins in the Koran. That idea only came into being 300 years later, and most Islamic scholars see it as the equivalent of people with wings sitting on clouds and strumming harps. Paradise is quite the opposite. It's not virginity; it's fecundity; it's plenty. It's gardens watered by running streams.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1045, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.077 --> 00:00:16.506\nYou may have

00:00:24.764\nBut in fact, here in the Northwest,\nwe're living very close\n\n00:00:24.788 --> 00:00:27.391\nto the real Koranic idea of paradise,\n\n00:00:27.415 --> 00:00:33.060\ndefined 36 times as \"gardens\nwatered by running streams.\"\n\n00:00:33.858 --> 00:00:38.095\nSince I live on a houseboat\non the running stream of Lake Union,\n\n00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:40.341\nthis makes perfect sense to me.\n\n00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:43.365\nBut the thing is, how come\nit's news to most people?\n\n00:00:44.665 --> 00:00:46.834\nI know many well-intentioned non-Muslims\n\n00:00:46.858 --> 00:00:49.525\nwho've begun reading\nthe Koran, but given up,\n\n00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:52.078\ndisconcerted by its \"otherness.\"\n\n00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.598\nThe historian Thomas Carlyle\nconsidered Muhammad\n\n00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:57.598\none of the world's greatest heroes,\n\n00:00:57.622 --> 00:01:00.034\nyet even he called the Koran\n\n00:01:00.058 --> 00:01:05.424\n\"as toilsome reading as I ever undertook;\na wearisome, confused jumble.\"\n\n00:01:05.448 --> 00:01:07.724\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:07.748 --> 00:01:10.754\nPart of the problem,\nI think, is that we imagine\n\n00:01:10.778 --> 00:01:14.434\nthat the Koran can be read\nas we usually read a book --\n\n00:01:14.458 --> 00:01:17.434\nas though we can curl up\nwith it on a rainy afternoon\n\n00:01:17.458 --> 00:01:19.434\nwith a bowl of popcorn within reach,\n\n00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:20.978\nas though God --\n\n00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:24.744\nand the Koran is entirely in the voice\nof God speaking to Muhammad --\n\n00:01:24.768 --> 00:01:27.562\nwere just another author\non the best-seller list.\n\n00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:33.686\nYet, the fact that so few people\ndo actually read the Koran\n\n00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.972\nis precisely why it's so easy to quote --\nthat is, to misquote.\n\n00:01:38.996 --> 00:01:40.020\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:40.044 --> 00:01:42.434\nPhrases and snippets taken out of context\n\n00:01:42.458 --> 00:01:44.534\nin what I call the \"highlighter version,\"\n\n00:01:44.558 --> 00:01:47.645\nwhich is the one favored\nby both Muslim fundamentalists\n\n00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:50.434\nand anti-Muslim Islamophobes.\n\n00:01:50.954 --> 00:01:52.780\nSo this past spring,\n\n00:01:52.804 --> 00:01:56.866\nas I was gearing up to begin writing\na biography of Muhammad,\n\n00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.124\nI realized I needed to read\nthe Koran properly --\n\n00:02:01.148 --> 00:02:03.910\nas properly as I could, that is.\n\n00:02:03.934 --> 00:02:07.044\nMy Arabic is reduced by now\nto wielding a dictionary,\n\n00:02:07.068 --> 00:02:09.434\nso I took four well-known translations\n\n00:02:09.458 --> 00:02:13.623\nand decided to read them\nside by side, verse by verse,\n\n00:02:13.647 --> 00:02:18.516\nalong with a transliteration\nand the original seventh-century Arabic.\n\n00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.458\nNow, I did have an advantage.\n\n00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:29.109\nMy last book was about the story\nbehind the Shi'a-Sunni split,\n\n00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:32.546\nand for that, I'd worked closely\nwith the earliest Islamic histories,\n\n00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.332\nso I knew the events\nto which the Koran constantly refers,\n\n00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:38.333\nits frame of reference.\n\n00:02:38.357 --> 00:02:43.434\nI knew enough, that is, to know\nthat I'd be a tourist in the Koran --\n\n00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:45.434\nan informed one,\n\n00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:46.933\nan experienced one, even,\n\n00:02:46.957 --> 00:02:49.306\nbut still an outsider,\n\n00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.152\nan agnostic Jew reading\nsomeone else's holy book.\n\n00:02:53.176 --> 00:02:55.251\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:56.845\nSo I read slowly.\n\n00:02:56.869 --> 00:03:01.354\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:01.378 --> 00:03:03.865\nI'd set aside three weeks\nfor this project,\n\n00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.759\nand that, I think,\nis what is meant by \"hubris\" --\n\n00:03:06.783 --> 00:03:11.069\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:11.093 --> 00:03:13.269\nbecause it turned out to be three months.\n\n00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:15.180\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:15.204 --> 00:03:17.702\nI did resist the temptation\nto skip to the back,\n\n00:03:17.726 --> 00:03:20.893\nwhere the shorter and more\nclearly mystical chapters are.\n\n00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:24.434\nBut every time I thought I was beginning\nto get a handle on the Koran --\n\n00:03:24.458 --> 00:03:26.740\nthat feeling of \"I get it now\" --\n\n00:03:26.764 --> 00:03:28.827\nit would slip away overnight,\n\n00:03:28.851 --> 00:03:30.505\nand I'd come back in the morning,\n\n00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:33.257\nwondering if I wasn't lost\nin a strange land.\n\n00:03:33.996 --> 00:03:36.513\nAnd yet, the terrain was very familiar.\n\n00:03:37.275 --> 00:03:40.138\nThe Koran declares that it comes\nto renew the message\n\n00:03:40.162 --> 00:03:41.595\nof the Torah and the Gospels.\n\n00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:45.107\nSo one-third of it reprises\nthe stories of Biblical figures\n\n00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:49.660\nlike Abraham, Moses, Joseph, Mary, Jesus.\n\n00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:53.343\nGod himself was utterly familiar\n\n00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:56.434\nfrom his earlier manifestation as Yahweh,\n\n00:03:56.458 --> 00:03:59.458\njealously insisting on no other gods.\n\n00:04:00.596 --> 00:04:05.660\nThe presence of camels, mountains,\ndesert wells and springs\n\n00:04:05.684 --> 00:04:09.115\ntook me back to the year I spent\nwandering the Sinai Desert.\n\n00:04:09.884 --> 00:04:13.434\nAnd then there was the language,\nthe rhythmic cadence of it,\n\n00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:16.679\nreminding me of evenings spent\nlistening to Bedouin elders\n\n00:04:16.703 --> 00:04:19.680\nrecite hours-long narrative poems\n\n00:04:19.704 --> 00:04:21.571\nentirely from memory.\n\n00:04:22.785 --> 00:04:27.488\nAnd I began to grasp why it's said\n\n00:04:27.512 --> 00:04:31.624\nthat the Koran is really\nthe Koran only in Arabic.\n\n00:04:32.497 --> 00:04:36.385\nTake the Fatihah,\nthe seven-verse opening chapter\n\n00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:40.409\nthat is the Lord's Prayer\nand the Shema Yisrael of Islam combined.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.995\nIt's just 29 words in Arabic,\n\n00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:47.860\nbut anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation.\n\n00:04:47.884 --> 00:04:51.651\nAnd yet the more you add,\nthe more seems to go missing.\n\n00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:57.434\nThe Arabic has an incantatory,\nalmost hypnotic quality\n\n00:04:57.458 --> 00:05:00.716\nthat begs to be heard rather than read,\n\n00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.510\nfelt more than analyzed.\n\n00:05:03.203 --> 00:05:05.262\nIt wants to be chanted out loud,\n\n00:05:05.286 --> 00:05:08.070\nto sound its music in the ear\nand on the tongue.\n\n00:05:08.713 --> 00:05:13.434\nSo the Koran in English\nis a kind of shadow of itself,\n\n00:05:13.458 --> 00:05:16.289\nor as Arthur Arberry called his version,\n\n00:05:16.313 --> 00:05:17.661\n\"an interpretation.\"\n\n00:05:19.458 --> 00:05:22.004\nBut all is not lost in translation.\n\n00:05:22.758 --> 00:05:25.434\nAs the Koran promises,\npatience is rewarded,\n\n00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:27.007\nand there are many surprises --\n\n00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:30.187\na degree of environmental\nawareness, for instance,\n\n00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:33.780\nand of humans as mere stewards\nof God's creation,\n\n00:05:33.804 --> 00:05:35.438\nunmatched in the Bible.\n\n00:05:36.307 --> 00:05:39.184\nAnd where the Bible is addressed\nexclusively to men,\n\n00:05:39.208 --> 00:05:41.834\nusing the second-\nand third-person masculine,\n\n00:05:41.858 --> 00:05:44.434\nthe Koran includes women --\n\n00:05:44.458 --> 00:05:45.882\ntalking, for instance,\n\n00:05:45.906 --> 00:05:48.330\nof believing men and believing women,\n\n00:05:48.354 --> 00:05:51.542\nhonorable men and honorable women.\n\n00:05:52.942 --> 00:05:56.919\nOr take the infamous verse\nabout killing the unbelievers.\n\n00:05:57.809 --> 00:05:59.434\nYes, it does say that,\n\n00:05:59.458 --> 00:06:02.184\nbut in a very specific context:\n\n00:06:02.208 --> 00:06:06.545\nthe anticipated conquest\nof the sanctuary city of Mecca,\n\n00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:09.093\nwhere fighting was usually forbidden.\n\n00:06:09.117 --> 00:06:12.640\nAnd the permission comes\nhedged about with qualifiers.\n\n00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:15.434\nNot \"You must kill unbelievers in Mecca,\"\n\n00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:17.697\nbut you can, you are allowed to,\n\n00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:22.092\nbut only after a grace period is over,\n\n00:06:22.116 --> 00:06:24.974\nand only if there's no other\npact in place,\n\n00:06:24.998 --> 00:06:28.434\nand only if they try to stop\nyou getting to the Kaaba,\n\n00:06:28.458 --> 00:06:31.174\nand only if they attack you first.\n\n00:06:31.198 --> 00:06:34.803\nAnd even then -- God is merciful;\n\n00:06:34.827 --> 00:06:36.856\nforgiveness is supreme --\n\n00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.598\nand so, essentially,\n\n00:06:39.622 --> 00:06:41.075\nbetter if you don't.\n\n00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:44.541\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:44.565 --> 00:06:47.328\nThis was perhaps the biggest surprise --\n\n00:06:47.352 --> 00:06:49.434\nhow flexible the Koran is,\n\n00:06:49.458 --> 00:06:53.143\nat least in minds that are not\nfundamentally inflexible.\n\n00:06:54.354 --> 00:06:58.001\n\"Some of these verses\nare definite in meaning,\" it says,\n\n00:06:58.025 --> 00:06:59.894\n\"and others are ambiguous.\"\n\n00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:04.641\nThe perverse at heart\nwill seek out the ambiguities,\n\n00:07:04.665 --> 00:07:09.294\ntrying to create discord\nby pinning down meanings of their own.\n\n00:07:09.318 --> 00:07:11.608\nOnly God knows the true meaning.\n\n00:07:12.989 --> 00:07:16.951\nThe phrase \"God is subtle\"\nappears again and again,\n\n00:07:16.975 --> 00:07:19.577\nand indeed, the whole\nof the Koran is far more subtle\n\n00:07:19.601 --> 00:07:22.105\nthan most of us have been led to believe.\n\n00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:27.197\nAs in, for instance, that little matter\nof virgins and paradise.\n\n00:07:28.402 --> 00:07:31.573\nOld-fashioned orientalism\ncomes into play here.\n\n00:07:32.549 --> 00:07:37.127\nThe word used four times is \"houris,\"\n\n00:07:37.151 --> 00:07:41.608\nrendered as dark-eyed maidens\nwith swelling breasts,\n\n00:07:41.632 --> 00:07:44.825\nor as fair, high-bosomed virgins.\n\n00:07:45.897 --> 00:07:50.458\nYet all there is in the original Arabic\nis that one word: houris.\n\n00:07:51.203 --> 00:07:53.707\nNot a swelling breast\nor high bosom in sight.\n\n00:07:53.731 --> 00:07:56.235\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:56.259 --> 00:08:00.816\nNow this may be a way of saying\n\"pure beings,\" like in angels,\n\n00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.853\nor it may be like\nthe Greek \"kouros\" or \"kore,\"\n\n00:08:03.877 --> 00:08:05.219\nan eternal youth.\n\n00:08:05.243 --> 00:08:07.979\nBut the truth is, nobody really knows.\n\n00:08:08.003 --> 00:08:09.247\nAnd that's the point.\n\n00:08:10.164 --> 00:08:12.580\nBecause the Koran is quite clear\n\n00:08:12.604 --> 00:08:17.434\nwhen it says that you'll be\n\"a new creation in paradise,\"\n\n00:08:17.458 --> 00:08:22.587\nand that you will be \"recreated\nin a form unknown to you,\"\n\n00:08:22.611 --> 00:08:25.146\nwhich seems to me\na far more appealing prospect\n\n00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:26.749\nthan a virgin.\n\n00:08:26.773 --> 00:08:33.745\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.261\nAnd that number 72 never appears.\n\n00:08:38.285 --> 00:08:41.951\nThere are no 72 virgins in the Koran.\n\n00:08:41.975 --> 00:08:45.220\nThat idea only came\ninto being 300 years later,\n\n00:08:45.244 --> 00:08:48.221\nand most Islamic scholars\nsee it as the equivalent\n\n00:08:48.245 --> 00:08:51.847\nof people with wings sitting on clouds\nand strumming harps.\n\n00:08:53.291 --> 00:08:55.936\nParadise is quite the opposite.\n\n00:08:56.809 --> 00:08:58.572\nIt's not virginity;\n\n00:08:58.596 --> 00:09:00.080\nit's fecundity;\n\n00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:02.162\nit's plenty.\n\n00:09:02.805 --> 00:09:06.563\nIt's gardens watered by running streams.\n\n00:09:08.218 --> 00:09:09.370\nThank you.\n\n00:09:09.394 --> 00:09:16.371\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Your brain on improv", "duration": "991", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/charles_limb_your_brain_on_improv", "transcript": "So I am a surgeon who studies creativity, and I have never had a patient tell me, \"I really want you to be creative during surgery,\" and so I guess there's a little bit of irony to it. I will say though that, after having done surgery a lot, it's similar to playing a musical instrument. And for me, this deep and enduring fascination with sound is what led me to both be a surgeon and to study the science of sound, particularly music. I'm going to talk over the next few minutes about my career in terms of how I'm able to study music and try to grapple with all these questions of how the brain is able to be creative. I've done most of this work at Johns Hopkins University, and at the National Institute of Health where I was previously. I'll go over some science experiments and cover three musical experiments.I will start off by playing a video for you. This video is of Keith Jarrett, who's a well-known jazz improviser and probably the most well-known, iconic example of someone who takes improvisation to a higher level. And he'll improvise entire concerts off the top of his head, and he'll never play it exactly the same way again, so as a form of intense creativity, I think this is a great example. And so why don't we go and click the video.(Music)(Music ends)It's really a remarkable thing that happens there. I've always as a listener, as a fan, I listen to that, and I'm astounded. I think \u2014 how can this possibly be? How can the brain generate that much information, that much music, spontaneously? And so I set out with this concept, scientifically, that artistic creativity, it's magical, but it's not magic, meaning that it's a product of the brain. There's not too many brain-dead people creating art. With this notion that artistic creativity is in fact a neurologic product, I took this thesis that we could study it just like we study any other complex neurologic process, and there are subquestions that I put there. Is it possible to study creativity scientifically? And I think that's a good question. And I'll tell you that most scientific studies of music, they're very dense, and when you go through them, it's very hard to recognize the music in it. In fact, they seem to be unmusical entirely and to miss the point of the music.This brings the second question: Why should scientists study creativity? Maybe we're not the right people to do it.(Laughter)Well it may be, but I will say that, from a scientific perspective, we talked a lot about innovation today, the science of innovation, how much we understand about how the brain is able to innovate is in its infancy, and truly, we know very little about how we are able to be creative. I think that we're going to see, over the next 10, 20, 30 years, a real science of creativity that's burgeoning and is going to flourish, Because we now have new methods that can enable us to take this process like complex jazz improvisation, and study it rigorously. So it gets down to the brain. All of us have this remarkable brain, which is poorly understood, to say the least. I think that neuroscientists have more questions than answers, and I'm not going to give you answers today, just ask a lot of questions.And that's what I do in my lab. I ask questions about what is the brain doing to enable us to do this. This is the main method that I use. This is functional MRI. If you've been in an MRI scanner, it's very much the same, but this one is outfitted in a special way to not just take pictures of your brain, but to also take pictures of active areas of the brain. The way that's done is by the following: There's something called BOLD imaging, which is Blood Oxygen Level Dependent imaging. When you're in an fMRI scanner, you're in a big magnet that's aligning your molecules in certain areas. When an area of the brain is active, meaning a neural area is active, it gets blood flow shunted to that area. That blood flow causes an increase in local blood to that area with a deoxyhemoglobin change in concentration. Deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by MRI, whereas oxyhemoglobin can't. So through this method of inference \u2014 and we're measuring blood flow, not neural activity \u2014 we say that an area of the brain that's getting more blood was active during a particular task, and that's the crux of how fMRI works. And it's been used since the '90s to study really complex processes.I'm going to review a study that I did, which was jazz in an fMRI scanner. It was done with a colleague, Alan Braun, at the NIH. This is a short video of how we did this project.(Video) Charles Limb: This is a plastic MIDI piano keyboard that we use for the jazz experiments. And it's a 35-key keyboard designed to fit both inside the scanner, be magnetically safe, have minimal interference that would contribute to any artifact, and have this cushion so that it can rest on the players' legs while they're lying down in the scanner, playing on their back. It works like this \u2014 this doesn't actually produce any sound. It sends out what's called a MIDI signal \u2014 or a Musical Instrument Digital Interface \u2014 through these wires into the box and then the computer, which then trigger high-quality piano samples like this.(Music)(Music)(Music ends)OK, so it works. And so through this piano keyboard, we have the means to take a musical process and study it. So what do you do now that you have this cool piano keyboard? You can't just say, \"It's great we have a keyboard.\" We have to come up with a scientific experiment. The experiment really rests on the following: What happens in the brain during something that's memorized and over-learned, and what happens in the brain during something that is spontaneously generated, or improvised, in a way that's matched motorically and in terms of lower-level sensory motor features?I have here what we call the paradigms. There's a scale paradigm, which is playing a scale up and down, memorized, then there's improvising on a scale, quarter notes, metronome, right hand \u2014 scientifically very safe, but musically really boring. Then there's the bottom one, which is called the jazz paradigm. So we brought professional jazz players to the NIH, and we had them memorize this piece of music on the lower-left, which is what you heard me playing \u2014 and we had them improvise to the same chord changes. And if you can hit that lower-right sound icon, that's an example of what was recorded in the scanner.(Music)(Music ends)In the end, it's not the most natural environment, but they're able to play real music. And I've listened to that solo 200 times, and I still like it. And the musicians were comfortable in the end. We first measured the number of notes. Were they playing more notes when they were improvising? That was not what was going on. And then we looked at the brain activity. I will try to condense this for you. These are contrast maps that are showing subtractions between what changes when you're improvising vs. when you're doing something memorized. In red is an area that's active in the prefrontal cortex, the frontal lobe of the brain, and in blue is this area that was deactivated. So we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex that went way up in activity. We had this broad patch of area called the lateral prefrontal cortex that went way down in activity, I'll summarize that for you.These are multifunctional areas of the brain, these are not the jazz areas of the brain. They do a whole host of things that have to do with self-reflection, introspection, working memory etc. Really, consciousness is seated in the frontal lobe. But we have this combination of an area that's thought to be involved in self-monitoring, turning off, and this area that's thought to be autobiographical, or self-expressive, turning on. We think, at least in this preliminary \u2014 it's one study; it's probably wrong, but it's one study \u2014(Laughter)we think that at least a reasonable hypothesis is that, to be creative, you should have this weird dissociation in your frontal lobe. One area turns on, and a big area shuts off, so that you're not inhibited, you're willing to make mistakes, so that you're not constantly shutting down all of these new generative impulses. Now a lot of people know that music is not always a solo activity \u2014 sometimes it's done communicatively.The next question was: What happens when musicians are trading back and forth, something called \"trading fours,\" which is something they do normally in a jazz experiment. So this is a 12-bar blues, and I've broken it down into four-bar groups, so you would know how you would trade. We brought a musician into the scanner, same way, had them memorize this melody then had another musician out in the control room trading back and forth interactively.So this is a musician, Mike Pope, one of the world's best bassists and a fantastic piano player.(Music)He's now playing the piece that we just saw a little better than I wrote it.(Video) CL: Mike, come on in.Mike Pope: May the force be with you.Nurse: Nothing in your pockets, Mike?MP: No. Nothing's in my pockets.CL: You have to have the right attitude to agree to do it.(Laughter)It's kind of fun, actually.(Music)Now we're playing back and forth. He's in there. You can see his legs up there.(Music)And then I'm in the control room here, playing back and forth.(Music)(Music ends)(Video) Mike Pope: This is a pretty good representation of what it's like. And it's good that it's not too quick. The fact that we do it over and over again lets you acclimate to your surroundings. So the hardest thing for me was the kinesthetic thing, looking at my hands through two mirrors, laying on my back, and not able to move at all except for my hand. That was challenging. But again \u2014 there were moments, for sure \u2014(Laughter)there were moments of real, honest-to-God musical interplay, for sure.CL: At this point, I'll take a few moments. So what you're seeing here \u2014 and I'm doing a cardinal sin in science, which is to show you preliminary data. This is one subject's data. This is, in fact, Mike Pope's data. So what am I showing you here? When he was trading fours with me, improvising vs. memorized, his language areas lit up, his Broca's area, in the inferior frontal gyrus on the left. He had it also homologous on the right. This is an area thought to be involved in expressive communication. This whole notion that music is a language \u2014 maybe there's a neurologic basis to it after all, and we can see it when two musicians are having a musical conversation. So we've done this on eight subjects now, and we're getting all the data together, hopefully we'll have something to say about it meaningfully.Now when I think about improvisation and the language, what's next? Rap, of course, rap \u2014 freestyle. I've always been fascinated by freestyle. And let's play this video.(Video) Mos Def: Brown skin I be, standing five-ten I be Rockin' it when I be, in your vicinity Whole-style synergy, recognize symmetry Go and try to injure me, broke 'em down chemically Ain't the number 10 MC, talk about how been I be Styled it like Kennedy, late like a 10 to three When I say when I be, girls say bend that key cutCL: So there's a lot of analogy between what takes place in freestyle rap and jazz. There are a lot of correlates between the two forms of music, I think, in different time periods, in lot of ways, rap serves the same social function that jazz used to serve. So how do you study rap scientifically? And my colleagues think I'm crazy, but I think it's very viable. This is what you do: You have a freestyle artist come and memorize a rap that you write for them, that they've never heard before, and then you have them freestyle. So I told my lab members that I would rap for TED, and they said, \"No, you won't.\" And then I thought \u2014(Laughter)(Applause)But here's the thing. With this big screen, you can all rap with me. OK? So what we had them do was memorize this lower-left sound icon, please. This is the control condition. This is what they memorized.Computer: Memory, thump.CL: Thump of the beat in a known repeat Rhythm and rhyme, they make me complete The climb is sublime when I'm on the mic Spittin' rhymes that hit you like a lightning strikeComputer: Search.CL: I search for the truth in this eternal quest My passion's not fashion, you can see how I'm dressed Psychopathic words in my head appear Whisper these lyrics only I can hearComputer: Art.CL: The art of discovering and that which is hovering Inside the mind of those unconfined All of these words keep pouring out like rain I need a mad scientist to check my brainComputer: Stop.(Applause)I guarantee you that will never happen again.(Laughter)So now, what's great about these free-stylers, they will get cued different words. They don't know what's coming, but they'll hear something off the cuff. Go hit that right sound icon, there will be cued three square words: like, not and head. He doesn't know what's coming. Computer: Like.Freestyler: I'm like some kind of extraterrestrial, celestial scene Back in the days, I used to sit in pyramids and meditateWith two microphones \u2014 Computer: Head hovering over my head See if I could still listen, spittin' off the sound See what you grinning I teach the children in the back of the classroom About the message of apocalypticalComputer: Not. Not really though, 'cause I've got to keep it simple instrumental Detrimental playing Super Mario boxes [unclear] hip hopComputer: Stop.CL: It's an incredible thing that's taking place. It's doing something neurologically remarkable. Whether or not you like the music is irrelevant. Creatively speaking, it's just a phenomenal thing. This is a short video of how we do this in a scanner.[fMRI of Hip-Hop Rap](Laughter)(Video) CL: We're here with Emmanuel.CL: That was recorded in the scanner, by the way.(Video) CL: That's Emmanuel in the scanner. He's just memorized a rhyme for us.[Control Condition Memorized Verses]Emmanuel: Top of the beat with no repeat Rhythm and rhyme make me complete Climb is sublime when I'm on the mic Spittin' rhymes that'll hit you like a lightning strikeComputer: Search. I search for the truth in this eternal quest I'm passing on fashion; you can see how I'm dressedCL: I'm going to stop that there; so what do we see in his brain? This is four rappers' brains. And we do see language areas lighting up, but then, eyes closed \u2014 when you are freestyling vs. memorizing, you've got major visual areas lighting up. You've got major cerebellar activity, which is involved in motor coordination. You have heightened brain activity when you're doing a comparable task, when that one task is creative and the other task is memorized. It's very preliminary, but I think it's kind of cool.To conclude, we've got a lot of questions to ask, and like I said, we'll ask questions here, not answer them. But we want to get at the root of what is creative genius neurologically, and I think, with these methods, we're getting close. And I think, hopefully in the next 10, 20 years, you'll see real, meaningful studies that say science has to catch up to art, and maybe we're starting now to get there.Thank you for your time, I appreciate it.(Applause)", "id": 1046, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.743 --> 00:00:15.216\nSo I am a surgeon who studies creativity,\n\n00:00:15.240

--> 00:00:36.813\nand to study the science\nof sound, particularly music.\n\n00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:38.886\nI'm going to talk\nover the next few minutes\n\n00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.201\nabout my career\n\n00:00:40.225 --> 00:00:42.509\nin terms of how I'm able to study music\n\n00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.567\nand try to grapple\nwith all these questions\n\n00:00:44.591 --> 00:00:46.934\nof how the brain is able to be creative.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.588\nI've done most of this work\nat Johns Hopkins University,\n\n00:00:49.612 --> 00:00:52.597\nand at the National Institute\nof Health where I was previously.\n\n00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:56.128\nI'll go over some science experiments\nand cover three musical experiments.\n\n00:00:56.152 --> 00:00:58.208\nI will start off by playing\na video for you.\n\n00:00:58.232 --> 00:01:01.335\nThis video is of Keith Jarrett,\nwho's a well-known jazz improviser\n\n00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.803\nand probably the most\nwell-known, iconic example\n\n00:01:03.827 --> 00:01:06.320\nof someone who takes improvisation\nto a higher level.\n\n00:01:06.344 --> 00:01:09.483\nAnd he'll improvise entire concerts\noff the top of his head,\n\n00:01:09.507 --> 00:01:11.912\nand he'll never play it\nexactly the same way again,\n\n00:01:11.936 --> 00:01:13.921\nso as a form of intense creativity,\n\n00:01:13.945 --> 00:01:15.563\nI think this is a great example.\n\n00:01:15.587 --> 00:01:17.934\nAnd so why don't we go\nand click the video.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:21.958\n(Music)\n\n00:02:13.753 --> 00:02:15.754\n(Music ends)\n\n00:02:15.778 --> 00:02:18.117\nIt's really a remarkable\nthing that happens there.\n\n00:02:18.141 --> 00:02:19.869\nI've always as a listener, as a fan,\n\n00:02:19.893 --> 00:02:21.610\nI listen to that, and I'm astounded.\n\n00:02:21.634 --> 00:02:23.370\nI think -- how can this possibly be?\n\n00:02:23.394 --> 00:02:25.685\nHow can the brain generate\nthat much information,\n\n00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.294\nthat much music, spontaneously?\n\n00:02:27.318 --> 00:02:29.934\nAnd so I set out\nwith this concept, scientifically,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:34.309\nthat artistic creativity,\nit's magical, but it's not magic,\n\n00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:36.340\nmeaning that it's a product of the brain.\n\n00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:38.798\nThere's not too many brain-dead\npeople creating art.\n\n00:02:38.822 --> 00:02:42.453\nWith this notion that artistic creativity\nis in fact a neurologic product,\n\n00:02:42.477 --> 00:02:44.934\nI took this thesis that we could study it\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:48.072\njust like we study any other\ncomplex neurologic process,\n\n00:02:48.096 --> 00:02:50.151\nand there are subquestions\nthat I put there.\n\n00:02:50.175 --> 00:02:52.561\nIs it possible to study\ncreativity scientifically?\n\n00:02:52.585 --> 00:02:54.622\nAnd I think that's a good question.\n\n00:02:54.646 --> 00:02:57.332\nAnd I'll tell you that most\nscientific studies of music,\n\n00:02:57.356 --> 00:02:58.874\nthey're very dense,\n\n00:02:58.898 --> 00:03:00.293\nand when you go through them,\n\n00:03:00.317 --> 00:03:02.387\nit's very hard to recognize\nthe music in it.\n\n00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:04.630\nIn fact, they seem to be\nunmusical entirely\n\n00:03:04.654 --> 00:03:06.448\nand to miss the point of the music.\n\n00:03:06.472 --> 00:03:08.028\nThis brings the second question:\n\n00:03:08.052 --> 00:03:09.934\nWhy should scientists study creativity?\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.037\nMaybe we're not the right people to do it.\n\n00:03:12.061 --> 00:03:13.060\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:13.084 --> 00:03:16.536\nWell it may be, but I will say that,\nfrom a scientific perspective,\n\n00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.578\nwe talked a lot about innovation today,\n\n00:03:18.602 --> 00:03:19.934\nthe science of innovation,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.911\nhow much we understand\nabout how the brain is able to innovate\n\n00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:24.179\nis in its infancy,\n\n00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:27.670\nand truly, we know very little\nabout how we are able to be creative.\n\n00:03:27.694 --> 00:03:29.218\nI think that we're going to see,\n\n00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:30.934\nover the next 10, 20, 30 years,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.129\na real science of creativity\nthat's burgeoning\n\n00:03:33.153 --> 00:03:34.354\nand is going to flourish,\n\n00:03:34.378 --> 00:03:36.810\nBecause we now have new methods\nthat can enable us\n\n00:03:36.834 --> 00:03:39.358\nto take this process\nlike complex jazz improvisation,\n\n00:03:39.382 --> 00:03:40.756\nand study it rigorously.\n\n00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.927\nSo it gets down to the brain.\n\n00:03:42.951 --> 00:03:44.745\nAll of us have this remarkable brain,\n\n00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.224\nwhich is poorly understood,\nto say the least.\n\n00:03:47.248 --> 00:03:51.446\nI think that neuroscientists\nhave more questions than answers,\n\n00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.672\nand I'm not going\nto give you answers today,\n\n00:03:53.696 --> 00:03:55.057\njust ask a lot of questions.\n\n00:03:55.081 --> 00:03:56.588\nAnd that's what I do in my lab.\n\n00:03:56.612 --> 00:03:59.926\nI ask questions about what is the brain\ndoing to enable us to do this.\n\n00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.727\nThis is the main method that I use.\nThis is functional MRI.\n\n00:04:02.751 --> 00:04:05.474\nIf you've been in an MRI scanner,\nit's very much the same,\n\n00:04:05.498 --> 00:04:09.413\nbut this one is outfitted in a special way\nto not just take pictures of your brain,\n\n00:04:09.437 --> 00:04:12.364\nbut to also take pictures\nof active areas of the brain.\n\n00:04:12.388 --> 00:04:14.293\nThe way that's done is by the following:\n\n00:04:14.317 --> 00:04:16.127\nThere's something called BOLD imaging,\n\n00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:18.550\nwhich is Blood Oxygen\nLevel Dependent imaging.\n\n00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.824\nWhen you're in an fMRI scanner,\nyou're in a big magnet\n\n00:04:21.848 --> 00:04:24.221\nthat's aligning your molecules\nin certain areas.\n\n00:04:24.245 --> 00:04:27.964\nWhen an area of the brain is active,\nmeaning a neural area is active,\n\n00:04:27.988 --> 00:04:30.226\nit gets blood flow shunted to that area.\n\n00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.600\nThat blood flow causes an increase\nin local blood to that area\n\n00:04:34.624 --> 00:04:37.607\nwith a deoxyhemoglobin\nchange in concentration.\n\n00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:39.786\nDeoxyhemoglobin can be detected by MRI,\n\n00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.660\nwhereas oxyhemoglobin can't.\n\n00:04:41.684 --> 00:04:43.638\nSo through this method of inference --\n\n00:04:43.662 --> 00:04:46.204\nand we're measuring blood flow,\nnot neural activity --\n\n00:04:46.228 --> 00:04:48.964\nwe say that an area of the brain\nthat's getting more blood\n\n00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:52.530\nwas active during a particular task,\nand that's the crux of how fMRI works.\n\n00:04:52.554 --> 00:04:56.459\nAnd it's been used since the '90s\nto study really complex processes.\n\n00:04:56.483 --> 00:04:59.983\nI'm going to review a study that I did,\nwhich was jazz in an fMRI scanner.\n\n00:05:00.007 --> 00:05:02.510\nIt was done with a colleague,\nAlan Braun, at the NIH.\n\n00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:04.934\nThis is a short video\nof how we did this project.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.739\n(Video) Charles Limb: This is a plastic\nMIDI piano keyboard\n\n00:05:07.763 --> 00:05:09.544\nthat we use for the jazz experiments.\n\n00:05:09.568 --> 00:05:11.621\nAnd it's a 35-key keyboard\n\n00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:14.105\ndesigned to fit both inside the scanner,\n\n00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:15.465\nbe magnetically safe,\n\n00:05:15.489 --> 00:05:19.331\nhave minimal interference\nthat would contribute to any artifact,\n\n00:05:19.355 --> 00:05:22.275\nand have this cushion\nso that it can rest on the players' legs\n\n00:05:22.299 --> 00:05:25.254\nwhile they're lying down in the scanner,\nplaying on their back.\n\n00:05:25.278 --> 00:05:28.307\nIt works like this --\nthis doesn't actually produce any sound.\n\n00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:30.774\nIt sends out what's called\na MIDI signal --\n\n00:05:30.798 --> 00:05:32.847\nor a Musical Instrument\nDigital Interface --\n\n00:05:32.871 --> 00:05:35.532\nthrough these wires into the box\nand then the computer,\n\n00:05:35.556 --> 00:05:38.491\nwhich then trigger\nhigh-quality piano samples like this.\n\n00:05:38.515 --> 00:05:41.756\n(Music)\n\n00:05:45.007 --> 00:05:48.761\n(Music)\n\n00:06:04.291 --> 00:06:06.266\n(Music ends)\n\n00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.934\nOK, so it works.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.934\nAnd so through this piano keyboard,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.701\nwe have the means to take\na musical process and study it.\n\n00:06:12.725 --> 00:06:15.652\nSo what do you do now that you have\nthis cool piano keyboard?\n\n00:06:15.676 --> 00:06:18.121\nYou can't just say,\n\"It's great we have a keyboard.\"\n\n00:06:18.145 --> 00:06:20.469\nWe have to come up\nwith a scientific experiment.\n\n00:06:20.493 --> 00:06:22.616\nThe experiment\nreally rests on the following:\n\n00:06:22.887 --> 00:06:26.531\nWhat happens in the brain during something\nthat's memorized and over-learned,\n\n00:06:26.555 --> 00:06:28.710\nand what happens in the brain\nduring something\n\n00:06:28.734 --> 00:06:31.008\nthat is spontaneously\ngenerated, or improvised,\n\n00:06:31.032 --> 00:06:32.846\nin a way that's matched motorically\n\n00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.715\nand in terms of lower-level\nsensory motor features?\n\n00:06:35.739 --> 00:06:38.334\nI have here what we call the paradigms.\n\n00:06:38.358 --> 00:06:41.854\nThere's a scale paradigm, which is playing\na scale up and down, memorized,\n\n00:06:41.878 --> 00:06:43.612\nthen there's improvising on a scale,\n\n00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:45.673\nquarter notes, metronome, right hand --\n\n00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:47.268\nscientifically very safe,\n\n00:06:47.292 --> 00:06:49.165\nbut musically really boring.\n\n00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:52.160\nThen there's the bottom one,\nwhich is called the jazz paradigm.\n\n00:06:52.184 --> 00:06:54.588\nSo we brought professional\njazz players to the NIH,\n\n00:06:54.612 --> 00:06:57.565\nand we had them memorize\nthis piece of music on the lower-left,\n\n00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:59.407\nwhich is what you heard me playing --\n\n00:06:59.431 --> 00:07:01.924\nand we had them improvise\nto the same chord changes.\n\n00:07:01.948 --> 00:07:04.156\nAnd if you can hit\nthat lower-right sound icon,\n\n00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.008\nthat's an example\nof what was recorded in the scanner.\n\n00:07:07.032 --> 00:07:10.762\n(Music)\n\n00:07:31.762 --> 00:07:33.763\n(Music ends)\n\n00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:36.203\nIn the end, it's not the most\nnatural environment,\n\n00:07:36.227 --> 00:07:38.133\nbut they're able to play real music.\n\n00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:40.128\nAnd I've listened to that solo 200 times,\n\n00:07:40.152 --> 00:07:41.329\nand I still like it.\n\n00:07:41.353 --> 00:07:43.740\nAnd the musicians\nwere comfortable in the end.\n\n00:07:43.764 --> 00:07:45.588\nWe first measured the number of notes.\n\n00:07:45.612 --> 00:07:48.269\nWere they playing more notes\nwhen they were improvising?\n\n00:07:48.293 --> 00:07:49.883\nThat was not what was going on.\n\n00:07:49.907 --> 00:07:51.892\nAnd then we looked at the brain activity.\n\n00:07:51.916 --> 00:07:53.724\nI will try to condense this for you.\n\n00:07:53.748 --> 00:07:57.228\nThese are contrast maps that are showing\nsubtractions between what changes\n\n00:07:57.252 --> 00:08:00.348\nwhen you're improvising\nvs. when you're doing something memorized.\n\n00:08:00.372 --> 00:08:03.157\nIn red is an area that's active\nin the prefrontal cortex,\n\n00:08:03.181 --> 00:08:04.640\nthe frontal lobe of the brain,\n\n00:08:04.664 --> 00:08:06.843\nand in blue is this area\nthat was deactivated.\n\n00:08:06.867 --> 00:08:09.743\nSo we had this focal area\ncalled the medial prefrontal cortex\n\n00:08:09.767 --> 00:08:11.154\nthat went way up in activity.\n\n00:08:11.178 --> 00:08:14.408\nWe had this broad patch of area\ncalled the lateral prefrontal cortex\n\n00:08:14.432 --> 00:08:15.957\nthat went way down in activity,\n\n00:08:15.981 --> 00:08:17.469\nI'll summarize that for you.\n\n00:08:17.493 --> 00:08:19.601\nThese are multifunctional\nareas of the brain,\n\n00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:21.780\nthese are not the jazz areas of the brain.\n\n00:08:21.804 --> 00:08:23.732\nThey do a whole host of things\n\n00:08:23.756 --> 00:08:25.615\nthat have to do with self-reflection,\n\n00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:27.999\nintrospection, working memory etc.\n\n00:08:28.023 --> 00:08:30.510\nReally, consciousness is seated\nin the frontal lobe.\n\n00:08:30.534 --> 00:08:32.568\nBut we have this combination\n\n00:08:32.592 --> 00:08:36.041\nof an area that's thought to be involved\nin self-monitoring, turning off,\n\n00:08:36.065 --> 00:08:38.528\nand this area that's thought\nto be autobiographical,\n\n00:08:38.552 --> 00:08:40.087\nor self-expressive, turning on.\n\n00:08:40.111 --> 00:08:42.182\nWe think, at least in this preliminary --\n\n00:08:42.206 --> 00:08:44.959\nit's one study; it's probably wrong,\nbut it's one study --\n\n00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:46.022\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:46.046 --> 00:08:48.777\nwe think that at least\na reasonable hypothesis\n\n00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:49.962\nis that, to be creative,\n\n00:08:49.986 --> 00:08:52.862\nyou should have this weird dissociation\nin your frontal lobe.\n\n00:08:52.886 --> 00:08:55.410\nOne area turns on,\nand a big area shuts off,\n\n00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:58.372\nso that you're not inhibited,\nyou're willing to make mistakes,\n\n00:08:58.396 --> 00:09:00.564\nso that you're not constantly\nshutting down\n\n00:09:00.588 --> 00:09:02.513\nall of these new generative impulses.\n\n00:09:02.537 --> 00:09:05.982\nNow a lot of people know that music\nis not always a solo activity --\n\n00:09:06.006 --> 00:09:07.726\nsometimes it's done communicatively.\n\n00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:08.934\nThe next question was:\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.530\nWhat happens when musicians\nare trading back and forth,\n\n00:09:11.554 --> 00:09:13.167\nsomething called \"trading fours,\"\n\n00:09:13.191 --> 00:09:16.014\nwhich is something they do\nnormally in a jazz experiment.\n\n00:09:16.038 --> 00:09:17.451\nSo this is a 12-bar blues,\n\n00:09:17.475 --> 00:09:19.584\nand I've broken it\ndown into four-bar groups,\n\n00:09:19.608 --> 00:09:21.420\nso you would know how you would trade.\n\n00:09:21.444 --> 00:09:23.730\nWe brought a musician\ninto the scanner, same way,\n\n00:09:23.754 --> 00:09:25.166\nhad them memorize this melody\n\n00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.756\nthen had another musician\nout in the control room\n\n00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.749\ntrading back and forth interactively.\n\n00:09:29.773 --> 00:09:32.397\nSo this is a musician, Mike Pope,\n\n00:09:32.421 --> 00:09:35.507\none of the world's best bassists\nand a fantastic piano player.\n\n00:09:35.531 --> 00:09:41.790\n(Music)\n\n00:09:41.814 --> 00:09:44.180\nHe's now playing the piece\nthat we just saw\n\n00:09:44.204 --> 00:09:45.934\na little better than I wrote it.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.724\n(Video) CL: Mike, come on in.\n\n00:09:47.748 --> 00:09:49.518\nMike Pope: May the force be with you.\n\n00:09:49.542 --> 00:09:51.308\nNurse: Nothing in your pockets, Mike?\n\n00:09:51.332 --> 00:09:52.875\nMP: No. Nothing's in my pockets.\n\n00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:05.313\nCL: You have to have the right\nattitude to agree to do it.\n\n00:10:05.337 --> 00:10:06.593\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:06.617 --> 00:10:08.432\nIt's kind of fun, actually.\n\n00:10:08.456 --> 00:10:10.055\n(Music)\n\n00:10:10.079 --> 00:10:11.778\nNow we're playing back and forth.\n\n00:10:11.802 --> 00:10:14.014\nHe's in there.\nYou can see his legs up there.\n\n00:10:14.038 --> 00:10:15.380\n(Music)\n\n00:10:15.404 --> 00:10:18.594\nAnd then I'm in the control room here,\nplaying back and forth.\n\n00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:25.618\n(Music)\n\n00:10:28.088 --> 00:10:29.238\n(Music ends)\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:33.302\n(Video) Mike Pope:\nThis is a pretty good representation\n\n00:10:33.326 --> 00:10:35.110\nof what it's like.\n\n00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:37.134\nAnd it's good that it's not too quick.\n\n00:10:37.158 --> 00:10:39.737\nThe fact that we do it over and over again\n\n00:10:39.761 --> 00:10:43.031\nlets you acclimate to your surroundings.\n\n00:10:43.991 --> 00:10:46.649\nSo the hardest thing for me\nwas the kinesthetic thing,\n\n00:10:46.673 --> 00:10:49.934\nlooking at my hands through two mirrors,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.934\nlaying on my back,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.636\nand not able to move at all\nexcept for my hand.\n\n00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.532\nThat was challenging.\n\n00:10:56.556 --> 00:10:57.706\nBut again --\n\n00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.696\nthere were moments, for sure --\n\n00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.721\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:07.108\nthere were moments of real, honest-to-God\nmusical interplay, for sure.\n\n00:11:07.744 --> 00:11:09.746\nCL: At this point,\nI'll take a few moments.\n\n00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.651\nSo what you're seeing here --\n\n00:11:11.675 --> 00:11:13.752\nand I'm doing a cardinal sin in science,\n\n00:11:13.776 --> 00:11:15.586\nwhich is to show you preliminary data.\n\n00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.363\nThis is one subject's data.\n\n00:11:17.387 --> 00:11:19.134\nThis is, in fact, Mike Pope's data.\n\n00:11:19.158 --> 00:11:20.634\nSo what am I showing you here?\n\n00:11:20.658 --> 00:11:24.769\nWhen he was trading fours with me,\nimprovising vs. memorized,\n\n00:11:24.793 --> 00:11:27.542\nhis language areas lit up,\nhis Broca's area,\n\n00:11:27.566 --> 00:11:29.628\nin the inferior frontal gyrus on the left.\n\n00:11:29.652 --> 00:11:31.561\nHe had it also homologous on the right.\n\n00:11:31.585 --> 00:11:34.744\nThis is an area thought to be\ninvolved in expressive communication.\n\n00:11:34.768 --> 00:11:36.896\nThis whole notion\nthat music is a language --\n\n00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.219\nmaybe there's a neurologic\nbasis to it after all,\n\n00:11:39.243 --> 00:11:42.597\nand we can see it when two musicians\nare having a musical conversation.\n\n00:11:42.621 --> 00:11:44.594\nSo we've done this on eight subjects now,\n\n00:11:44.618 --> 00:11:46.547\nand we're getting all the data together,\n\n00:11:46.571 --> 00:11:49.396\nhopefully we'll have something\nto say about it meaningfully.\n\n00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.663\nNow when I think about improvisation\nand the language, what's next?\n\n00:11:52.687 --> 00:11:54.934\nRap, of course, rap -- freestyle.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.705\nI've always been fascinated by freestyle.\n\n00:11:57.729 --> 00:11:59.242\nAnd let's play this video.\n\n00:11:59.266 --> 00:12:02.104\n(Video) Mos Def: Brown skin I be,\nstanding five-ten I be\n\n00:12:02.128 --> 00:12:04.150\nRockin' it when I be, in your vicinity\n\n00:12:04.174 --> 00:12:07.194\nWhole-style synergy, recognize symmetry\n\n00:12:07.218 --> 00:12:09.552\nGo and try to injure me,\nbroke 'em down chemically\n\n00:12:09.576 --> 00:12:12.005\nAin't the number 10 MC,\ntalk about how been I be\n\n00:12:12.029 --> 00:12:14.427\nStyled it like Kennedy,\nlate like a 10 to three\n\n00:12:14.451 --> 00:12:17.269\nWhen I say when I be,\ngirls say bend that key cut\n\n00:12:17.293 --> 00:12:19.111\nCL: So there's a lot of analogy\n\n00:12:19.135 --> 00:12:21.591\nbetween what takes place\nin freestyle rap and jazz.\n\n00:12:21.615 --> 00:12:24.532\nThere are a lot of correlates\nbetween the two forms of music,\n\n00:12:24.556 --> 00:12:27.003\nI think, in different time periods,\nin lot of ways,\n\n00:12:27.027 --> 00:12:29.858\nrap serves the same social function\nthat jazz used to serve.\n\n00:12:29.882 --> 00:12:31.775\nSo how do you study rap scientifically?\n\n00:12:31.799 --> 00:12:34.934\nAnd my colleagues think I'm crazy,\nbut I think it's very viable.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.185\nThis is what you do:\n\n00:12:36.209 --> 00:12:38.956\nYou have a freestyle artist come\nand memorize a rap\n\n00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.201\nthat you write for them,\n\n00:12:40.225 --> 00:12:43.657\nthat they've never heard before,\nand then you have them freestyle.\n\n00:12:43.681 --> 00:12:46.099\nSo I told my lab members\nthat I would rap for TED,\n\n00:12:46.123 --> 00:12:47.765\nand they said, \"No, you won't.\"\n\n00:12:47.789 --> 00:12:48.992\nAnd then I thought --\n\n00:12:49.016 --> 00:12:50.332\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:50.356 --> 00:12:56.082\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:56.106 --> 00:12:57.386\nBut here's the thing.\n\n00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.311\nWith this big screen,\nyou can all rap with me. OK?\n\n00:13:00.335 --> 00:13:02.179\nSo what we had them do\n\n00:13:02.203 --> 00:13:04.799\nwas memorize this lower-left\nsound icon, please.\n\n00:13:04.823 --> 00:13:07.716\nThis is the control condition.\nThis is what they memorized.\n\n00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.773\nComputer: Memory, thump.\n\n00:13:09.797 --> 00:13:11.934\nCL: Thump of the beat in a known repeat\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.934\nRhythm and rhyme, they make me complete\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.054\nThe climb is sublime when I'm on the mic\n\n00:13:17.078 --> 00:13:19.634\nSpittin' rhymes that hit you\nlike a lightning strike\n\n00:13:19.658 --> 00:13:20.822\nComputer: Search.\n\n00:13:20.846 --> 00:13:23.190\nCL: I search for the truth\nin this eternal quest\n\n00:13:23.214 --> 00:13:25.944\nMy passion's not fashion,\nyou can see how I'm dressed\n\n00:13:25.968 --> 00:13:27.934\nPsychopathic words in my head appear\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.196\nWhisper these lyrics only I can hear\n\n00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.392\nComputer: Art.\n\n00:13:31.416 --> 00:13:34.046\nCL: The art of discovering\nand that which is hovering\n\n00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.934\nInside the mind of those unconfined\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.934\nAll of these words keep\npouring out like rain\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.693\nI need a mad scientist to check my brain\n\n00:13:41.717 --> 00:13:43.024\nComputer: Stop.\n\n00:13:43.048 --> 00:13:50.048\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:52.228 --> 00:13:54.402\nI guarantee you\nthat will never happen again.\n\n00:13:54.426 --> 00:13:56.367\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:56.391 --> 00:13:58.579\nSo now, what's great\nabout these free-stylers,\n\n00:13:58.603 --> 00:14:00.465\nthey will get cued different words.\n\n00:14:00.489 --> 00:14:01.933\nThey don't know what's coming,\n\n00:14:01.957 --> 00:14:03.873\nbut they'll hear something off the cuff.\n\n00:14:03.897 --> 00:14:05.306\nGo hit that right sound icon,\n\n00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.050\nthere will be cued three square words:\nlike, not and head.\n\n00:14:08.074 --> 00:14:10.228\nHe doesn't know what's coming.\nComputer: Like.\n\n00:14:10.252 --> 00:14:12.022\nFreestyler: I'm like some kind of\n\n00:14:12.046 --> 00:14:14.275\nextraterrestrial, celestial scene\n\n00:14:14.299 --> 00:14:17.136\nBack in the days, I used to sit\nin pyramids and

"https://www.ted.com/talks/deborah_rhodes", "transcript": "There are two groups of women when it comes to screening mammography \u2014 women in whom mammography works very well and has saved thousands of lives and women in whom it doesn't work well at all. Do you know which group you're in? If you don't, you're not alone. Because the breast has become a very political organ. The truth has become lost in all the rhetoric coming from the press, politicians, radiologists and medical imaging companies. I will do my best this morning to tell you what I think is the truth. But first, my disclosures. I am not a breast cancer survivor. I'm not a radiologist. I don't have any patents, and I've never received any money from a medical imaging company, and I am not seeking your vote.(Laughter)What I am is a doctor of internal medicine who became passionately interested in this topic about 10 years ago when a patient asked me a question. She came to see me after discovering a breast lump. Her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer in her 40s. She and I were both very pregnant at that time, and my heart just ached for her, imagining how afraid she must be. Fortunately, her lump proved to be benign. But she asked me a question: how confident was I that I would find a tumor early on her mammogram if she developed one? So I studied her mammogram, and I reviewed the radiology literature, and I was shocked to discover that, in her case, our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram were less than the toss of a coin.You may recall a year ago when a firestorm erupted after the United States Preventive Services Task Force reviewed the world's mammography screening literature and issued a guideline recommending against screening mammograms in women in their 40s. Now everybody rushed to criticize the Task Force, even though most of them weren't in anyway familiar with the mammography studies. It took the Senate just 17 days to ban the use of the guidelines in determining insurance coverage. Radiologists were outraged by the guidelines. The pre-eminent mammographer in the United States issued the following quote to the Washington Post. The radiologists were, in turn, criticized for protecting their own financial self-interest. But in my view, the radiologists are heroes. There's a shortage of radiologists qualified to read mammograms, and that's because mammograms are one of the most complex of all radiology studies to interpret, and because radiologists are sued more often over missed breast cancer than any other cause. But that very fact is telling.Where there is this much legal smoke, there is likely to be some fire. The factor most responsible for that fire is breast density. Breast density refers to the relative amount of fat \u2014 pictured here in yellow \u2014 versus connective and epithelial tissues \u2014 pictured in pink. And that proportion is primarily genetically determined. Two-thirds of women in their 40s have dense breast tissue, which is why mammography doesn't work as well in them. And although breast density generally declines with age, up to a third of women retain dense breast tissue for years after menopause.So how do you know if your breasts are dense? Well, you need to read the details of your mammography report. Radiologists classify breast density into four categories based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram. If the breast is less than 25 percent dense, that's called fatty-replaced. The next category is scattered fibroglandular densities, followed by heterogeneously dense and extremely dense. And breasts that fall into these two categories are considered dense. The problem with breast density is that it's truly the wolf in sheep's clothing. Both tumors and dense breast tissue appear white on a mammogram, and the X-ray often can't distinguish between the two. So it's easy to see this tumor in the upper part of this fatty breast. But imagine how difficult it would be to find that tumor in this dense breast. That's why mammograms find over 80 percent of tumors in fatty breasts, but as few as 40 percent in extremely dense breasts.Now it's bad enough that breast density makes it hard to find a cancer, but it turns out that it's also a powerful predictor of your risk for breast cancer. It's a stronger risk factor than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer. At the time my patient posed this question to me, breast density was an obscure topic in the radiology literature, and very few women having mammograms, or the physicians ordering them, knew about this. But what else could I offer her?Mammograms have been around since the 1960's, and it's changed very little. There have been surprisingly few innovations, until digital mammography was approved in 2000. Digital mammography is still an X-ray of the breast, but the images can be stored and manipulated digitally, just like we can with a digital camera. The U.S. has invested four billion dollars converting to digital mammography equipment, and what have we gained from that investment? In a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars, digital mammography was found to be no better over all than traditional mammography, and in fact, it was worse in older women. But it was better in one group, and that was women under 50 who were pre-menopausal and had dense breasts, and in those women, digital mammography found twice as many cancers, but it still only found 60 percent. So digital mammography has been a giant leap forward for manufacturers of digital mammography equipment, but it's been a very small step forward for womankind.What about ultrasound? Ultrasound generates more biopsies that are unnecessary relative to other technologies, so it's not widely used. And MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors, but it's also very expensive. If we think about disruptive technology, we see an almost ubiquitous pattern of the technology getting smaller and less expensive. Think about iPods compared to stereos. But it's the exact opposite in health care. The machines get ever bigger and ever more expensive. Screening the average young woman with an MRI is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer. It's just way too much equipment. One MRI scan costs 10 times what a digital mammogram costs. And sooner or later, we're going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation can't always come at a much higher price.Malcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker on innovation, and he made the case that scientific discoveries are rarely the product of one individual's genius. Rather, big ideas can be orchestrated, if you can simply gather people with different perspectives in a room and get them to talk about things that they don't ordinarily talk about. It's like the essence of TED. He quotes one innovator who says, \"The only time a physician and a physicist get together is when the physicist gets sick.\" (Laughter) This makes no sense, because physicians have all kinds of problems that they don't realize have solutions. And physicists have all kinds of solutions for things that they don't realize are problems. Now, take a look at this cartoon that accompanied Gladwell's article, and tell me if you see something disturbing about this depiction of innovative thinkers.(Laughter)So if you will allow me a little creative license, I will tell you the story of the serendipitous collision of my patient's problem with a physicist's solution. Shortly after her visit, I was introduced to a nuclear physicist at Mayo named Michael O'Conner, who was a specialist in cardiac imaging, something I had nothing to do with. And he happened to tell me about a conference he'd just returned from in Israel, where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector. Now gamma imaging has been around for a long time to image the heart, and it had even been tried to image the breast. But the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge, bulky tubes, and they were filled with these scintillating crystals, and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors. But the potential advantage was that gamma rays, unlike X-rays, are not influenced by breast density. But this technology could not find tumors when they're small, and finding a small tumor is critical for survival. If you can find a tumor when it's less than a centimeter, survival exceeds 90 percent, but drops off rapidly as tumor size increases. But Michael told me about a new type of gamma detector that he'd seen, and this is it. It's made not of a bulky tube, but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material that serves as the gamma detector. And I started talking to him about this problem with breast density, and we realized that we might be able to get this detector close enough around the breast to actually find small tumors.So after putting together a grid of these cubes with tape \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 Michael hacked off the X-ray plate of a mammography machine that was about to be thrown out, and we attached the new detector, and we decided to call this machine Molecular Breast Imaging, or MBI. This is an image from our first patient. And you can see, using the old gamma technology, that it just looked like noise. But using our new detector, we could begin to see the outline of a tumor.So here we were, a nuclear physicist, an internist, soon joined by Carrie Hruska, a biomedical engineer, and two radiologists, and we were trying to take on the entrenched world of mammography with a machine that was held together by duct tape. To say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement, but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system. This is our current detector. And you can see that it looks a lot different. The duct tape is gone, and we added a second detector on top of the breast, which has further improved our tumor detection.So how does this work? The patient receives an injection of a radio tracer that's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells, but not by normal cells, and this is the key difference from mammography. Mammography relies on differences in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue, and we've seen that those differences can be obscured in a dense breast. But MBI exploits the different molecular behavior of tumors, and therefore, it's impervious to breast density. After the injection, the patient's breast is placed between the detectors. And if you've ever had a mammogram \u2014 if you're old enough to have had a mammogram \u2014 you know what comes next: pain. You may be surprised to know that mammography is the only radiologic study that's regulated by federal law, and the law requires that the equivalent of a 40-pound car battery come down on your breast during this study. But with MBI, we use just light, pain-free compression. (Applause) And the detector then transmits the image to the computer.So here's an example. You can see, on the right, a mammogram showing a faint tumor, the edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue. But the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly, as well as a second tumor, which profoundly influence that patient's surgical options. In this example, although the mammogram found one tumor, we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors \u2014 one is small as three millimeters.Our big break came in 2004. After we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors, we used these images to submit a grant to the Susan G. Komen Foundation. And we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators and funded us to study 1,000 women with dense breasts, comparing a screening mammogram to an MBI. Of the tumors that we found, mammography found only 25 percent of those tumors. MBI found 83 percent. Here's an example from that screening study. The digital mammogram was read as normal and shows lots of dense tissue, but the MBI shows an area of intense uptake, which correlated with a two-centimeter tumor. In this case, a one-centimeter tumor. And in this case, a 45-year-old medical secretary at Mayo, who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young, wanted to enroll in our study. And her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue, but her MBI showed an area of worrisome uptake, which we can also see on a color image. And this corresponded to a tumor the size of a golf ball. But fortunately it was removed before it had spread to her lymph nodes.So now that we knew that this technology could find three times more tumors in a dense breast, we had to solve one very important problem. We had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose, and we have spent the last three years making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system to allow this. And I'm very happy to report that we're now using a dose of radiation that is equivalent to the effective dose from one digital mammogram. And at this low dose, we're continuing this screening study, and this image from three weeks ago in a 67-year-old woman shows a normal digital mammogram, but an MBI image showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer. So this is not just young women that it's benefiting. It's also older women with dense tissue. And we're now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dose that's used in any other type of gamma technology.MBI generates four images per breast. MRI generates over a thousand. It takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding. But I suspect even the non-radiologists in the room can find the tumor on the MBI image. But this is why MBI is so potentially disruptive \u2014 it's as accurate as MRI, it's far less complex to interpret, and it's a fraction of the cost. But you can understand why there may be forces in the breast-imaging world who prefer the status quo.After achieving what we felt were remarkable results, our manuscript was rejected by four journals. After the fourth rejection, we requested reconsideration of the manuscript, because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology. Our manuscript was then accepted and will be published later this month in the journal Radiology. (Applause) We still need to complete the screening study using the low dose, and then our findings will need to be replicated at other institutions, and this could take five or more years. If this technology is widely adopted, I will not benefit financially in any way, and that is very important to me, because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth. But I recognize \u2014 (Applause) I recognize that the adoption of this technology will depend as much on economic and political forces as it will on the soundness of the science.The MBI unit has now been FDA approved, but it's not yet widely available. So until something is available for women with dense breasts, there are things that you should know to protect yourself. First, know your density. Ninety percent of women don't, and 95 percent of women don't know that it increases your breast cancer risk. The State of Connecticut became the first and only state to mandate that women receive notification of their breast density after a mammogram. I was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging last week in Chicago, and I was stunned that there was a heated debate as to whether we should be telling women what their breast density is. Of course we should. And if you don't know, please ask your doctor or read the details of your mammography report. Second, if you're pre-menopausal, try to schedule your mammogram in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle, when breast density is relatively lower. Third, if you notice a persistent change in your breast, insist on additional imaging. And fourth and most important, the mammography debate will rage on, but I do believe that all women 40 and older should have an annual mammogram.Mammography isn't perfect, but it's the only test that's been proven to reduce mortality from breast cancer. But this mortality banner is the very sword which mammography's most ardent advocates use to deter innovation. Some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later, and most women, thankfully, survive. So it takes 10 or more years for any screening method to demonstrate a reduction in mortality from breast cancer. Mammography's the only one that's been around long enough to have a chance of making that claim. It is time for us to accept both the extraordinary successes of mammography and the limitations. We need to individualize screening based on density. For women without dense breasts, mammography is the best choice. But for women with dense breasts; we shouldn't abandon screening altogether, we need to offer them something better.The babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question are now both in middle school, and the answer has been so slow to come. She's given me her blessing to share this story with you. After undergoing biopsies that further increased her risk for cancer and losing her sister to cancer, she made the difficult decision to have a prophylactic mastectomy. We can and must do better, not just in time for her granddaughters and my daughters, but in time for you.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1047, "subtitle":

coin.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nYou may recall a year ago\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nwhen a firestorm erupted\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nafter the United States Preventive Services Task Force\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nreviewed the world's mammography screening literature\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nand issued a guideline\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nrecommending against screening mammograms\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nin women in their 40s.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nNow everybody rushed to criticize the Task Force,\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\neven though most of them weren't in anyway familiar\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nwith the mammography studies.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nIt took the Senate just 17 days\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nto ban the use of the guidelines\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nin determining insurance coverage.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nRadiologists were outraged\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nby the guidelines.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nThe pre-eminent mammographer in the United States\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nissued the following quote\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nto the Washington Post.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nThe radiologists were, in turn, criticized\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nfor protecting their own financial self-interest.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nBut in my view,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nthe radiologists are heroes.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nThere's a shortage of radiologists\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nqualified to read mammograms,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nand that's because mammograms are one of the most complex\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nof all radiology studies to interpret,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nand because radiologists\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nare sued more often\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nover missed breast cancer\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nthan any other cause.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nBut that very fact is telling.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nWhere there is this much legal smoke,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nthere is likely to be some fire.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nThe factor most responsible for that fire\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nis breast density.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nBreast density refers to the relative amount of fat --\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\npictured here in yellow --\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nversus connective and epithelial tissues --\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\npictured in pink.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nAnd that proportion\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nis primarily genetically determined.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nTwo-thirds of women in their 40s\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nhave dense breast tissue,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nwhich is why mammography doesn't work as well in them.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nAnd although breast density generally declines with age,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nup to a third of women\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nretain dense breast tissue\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nfor years after menopause.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nSo how do you know if your breasts are dense?\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nWell, you need to read the details\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nof your mammography report.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nRadiologists classify breast density\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\ninto four categories\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nbased on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nIf the breast is less than 25 percent dense,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nthat's called fatty-replaced.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nThe next category\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nis scattered fibroglandular densities,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nfollowed by heterogeneously dense\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nand extremely dense.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nAnd breasts that fall into these two categories\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nare considered dense.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nThe problem with breast density\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nis that it's truly the wolf in sheep's clothing.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nBoth tumors and dense breast tissue\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nappear white on a mammogram,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nand the X-ray often can't distinguish between the two.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nSo it's easy to see this tumor\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nin the upper part of this fatty breast.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nBut imagine how difficult it would be\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nto find that tumor in this dense breast.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nThat's why mammograms find\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nover 80 percent of tumors in fatty breasts,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nbut as few as 40 percent in extremely dense breasts.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nNow it's bad enough that breast density\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nmakes it hard to find a cancer,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nbut it turns out\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nthat it's also a powerful predictor\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nof your risk for breast cancer.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nIt's a stronger risk factor\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nthan having a mother or a sister with breast cancer.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nAt the time my patient posed this question to me,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nbreast density was an obscure topic\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nin the radiology literature,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nand very few women having mammograms,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nor the physicians ordering them,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nknew about this.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nBut what else could I offer her?\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nMammograms have been around since the 1960's,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nand it's changed very little.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nThere have been surprisingly few innovations,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nuntil digital mammography was approved\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nin 2000.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nDigital mammography is still an X-ray of the breast,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nbut the images\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\ncan be stored and manipulated digitally,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\njust like we can with a digital camera.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nThe U.S. has invested\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nfour billion dollars\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nconverting to digital mammography equipment,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nand what have we gained from that investment?\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nIn a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\ndigital mammography was found\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nto be no better over all\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nthan traditional mammography,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nand in fact, it was worse in older women.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nBut it was better in one group,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nand that was women under 50\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nwho were pre-menopausal and had dense breasts,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nand in those women,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\ndigital mammography found twice as many cancers,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nbut it still only found 60 percent.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nSo digital mammography\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nhas been a giant leap forward\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nfor manufacturers\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nof digital mammography equipment,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nbut it's been a very small step forward for\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nwomankind.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nWhat about ultrasound?\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nUltrasound generates more biopsies\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nthat are unnecessary relative to other technologies,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nso it's not widely used.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nAnd MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nbut it's also very expensive.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nIf we think about disruptive technology,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nwe see an almost ubiquitous pattern\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nof the technology getting smaller and less expensive.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nThink about iPods compared to stereos.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nBut it's the exact opposite in health care.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nThe machines get ever bigger\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nand ever more expensive.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nScreening the average young woman with an MRI\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nis kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nIt's just way too much equipment.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nOne MRI scan\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\ncosts 10 times what a digital mammogram costs.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nAnd sooner or later, we're going to have to accept the fact\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nthat health care innovation\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\ncan't always come at a much higher price.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nMalcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\non innovation,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nand he made the case that scientific discoveries\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nare rarely the product of one individual's genius.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nRather, big ideas can be orchestrated,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nif you can simply gather\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\npeople with different perspectives in a room\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nand get them to talk about things\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nthat they don't ordinarily talk about.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nIt's like the essence of TED.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nHe quotes one innovator who says,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:16.958\n\"The only time a physician and a physicist get together\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nis when the physicist gets sick.\"\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nThis makes no sense,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nbecause physicians have all kinds of problems\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nthat they don't realize have solutions.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nAnd physicists have all kinds of solutions for things\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nthat they don't realize are problems.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nNow, take a look at this cartoon\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nthat accompanied Gladwell's article,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nand tell me if you see something disturbing\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nabout this depiction of innovative thinkers.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nSo if you will allow me a little creative license,\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nI will tell you the story\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nof the serendipitous collision\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nof my patient's problem\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nwith a physicist's solution.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nShortly after her visit,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nI was introduced to a nuclear physicist\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nat Mayo\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nnamed Michael O'Conner,\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nwho was a specialist in cardiac imaging,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nsomething I had nothing to do with.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nAnd he happened to tell me\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nabout a conference he'd just returned from in Israel,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nwhere they were talking about a new type of gamma detector.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nNow gamma imaging has been around for a long time\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nto image the heart,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nand it had even been tried to image the breast.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nBut the problem was\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nthat the gamma detectors\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nwere these huge, bulky tubes,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nand they were filled with these scintillating crystals,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nand you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nto find small tumors.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nBut the potential advantage was\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nthat gamma rays, unlike X-rays,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nare not influenced by breast density.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nBut this technology\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\ncould not find tumors when they're small,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nand finding a small tumor is critical for survival.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nIf you can find a tumor\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nwhen it's less than a centimeter,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nsurvival exceeds 90 percent,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nbut drops off rapidly\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nas tumor size increases.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nBut Michael told me about\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\na new type of gamma detector that he'd seen,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nand this is it.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nIt's made\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nnot of a bulky tube,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nbut of a thin layer of a semiconductor material\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nthat serves as the gamma detector.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nAnd I started talking to him\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nabout this problem with breast density,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nand we realized that we might be able to get this detector\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nclose enough around the breast\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nto actually find small tumors.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nSo after putting together\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\na grid of these cubes with tape --\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\n-- Michael hacked off the X-ray plate\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nof a mammography machine\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nthat was about to be thrown out,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nand we attached the new detector,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nand we decided to call this machine\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nMolecular Breast Imaging, or MBI.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nThis is an image from our first patient.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nAnd you can see, using the old gamma technology,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nthat it just looked like noise.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nBut using our new detector,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nwe could begin to see the outline of a tumor.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nSo here we were, a nuclear physicist,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nan internist,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nsoon joined by Carrie Hruska, a biomedical engineer,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nand two radiologists,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nand we were trying to take on\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nthe entrenched world of mammography\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nwith a machine that was held together by duct tape.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nTo say that we faced\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nhigh doses of skepticism\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nin those early years\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nis just a huge understatement,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nbut we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nthat we chipped away with incremental modifications\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nto this system.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nThis is our current detector.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nAnd you can see that it looks a lot different.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nThe duct tape is gone,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nand we added a second detector on top of the breast,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nwhich has further improved our tumor detection.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nSo how does this work?\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nThe patient receives an injection of a radio tracer\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nthat's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells,\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nbut not by normal cells,\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nand this is the key difference from mammography.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nMammography relies on differences\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nin the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand we've seen that those differences\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\ncan be obscured in a dense breast.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nBut MBI exploits\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nthe different molecular behavior of tumors,\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nand therefore, it's impervious to breast density.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAfter the injection,\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nthe patient's breast is placed between the detectors.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nAnd if you've ever had a mammogram --\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nif you're old enough to have had a mammogram --\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nyou know what comes next:\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\npain.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nYou may be surprised to know\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nthat mammography is the only radiologic study\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nthat's regulated by federal law,\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nand the law requires\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nthat the equivalent of a 40-pound car battery\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\ncome down on your breast during this study.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nBut with MBI,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nwe use just light, pain-free compression.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:59.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nAnd the detector\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nthen transmits the image to the computer.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nSo here's an example.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nYou can see, on the right, a mammogram\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nshowing a faint tumor,\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nthe edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nBut the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly,\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nas well as a second tumor,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nwhich profoundly influence that patient's surgical options.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nIn this example, although the mammogram found one tumor,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nwe were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors --\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\none is small as three millimeters.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nOur big break came in 2004.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nAfter we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nwe used these images\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nto submit a grant to the Susan G. Komen Foundation.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nAnd we were elated when they took a chance\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\non a team of completely unknown investigators\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nand funded us to study\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\n1,000 women with dense breasts,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\ncomparing a screening mammogram to an MBI.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nOf the tumors that we found,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nmammography found\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nonly 25 percent of those tumors.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nMBI found 83 percent.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nHere's an example from that screening study.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nThe digital mammogram was read as normal\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nand shows lots of dense tissue,\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nbut the MBI shows an area of intense uptake,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nwhich correlated with a two-centimeter tumor.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nIn this case, a one-centimeter tumor.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nAnd in this case,\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\na 45-year-old medical secretary at Mayo,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nwho had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nwanted to enroll in our study.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nAnd her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nbut her MBI showed an area\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nof worrisome uptake,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nwhich we can also see on a color image.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nAnd this corresponded\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nto a tumor the size of a golf ball.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nBut fortunately it was removed\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nbefore it had spread to her lymph nodes.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nSo now that we knew that this technology\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\ncould find three times more tumors in a dense breast,\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nwe had to solve one very important problem.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nWe had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nand we have spent the last three years\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nmaking modifications to every aspect of the imaging system\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nto allow this.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nAnd I'm very happy to report that we're now using a dose of radiation\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nthat is equivalent to the effective dose\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nfrom one digital mammogram.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nAnd at this low dose, we're continuing this screening study,\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nand this image from three weeks ago\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nin a 67-year-old woman\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nshows a normal digital mammogram,\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nbut an MBI image\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nshowing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nSo this is not just young women that it's benefiting.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nIt's also older women with dense tissue.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nAnd we're now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dose\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nthat's used in any other type of gamma technology.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nMBI generates four images per breast.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nMRI generates over a thousand.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nIt takes a radiologist\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nyears of specialty training\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nto become expert in differentiating\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nthe normal anatomic detail\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nfrom the worrisome finding.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nBut I suspect even the non-radiologists in the room\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\ncan find the tumor on the MBI image.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nBut this is why MBI\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nis so potentially disruptive --\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nit's as accurate as MRI,\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nit's far less complex to interpret,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nand it's a fraction of the cost.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nBut you can understand why there may be\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nforces in the breast-imaging world\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nwho prefer the status quo.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nAfter achieving what we felt were remarkable results,\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nour manuscript was rejected\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nby four journals.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nAfter the fourth rejection,\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nwe requested reconsideration of the manuscript,\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nbecause we strongly suspected\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nthat one of the reviewers who had rejected it\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nhad a financial conflict of interest\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nin a competing technology.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nOur manuscript was then accepted\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nand will be published later this month\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nin the journal Radiology.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:17:01.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nWe still need to complete the screening study using the low dose,\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nand then our findings will need to be replicated\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nat other institutions,\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nand this could take five or more years.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nIf this technology is widely adopted,\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nI will not benefit financially in any way,\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nand that is very important to me,\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nbecause it allows me to continue to tell you the truth.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nBut I recognize --\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:30.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nI recognize that the adoption of this technology\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nwill depend as much on economic\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nand political forces\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nas it will on the soundness of the science.\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nThe MBI unit has now been FDA approved,\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nbut it's not yet widely available.\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:48.958\nSo until something is available\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nfor women with dense breasts,\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nthere are things that you should know\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nto protect yourself.\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nFirst, know your density.\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nNinety percent of women don't,\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nand 95 percent of women don't know\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nthat it increases your breast cancer risk.\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nThe State of Connecticut became the first and only state\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nto mandate that women receive notification\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nof their breast density\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nafter a mammogram.\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nI was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nlast week in Chicago,\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nand I was stunned that there was a heated debate\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:23.958\nas to whether we should be telling women\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:25.958\nwhat their breast density is.\n\n00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nOf course we should.\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nAnd if you don't know, please ask your doctor\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nor read the details of your mammography report.\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nSecond, if you're pre-menopausal,\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:37.958\ntry to schedule your mammogram\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nin the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle,\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nwhen breast density is relatively lower.\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nThird, if you notice a persistent change in your breast,\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.958\ninsist on additional imaging.\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nAnd fourth and most important,\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nthe mammography debate will rage on,\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nbut I do believe that all women 40 and older\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nshould have an annual mammogram.\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nMammography isn't perfect,\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nbut it's the only test that's been proven\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nto reduce mortality from breast cancer.\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nBut this mortality banner\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nis the very sword\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:12.958\nwhich mammography's most ardent advocates use\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nto deter innovation.\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nSome women who develop breast cancer\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:19.958\ndie from it many years later,\n\n00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nand most women, thankfully, survive.\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:23.958\nSo it takes 10 or more years\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:25.958\nfor any screening method\n\n00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:27.958\nto demonstrate a reduction\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:29.958\nin mortality from breast cancer.\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:31.958\nMammography's the only one that's been around long enough\n\n00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:34.958\nto have a chance of making that claim.\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:37.958\nIt is time for us to accept\n\n00:19:37.958 --> 00:19:39.958\nboth the extraordinary successes of mammography\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:41.958\nand the limitations.\n\n00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:43.958\nWe need to individualize screening\n\n00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:45.958\nbased on density.\n\n00:19:45.958 --> 00:19:47.958\nFor women without dense breasts,\n\n00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:50.958\nmammography is the best choice.\n\n00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:52.958\nBut for women with dense breasts;\n\n00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:54.958\nwe shouldn't abandon screening altogether,\n\n00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:57.958\nwe need to offer them something better.\n\n00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:01.958\nThe babies that we were carrying\n\n00:20:01.958 --> 00:20:04.958\nwhen my patient first asked me this question\n\n00:20:04.958 --> 00:20:07.958\nare now both in middle school,\n\n00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:10.958\nand the answer has been so slow to come.\n\n00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:14.958\nShe's given me her blessing\n\n00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:17.958\nto share this story with you.\n\n00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:19.958\nAfter undergoing biopsies\n\n00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:22.958\nthat further increased her risk for cancer\n\n00:20:22.958 --> 00:20:24.958\nand losing her sister to cancer,\n\n00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:26.958\nshe made the difficult decision\n\n00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:29.958\nto have a prophylactic mastectomy.\n\n00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:33.958\nWe can and must do better,\n\n00:20:33.958 --> 00:20:36.958\nnot just in time for her granddaughters\n\n00:20:36.958 --> 00:20:38.958\nand my daughters,\n\n00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:40.958\nbut in time for you.\n\n00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:42.958\nThank you.\n\n00:20:42.958 --> 00:20:58.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The 3 A's of awesome", "duration": "1053", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/neil_pasricha_the_3_a_s_of_awesome", "transcript": "So the Awesome story: It begins about 40 years ago, when my mom and my dad came to Canada. My mom left Nairobi, Kenya. My dad left a small village outside of Amritsar, India. And they got here in the late 1960s. They settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto, and they settled into a new life. They saw their first dentist, they ate their first hamburger, and they had their first kids. My sister and I grew up here, and we had quiet, happy childhoods. We had close family, good friends, a quiet street. We grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted when they grew up \u2014 things like power always on in our houses, things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and popsicles in the backyard. We grew up, and we grew older. I went to high school. I graduated. I moved out of the house, I got a job, I found a girl, I settled down \u2014 and I realize it sounds like a bad sitcom or a Cat Stevens' song \u2014(Laughter)but life was pretty good. Life was pretty good. 2006 was a great year. Under clear blue skies in July in the wine region of Ontario, I got married, surrounded by 150 family and friends. 2007 was a great year. I graduated from school, and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends. Here's a picture of me and my friend, Chris, on the coast of the Pacific Ocean. We actually saw seals out of our car window, and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them and then blocked them with our giant heads. (Laughter) So you can't actually see them, but it was breathtaking, believe me.(Laughter)2008 and 2009 were a little tougher. I know that they were tougher for a lot of people, not just me. First of all, the news was so heavy. It's still heavy now, and it was heavy before that, but when you flipped open a newspaper, when you turned on the TV, it was about ice caps melting, wars going on around the world, earthquakes, hurricanes and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse, and then eventually did collapse, and so many of us losing our homes, or our jobs, or our retirements, or our livelihoods. 2008, 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason, too. I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time. My marriage wasn't going well, and we just were growing further and further apart. One day my wife came home from work and summoned the courage, through a lot of tears, to have a very honest conversation. And she said, \"I don't love you anymore,\" and it was one of the most painful things I'd ever heard and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard, until only a month later, when I heard something even more heartbreaking.My friend Chris, who I just showed you a picture of, had been battling mental illness for some time. And for those of you whose lives have been touched by mental illness, you know how challenging it can be. I spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m. on a Sunday night. We talked about the TV show we watched that evening. And Monday morning, I found out that he disappeared. Very sadly, he took his own life. And it was a really heavy time.And as these dark clouds were circling me, and I was finding it really, really difficult to think of anything good, I said to myself that I really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow. So I came home from work one night, and I logged onto the computer, and I started up a tiny website called 1000awesomethings.com. I was trying to remind myself of the simple, universal, little pleasures that we all love, but we just don't talk about enough \u2014 things like waiters and waitresses who bring you free refills without asking, being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding, wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer, or when cashiers open up a new check-out lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line \u2014 even if you were last at the other line, swoop right in there.(Laughter)And slowly over time, I started putting myself in a better mood. I mean, 50,000 blogs are started a day, and so my blog was just one of those 50,000. And nobody read it except for my mom. Although I should say that my traffic did skyrocket and go up by 100 percent when she forwarded it to my dad. (Laughter) And then I got excited when it started getting tens of hits, and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then millions. It started getting bigger and bigger and bigger. And then I got a phone call, and the voice at the other end of the line said, \"You've just won the Best Blog In the World award.\" I was like, that sounds totally fake. (Laughter) (Applause) Which African country do you want me to wire all my money to? (Laughter) But it turns out, I jumped on a plane, and I ended up walking a red carpet between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart. And I went onstage to accept a Webby award for Best Blog. And the surprise and just the amazement of that was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto, when, in my inbox, 10 literary agents were waiting for me to talk about putting this into a book. Flash-forward to the next year and \"The Book of Awesome\" has now been number one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks.(Applause)But look, I said I wanted to do three things with you today. I said I wanted to tell you the Awesome story, I wanted to share with you the three As of Awesome, and I wanted to leave you with a closing thought. So let's talk about those three As. Over the last few years, I haven't had that much time to really think. But lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself: \"What is it over the last few years that helped me grow my website, but also grow myself?\" And I've summarized those things, for me personally, as three As. They are Attitude, Awareness and Authenticity. I'd love to just talk about each one briefly.So Attitude: Look, we're all going to get lumps, and we're all going to get bumps. None of us can predict the future, but we do know one thing about it and that's that it ain't gonna go according to plan. We will all have high highs and big days and proud moments of smiles on graduation stages, father-daughter dances at weddings and healthy babies screeching in the delivery room, but between those high highs, we may also have some lumps and some bumps too. It's sad, and it's not pleasant to talk about, but your husband might leave you, your girlfriend could cheat, your headaches might be more serious than you thought, or your dog could get hit by a car on the street. It's not a happy thought, but your kids could get mixed up in gangs or bad scenes. Your mom could get cancer, your dad could get mean. And there are times in life when you will be tossed in the well, too, with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart, and when that bad news washes over you, and when that pain sponges and soaks in, I just really hope you feel like you've always got two choices. One, you can swirl and twirl and gloom and doom forever, or two, you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eyes. Having a great attitude is about choosing option number two, and choosing, no matter how difficult it is, no matter what pain hits you, choosing to move forward and move on and take baby steps into the future.The second \"A\" is Awareness. I love hanging out with three year-olds. I love the way that they see the world, because they're seeing the world for the first time. I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk. I love the way that they'll stare slack-jawed at their first baseball game with wide eyes and a mitt on their hand, soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts and the smell of the hotdogs. I love the way that they'll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard and putting them into a nice centerpiece for Thanksgiving dinner. I love the way that they see the world, because they're seeing the world for the first time. Having a sense of awareness is just about embracing your inner three year-old. Because you all used to be three years old. That three-year-old boy is still part of you. That three-year-old girl is still part of you. They're in there. And being aware is just about remembering that you saw everything you've seen for the first time once, too. So there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work. There was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery and smelt the bakery air, or the first time you pulled a 20-dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket and said, \"Found money.\"The last \"A\" is Authenticity. And for this one, I want to tell you a quick story. Let's go all the way back to 1932 when, on a peanut farm in Georgia, a little baby boy named Roosevelt Grier was born. Roosevelt Grier, or Rosey Grier, as people used to call him, grew up and grew into a 300-pound, six-foot-five linebacker in the NFL. He's number 76 in the picture. Here he is pictured with the \"fearsome foursome.\" These were four guys on the L.A. Rams in the 1960s you did not want to go up against. They were tough football players doing what they love, which was crushing skulls and separating shoulders on the football field. But Rosey Grier also had another passion. In his deeply authentic self, he also loved needlepoint. (Laughter) He loved knitting. He said that it calmed him down, it relaxed him, it took away his fear of flying and helped him meet chicks. That's what he said. I mean, he loved it so much that, after he retired from the NFL, he started joining clubs. And he even put out a book called \"Rosey Grier's Needlepoint for Men.\" (Laughter) (Applause) It's a great cover. If you notice, he's actually needlepointing his own face.(Laughter)And so what I love about this story is that Rosey Grier is just such an authentic person, and that's what authenticity is all about. It's just about being you and being cool with that. And I think when you're authentic, you end up following your heart, and you put yourself in places and situations and in conversations that you love and that you enjoy. You meet people that you like talking to. You go places you've dreamt about. And you end you end up following your heart and feeling very fulfilled. So those are the three A's.For the closing thought, I want to take you all the way back to my parents coming to Canada. I don't know what it would feel like coming to a new country when you're in your mid-20s. I don't know, because I never did it, but I would imagine that it would take a great attitude. I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings and appreciating the small wonders that you're starting to see in your new world. And I think you'd have to be really authentic, you'd have to be really true to yourself in order to get through what you're being exposed to.I'd like to pause my TEDTalk for about 10 seconds right now, because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this, and my parents are sitting in the front row. So I wanted to ask them to, if they don't mind, stand up. And I just wanted to say thank you to you guys.(Applause)When I was growing up, my dad used to love telling the story of his first day in Canada. And it's a great story, because what happened was he got off the plane at the Toronto airport, and he was welcomed by a non-profit group, which I'm sure someone in this room runs. (Laughter) And this non-profit group had a big welcoming lunch for all the new immigrants to Canada. And my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch and there was this huge spread. There was bread, there was those little, mini dill pickles, there was olives, those little white onions. There was rolled up turkey cold cuts, rolled up ham cold cuts, rolled up roast beef cold cuts and little cubes of cheese. There was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches and salmon salad sandwiches. There was lasagna, there was casseroles, there was brownies, there was butter tarts, and there was pies, lots and lots of pies. And when my dad tells the story, he says, \"The craziest thing was, I'd never seen any of that before, except bread. (Laughter) I didn't know what was meat, what was vegetarian. I was eating olives with pie. (Laughter) I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here.\"(Laughter)When I was five years old, my dad used to take me grocery shopping, and he would stare in wonder at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables. He would say, \"Look, can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico? They've got an apple here from South Africa. Can you believe they've got a date from Morocco?\" He's like, \"Do you know where Morocco even is?\" And I'd say, \"I'm five. I don't even know where I am. Is this A&P?\" And he'd say, \"I don't know where Morocco is either, but let's find out.\" And so we'd buy the date, and we'd go home. And we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf, and we'd flip through until we found this mysterious country. And when we did, my dad would say, \"Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there, picked this thing off it, put it in a truck, drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house, so they could sell it to us for 25 cents?\" And I'd say, \"I don't believe that.\" And he's like, \"I don't believe it either. Things are amazing. There's just so many things to be happy about.\"When I stop to think about it, he's absolutely right. There are so many things to be happy about. We are the only species on the only life-giving rock in the entire universe that we've ever seen, capable of experiencing so many of these things. I mean, we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture. We're the only ones with jewelry and democracy. We've got airplanes, highway lanes, interior design and horoscope signs. We've got fashion magazines, house party scenes. You can watch a horror movie with monsters. You can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming. We've got books, buffets and radio waves, wedding brides and rollercoaster rides. You can sleep in clean sheets. You can go to the movies and get good seats. You can smell bakery air, walk around with rain hair, pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap.We've got all that, but we've only got 100 years to enjoy it. And that's the sad part. The cashiers at your grocery store, the foreman at your plant, the guy tailgating you home on the highway, the telemarketer calling you during dinner, every teacher you've ever had, everyone that's ever woken up beside you, every politician in every country, every actor in every movie, every single person in your family, everyone you love, everyone in this room and you will be dead in a hundred years. Life is so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet. And that moment is right now, and those moments are counting down, and those moments are always, always, always fleeting.You will never be as young as you are right now. And that's why I believe that if you live your life with a great attitude, choosing to move forward and move on whenever life deals you a blow, living with a sense of awareness of the world around you, embracing your inner three year-old and seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet and being authentic to yourself, being you and being cool with that, letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you, then I think you'll live a life that is rich and is satisfying, and I think you'll live a life that is truly awesome.Thank you.", "id": 1048, "subtitle":

me.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\n2008 and 2009 were a little tougher.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nI know that they were tougher for a lot of people,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nnot just me.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nFirst of all, the news was so heavy.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nIt's still heavy now, and it was heavy before that,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nbut when you flipped open a newspaper, when you turned on the TV,\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nit was about ice caps melting,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nwars going on around the world,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nearthquakes, hurricanes\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nand an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nand then eventually did collapse,\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nand so many of us losing our homes,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nor our jobs,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nor our retirements,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nor our livelihoods.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\n2008, 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason, too.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nI was going through a lot of personal problems at the time.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nMy marriage wasn't going well,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nand we just were growing further and further apart.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nOne day my wife came home from work\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nand summoned the courage, through a lot of tears,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nto have a very honest conversation.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nAnd she said, \"I don't love you anymore,\"\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nand it was one of the most painful things I'd ever heard\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nand certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nuntil only a month later,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nwhen I heard something even more heartbreaking.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nMy friend Chris, who I just showed you a picture of,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nhad been battling mental illness for some time.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nAnd for those of you\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nwhose lives have been touched by mental illness,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nyou know how challenging it can be.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nI spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\non a Sunday night.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nWe talked about the TV show we watched that evening.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nAnd Monday morning, I found out that he disappeared.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nVery sadly, he took his own life.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nAnd it was a really heavy time.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nAnd as these dark clouds were circling me,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nand I was finding it really, really difficult\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nto think of anything good,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nI said to myself that I really needed a way\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nto focus on the positive somehow.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nSo I came home from work one night,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nand I logged onto the computer,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nand I started up a tiny website\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\ncalled 1000awesomethings.com.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nI was trying to remind myself\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nof the simple, universal, little pleasures that we all love,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nbut we just don't talk about enough --\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nthings like waiters and waitresses\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nwho bring you free refills without asking,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nbeing the first table to get called up\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nto the dinner buffet at a wedding,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nwearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nor when cashiers open up a new check-out lane at the grocery store\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nand you get to be first in line --\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\neven if you were last at the other line, swoop right in there.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nAnd slowly over time,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nI started putting myself in a better mood.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nI mean, 50,000 blogs\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nare started a day,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nand so my blog was just one of those 50,000.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nAnd nobody read it except for my mom.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nAlthough I should say that my traffic did skyrocket\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nand go up by 100 percent\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nwhen she forwarded it to my dad.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nAnd then I got excited\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nwhen it started getting tens of hits,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nand then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nand then hundreds and then thousands\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nand then millions.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nIt started getting bigger and bigger and bigger.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAnd then I got a phone call,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nand the voice at the other end of the line said,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:23.958\n\"You've just won the Best Blog In the World award.\"\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nI was like, that sounds totally fake.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:33.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nWhich African country do you want me to wire all my money to?\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nBut it turns out, I jumped on a plane,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nand I ended up walking a red carpet\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nbetween Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nAnd I went onstage to accept a Webby award for Best Blog.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nAnd the surprise\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nand just the amazement of that\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nwas only overshadowed by my return to Toronto,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nwhen, in my inbox,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\n10 literary agents were waiting for me\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nto talk about putting this into a book.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nFlash-forward to the next year\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nand \"The Book of Awesome\" has now been\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nnumber one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:17.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nBut look, I said I wanted to do three things with you today.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nI said I wanted to tell you the Awesome story,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nI wanted to share with you the three As of Awesome,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nand I wanted to leave you with a closing thought.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nSo let's talk about those three As.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nOver the last few years,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nI haven't had that much time to really think.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nBut lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nand ask myself: \"What is it over the last few years\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nthat helped me grow my website,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nbut also grow myself?\"\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nAnd I've summarized those things, for me personally,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nas three As.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nThey are Attitude, Awareness\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nand Authenticity.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nI'd love to just talk about each one briefly.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nSo Attitude:\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nLook, we're all going to get lumps,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nand we're all going to get bumps.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nNone of us can predict the future, but we do know one thing about it\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nand that's that it ain't gonna go according to plan.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nWe will all have high highs\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nand big days and proud moments\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nof smiles on graduation stages,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nfather-daughter dances at weddings\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nand healthy babies screeching in the delivery room,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nbut between those high highs,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nwe may also have some lumps and some bumps too.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nIt's sad, and it's not pleasant to talk about,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nbut your husband might leave you,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nyour girlfriend could cheat,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nyour headaches might be more serious than you thought,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nor your dog could get hit by a car on the street.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nIt's not a happy thought,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nbut your kids could get mixed up in gangs\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nor bad scenes.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nYour mom could get cancer,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nyour dad could get mean.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nAnd there are times in life\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nwhen you will be tossed in the well, too,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nwith twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nand when that bad news washes over you,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nand when that pain sponges and soaks in,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nI just really hope you feel\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nlike you've always got two choices.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nOne, you can swirl and twirl\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nand gloom and doom forever,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nor two, you can grieve\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nand then face the future\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nwith newly sober eyes.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nHaving a great attitude is about choosing option number two,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nand choosing, no matter how difficult it is,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nno matter what pain hits you,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nchoosing to move forward and move on\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nand take baby steps into the future.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nThe second \"A\" is Awareness.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nI love hanging out with three year-olds.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nI love the way that they see the world,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nbecause they're seeing the world for the first time.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nI love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nI love the way that they'll stare slack-jawed\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nat their first baseball game\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nwith wide eyes and a mitt on their hand,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nsoaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nand the smell of the hotdogs.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nI love the way that they'll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nand putting them into a nice centerpiece\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nfor Thanksgiving dinner.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nI love the way that they see the world,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nbecause they're seeing the world\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nfor the first time.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nHaving a sense of awareness\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nis just about embracing your inner three year-old.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nBecause you all used to be three years old.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nThat three-year-old boy is still part of you.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nThat three-year-old girl is still part of you.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nThey're in there.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nAnd being aware is just about remembering\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nthat you saw everything you've seen\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nfor the first time once, too.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nSo there was a time when it was your first time ever\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nhitting a string of green lights on the way home from work.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nThere was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nand smelt the bakery air,\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nor the first time you pulled a 20-dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nand said, \"Found money.\"\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nThe last \"A\" is Authenticity.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nAnd for this one, I want to tell you a quick story.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nLet's go all the way back to 1932\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nwhen, on a peanut farm in Georgia,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\na little baby boy named Roosevelt Grier was born.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nRoosevelt Grier, or Rosey Grier, as people used to call him,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\ngrew up and grew into\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:07.958\na 300-pound, six-foot-five linebacker in the NFL.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nHe's number 76 in the picture.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nHere he is pictured with the \"fearsome foursome.\"\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nThese were four guys on the L.A. Rams in the 1960s\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nyou did not want to go up against.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nThey were tough football players doing what they love,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nwhich was crushing skulls\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nand separating shoulders on the football field.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nBut Rosey Grier also had\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nanother passion.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nIn his deeply authentic self,\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nhe also loved needlepoint. (Laughter)\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nHe loved knitting.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nHe said that it calmed him down, it relaxed him,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nit took away his fear of flying and helped him meet chicks.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nThat's what he said.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nI mean, he loved it so much that, after he retired from the NFL,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nhe started joining clubs.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nAnd he even put out a book\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\ncalled \"Rosey Grier's Needlepoint for Men.\"\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nIt's a great cover.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nIf you notice, he's actually needlepointing his own face.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nAnd so what I love about this story\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nis that Rosey Grier\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nis just such an authentic person,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nand that's what authenticity is all about.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nIt's just about being you and being cool with that.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nAnd I think when you're authentic,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nyou end up following your heart,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nand you put yourself in places\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nand situations and in conversations\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nthat you love and that you enjoy.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nYou meet people that you like talking to.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nYou go places you've dreamt about.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nAnd you end you end up following your heart\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nand feeling very fulfilled.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nSo those are the three A's.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nFor the closing thought, I want to take you all the way back\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nto my parents coming to Canada.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nI don't know what it would feel like\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\ncoming to a new country when you're in your mid-20s.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nI don't know, because I never did it,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nbut I would imagine that it would take a great attitude.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nI would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nand appreciating the small wonders\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nthat you're starting to see in your new world.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nAnd I think you'd have to be really authentic,\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nyou'd have to be really true to yourself\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nin order to get through what you're being exposed to.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nI'd like to pause my TEDTalk\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nfor about 10 seconds right now,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nbecause you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this,\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nand my parents are sitting in the front row.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nSo I wanted to ask them to, if they don't mind, stand up.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAnd I just wanted to say thank you to you guys.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:41.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nWhen I was growing up, my dad used to love telling the story\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nof his first day in Canada.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nAnd it's a great story, because what happened was\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nhe got off the plane at the Toronto airport,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nand he was welcomed by a non-profit group,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nwhich I'm sure someone in this room runs.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nAnd this non-profit group had a big welcoming lunch\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nfor all the new immigrants to Canada.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nAnd my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nand there was this huge spread.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nThere was bread, there was those little, mini dill pickles,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nthere was olives, those little white onions.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nThere was rolled up turkey cold cuts,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nrolled up ham cold cuts, rolled up roast beef cold cuts\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nand little cubes of cheese.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nThere was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nand salmon salad sandwiches.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nThere was lasagna, there was casseroles,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nthere was brownies, there was butter tarts,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nand there was pies, lots and lots of pies.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nAnd when my dad tells the story, he says,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:39.958\n\"The craziest thing was, I'd never seen any of that before, except bread.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nI didn't know what was meat, what was vegetarian.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nI was eating olives with pie.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nI just couldn't believe how many things you can get here.\"\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nWhen I was five years old,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nmy dad used to take me grocery shopping,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nand he would stare in wonder\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nat the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nHe would say, \"Look, can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico?\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nThey've got an apple here from South Africa.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nCan you believe they've got a date from Morocco?\"\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nHe's like, \"Do you know where Morocco even is?\"\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nAnd I'd say, \"I'm five. I don't even know where I am.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nIs this A&amp;P?\"\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nAnd he'd say, \"I don't know where Morocco is either, but let's find out.\"\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nAnd so we'd buy the date, and we'd go home.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nand we'd flip through until we found this mysterious country.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nAnd when we did, my dad would say,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\n\"Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\npicked this thing off it, put it in a truck,\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\ndrove it all the way to the docks\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nand then sailed it all the way\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nacross the Atlantic Ocean\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nand then put it in another truck\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nand drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nso they could sell it to us for 25 cents?\"\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nAnd I'd say, \"I don't believe that.\"\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nAnd he's like, \"I don't believe it either.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nThings are amazing. There's just so many things to be happy about.\"\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nWhen I stop to think about it, he's absolutely right.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nThere are so many things to be happy about.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nWe are the only species\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\non the only life-giving rock\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nin the entire universe that we've ever seen,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\ncapable of experiencing\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nso many of these things.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nI mean, we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nWe're the only ones with jewelry and democracy.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nWe've got airplanes, highway lanes,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\ninterior design and horoscope signs.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nWe've got fashion magazines, house party scenes.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nYou can watch a horror movie with monsters.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nYou can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nWe've got books, buffets and radio waves,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nwedding brides and rollercoaster rides.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nYou can sleep in clean sheets.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nYou can go to the movies and get good seats.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nYou can smell bakery air, walk around with rain hair,\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\npop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nWe've got all that,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nbut we've only got 100 years to enjoy it.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nAnd that's the sad part.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nThe cashiers at your grocery store,\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nthe foreman at your plant,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nthe guy tailgating you home on the highway,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nthe telemarketer calling you during dinner,\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nevery teacher you've ever had,\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\neveryone that's ever woken up beside you,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nevery politician in every country,\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nevery actor in every movie,\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nevery single person in your family, everyone you love,\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:25.958\neveryone in this room and you\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nwill be dead in a hundred years.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nLife is so great that we only get such a short time\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nto experience and enjoy\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nall those tiny little moments that make it so sweet.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nAnd that moment is right now,\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nand those moments are counting down,\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nand those moments are always, always, always fleeting.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nYou will never be as young as you are right now.\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nAnd that's why I believe that if you live your life\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nwith a great attitude,\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nchoosing to move forward and move on\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nwhenever life deals you a blow,\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nliving with a sense of awareness of the world around you,\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nembracing your inner three year-old\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nand seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nand being authentic to yourself,\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nbeing you and being cool with that,\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nletting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you,\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nthen I think you'll live a life\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nthat is rich and is satisfying,\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nand I think you'll live a life that is truly awesome.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nThank you."}, {"title": "A realistic vision for world peace", "duration": "652", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jody_williams_a_realistic_vision_for_world_peace", "transcript": "I'm actually here to make a challenge to people. I know there have been many challenges made to people. The one I'm going to make is that it is time for us to reclaim what peace really means. Peace is not \"Kumbaya, my Lord.\" Peace is not the dove and the rainbow \u2014 as lovely as they are. When I see the symbols of the rainbow and the dove, I think of personal serenity. I think of meditation. I do not think about what I consider to be peace, which is sustainable peace with justice and equality. It is a sustainable peace in which the majority of people on this planet have access to enough resources to live dignified lives, where these people have enough access to education and health care, so that they can live in freedom from want and freedom from fear. This is called human security. And I am not a complete pacifist like some of my really, really heavy-duty, non-violent friends, like Mairead McGuire. I understand that humans are so \"messed up\" \u2014 to use a nice word, because I promised my mom I'd stop using the F-bomb in public. And I'm trying harder and harder. Mom, I'm really trying.We need a little bit of police; we need a little bit of military, but for defense. We need to redefine what makes us secure in this world. It is not arming our country to the teeth. It is not getting other countries to arm themselves to the teeth with the weapons that we produce and we sell them. It is using that money more rationally to make the countries of the world secure, to make the people of the world secure. I was thinking about the recent ongoings in Congress, where the president is offering 8.4 billion dollars to try to get the START vote. I certainly support the START vote. But he's offering 84 billion dollars for the modernizing of nuclear weapons. Do you know the figure that the U.N. talks about for fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals is 80 billion dollars? Just that little bit of money, which to me, I wish it was in my bank account \u2014 it's not, but ... In global terms, it's a little bit of money. But it's going to modernize weapons we do not need and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime, unless we get up off our ... and take action to make it happen, unless we begin to believe that all of the things that we've been hearing about in these last two days are elements of what come together to make human security. It is saving the tigers. It is stopping the tar sands. It is having access to medical equipment that can actually tell who does have cancer. It is all of those things. It is using our money for all of those things. It is about action.I was in Hiroshima a couple of weeks ago, and His Holiness \u2014 we're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city, and there were about eight of us Nobel laureates. And he's a bad guy. He's like a bad kid in church. We're staring at everybody, waiting our turn to speak, and he leans over to me, and he says, \"Jody, I'm a Buddhist monk.\" I said, \"Yes, Your Holiness. Your robe gives it away.\" (Laughter) He said, \"You know that I kind of like meditation, and I pray.\" I said, \"That's good. That's good. We need that in the world. I don't follow that, but that's cool.\" And he says, \"But I have become skeptical. I do not believe that meditation and prayer will change this world. I think what we need is action.\" His Holiness, in his robes, is my new action hero.I spoke with Aung Sun Suu Kyi a couple of days ago. As most of you know, she's a hero for democracy in her country, Burma. You probably also know that she has spent 15 of the last 20 years imprisoned for her efforts to bring about democracy. She was just released a couple of weeks ago, and we're very concerned to see how long she will be free, because she is already out in the streets in Rangoon, agitating for change. She is already out in the streets, working with the party to try to rebuild it. But I talked to her for a range of issues. But one thing that I want to say, because it's similar to what His Holiness said. She said, \"You know, we have a long road to go to finally get democracy in my country. But I don't believe in hope without endeavor. I don't believe in the hope of change, unless we take action to make it so.\"Here's another woman hero of mine. She's my friend, Dr. Shirin Ebadi, the first Muslim woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. She has been in exile for the last year and a half. You ask her where she lives \u2014 where does she live in exile? She says the airports of the world. She is traveling because she was out of the country at the time of the elections. And instead of going home, she conferred with all the other women that she works with, who said to her, \"Stay out. We need you out. We need to be able to talk to you out there, so that you can give the message of what's happening here.\" A year and a half \u2014 she's out speaking on behalf of the other women in her country.Wangari Maathai \u2014 2004 Peace laureate. They call her the \"Tree Lady,\" but she's more than the Tree Lady. Working for peace is very creative. It's hard work every day. When she was planting those trees, I don't think most people understand that, at the same time, she was using the action of getting people together to plant those trees to talk about how to overcome the authoritarian government in her country. People could not gather without getting busted and taken to jail. But if they were together planting trees for the environment, it was okay \u2014 creativity. But it's not just iconic women like Shirin, like Aung Sun Suu Kyi, like Wangari Maathai \u2014 it is other women in the world who are also struggling together to change this world.The Women's League of Burma, 11 individual organizations of Burmese women came together because there's strength in numbers. Working together is what changes our world. The Million Signatures Campaign of women inside Burma working together to change human rights, to bring democracy to that country. When one is arrested and taken to prison, another one comes out and joins the movement, recognizing that if they work together, they will ultimately bring change in their own country.Mairead McGuire in the middle, Betty Williams on the right-hand side \u2014 bringing peace to Northern Ireland. I'll tell you the quick story. An IRA driver was shot, and his car plowed into people on the side of the street. There was a mother and three children. The children were killed on the spot. It was Mairead's sister. Instead of giving in to grief, depression, defeat in the face of that violence, Mairead hooked up with Betty \u2014 a staunch Protestant and a staunch Catholic \u2014 and they took to the streets to say, \"No more violence.\" And they were able to get tens of thousands of, primarily, women, some men, in the streets to bring about change. And they have been part of what brought peace to Northern Ireland, and they're still working on it, because there's still a lot more to do.This is Rigoberta Menchu Tum. She also received the Peace Prize. She is now running for president. She is educating the indigenous people of her country about what it means to be a democracy, about how you bring democracy to the country, about educating, about how to vote \u2014 but that democracy is not just about voting; it's about being an active citizen.That's what I got stuck doing \u2014 the landmine campaign. One of the things that made this campaign work is because we grew from two NGOs to thousands in 90 countries around the world, working together in common cause to ban landmines. Some of the people who worked in our campaign could only work maybe an hour a month. They could maybe volunteer that much. There were others, like myself, who were full-time. But it was the actions, together, of all of us that brought about that change.In my view, what we need today is people getting up and taking action to reclaim the meaning of peace. It's not a dirty word. It's hard work every single day. And if each of us who cares about the different things we care about got up off our butts and volunteered as much time as we could, we would change this world, we would save this world. And we can't wait for the other guy. We have to do it ourselves.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1049, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nI'm actually here\n\n00:00:13.958

Ireland.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nI'll tell you the quick story.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nAn IRA driver was shot,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nand his car plowed into people\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\non the side of the street.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nThere was a mother and three children.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nThe children were killed on the spot.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nIt was Mairead's sister.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nInstead of giving in\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nto grief, depression, defeat\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nin the face of that violence,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nMairead hooked up with Betty --\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\na staunch Protestant and a staunch Catholic --\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nand they took to the streets\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nto say, \"No more violence.\"\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nAnd they were able to get\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\ntens of thousands of, primarily, women, some men,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nin the streets to bring about change.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nAnd they have been\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\npart of what brought peace to Northern Ireland,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nand they're still working on it,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nbecause there's still a lot more to do.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nThis is Rigoberta Menchu Tum.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nShe also received the Peace Prize.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nShe is now running for president.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nShe is educating the indigenous people of her country\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nabout what it means to be a democracy,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nabout how you bring democracy to the country,\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nabout educating, about how to vote --\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nbut that democracy is not just about voting;\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nit's about being an active citizen.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nThat's what I got stuck doing --\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nthe landmine campaign.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nOne of the things that made this campaign work\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nis because we grew from two NGOs\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nto thousands\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nin 90 countries around the world,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nworking together in common cause to ban landmines.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nSome of the people who worked in our campaign\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\ncould only work maybe an hour a month.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nThey could maybe volunteer that much.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nThere were others, like myself,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nwho were full-time.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nBut it was the actions, together, of all of us\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nthat brought about that change.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nIn my view, what we need today\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nis people getting up\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nand taking action\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nto reclaim the meaning of peace.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nIt's not a dirty word.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nIt's hard work every single day.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nAnd if each of us\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nwho cares about the different things we care about\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\ngot up off our butts\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nand volunteered\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nas much time as we could,\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nwe would change this world,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nwe would save this world.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nAnd we can't wait for the other guy. We have to do it ourselves.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nThank you.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "We are all cyborgs now", "duration": "473", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/amber_case_we_are_all_cyborgs_now", "transcript": "I would like to tell you all that you are all actually cyborgs, but not the cyborgs that you think. You're not RoboCop, and you're not Terminator, but you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen or use one of your cell phone devices. So what's a good definition for cyborg? Well, traditional definition is \"an organism to which exogenous components have been added for the purpose of adapting to new environments.\" That came from a 1960 paper on space travel, because, if you think about it, space is pretty awkward. People aren't supposed to be there. But humans are curious, and they like to add things to their bodies so they can go to the Alps one day and then become a fish in the sea the next.So let's look at the concept of traditional anthropology. Somebody goes to another country, says, \"How fascinating these people are, how interesting their tools are, how curious their culture is.\" And then they write a paper, and maybe a few other anthropologists read it, and we think it's very exotic. Well, what's happening is that we've suddenly found a new species. I, as a cyborg anthropologist, have suddenly said, \"Oh, wow. Now suddenly we're a new form of Homo sapiens, and look at these fascinating cultures, and look at these curious rituals that everybody's doing around this technology. They're clicking on things and staring at screens.\"Now there's a reason why I study this, versus traditional anthropology. And the reason is that tool use, in the beginning \u2014 for thousands and thousands of years, everything has been a physical modification of self. It has helped us to extend our physical selves, go faster, hit things harder, and there's been a limit on that. But now what we're looking at is not an extension of the physical self, but an extension of the mental self, and because of that, we're able to travel faster, communicate differently. And the other thing that happens is that we're all carrying around little Mary Poppins technology. We can put anything we want into it, and it doesn't get heavier, and then we can take anything out. What does the inside of your computer actually look like? Well, if you print it out, it looks like a thousand pounds of material that you're carrying around all the time. And if you actually lose that information, it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind, that you suddenly feel like something's missing, except you aren't able to see it, so it feels like a very strange emotion.The other thing that happens is that you have a second self. Whether you like it or not, you're starting to show up online, and people are interacting with your second self when you're not there. And so you have to be careful about leaving your front lawn open, which is basically your Facebook wall, so that people don't write on it in the middle of the night \u2014 because it's very much the equivalent. And suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self. You have to present yourself in digital life in a similar way that you would in your analog life. So, in the same way that you wake up, take a shower and get dressed, you have to learn to do that for your digital self. And the problem is that a lot of people now, especially adolescents, have to go through two adolescences. They have to go through their primary one, that's already awkward, and then they go through their second self's adolescence, and that's even more awkward because there's an actual history of what they've gone through online. And anybody coming in new to technology is an adolescent online right now, and so it's very awkward, and it's very difficult for them to do those things.So when I was little, my dad would sit me down at night and he would say, \"I'm going to teach you about time and space in the future.\" And I said, \"Great.\" And he said one day, \"What's the shortest distance between two points?\" And I said, \"Well, that's a straight line. You told me that yesterday.\" I thought I was very clever. He said, \"No, no, no. Here's a better way.\" He took a piece of paper, drew A and B on one side and the other and folded them together so where A and B touched. And he said, \"That is the shortest distance between two points.\" And I said, \"Dad, dad, dad, how do you do that?\" He said, \"Well, you just bend time and space, it takes an awful lot of energy, and that's just how you do it.\" And I said, \"I want to do that.\" And he said, \"Well, okay.\" And so, when I went to sleep for the next 10 or 20 years, I was thinking at night, \"I want to be the first person to create a wormhole, to make things accelerate faster. And I want to make a time machine.\" I was always sending messages to my future self using tape recorders.But then what I realized when I went to college is that technology doesn't just get adopted because it works. It gets adopted because people use it and it's made for humans. So I started studying anthropology. And when I was writing my thesis on cell phones, I realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets. They weren't physically transporting themselves; they were mentally transporting themselves. They would click on a button, and they would be connected as A to B immediately. And I thought, \"Oh, wow. I found it. This is great.\"So over time, time and space have compressed because of this. You can stand on one side of the world, whisper something and be heard on the other. One of the other ideas that comes around is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use. Every single browser tab gives you a different type of time. And because of that, you start to dig around for your external memories \u2014 where did you leave them? So now we're all these paleontologists that are digging for things that we've lost on our external brains that we're carrying around in our pockets. And that incites a sort of panic architecture \u2014 \"Oh no, where's this thing?\" We're all \"I Love Lucy\" on a great assembly line of information, and we can't keep up.And so what happens is, when we bring all that into the social space, we end up checking our phones all the time. So we have this thing called ambient intimacy. It's not that we're always connected to everybody, but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want. And if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone, the room would be very crowded. These are the people that you have access to right now, in general \u2014 all of these people, all of your friends and family that you can connect to.And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this. One I'm really worried about is that people aren't taking time for mental reflection anymore, and that they aren't slowing down and stopping, being around all those people in the room all the time that are trying to compete for their attention on the simultaneous time interfaces, paleontology and panic architecture. They're not just sitting there. And really, when you have no external input, that is a time when there is a creation of self, when you can do long-term planning, when you can try and figure out who you really are. And then, once you do that, you can figure out how to present your second self in a legitimate way, instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in \u2014 and oh, I have to do this, and I have to do this, and I have to do this. And so this is very important. I'm really worried that, especially kids today, they're not going to be dealing with this down-time, that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture, and that everything comes to them, and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it.So if you think about it, the world hasn't stopped either. It has its own external prosthetic devices, and these devices are helping us all to communicate and interact with each other. But when you actually visualize it, all the connections that we're doing right now \u2014 this is an image of the mapping of the Internet \u2014 it doesn't look technological. It actually looks very organic. This is the first time in the entire history of humanity that we've connected in this way. And it's not that machines are taking over. It's that they're helping us to be more human, helping us to connect with each other.The most successful technology gets out of the way and helps us live our lives. And really, it ends up being more human than technology, because we're co-creating each other all the time. And so this is the important point that I like to study: that things are beautiful, that it's still a human connection \u2014 it's just done in a different way. We're just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other, regardless of geography. So that's why I study cyborg anthropology.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1050, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nI would like to tell you all\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nthat you are all actually cyborgs,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nbut not the cyborgs that you think.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nYou're not RoboCop, and you're not Terminator,\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nbut you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nor use one of your cell phone devices.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nSo what's a good definition for cyborg?\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nWell, traditional definition is \"an organism\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nto which exogenous components have been added\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nfor the purpose of adapting to new environments.\"\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nThat came from a 1960 paper on space travel,\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nbecause, if you think about it, space is pretty awkward.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nPeople aren't supposed to be there.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nBut humans are curious, and they like to add things to their bodies\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nso they can go to the Alps one day\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nand then become a fish in the sea the next.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nSo let's look at the concept of traditional anthropology.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nSomebody goes to another country,\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nsays, \"How fascinating these people are, how interesting their tools are,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nhow curious their culture is.\"\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nAnd then they write a paper, and maybe a few other anthropologists read it,\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nand we think it's very exotic.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nWell, what's happening\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nis that we've suddenly found a new species.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nI, as a cyborg anthropologist, have suddenly said,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\n\"Oh, wow. Now suddenly we're a new form of Homo sapiens,\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nand look at these fascinating cultures,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nand look at these curious rituals\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nthat everybody's doing around this technology.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nThey're clicking on things and staring at screens.\"\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nNow there's a reason why I study this,\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nversus traditional anthropology.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nAnd the reason is that tool use,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nin the beginning -- for thousands and thousands of years,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.958\neverything has been a physical modification of self.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nIt has helped us to extend our physical selves,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\ngo faster, hit things harder,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nand there's been a limit on that.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nBut now what we're looking at is not an extension of the physical self,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nbut an extension of the mental self,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nand because of that, we're able to travel faster,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\ncommunicate differently.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nAnd the other thing that happens\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nis that we're all carrying around little Mary Poppins technology.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nWe can put anything we want into it, and it doesn't get heavier,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nand then we can take anything out.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nWhat does the inside of your computer actually look like?\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nWell, if you print it out, it looks like a thousand pounds of material\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nthat you're carrying around all the time.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nAnd if you actually lose that information,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nit means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nthat you suddenly feel like something's missing,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nexcept you aren't able to see it, so it feels like a very strange emotion.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nThe other thing that happens is that you have a second self.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nWhether you like it or not, you're starting to show up online,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nand people are interacting with your second self\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nwhen you're not there.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nAnd so you have to be careful\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nabout leaving your front lawn open,\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nwhich is basically your Facebook wall,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nso that people don't write on it in the middle of the night --\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nbecause it's very much the equivalent.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nAnd suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nYou have to present yourself in digital life\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nin a similar way that you would in your analog life.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nSo, in the same way that you wake up, take a shower and get dressed,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nyou have to learn to do that for your digital self.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nAnd the problem is that a lot of people now,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nespecially adolescents,\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nhave to go through two adolescences.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nThey have to go through their primary one, that's already awkward,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nand then they go through their second self's adolescence,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nand that's even more awkward\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nbecause there's an actual history\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nof what they've gone through online.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nAnd anybody coming in new to technology\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nis an adolescent online right now,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nand so it's very awkward,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nand it's very difficult for them to do those things.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nSo when I was little, my dad would sit me down at night and he would say,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\n\"I'm going to teach you about time and space in the future.\"\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nAnd I said, \"Great.\"\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nAnd he said one day, \"What's the shortest distance between two points?\"\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAnd I said, \"Well, that's a straight line. You told me that yesterday.\"\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nI thought I was very clever.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nHe said, \"No, no, no. Here's a better way.\"\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nHe took a piece of paper,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\ndrew A and B on one side and the other\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nand folded them together so where A and B touched.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nAnd he said, \"That is the shortest distance between two points.\"\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nAnd I said, \"Dad, dad, dad, how do you do that?\"\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nHe said, \"Well, you just bend time and space,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nit takes an awful lot of energy,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nand that's just how you do it.\"\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nAnd I said, \"I want to do that.\"\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nAnd he said, \"Well, okay.\"\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nAnd so, when I went to sleep for the next 10 or 20 years,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nI was thinking at night,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\n\"I want to be the first person to create a wormhole,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nto make things accelerate faster.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nAnd I want to make a time machine.\"\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nI was always sending messages to my future self\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nusing tape recorders.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nBut then what I realized when I went to college\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nis that technology doesn't just get adopted\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nbecause it works.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nIt gets adopted because people use it\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nand it's made for humans.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nSo I started studying anthropology.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAnd when I was writing my thesis on cell phones,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nI realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nThey weren't physically transporting themselves;\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nthey were mentally transporting themselves.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nThey would click on a button,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nand they would be connected as A to B immediately.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nAnd I thought, \"Oh, wow. I found it. This is great.\"\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nSo over time, time and space\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nhave compressed because of this.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nYou can stand on one side of the world,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nwhisper something and be heard on the other.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nOne of the other ideas that comes around\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nis that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nEvery single browser tab gives you a different type of time.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAnd because of that, you start to dig around\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nfor your external memories -- where did you leave them?\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nSo now we're all these paleontologists\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nthat are digging for things that we've lost\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\non our external brains that we're carrying around in our pockets.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nAnd that incites a sort of panic architecture --\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\n\"Oh no, where's this thing?\"\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nWe're all \"I Love Lucy\" on a great assembly line of information,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nand we can't keep up.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nAnd so what happens is,\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nwhen we bring all that into the social space,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nwe end up checking our phones all the time.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nSo we have this thing called ambient intimacy.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nIt's not that we're always connected to everybody,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nbut at anytime we can connect to anyone we want.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nAnd if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nthe room would be very crowded.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nThese are the people that you have access to right now, in general --\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nall of these people, all of your friends and family that you can connect to.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAnd so there are some psychological effects that happen with this.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nOne I'm really worried about\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nis that people aren't taking time for mental reflection anymore,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nand that they aren't slowing down and stopping,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nbeing around all those people in the room all the time\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nthat are trying to compete for their attention\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\non the simultaneous time interfaces,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\npaleontology and panic architecture.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nThey're not just sitting there.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nAnd really, when you have no external input,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nthat is a time when there is a creation of self,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nwhen you can do long-term planning,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nwhen you can try and figure out who you really are.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd then, once you do that, you can figure out\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nhow to present your second self in a legitimate way,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\ninstead of just dealing with everything as it comes in --\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nand oh, I have to do this, and I have to do this, and I have to do this.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nAnd so this is very important.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nI'm really worried that, especially kids today,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nthey're not going to be dealing with this down-time,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nthat they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nand that everything comes to them,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nand that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nSo if you think about it, the world hasn't stopped either.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nIt has its own external prosthetic devices,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nand these devices are helping us all\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nto communicate and interact with each other.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nBut when you actually visualize it,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nall the connections that we're doing right now --\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nthis is an image of the mapping of the Internet --\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nit doesn't look technological.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nIt actually looks very organic.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nThis is the first time in the entire history of humanity\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nthat we've connected in this way.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nAnd it's not that machines are taking over.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nIt's that they're helping us to be more human,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nhelping us to connect with each other.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nThe most successful technology gets out of the way\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nand helps us live our lives.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nAnd really,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nit ends up being more human than technology,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nbecause we're co-creating each other all the time.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nAnd so this is the important point that I like to study:\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nthat things are beautiful, that it's still a human connection --\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nit's just done in a different way.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nWe're just increasing our humanness\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nand our

"transcript": "If we look around us, much of what surrounds us started life as various rocks and sludge buried in the ground in various places in the world. But, of course, they don't look like rocks and sludge now. They look like TV cameras, monitors, annoying radio mics. And so this magical transformation is what I was trying to get at with my project, which became known as the Toaster Project. And it was also inspired by this quote from Douglas Adams, and the situation is from \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\" And the situation it describes is the hero of the book \u2014 he's a 20th-century man \u2014 finds himself alone on a strange planet populated only by a technologically primitive people. And he kind of assumes that, yes, he'll become \u2014 these villagers \u2014 he'll become their emperor and transform their society with his wonderful command of technology and science and the elements, but, of course, realizes that without the rest of human society, he can barely make a sandwich, let alone a toaster. But he didn't have Wikipedia.So I thought, okay, I'll try and make an electric toaster from scratch. And, working on the idea that the cheapest electric toaster would also be the simplest to reverse-engineer, I went and bought the cheapest toaster I could find, took it home and was kind of dismayed to discover that, inside this object, which I'd bought for just 3.49 pounds, there were 400 different bits made out of a hundred-plus different materials. I didn't have the rest of my life to do this project. I had maybe nine months. So I thought, okay, I'll start with five. And these were steel, mica, plastic, copper and nickel.So, starting with steel: how do you make steel? I went and knocked on the door of the Rio Tinto Chair of Advanced Mineral Extraction at the Royal School of Mines and said, \"How do you make steel?\" And Professor Cilliers was very kind and talked me through it. And my vague rememberings from GCSE science \u2014 well, steel comes from iron, so I phoned up an iron mine. And said, \"Hi, I'm trying to make a toaster. Can I come up and get some iron?\" Unfortunately, when I got there \u2014 emerges Ray. He had misheard me and thought I was coming up because I was trying to make a poster, and so wasn't prepared to take me into the mines. But after some nagging, I got him to do that.(Video) Ray: It was Crease Limestone, and that was produced by sea creatures 350 million years ago in a nice, warm, sunny atmosphere. When you study geology, you can see what's happened in the past, and there were terrific changes in the earth.Thomas Thwaites: As you can see, they had the Christmas decorations up. And of course, it wasn't actually a working mine anymore, because, though Ray was a miner there, the mine had closed and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction, because, of course, it can't compete on the scale of operations which are happening in South America, Australia, wherever. But anyway, I got my suitcase of iron ore and dragged it back to London on the train, and then was faced with the problem: Okay, how do you make this rock into components for a toaster?So I went back to Professor Cilliers, and he said, \"Go to the library.\" So I did and was looking through the undergraduate textbooks on metallurgy \u2014 completely useless for what I was trying to do. Because, of course, they don't actually tell you how to do it if you want to do it yourself and you don't have a smelting plant. So I ended up going to the History of Science Library and looking at this book. This is the first textbook on metallurgy written in the West, at least. And there you can see that woodcut is basically what I ended up doing. But instead of a bellows, I had a leaf blower. (Laughter) And that was something that reoccurred throughout the project, was, the smaller the scale you want to work on, the further back in time you have to go. And so this is after a day and about half a night smelting this iron. I dragged out this stuff, and it wasn't iron. But luckily, I found a patent online for industrial furnaces that use microwaves, and at 30 minutes at full power, and I was able to finish off the process.So, my next \u2014 (Applause) The next thing I was trying to get was copper. Again, this mine was once the largest copper mine in the world. It's not anymore, but I found a retired geology professor to take me down, and he said, \"Okay, I'll let you have some water from the mine.\" And the reason I was interested in getting water is because water which goes through mines becomes kind of acidic and will start picking up, dissolving the minerals from the mine. And a good example of this is the Rio Tinto, which is in Portugal. As you can see, it's got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it. So many such that it's now just a home for bacteria who really like acidic, toxic conditions. But anyway, the water I dragged back from the Isle of Anglesey where the mine was \u2014 there was enough copper in it such that I could cast the pins of my metal electric plug.So my next thing: I was off to Scotland to get mica. And mica is a mineral which is a very good insulator and very good at insulating electricity. That's me getting mica. And the last material I'm going to talk about today is plastic, and, of course, my toaster had to have a plastic case. Plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods. And so plastic comes from oil, so I phoned up BP and spent a good half an hour trying to convince the PR office at BP that it would be fantastic for them if they flew me to an oil rig and let me have a jug of oil. BP obviously has a bit more on their mind now. But even then they weren't convinced and said, \"Okay, we'll phone you back\" \u2014 never did. So I looked at other ways of making plastic. And you can actually make plastic from obviously oils which come from plants, but also from starches. So this is attempting to make potato starch plastic. And for a while that was looking really good. I poured it into the mold, which you can see there, which I've made from a tree trunk. And it was looking good for a while, but I left it outside, because you had to leave it outside to dry, and unfortunately I came back and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato.So kind of out of desperation, I decided that I could think laterally. And geologists have actually christened \u2014 well, they're debating whether to christen \u2014 the age that we're living in \u2014 they're debating whether to make it a new geological epoch called the Anthropocene, the age of Man. And that's because geologists of the future would kind of see a sharp shift in the strata of rock that is being laid down now. So suddenly, it will become kind of radioactive from Chernobyl and the 2,000 or so nuclear bombs that have been set off since 1945. And there'd also be an extinction event \u2014 like fossils would suddenly disappear. And also, I thought that there would be synthetic polymers, plastics, embedded in the rock.So I looked up a plastic \u2014 so I decided that I could mine some of this modern-day rock. And I went up to Manchester to visit a place called Axion Recycling. And they're at the sharp end of what's called the WEEE, which is this European electrical and electronic waste directive. And that was brought into force to try and deal with the mountain of stuff that is just being made and then living for a while in our homes and then going to landfill. But this is it.(Music)(Laughter)So there's a picture of my toaster. (Applause) That's it without the case on. And there it is on the shelves. Thanks.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: I'm told you did plug it in once.TT: Yeah, I did plug it in. I don't know if you could see, but I was never able to make insulation for the wires. Kew Gardens were insistent that I couldn't come and hack into their rubber tree. So the wires were uninsulated. So there was 240 volts going through these homemade copper wires, homemade plug. And for about five seconds, the toaster toasted, but then, unfortunately, the element kind of melted itself. But I considered it a partial success, to be honest.BG: Thomas Thwaites.

said, \"Okay, I'll let you have some water from the mine.\"\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nAnd the reason I was interested in getting water\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nis because water which goes through mines\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nbecomes kind of acidic\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nand will start picking up,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\ndissolving the minerals from

got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nSo many such\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nthat it's now just a home for bacteria\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nwho really like acidic, toxic conditions.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nBut anyway, the water I dragged back\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nfrom the Isle of Anglesey where the

plug.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nSo my next thing: I was off to Scotland\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nto get mica.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nAnd mica is a mineral\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nwhich is a very good insulator\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nand very good at insulating electricity.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nThat's me getting mica.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nAnd the last material I'm going to talk about today is plastic,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nand, of course,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nmy toaster had to have a plastic case.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nPlastic is the defining feature\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nof cheap electrical goods.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nAnd so plastic comes from oil, so I phoned up BP\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nand spent a good half an hour\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\ntrying to convince the PR office at BP\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nthat it would be fantastic for them\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nif they flew me to an oil rig\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nand let me have a jug of oil.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nBP obviously has a bit more on their mind now.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nBut even then\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nthey weren't convinced\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nand said, \"Okay, we'll phone you back\" -- never did.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nSo I looked at other ways of making plastic.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nAnd you can actually make plastic\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nfrom obviously oils which come from plants, but also from starches.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nSo this is attempting to make\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\npotato starch plastic.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nAnd for a while that was looking really good.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nI poured it into the mold, which you can see there,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nwhich I've made from a tree trunk.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nAnd it was looking good for a while,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nbut I left it outside, because you had to leave it outside to dry,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nand unfortunately I came back\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nand there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nSo kind of out of desperation,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nI decided that I could think laterally.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nAnd geologists have actually christened --\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nwell, they're debating whether to christen --\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nthe age that we're living in --\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nthey're debating whether to make it a new geological epoch\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\ncalled the Anthropocene, the age of Man.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nAnd that's because geologists of the future\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nwould kind of see a sharp shift\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nin the strata of rock that is being laid down now.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nSo suddenly, it will become kind of radioactive from Chernobyl\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nand the 2,000 or so nuclear bombs\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nthat have been set off since 1945.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nAnd there'd also be an extinction event --\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nlike fossils would suddenly disappear.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAnd also, I thought\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nthat there would be\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nsynthetic polymers,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nplastics, embedded in the rock.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nSo I looked up a plastic --\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nso I decided that I could mine\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nsome of this modern-day rock.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nAnd I went up to Manchester\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nto visit a place called Axion Recycling.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd they're at the sharp end of what's called the WEEE,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nwhich is this European electrical and electronic waste directive.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nAnd that was brought into force\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nto try and deal with the mountain of stuff\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nthat is just being made\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nand then living for a while in our homes\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nand then going to landfill.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nBut this is it.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:47.958\n(Music)\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nSo there's a picture\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nof my toaster.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:53.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nThat's it without the case on.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nAnd there it is on the shelves.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nThanks.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:05.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nBruno Giussani: I'm told you did plug it in once.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nTT: Yeah, I did plug it in.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nI don't know if you could see,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nbut I was never able to make insulation for the wires.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nKew Gardens were insistent\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nthat I couldn't come and hack into their rubber tree.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nSo the wires were uninsulated.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nSo there was 240 volts\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\ngoing through these homemade copper wires,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nhomemade plug.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nAnd for about five seconds,\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nthe toaster toasted,\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nbut then, unfortunately,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nthe element kind of melted itself.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nBut I considered it a partial success, to be honest.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nBG: Thomas Thwaites.

I have two primary personalities that have been in conflict and conversation within me since I was a little girl. I call them \"the mystic\" and \"the warrior.\" I was born into a family of politically active, intellectual atheists. There was this equation in my family that went something like this: if you are intelligent, you therefore are not spiritual. I was the freak of the family. I was this weird little kid who wanted to have deep talks about the worlds that might exist beyond the ones that we perceive with our senses. I wanted to know if what we human beings see and hear and think is a full and accurate picture of reality. So, looking for answers, I went to Catholic mass. I tagged along with my neighbors. I read Sartre and Socrates. And then a wonderful thing happened when I was in high school: Gurus from the East started washing up on the shores of America. And I said to myself, \"I wanna get me one of them.\"And ever since, I've been walking the mystic path, trying to peer beyond what Albert Einstein called \"the optical delusion of everyday consciousness.\" So what did he mean by this? I'll show you. Take a breath right now of this clear air in this room. Now, see this strange, underwater, coral reef-looking thing? It's actually a person's trachea, and those colored globs are microbes that are actually swimming around in this room right now, all around us. If we're blind to this simple biology, imagine what we're missing at the smallest subatomic level right now and at the grandest cosmic levels. My years as a mystic have made me question almost all my assumptions. They've made me a proud I-don't-know-it-all.Now when the mystic part of me jabbers on and on like this, the warrior rolls her eyes. She's concerned about what's happening in this world right now. She's worried. She says, \"Excuse me, I'm pissed off, and I know a few things, and we better get busy about them right now.\" I've spent my life as a warrior, working for women's issues, working on political campaigns, being an activist for the environment. And it can be sort of crazy-making, housing both the mystic and the warrior in one body. I've always been attracted to those rare people who pull that off, who devote their lives to humanity with the grit of the warrior and the grace of the mystic \u2014 people like Martin Luther King, Jr., who wrote, \"I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. This,\" he wrote, \"is the interrelated structure of reality.\" Then Mother Teresa, another mystic warrior, who said, \"The problem with the world is that we draw the circle of our family too small.\" And Nelson Mandela, who lives by the African concept of \"ubuntu,\" which means \"I need you in order to be me, and you need me in order to be you.\" Now we all love to trot out these three mystic warriors as if they were born with the saint gene. But we all actually have the same capacity that they do, and we need to do their work now.I'm deeply disturbed by the ways in which all of our cultures are demonizing \"the Other\" by the voice we're giving to the most divisive among us. Listen to these titles of some of the bestselling books from both sides of the political divide here in the U.S. \"Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder,\" \"Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot,\" \"Pinheads and Patriots,\" \"Arguing With Idiots.\" They're supposedly tongue-in-cheek, but they're actually dangerous. Now here's a title that may sound familiar, but whose author may surprise you: \"Four-and-a-Half-Years of Struggle Against Lies, Stupidity and Cowardice.\" Who wrote that? That was Adolf Hitler's first title for \"Mein Kampf\" \u2014 \"My Struggle\" \u2014 the book that launched the Nazi party. The worst eras in human history, whether in Cambodia or Germany or Rwanda, they start like this, with negative other-izing. And then they morph into violent extremism.This is why I'm launching a new initiative. And it's to help all of us, myself included, to counteract the tendency to \"otherize.\" And I realize we're all busy people, so don't worry, you can do this on a lunch break. I'm calling my initiative, \"Take the Other to Lunch.\" If you are a Republican, you can take a Democrat to lunch, or if you're a Democrat, think of it as taking a Republican to lunch. Now if the idea of taking any of these people to lunch makes you lose your appetite, I suggest you start more local, because there is no shortage of the Other right in your own neighborhood. Maybe that person who worships at the mosque, or the church or the synagogue, down the street. Or someone from the other side of the abortion conflict. Or maybe your brother-in-law who doesn't believe in global warming. Anyone whose lifestyle may frighten you, or whose point of view makes smoke come out of your ears.A couple of weeks ago, I took a Conservative Tea Party woman to lunch. Now on paper, she passed my smoking ears test. She's an activist from the Right, and I'm an activist from the Left. And we used some guidelines to keep our conversation elevated, and you can use them too, because I know you're all going to take an Other to lunch. So first of all, decide on a goal: to get to know one person from a group you may have negatively stereotyped. And then, before you get together, agree on some ground rules. My Tea Party lunchmate and I came up with these: don't persuade, defend or interrupt. Be curious; be conversational; be real. And listen.From there, we dove in. And we used these questions: Share some of your life experiences with me. What issues deeply concern you? And what have you always wanted to ask someone from the other side? My lunch partner and I came away with some really important insights, and I'm going to share just one with you. I think it has relevance to any problem between people anywhere. I asked her why her side makes such outrageous allegations and lies about my side. \"What?\" she wanted to know. \"Like we're a bunch of elitist, morally-corrupt terrorist-lovers.\" Well, she was shocked. She thought my side beat up on her side way more often, that we called them brainless, gun-toting racists, and we both marveled at the labels that fit none of the people we actually know. And since we had established some trust, we believed in each other's sincerity.We agreed we'd speak up in our own communities when we witnessed the kind of \"otherizing\" talk that can wound and fester into paranoia and then be used by those on the fringes to incite. By the end of our lunch, we acknowledged each other's openness. Neither of us had tried to change the other. But we also hadn't pretended that our differences were just going to melt away after a lunch. Instead, we had taken first steps together, past our knee-jerk reactions, to the ubuntu place, which is the only place where solutions to our most intractable-seeming problems will be found.Who should you invite to lunch? Next time you catch yourself in the act of otherizing, that will be your clue. And what might happen at your lunch? Will the heavens open and \"We Are the World\" play over the restaurant sound system? Probably not. Because ubuntu work is slow, and it's difficult. It's two people dropping the pretense of being know-it-alls. It's two people, two warriors, dropping their weapons and reaching toward each other. Here's how the great Persian poet Rumi put it: \"Out beyond ideas of wrong-doing and right-doing, there is a field. I'll meet you there.\"(Applause)", "id": 1052, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nThis room may appear\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nto be holding 600 people,\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nbut there's actually so many more,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nbecause in each one of us\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nthere is a multitude of personalities.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nI have two primary personalities\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nthat have been in conflict and conversation within me\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nsince I was a little girl.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nI call them \"the mystic\"\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nand \"the warrior.\"\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nI was born into a family\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nof politically active,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nintellectual atheists.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nThere was this equation in my family that went something like this:\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nif you are intelligent,\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nyou therefore are not spiritual.\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nI was the freak of the family.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nI was this weird little kid\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nwho wanted to have deep talks\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nabout the worlds that might exist\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nbeyond the ones that we perceive with our senses.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nI wanted to know\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nif what we human beings see\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nand hear and think\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nis a full and accurate picture\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nof reality.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nSo, looking for answers,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nI went to Catholic mass.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nI tagged along with my neighbors.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nI read Sartre and Socrates.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nAnd then a wonderful thing happened\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nwhen I was in high school:\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nGurus from the East\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nstarted washing up on the shores of America.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nAnd I said to myself,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\n\"I wanna get me one of them.\"\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nAnd ever since,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nI've been walking the mystic path,\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\ntrying to peer beyond\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nwhat Albert Einstein called\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\n\"the optical delusion\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nof everyday consciousness.\"\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nSo what did he mean by this?

00:03:10.958\nbeing an activist for the environment.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nAnd it can be sort of crazy-making,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nhousing both the mystic and the

00:07:36.958\nfrom a group you may have negatively stereotyped.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nAnd then, before you get together,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nagree on some ground

--> 00:07:58.958\nFrom there, we dove in.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd we used these questions:\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nShare some of your life experiences with me.\n\n00:08:03.958

going to share just one with you.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nI think it has relevance\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nto any problem\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nbetween people

"https://www.ted.com/talks/ali_carr_chellman_gaming_to_re_engage_boys_in_learning", "transcript": "So I'm here to tell you that we have a problem with boys, and it's a serious problem with boys. Their culture isn't working in schools, and I'm going to share with you ways that we can think about overcoming that problem. First, I want to start by saying, this is a boy, and this is a girl, and this is probably stereotypically what you think of as a boy and a girl. If I essentialize gender for you today, then you can dismiss what I have to say. So I'm not going to do that, I'm not interested in doing that. This is a different kind of boy and a different kind of girl. So the point here is that not all boys exist within these rigid boundaries of what we think of as boys and girls, and not all girls exist within those rigid boundaries of what we think of as girls. But, in fact, most boys tend to be a certain way, and most girls tend to be a certain way. And the point is that, for boys, the way that they exist and the culture that they embrace isn't working well in schools now.How do we know that? The 100 girls project tells us some really nice statistics. For example, for every 100 girls that are suspended from school, there are 250 boys that are suspended from school. For every 100 girls who are expelled from school, there are 335 boys who are expelled from school. For every 100 girls in special education, there are 217 boys. For every 100 girls with a learning disability, there are 276 boys. For every 100 girls with an emotional disturbance diagnosed, we have 324 boys. And by the way, all of these numbers are significantly higher if you happen to be black, if you happen to be poor, if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school. And if you are a boy, you're four times as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD \u2014 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.Now there is another side to this. And it is important that we recognize that women still need help in school, that salaries are still significantly lower, even when controlled for job types, and that girls have continued to struggle in math and science for years. That's all true. Nothing about that prevents us from paying attention to the literacy needs of our boys between ages three and 13. And so we should. In fact, what we ought to do is take a page from their playbook, because the initiatives and programs that have been set in place for women in science and engineering and mathematics are fantastic. They've done a lot of good for girls in these situations, and we ought to be thinking about how we can make that happen for boys too in their younger years.Even in their older years, what we find is that there's still a problem. When we look at the universities, 60 percent of baccalaureate degrees are going to women now, which is a significant shift. And in fact, university administrators are a little uncomfortable about the idea that we may be getting close to 70 percent female population in universities. This makes university administrators very nervous, because girls don't want to go to schools that don't have boys. And so we're starting to see the establishment of men centers and men studies to think about how do we engage men in their experiences in the university. If you talk to faculty, they may say, \"Ugh. Yeah, well, they're playing video games, and they're gambling online all night long, and they're playing World of Warcraft, and that's affecting their academic achievement.\" Guess what? Video games are not the cause. Video games are a symptom. They were turned off a long time before they got here.So let's talk about why they got turned off when they were between the ages of three and 13. There are three reasons that I believe that boys are out of sync with the culture of schools today. The first is zero tolerance. A kindergarten teacher I know, her son donated all of his toys to her, and when he did, she had to go through and pull out all the little plastic guns. You can't have plastic knives and swords and axes and all that kind of thing in a kindergarten classroom. What is it that we're afraid that this young man is going to do with this gun? I mean, really. But here he stands as testament to the fact that you can't roughhouse on the playground today. Now I'm not advocating for bullies. I'm not suggesting that we need to be allowing guns and knives in the school. But when we say that an Eagle Scout in a high school classroom who has a locked parked car in the parking lot and a penknife in it, has to be suspended from school, I think we may have gone a little too far with zero tolerance.Another way that zero tolerance lives itself out is in the writing of boys. In a lot of classrooms today, you're not allowed to write about anything that's violent. You're not allowed to write about anything that has to do with video games. These topics are banned. Boy comes home from school, and he says, \"I hate writing.\" \"Why do you hate writing, son? What's wrong with writing?\" \"Now I have to write what she tells me to write.\" \"OK, what is she telling you to write?\" \"Poems. I have to write poems. And little moments in my life. I don't want to write that stuff.\" \"Well, what do you want to write? What do you want to write about?\" \"I want to write about video games. I want to write about leveling-up. I want to write about this really interesting world. I want to write about a tornado that comes into our house and blows all the windows out, and ruins all the furniture and kills everybody.\" \"All right. OK.\" You tell a teacher that, and they'll ask you, in all seriousness, \"Should we send this child to the psychologist?\" And the answer is no, he's just a boy. He's just a little boy. It's not OK to write these kinds of things in classrooms today.So that's the first reason: Zero tolerance policies and the way they're lived out. The next reason that boys' cultures are out of sync with school cultures: there are fewer male teachers. Anybody who's over 15 doesn't know what this means, because in the last 10 years, the number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half. We went from 14 percent to seven percent. That means that 93 percent of the teachers that our young men get in elementary classrooms are women. Now what's the problem with this? Women are great, yep, absolutely. But male role models for boys that say it's all right to be smart \u2014 they've got dads, they've got pastors, they've got Cub Scout leaders, but ultimately, six hours a day, five days a week they're spending in a classroom, and most of those classrooms are not places where men exist. And so they say, I guess this really isn't a place for boys. This is a place for girls. And I'm not very good at this, so I guess I'd better go play video games or get into sports, or something like that, because I obviously don't belong here. Men don't belong here, that's pretty obvious.So that may be a very direct way that we see it happen. But less directly, the lack of male presence in the culture \u2014 you've got a teachers' lounge, and they're having a conversation about Joey and Johnny who beat each other up on the playground. \"What are we going to do with these boys?\" The answer to that question changes depending on who's sitting around that table. Are there men around that table? Are there moms who've raised boys around that table? You'll see, the conversation changes depending upon who's sitting around the table.Third reason that boys are out of sync with school today: Kindergarten is the old second grade, folks. We have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there. When you're three, you better be able to write your name legibly, or else we'll consider it a developmental delay. By the time you're in first grade, you should be able to read paragraphs of text with maybe a picture, maybe not, in a book of maybe 25 to 30 pages. If you don't, we're probably going to be putting you into a Title I special reading program. And if you ask Title I teachers, they'll tell you they've got about four or five boys for every girl that's in their program, in the elementary grades.The reason that this is a problem is because the message that boys are getting is, \"You need to do what the teacher asks you to do all the time.\" The teacher's salary depends on \"No Child Left Behind\" and \"Race to the Top\" and accountability and testing and all of this. So she has to figure out a way to get all these boys through this curriculum \u2014 and girls. This compressed curriculum is bad for all active kids. And what happens is, she says, \"Please, sit down, be quiet, do what you're told, follow the rules, manage your time, focus, be a girl.\" That's what she tells them. Indirectly, that's what she tells them. And so this is a very serious problem. Where is it coming from? It's coming from us.(Laughter)We want our babies to read when they are six months old. Have you seen the ads? We want to live in Lake Wobegon where every child is above average ... but what this does to our children is really not healthy. It's not developmentally appropriate, and it's particularly bad for boys.So what do we do? We need to meet them where they are. We need to put ourselves into boy culture. We need to change the mindset of acceptance in boys in elementary schools. More specifically, we can do some very specific things. We can design better games. Most of the educational games that are out there today are really flashcards. They're glorified drill and practice. They don't have the depth, the rich narrative that really engaging video games have, that the boys are really interested in. So we need to design better games. We need to talk to teachers and parents and school board members and politicians. We need to make sure that people see that we need more men in the classroom. We need to look carefully at our zero tolerance policies. Do they make sense? We need to think about how to uncompress this curriculum if we can, trying to bring boys back into a space that is comfortable for them. All of those conversations need to be happening.There are some great examples out there of schools \u2014 the New York Times just talked about a school recently. A game designer from the New School put together a wonderful video gaming school. But it only treats a few kids, and so this isn't very scalable. We have to change the culture and the feelings that politicians and school board members and parents have about the way we accept and what we accept in our schools today. We need to find more money for game design. Because good games, really good games, cost money, and World of Warcraft has quite a budget. Most of the educational games do not.Where we started: my colleagues Mike Petner, Shawn Vashaw, myself, we started by trying to look at the teachers' attitudes and find out how do they really feel about gaming, what do they say about it. And we discovered that they talk about the kids in their school, who talk about gaming, in pretty demeaning ways. They say, \"Oh, yeah. They're always talking about that stuff. They're talking about their little action figures and their little achievements or merit badges, or whatever it is that they get. And they're always talking about this stuff.\" And they say these things as if it's OK. But if it were your culture, think of how that might feel. It's very uncomfortable to be on the receiving end of that kind of language. They're nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero tolerance policies. They are sure that parents and administrators will never accept anything.So we really need to think about looking at teacher attitudes and finding ways to change the attitudes, so that teachers are much more open and accepting of boy cultures in their classrooms. Because, ultimately, if we don't, then we're going to have boys who leave elementary school saying, \"Well I guess that was just a place for girls, it wasn't for me. So I've got to do gaming, or I've got to do sports.\" If we change these things, if we pay attention to these things, and we reengage boys in their learning, they will leave the elementary schools saying, \"I'm smart.\"Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1053, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.886 --> 00:00:16.057\nSo I'm here to tell you\nthat we have a problem with boys,\n\n00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:17.949\nand it's a serious problem with boys.\n\n00:00:18.715 --> 00:00:21.343\nTheir culture isn't working in schools,\n\n00:00:21.367 --> 00:00:23.145\nand I'm going to share with you ways\n\n00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:25.934\nthat we can think\nabout overcoming that problem.\n\n00:00:26.263 --> 00:00:29.229\nFirst, I want to start\nby saying, this is a boy,\n\n00:00:29.253 --> 00:00:31.775\nand this is a girl,\n\n00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:35.347\nand this is probably stereotypically\nwhat you think of as a boy and a girl.\n\n00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:39.154\nIf I essentialize gender for you today,\nthen you can dismiss what I have to say.\n\n00:00:39.178 --> 00:00:42.142\nSo I'm not going to do that,\nI'm not interested in doing that.\n\n00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.383\nThis is a different kind of boy\nand a different kind of girl.\n\n00:00:45.407 --> 00:00:49.840\nSo the point here is that not all boys\nexist within these rigid boundaries\n\n00:00:49.864 --> 00:00:52.054\nof what we think of as boys and girls,\n\n00:00:52.078 --> 00:00:54.633\nand not all girls exist\nwithin those rigid boundaries\n\n00:00:54.657 --> 00:00:56.049\nof what we think of as girls.\n\n00:00:56.073 --> 00:00:59.798\nBut, in fact, most boys\ntend to be a certain way,\n\n00:00:59.822 --> 00:01:01.799\nand most girls tend to be a certain way.\n\n00:01:01.823 --> 00:01:04.062\nAnd the point is that, for boys,\n\n00:01:04.086 --> 00:01:07.272\nthe way that they exist\nand the culture that they embrace\n\n00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:09.804\nisn't working well in schools now.\n\n00:01:09.828 --> 00:01:11.052\nHow do we know that?\n\n00:01:11.076 --> 00:01:15.835\nThe 100 girls project\ntells us some really nice statistics.\n\n00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:19.372\nFor example, for every 100 girls\nthat are suspended from school,\n\n00:01:19.396 --> 00:01:22.316\nthere are 250 boys\nthat are suspended from school.\n\n00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.663\nFor every 100 girls\nwho are expelled from school,\n\n00:01:24.687 --> 00:01:27.487\nthere are 335 boys\nwho are expelled from school.\n\n00:01:28.038 --> 00:01:30.385\nFor every 100 girls in special education,\n\n00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.091\nthere are 217 boys.\n\n00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.801\nFor every 100 girls\nwith a learning disability,\n\n00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:36.548\nthere are 276 boys.\n\n00:01:37.243 --> 00:01:41.705\nFor every 100 girls\nwith an emotional disturbance diagnosed,\n\n00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.499\nwe have 324 boys.\n\n00:01:43.523 --> 00:01:47.099\nAnd by the way, all of these numbers\nare significantly higher\n\n00:01:47.123 --> 00:01:48.543\nif you happen to be black,\n\n00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:50.410\nif you happen to be poor,\n\n00:01:50.434 --> 00:01:52.958\nif you happen to exist\nin an overcrowded school.\n\n00:01:54.207 --> 00:01:56.328\nAnd if you are a boy,\n\n00:01:56.352 --> 00:02:00.088\nyou're four times as likely\nto be diagnosed with ADHD --\n\n00:02:00.112 --> 00:02:02.573\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.\n\n00:02:03.037 --> 00:02:06.098\nNow there is another side to this.\n\n00:02:06.122 --> 00:02:11.732\nAnd it is important that we recognize\nthat women still need help in school,\n\n00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:14.019\nthat

do\nis take a page from their playbook,\n\n00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.277\nbecause the initiatives and programs\nthat have been set in place\n\n00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:41.142\nfor women in science and

very nervous,\n\n00:03:13.156 --> 00:03:16.346\nbecause girls don't want to go\nto schools that don't have boys.\n\n00:03:18.488 --> 00:03:20.586\nAnd so we're starting to see\n\n00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.767\nthe establishment of men centers\nand men studies\n\n00:03:23.791 --> 00:03:28.068\nto think about how do we engage men\nin their experiences in the university.\n\n00:03:28.092 --> 00:03:30.869\nIf you talk to faculty,\nthey may say, \"Ugh. Yeah, well,\n\n00:03:30.893 --> 00:03:32.441\nthey're playing video games,\n\n00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:35.434\nand they're gambling\nonline all night long,\n\n00:03:35.458 --> 00:03:37.273\nand they're playing World of Warcraft,\n\n00:03:37.297 --> 00:03:41.129\nand that's affecting\ntheir academic achievement.\"\n\n00:03:42.418 --> 00:03:43.599\nGuess what?\n\n00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:46.094\nVideo games are not the cause.\n\n00:03:46.118 --> 00:03:47.933\nVideo games are a symptom.\n\n00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:52.839\nThey were turned off a long time\nbefore they got here.\n\n00:03:53.085 --> 00:03:55.744\nSo let's talk about\nwhy they got turned off\n\n00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:58.617\nwhen they were between the ages\nof three and 13.\n\n00:03:59.148 --> 00:04:01.027\nThere are three reasons that I believe\n\n00:04:01.051 --> 00:04:04.313\nthat boys are out of sync\nwith the culture of schools today.\n\n00:04:04.712 --> 00:04:06.934\nThe first is zero tolerance.\n\n00:04:07.325 --> 00:04:12.342\nA kindergarten teacher I know,\nher son donated all of his toys to her,\n\n00:04:12.366 --> 00:04:18.212\nand when he did, she had to go through\nand pull out all the little plastic guns.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.452\nYou can't have plastic knives\nand swords and axes\n\n00:04:21.476 --> 00:04:24.619\nand all that kind of thing\nin a kindergarten classroom.\n\n00:04:24.643 --> 00:04:28.518\nWhat is it that we're afraid that this\nyoung man is going to do with this gun?\n\n00:04:28.542 --> 00:04:29.934\nI mean, really.\n\n00:04:30.616 --> 00:04:32.934\nBut here he stands as testament\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:36.234\nto the fact that you can't roughhouse\non the playground today.\n\n00:04:36.258 --> 00:04:38.267\nNow I'm not advocating for bullies.\n\n00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:43.494\nI'm not suggesting that we need to be\nallowing guns and knives in the school.\n\n00:04:43.518 --> 00:04:47.774\nBut when we say that an Eagle Scout\nin a high school classroom\n\n00:04:47.798 --> 00:04:51.123\nwho has a locked parked car\nin the parking lot and a penknife in it,\n\n00:04:51.147 --> 00:04:53.170\nhas to be suspended from school,\n\n00:04:53.194 --> 00:04:56.494\nI think we may have gone\na little too far with zero tolerance.\n\n00:04:56.518 --> 00:04:58.846\nAnother way that zero tolerance\nlives itself out\n\n00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.161\nis in the writing of boys.\n\n00:05:00.185 --> 00:05:01.570\nIn a lot of classrooms today,\n\n00:05:01.594 --> 00:05:04.314\nyou're not allowed to write\nabout anything that's violent.\n\n00:05:04.338 --> 00:05:07.864\nYou're not allowed to write about anything\nthat has to do with video games.\n\n00:05:07.888 --> 00:05:09.058\nThese topics are banned.\n\n00:05:09.082 --> 00:05:11.030\nBoy comes home from school, and he says,\n\n00:05:11.054 --> 00:05:12.504\n\"I hate writing.\"\n\n00:05:12.528 --> 00:05:15.255\n\"Why do you hate writing, son?\nWhat's wrong with writing?\"\n\n00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:17.592\n\"Now I have to write\nwhat she tells me to write.\"\n\n00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:19.617\n\"OK, what is she telling you to write?\"\n\n00:05:20.061 --> 00:05:22.422\n\"Poems.

OK.\"\n\n00:05:44.108 --> 00:05:47.831\nYou tell a teacher that,\nand they'll ask you, in all seriousness,\n\n00:05:47.855 --> 00:05:50.531\n\"Should we send this child\nto the psychologist?\"\n\n00:05:51.575 --> 00:05:53.934\nAnd the answer is no, he's just a boy.\n\n00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.261\nHe's just a little boy.\n\n00:05:57.134 --> 00:06:00.933\nIt's not OK to write these kinds of things\nin classrooms today.\n\n00:06:01.792 --> 00:06:03.087\nSo that's the first reason:\n\n00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:05.660\nZero tolerance policies\nand the way they're lived out.\n\n00:06:05.684 --> 00:06:09.165\nThe next reason that boys' cultures\nare out of sync with school cultures:\n\n00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:10.626\nthere are fewer male teachers.\n\n00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.409\nAnybody who's over 15\ndoesn't know what this means,\n\n00:06:13.433 --> 00:06:15.189\nbecause in the last 10 years,\n\n00:06:15.213 --> 00:06:19.006\nthe number of elementary school\nclassroom teachers has been cut in half.\n\n00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.422\nWe went from 14 percent to seven percent.\n\n00:06:22.898 --> 00:06:25.221\nThat means that 93 percent of the teachers\n\n00:06:25.245 --> 00:06:28.364\nthat our young men get in elementary\nclassrooms are women.\n\n00:06:29.441 --> 00:06:31.342\nNow what's the problem with this?\n\n00:06:31.695 --> 00:06:33.592\nWomen are great, yep, absolutely.\n\n00:06:34.298 --> 00:06:38.740\nBut male role models for boys\nthat say it's all right to be smart --\n\n00:06:38.764 --> 00:06:42.366\nthey've got dads, they've got pastors,\nthey've got Cub Scout leaders,\n\n00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.474\nbut ultimately, six hours a day,\nfive days a week\n\n00:06:45.498 --> 00:06:47.744\nthey're spending in a classroom,\n\n00:06:47.768 --> 00:06:51.132\nand most of those classrooms\nare not places where men exist.\n\n00:06:51.156 --> 00:06:54.704\nAnd so they say, I guess this really\nisn't a place for boys.\n\n00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:56.749\nThis is a place for girls.\n\n00:06:56.773 --> 00:06:58.363\nAnd I'm not very good at this,\n\n00:06:58.387 --> 00:07:01.595\nso I guess I'd better go play video games\n\n00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:03.630\nor get into sports,\nor something like that,\n\n00:07:03.654 --> 00:07:05.536\nbecause I obviously don't belong here.\n\n00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.670\nMen don't belong here,\nthat's pretty obvious.\n\n00:07:07.694 --> 00:07:11.582\nSo that may be a very direct way\nthat we see it happen.\n\n00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.933\nBut less directly, the lack of male\npresence in the culture --\n\n00:07:16.455 --> 00:07:19.645\nyou've got a teachers' lounge,\nand they're having a conversation\n\n00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:23.796\nabout Joey and Johnny\nwho beat each other up on the playground.\n\n00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.824\n\"What are we going to do with these boys?\"\n\n00:07:25.848 --> 00:07:27.532\nThe answer to that question changes\n\n00:07:27.556 --> 00:07:29.657\ndepending on who's sitting\naround that table.\n\n00:07:29.681 --> 00:07:31.241\nAre there men around that table?\n\n00:07:31.265 --> 00:07:33.715\nAre there moms who've raised boys\naround that table?\n\n00:07:33.739 --> 00:07:35.481\nYou'll see, the conversation changes\n\n00:07:35.505 --> 00:07:37.653\ndepending upon who's sitting\naround the table.\n\n00:07:37.677 --> 00:07:40.529\nThird reason that boys\nare out of sync with school today:\n\n00:07:40.553 --> 00:07:42.997\nKindergarten is the old\nsecond grade, folks.\n\n00:07:43.021 --> 00:07:46.933\nWe have a serious compression\nof the curriculum happening out there.\n\n00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.383\nWhen you're three, you better be able\nto write your name legibly,\n\n00:07:50.407 --> 00:07:52.984\nor else we'll consider it\na developmental delay.\n\n00:07:53.452 --> 00:07:55.095\nBy the time you're in first grade,\n\n00:07:55.119 --> 00:07:57.724\nyou should be able to read\nparagraphs of text\n\n00:07:57.748 --> 00:08:01.228\nwith maybe a picture, maybe not,\nin a book of maybe 25 to 30 pages.\n\n00:08:01.252 --> 00:08:02.432\nIf you don't,\n\n00:08:02.456 --> 00:08:06.131\nwe're probably going to be putting you\ninto a Title I special reading program.\n\n00:08:06.155 --> 00:08:08.453\nAnd if you ask Title I teachers,\nthey'll tell you\n\n00:08:08.477 --> 00:08:12.096\nthey've got about four or five boys\nfor every girl that's in their program,\n\n00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.324\nin the elementary grades.\n\n00:08:13.348 --> 00:08:15.102\nThe reason that this is a problem\n\n00:08:15.126 --> 00:08:18.179\nis because the message\nthat boys are getting\n\n00:08:18.203 --> 00:08:22.545\nis, \"You need to do what the teacher\nasks you to do all the time.\"\n\n00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:27.210\nThe teacher's salary depends\non \"No Child Left Behind\"\n\n00:08:27.234 --> 00:08:29.934\nand \"Race to the Top\"\nand accountability and testing\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.934\nand all of this.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:35.932\nSo she has to figure out a way\nto get all these boys\n\n00:08:35.956 --> 00:08:38.933\nthrough this curriculum -- and girls.\n\n00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.419\nThis compressed curriculum is bad\nfor all active kids.\n\n00:08:44.444 --> 00:08:46.264\nAnd what happens is,\n\n00:08:46.288 --> 00:08:50.948\nshe says, \"Please, sit down,\nbe quiet, do what you're told,\n\n00:08:50.972 --> 00:08:55.924\nfollow the rules, manage your time,\nfocus, be a girl.\"\n\n00:08:57.267 --> 00:08:58.825\nThat's what she tells them.\n\n00:08:58.849 --> 00:09:00.934\nIndirectly, that's what she tells them.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.018\nAnd so this is a very serious problem.\n\n00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:05.399\nWhere is it coming from?\nIt's coming from us.\n\n00:09:05.423 --> 00:09:07.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:11.658\nWe want our babies to read\nwhen they are six months old.\n\n00:09:11.682 --> 00:09:12.934\nHave you seen the ads?\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:17.638\nWe want to live in Lake Wobegon\nwhere every child is above average ...\n\n00:09:18.356 --> 00:09:21.800\nbut what this does to our children\nis really not healthy.\n\n00:09:21.824 --> 00:09:23.634\nIt's not developmentally appropriate,\n\n00:09:23.658 --> 00:09:25.634\nand it's particularly bad for boys.\n\n00:09:26.102 --> 00:09:27.377\nSo what do we do?\n\n00:09:27.858 --> 00:09:29.583\nWe need to meet them where they are.\n\n00:09:29.607 --> 00:09:31.871\nWe need to put ourselves into boy culture.\n\n00:09:31.895 --> 00:09:37.150\nWe need to change the mindset\nof acceptance in boys\n\n00:09:37.174 --> 00:09:38.612\nin elementary schools.\n\n00:09:39.126 --> 00:09:42.322\nMore specifically, we can do\nsome very specific things.\n\n00:09:42.346 --> 00:09:43.934\nWe can design better games.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.773\nMost of the educational games\nthat are out there today\n\n00:09:46.797 --> 00:09:48.322\nare really flashcards.\n\n00:09:48.346 --> 00:09:50.288\nThey're glorified drill and practice.\n\n00:09:50.312 --> 00:09:53.125\nThey don't have the depth,\nthe rich narrative\n\n00:09:53.149 --> 00:09:55.901\nthat really engaging video games have,\n\n00:09:55.925 --> 00:09:57.928\nthat the boys are really interested in.\n\n00:09:57.952 --> 00:09:59.594\nSo we need to design better games.\n\n00:09:59.618 --> 00:10:03.444\nWe need to talk to teachers and parents\nand school board members and politicians.\n\n00:10:03.468 --> 00:10:07.044\nWe need to make sure that people see\nthat we need more men in the classroom.\n\n00:10:07.068 --> 00:10:09.762\nWe need to look carefully\nat our zero tolerance policies.\n\n00:10:09.786 --> 00:10:10.954\nDo they make sense?\n\n00:10:10.978 --> 00:10:14.934\nWe need to think about how to uncompress\nthis curriculum if we can,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:18.423\ntrying to bring boys back into a space\nthat is comfortable for them.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.244\nAll of those conversations\nneed to be happening.\n\n00:10:21.268 --> 00:10:24.071\nThere are some great examples\nout there of schools --\n\n00:10:24.095 --> 00:10:27.578\nthe New York Times\njust talked about a school recently.\n\n00:10:27.602 --> 00:10:29.934\nA game designer from the New School\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.934\nput together a wonderful\nvideo gaming school.\n\n00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:38.187\nBut it only treats a few kids,\nand so this isn't very scalable.\n\n00:10:38.211 --> 00:10:40.367\nWe have to change the culture\nand the feelings\n\n00:10:40.391 --> 00:10:45.213\nthat politicians and school board\nmembers and parents have\n\n00:10:45.237 --> 00:10:48.304\nabout the way we accept\nand what we accept in our schools today.\n\n00:10:48.328 --> 00:10:50.337\nWe need to find more money\nfor game design.\n\n00:10:50.361 --> 00:10:52.715\nBecause good games,\nreally good games, cost money,\n\n00:10:52.739 --> 00:10:54.726\nand World of Warcraft has quite a budget.\n\n00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.842\nMost of the educational games do not.\n\n00:10:56.866 --> 00:10:58.114\nWhere we started:\n\n00:10:58.138 --> 00:11:00.934\nmy colleagues Mike Petner,\nShawn Vashaw, myself,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.549\nwe started by trying to look\nat the teachers' attitudes\n\n00:11:03.573 --> 00:11:05.918\nand find out how do they really\nfeel about gaming,\n\n00:11:05.942 --> 00:11:07.202\nwhat do they say about it.\n\n00:11:07.226 --> 00:11:12.200\nAnd we discovered that they talk\nabout the kids in their school,\n\n00:11:12.224 --> 00:11:14.933\nwho talk about gaming,\nin pretty demeaning ways.\n\n00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.683\nThey say, \"Oh, yeah. They're always\ntalking about that stuff.\n\n00:11:18.707 --> 00:11:21.031\nThey're talking\nabout their little action figures\n\n00:11:21.055 --> 00:11:23.443\nand their little achievements\nor merit badges,\n\n00:11:23.467 --> 00:11:25.525\nor whatever it is that they get.\n\n00:11:25.549 --> 00:11:27.651\nAnd they're always talking\nabout this stuff.\"\n\n00:11:27.675 --> 00:11:29.632\nAnd they say these things as if it's OK.\n\n00:11:29.656 --> 00:11:32.934\nBut if it were your culture,\nthink of how that might feel.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.339\nIt's very uncomfortable\nto be on the receiving end\n\n00:11:35.363 --> 00:11:37.545\nof that kind of language.\n\n00:11:37.934 --> 00:11:41.150\nThey're nervous about anything\nthat has anything to do with violence\n\n00:11:41.174 --> 00:11:43.059\nbecause of the zero tolerance policies.\n\n00:11:43.083 --> 00:11:45.194\nThey are sure that parents\nand administrators\n\n00:11:45.218 --> 00:11:46.516\nwill never accept anything.\n\n00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.424\nSo we really need to think\nabout looking at teacher attitudes\n\n00:11:49.448 --> 00:11:52.210\nand finding ways to change the attitudes,\n\n00:11:52.234 --> 00:11:56.204\nso that teachers are much more open\nand accepting of boy cultures\n\n00:11:56.228 --> 00:11:57.418\nin their classrooms.\n\n00:11:57.442 --> 00:11:59.510\nBecause, ultimately, if we don't,\n\n00:11:59.534 --> 00:12:02.806\nthen we're going to have boys\nwho leave elementary school saying,\n\n00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.858\n\"Well I guess that was just\na place for girls, it wasn't for me.\n\n00:12:05.882 --> 00:12:08.657\nSo I've got to do gaming,\nor I've got to do sports.\"\n\n00:12:09.114 --> 00:12:12.127\nIf we change these things,\nif we pay attention to these things,\n\n00:12:12.151 --> 00:12:14.070\nand we reengage boys in their learning,\n\n00:12:14.094 --> 00:12:17.268\nthey will leave the elementary\nschools saying, \"I'm smart.\"\n\n00:12:18.092 --> 00:12:19.243\nThank you.\n\n00:12:19.267 --> 00:12:21.743\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Addicted to risk", "duration": "1189", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/naomi_klein_addicted_to_risk", "transcript": "I just did something I've never done before. I spent a week at sea on a research vessel. Now I'm not a scientist, but I was accompanying a remarkable scientific team from the University of South Florida who have been tracking the travels of BP's oil in the Gulf of Mexico. This is the boat we were on, by the way. The scientists I was with were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff \u2014 the birds, the turtles, the dolphins, the glamorous stuff. They're looking at the really little stuff that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff. And what they're finding is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants can be highly toxic to phytoplankton, which is very bad news, because so much life depends on it. So contrary to what we heard a few months back about how 75 percent of that oil sort of magically disappeared and we didn't have to worry about it, this disaster is still unfolding. It's still working its way up the food chain. Now this shouldn't come as a surprise to us. Rachel Carson \u2014 the godmother of modern environmentalism \u2014 warned us about this very thing back in 1962. She pointed out that the \"control men\" \u2014 as she called them \u2014 who carpet-bombed towns and fields with toxic insecticides like DDT, were only trying to kill the little stuff, the insects, not the birds. But they forgot this: the fact that birds dine on grubs, that robins eat lots of worms now saturated with DDT. And so, robin eggs failed to hatch, songbirds died en masse, towns fell silent. Thus the title \"Silent Spring.\" I've been trying to pinpoint what keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico, because I'm Canadian, and I can draw no ancestral ties. And I think what it is is I don't think we have fully come to terms with the meaning of this disaster, with what it meant to witness a hole ripped in our world, with what it meant to watch the contents of the Earth gush forth on live TV, 24 hours a day, for months. After telling ourselves for so long that our tools and technology can control nature, suddenly we were face-to-face with our weakness, with our lack of control, as the oil burst out of every attempt to contain it \u2014 \"top hats,\" \"top kills\" and, most memorably, the \"junk shot\" \u2014 the bright idea of firing old tires and golf balls down that hole in the world. But even more striking than the ferocious power emanating from that well was the recklessness with which that power was unleashed \u2014 the carelessness, the lack of planning that characterized the operation from drilling to clean-up. If there is one thing BP's watery improv act made clear, it is that, as a culture, we have become far too willing to gamble with things that are precious and irreplaceable, and to do so without a back-up plan, without an exit strategy. And BP was hardly our first experience of this in recent years. Our leaders barrel into wars, telling themselves happy stories about cakewalks and welcome parades. Then, it is years of deadly damage control, Frankensteins of sieges and surges and counter-insurgencies, and once again, no exit strategy. Our financial wizards routinely fall victim to similar overconfidence, convincing themselves that the latest bubble is a new kind of market \u2014 the kind that never goes down. And when it inevitably does, the best and the brightest reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot \u2014 in this case, throwing massive amounts of much-needed public money down a very different kind of hole. As with BP, the hole does get plugged, at least temporarily, but not before exacting a tremendous price. We have to figure out why we keep letting this happen, because we are in the midst of what may be our highest-stakes gamble of all \u2014 deciding what to do, or not to do, about climate change. Now as you know, a great deal of time is spent, in this country and around the world, inside the climate debate, on the question of, \"What if the IPC scientists are all wrong?\" Now a far more relevant question \u2014 as MIT physicist Evelyn Fox Keller puts it \u2014 is, \"What if those scientists are right?\" Given the stakes, the climate crisis clearly calls for us to act based on the precautionary principle \u2014 the theory that holds that when human health and the environment are significantly at risk and when the potential damage is irreversible, we cannot afford to wait for perfect scientific certainty. Better to err on the side of caution. More overt, the burden of proving that a practice is safe should not be placed on the public that would be harmed, but rather on the industry that stands to profit. But climate policy in the wealthy world \u2014 to the extent that such a thing exists \u2014 is not based on precaution, but rather on cost-benefit analysis \u2014 finding the course of action that economists believe will have the least impact on our GDP. So rather than asking, as precaution would demand, what can we do as quickly as possible to avoid potential catastrophe, we ask bizarre questions like this: \"What is the latest possible moment we can wait before we begin seriously lowering emissions? Can we put this off till 2020, 2030, 2050?\" Or we ask, \"How much hotter can we let the planet get and still survive? Can we go with two degrees, three degrees, or \u2014 where we're currently going \u2014 four degrees Celsius?\" And by the way, the assumption that we can safely control the Earth's awesomely complex climate system as if it had a thermostat, making the planet not too hot, not too cold, but just right \u2014 sort of Goldilocks style \u2014 this is pure fantasy, and it's not coming from the climate scientists. It's coming from the economists imposing their mechanistic thinking on the science. The fact is that we simply don't know when the warming that we create will be utterly overwhelmed by feedback loops. So once again, why do we take these crazy risks with the precious? A range of explanations may be popping into your mind by now, like \"greed.\" This is a popular explanation, and there's lots of truth to it, because taking big risks, as we all know, pays a lot of money. Another explanation that you often hear for recklessness is hubris. And greed and hubris are intimately intertwined when it comes to recklessness. For instance, if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker taking home 100 times more than a brain surgeon, then you need a narrative, you need a story that makes that disparity okay. And you actually don't have a lot of options. You're either an incredibly good scammer, and you're getting away with it \u2014 you gamed the system \u2014 or you're some kind of boy genius, the likes of which the world has never seen. Now both of these options \u2014 the boy genius and the scammer \u2014 are going to make you vastly overconfident and therefore more prone to taking even bigger risks in the future. By the way, Tony Hayward, the former CEO of BP, had a plaque on his desk inscribed with this inspirational slogan: \"What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?\" Now this is actually a popular plaque, and this is a crowd of overachievers, so I'm betting that some of you have this plaque. Don't feel ashamed. Putting fear of failure out of your mind can be a very good thing if you're training for a triathlon or preparing to give a TEDTalk, but personally, I think people with the power to detonate our economy and ravage our ecology would do better having a picture of Icarus hanging from the wall, because \u2014 maybe not that one in particular \u2014 but I want them thinking about the possibility of failure all of the time. So we have greed, we've got overconfidence/hubris, but since we're here at TEDWomen, let's consider one other factor that could be contributing in some small way to societal recklessness. Now I'm not going to belabor this point, but studies do show that, as investors, women are much less prone to taking reckless risks than men, precisely because, as we've already heard, women tend not to suffer from overconfidence in the same way that men do. So it turns out that being paid less and praised less has its upsides \u2014 for society at least. The flipside of this is that constantly being told that you are gifted, chosen and born to rule has distinct societal downsides. And this problem \u2014 call it the \"perils of privilege\" \u2014 brings us closer, I think, to the root of our collective recklessness. Because none of us \u2014 at least in the global North \u2014 neither men nor women, are fully exempt from this message. Here's what I'm talking about. Whether we actively believe them or consciously reject them, our culture remains in the grips of certain archetypal stories about our supremacy over others and over nature \u2014 the narrative of the newly discovered frontier and the conquering pioneer, the narrative of manifest destiny, the narrative of apocalypse and salvation. And just when you think these stories are fading into history, and that we've gotten over them, they pop up in the strangest places. For instance, I stumbled across this advertisement outside the women's washroom in the Kansas City airport. It's for Motorola's new Rugged cell phone, and yes, it really does say, \"Slap Mother Nature in the face.\" And I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola \u2014 that's just a bonus. I'm showing it because \u2014 they're not a sponsor, are they? \u2014 because, in its own way, this is a crass version of our founding story. We slapped Mother Nature around and won, and we always win, because dominating nature is our destiny. But this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature. There's another one, equally important, about how that very same Mother Nature is so nurturing and so resilient that we can never make a dent in her abundance. Let's hear from Tony Hayward again. \"The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean. The amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume.\" In other words, the ocean is big; she can take it. It is this underlying assumption of limitlessness that makes it possible to take the reckless risks that we do. Because this is our real master-narrative: however much we mess up, there will always be more \u2014 more water, more land, more untapped resources. A new bubble will replace the old one. A new technology will come along to fix the messes we made with the last one. In a way, that is the story of the settling of the Americas, the supposedly inexhaustible frontier to which Europeans escaped. And it's also the story of modern capitalism, because it was the wealth from this land that gave birth to our economic system, one that cannot survive without perpetual growth and an unending supply of new frontiers. Now the problem is that the story was always a lie. The Earth always did have limits. They were just beyond our sights. And now we are hitting those limits on multiple fronts. I believe that we know this, yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop. Not only do we continue to tell and retell the same tired stories, but we are now doing so with a frenzy and a fury that, frankly, verges on camp. How else to explain the cultural space occupied by Sarah Palin? Now on the one hand, exhorting us to \"drill, baby, drill,\" because God put those resources into the ground in order for us to exploit them, and on the other, glorying in the wilderness of Alaska's untouched beauty on her hit reality TV show. The twin message is as comforting as it is mad. Ignore those creeping fears that we have finally hit the wall. There are still no limits. There will always be another frontier. So stop worrying and keep shopping. Now, would that this were just about Sarah Palin and her reality TV show. In environmental circles, we often hear that, rather than shifting to renewables, we are continuing with business as usual. This assessment, unfortunately, is far too optimistic. The truth is that we have already exhausted so much of the easily accessible fossil fuels that we have already entered a far riskier business era, the era of extreme energy. So that means drilling for oil in the deepest water, including the icy Arctic seas, where a clean-up may simply be impossible. It means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas and massive strip-mining operations for coal, the likes of which we haven't yet seen. And most controversially, it means the tar sands. I'm always surprised by how little people outside of Canada know about the Alberta Tar Sands, which this year are projected to become the number one source of imported oil to the United States. It's worth taking a moment to understand this practice, because I believe it speaks to recklessness and the path we're on like little else. So this is where the tar sands live, under one of the last magnificent Boreal forests. The oil is not liquid. You can't just drill a hole and pump it out. Tar sand's oil is solid, mixed in with the soil. So to get at it, you first have to get rid of the trees. Then, you rip off the topsoil and get at that oily sand. The process requires a huge amount of water, which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds. That's very bad news for local indigenous people living downstream who are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates. Now looking at these images, it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation, which can already be seen from space and could grow to an area the size of England. I find it helps actually to look at the dump trucks that move the earth, the largest ever built. That's a person down there by the wheel. My point is that this is not oil drilling. It's not even mining. It is terrestrial skinning. Vast, vivid landscapes are being gutted, left monochromatic gray. Now I should confess that as [far as] I'm concerned this would be an abomination if it emitted not one particle of carbon. But the truth is that, on average, turning that gunk into crude oil produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution than it does to produce conventional oil in Canada. How else to describe this, but as a form of mass insanity? Just when we know we need to be learning to live on the surface of our planet, off the power of sun, wind and waves, we are frantically digging to get at the dirtiest, highest-emitting stuff imaginable. This is where our story of endless growth has taken us, to this black hole at the center of my country \u2014 a place of such planetary pain that, like the BP gusher, one can only stand to look at it for so long. As Jared Diamond and others have shown us, this is how civilizations commit suicide, by slamming their foot on the accelerator at the exact moment when they should be putting on the brakes. The problem is that our master-narrative has an answer for that too. At the very last minute, we are going to get saved just like in every Hollywood movie, just like in the Rapture. But, of course, our secular religion is technology. Now, you may have noticed more and more headlines like these. The idea behind this form of \"geoengineering\" as it's called, is that, as the planet heats up, we may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles into the stratosphere to reflect some of the sun's rays back to space, thereby cooling the planet. The wackiest plan \u2014 and I'm not making this up \u2014 would put what is essentially a garden hose 18-and-a-half miles high into the sky, suspended by balloons, to spew sulfur dioxide. So, solving the problem of pollution with more pollution. Think of it as the ultimate junk shot. The serious scientists involved in this research all stress that these techniques are entirely untested. They don't know if they'll work, and they have no idea what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash. Nevertheless, the mere mention of geoengineering is being greeted in some circles, particularly media circles, with a relief tinged with euphoria. An escape hatch has been reached. A new frontier has been found. Most importantly, we don't have to change our lifestyles after all. You see, for some people, their savior is a guy in a flowing robe. For other people, it's a guy with a garden hose. We badly need some new stories. We need stories that have different kinds of heroes willing to take different kinds of risks \u2014 risks that confront recklessness head on, that put the precautionary principle into practice, even if that means through direct action \u2014 like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested, blocking dirty power plants or fighting mountaintop-removal coal mining. We need stories that replace that linear narrative of endless growth with circular narratives that remind us that what goes around comes around. That this is our only home. There is no escape hatch. Call it karma, call it physics, action and reaction, call it precaution \u2014 the principle that reminds us that life is too precious to be risked for any profit. Thank you.

--> 00:06:24.958\nCan we go with two degrees, three degrees, or --\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nwhere we're currently going --\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nfour degrees Celsius?\"\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nAnd by the way,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nthe assumption that we can safely control\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nthe Earth's awesomely complex climate system\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nas if it had a thermostat,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nmaking the planet not too hot, not too cold,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nbut just right -- sort of Goldilocks style --\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nthis is pure fantasy,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nand it's not coming from the climate scientists.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nIt's coming from the economists\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nimposing their mechanistic thinking\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\non the science.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nThe fact is that we simply don't know\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nwhen the warming that we create\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nwill be utterly overwhelmed\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nby feedback loops.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nSo once again,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nwhy do we take these crazy risks\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nwith the precious?\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nA range of explanations\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nmay be popping into your mind by now,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nlike \"greed.\"\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nThis is a popular explanation, and there's lots of truth to it,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nbecause taking big risks, as we all know,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\npays a lot of money.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nAnother explanation that you often hear for recklessness\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nis hubris.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAnd greed and hubris\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nare intimately intertwined\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nwhen it comes to recklessness.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nFor instance, if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\ntaking home 100 times more\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nthan a brain surgeon,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nthen you need a narrative,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nyou need a story\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nthat makes that disparity okay.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nAnd you actually don't have a lot of options.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nYou're either an incredibly good scammer,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nand you're getting away with it -- you gamed the system --\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nor you're some kind of boy genius,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nthe likes of which the world has never seen.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nNow both of these options -- the boy genius and the scammer --\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nare going to make you vastly overconfident\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nand therefore more prone\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nto taking even bigger risks in the future.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nBy the way, Tony Hayward, the former CEO of BP,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nhad a plaque on his desk\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\ninscribed with this inspirational slogan:\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\n\"What would you attempt to do\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nif you knew you could not fail?\"\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nNow this is actually a popular plaque,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nand this is a crowd of overachievers,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nso I'm betting that some of you have this plaque.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nDon't feel ashamed.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nPutting fear of failure out of your mind\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\ncan be a very good thing\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nif you're training for a triathlon\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nor preparing to give a TEDTalk,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nbut personally, I think people with the power\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nto detonate our economy and ravage our ecology\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nwould do better having\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\na picture of Icarus hanging from the wall,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nbecause -- maybe not that one in particular --\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nbut I want them thinking about the possibility of failure\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nall of the time.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nSo we have greed,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nwe've got overconfidence/hubris,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nbut since we're here at TEDWomen,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nlet's consider one other factor\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nthat could be contributing in some small way\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nto societal recklessness.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nNow I'm not going to belabor this point,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nbut studies do show that, as investors,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nwomen are much less prone\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nto taking reckless risks than men,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nprecisely because, as we've already heard,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nwomen tend not to suffer from overconfidence\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nin the same way that men do.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nSo it turns out\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nthat being paid less and praised less\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nhas its upsides --\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nfor society at least.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nThe flipside of this\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nis that constantly being told\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nthat you are gifted, chosen\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nand born to rule\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nhas distinct societal downsides.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nAnd this problem -- call it the \"perils of privilege\" --\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nbrings us closer, I think,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nto the root of our collective recklessness.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nBecause none of us -- at least in the global North --\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nneither men nor women,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nare fully exempt from this message.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nHere's what I'm talking about.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nWhether we actively believe them\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nor consciously reject them,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nour culture remains in the grips\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nof certain archetypal stories\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nabout our supremacy\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nover others and over nature --\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nthe narrative of the newly discovered frontier\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nand the conquering pioneer,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nthe narrative of manifest destiny,\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nthe narrative of apocalypse and salvation.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nAnd just when you think these stories are fading into history,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nand that we've gotten over them,\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nthey pop up in the strangest places.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nFor instance, I stumbled across this advertisement\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\noutside the women's washroom\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nin the Kansas City airport.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nIt's for Motorola's new Rugged cell phone,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nand yes, it really does say,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\n\"Slap Mother Nature in the face.\"\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nAnd I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola --\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nthat's just a bonus.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nI'm showing it because --\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nthey're not a sponsor, are they? --\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nbecause, in its own way,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nthis is a crass version\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nof our founding story.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nWe slapped Mother Nature around and won,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nand we always win,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nbecause dominating nature is our destiny.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nBut this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nThere's another one, equally important,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nabout how that very same Mother Nature\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nis so nurturing and so resilient\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nthat we can never make a dent in her abundance.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nLet's hear from Tony Hayward again.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\n\"The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nThe amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nis tiny in relation to the total water volume.\"\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nIn other words, the ocean is big;\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nshe can take it.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nIt is this underlying assumption of limitlessness\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nthat makes it possible\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nto take the reckless risks that we do.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nBecause this is our real master-narrative:\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nhowever much we mess up,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nthere will always be more --\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nmore water, more land,\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nmore untapped resources.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nA new bubble will replace the old one.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nA new technology will come along\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nto fix the messes we made with the last one.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nIn a way, that is the story\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nof the settling of the Americas,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nthe supposedly inexhaustible frontier\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nto which Europeans escaped.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nAnd it's also the story of modern capitalism,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nbecause it was the wealth from this land\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nthat gave birth to our economic system,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\none that cannot survive without perpetual growth\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand an unending supply\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nof new frontiers.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nNow the problem is\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nthat the story was always a lie.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nThe Earth always did have limits.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nThey were just beyond our sights.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nAnd now we are hitting those limits\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\non multiple fronts.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nI believe that we know this,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nyet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nNot only do we continue to tell and retell\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nthe same tired stories,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nbut we are now doing so\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nwith a frenzy and a fury\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nthat, frankly, verges on camp.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nHow else to explain the cultural space\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\noccupied by Sarah Palin?\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nNow on the one hand,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nexhorting us to \"drill, baby, drill,\"\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nbecause God put those resources into the ground\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nin order for us to exploit them,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nand on the other, glorying in the wilderness\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nof Alaska's untouched beauty\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\non her hit reality TV show.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nThe twin message is as comforting as it is mad.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nIgnore those creeping fears\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nthat we have finally hit the wall.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nThere are still no limits.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nThere will always be another frontier.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nSo stop worrying and keep shopping.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nNow, would that this were just about\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nSarah Palin and her reality TV show.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nIn environmental circles,\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nwe often hear that, rather than shifting to renewables,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nwe are continuing with business as usual.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nThis assessment, unfortunately,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nis far too optimistic.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nThe truth is that we have already exhausted\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nso much of the easily accessible fossil fuels\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nthat we have already entered\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\na far riskier business era,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nthe era of extreme energy.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nSo that means drilling for oil in the deepest water,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nincluding the icy Arctic seas,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nwhere a clean-up may simply be impossible.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nIt means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nand massive strip-mining operations for coal,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nthe likes of which we haven't yet seen.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nAnd most controversially, it means the tar sands.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nI'm always surprised by how little\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\npeople outside of Canada\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nknow about the Alberta Tar Sands,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nwhich this year are projected to become\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nthe number one source of imported oil\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nto the United States.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nIt's worth taking a moment to understand this practice,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nbecause I believe it speaks to recklessness\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nand the path we're on\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nlike little else.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nSo this is where the tar sands live,\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nunder one of the last magnificent\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nBoreal forests.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nThe oil is not liquid.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nYou can't just drill a hole and pump it out.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nTar sand's oil is solid,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nmixed in with the soil.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nSo to get at it,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nyou first have to get rid of the trees.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nThen, you rip off the topsoil\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nand get at that oily sand.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nThe process requires a huge amount of water,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nwhich is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nThat's very bad news for local indigenous people\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nliving downstream\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nwho are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nNow looking at these images,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nit's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation,\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nwhich can already be seen from space\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nand could grow to an area the size of England.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nI find it helps actually\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nto look at the dump trucks that move the earth,\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nthe largest ever built.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nThat's a person down there by the wheel.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nMy point is that\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nthis is not oil drilling.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nIt's not even mining.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nIt is terrestrial skinning.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nVast, vivid landscapes\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nare being gutted,\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nleft monochromatic gray.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nNow I should confess that as [far as] I'm concerned\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nthis would be an abomination\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nif it emitted not one particle of carbon.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nBut the truth is that, on average,\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nturning that gunk into crude oil\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nproduces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nthan it does to produce conventional oil\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nin Canada.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nHow else to describe this,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nbut as a form of mass insanity?\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nJust when we know we need to be learning\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nto live on the surface of our planet,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:29.958\noff the power of sun, wind and waves,\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nwe are frantically digging\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nto get at the dirtiest,\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nhighest-emitting stuff imaginable.\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nThis is where our story of endless growth\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nhas taken us,\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nto this black hole at the center of my country --\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\na place of such planetary pain\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nthat, like the BP gusher,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:51.958\none can only stand to look at it for so long.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nAs Jared Diamond and others have shown us,\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nthis is how civilizations commit suicide,\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nby slamming their foot on the accelerator\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nat the exact moment\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nwhen they should be putting on the brakes.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nThe problem is that our master-narrative\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nhas an answer for that too.\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nAt the very last minute, we are going to get saved\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\njust like in every Hollywood movie,\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:17.958\njust like in the Rapture.\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nBut, of course, our secular religion is technology.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nNow, you may have noticed\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nmore and more headlines like these.\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nThe idea behind this form of \"geoengineering\" as it's called,\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:30.958\nis that, as the planet heats up,\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nwe may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.958\ninto the stratosphere\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nto reflect some of the sun's rays\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nback to space,\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nthereby cooling the planet.\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nThe wackiest plan -- and I'm not making this up --\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nwould put what is essentially a garden hose\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:50.958\n18-and-a-half miles high into the sky,\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nsuspended by balloons,\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nto spew sulfur dioxide.\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nSo, solving the problem of pollution with more pollution.\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nThink of it as the ultimate junk shot.\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nThe serious scientists involved in this research\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nall stress that these techniques\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nare entirely untested.\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nThey don't know if they'll work,\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nand they have no idea\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nwhat kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash.\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nNevertheless, the mere mention of geoengineering\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nis being greeted in some circles,\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nparticularly media circles,\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:23.958\nwith a relief tinged with euphoria.\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:25.958\nAn escape hatch has been reached.\n\n00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nA new frontier has been found.\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nMost importantly,\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:31.958\nwe don't have to change our lifestyles after all.\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nYou see, for some people,\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:35.958\ntheir savior is a guy in a flowing robe.\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:38.958\nFor other people, it's a guy with a garden hose.\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nWe badly need some new stories.\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nWe need stories that have different kinds of heroes\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.958\nwilling to take different kinds of risks --\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nrisks that confront recklessness head on,\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nthat put the precautionary principle into practice,\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:56.958\neven if that means through direct action --\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nlike hundreds of young people willing to get arrested,\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nblocking dirty power plants\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:03.958\nor fighting mountaintop-removal coal mining.\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nWe need stories\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nthat replace that linear narrative of endless growth\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:10.958\nwith circular narratives\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:12.958\nthat remind us\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nthat what goes around comes around.\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:16.958\nThat this is our only home.\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nThere is no escape hatch.\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nCall it karma, call it physics,\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:24.958\naction and reaction, call it precaution --\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nthe principle that reminds us\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nthat life is too precious to be risked\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:30.958\nfor any profit.\n\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nThank you.\n\n00:19:32.958

"transcript": "You may not know this, but you are celebrating an anniversary with me. I'm not married, but one year ago today, I woke up from a month-long coma, following a double lung transplant. Crazy, I know. Insane. Thank you.Six years before that, I was starting my career as an opera singer in Europe, when I was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension \u2014 also known as PH. It happens when there's a thickening in the pulmonary veins, making the right side of the heart work overtime, and causing what I call the reverse-Grinch effect. My heart was three-and-a-half sizes too big. Physical activity becomes very difficult for people with this condition, and usually after two to five years, you die. I went to see this specialist, and she was top-of-the-field and told me I had to stop singing. She said, \"Those high notes are going to kill you.\" While she didn't have any medical evidence to back up her claim that there was a relationship between operatic arias and pulmonary hypertension, she was absolutely emphatic I was singing my own obituary. I was very limited by my condition, physically. But I was not limited when I sang, and as air came up from my lungs, through my vocal cords and passed my lips as sound, it was the closest thing I had ever come to transcendence. And just because of someone's hunch, I wasn't going to give it up.Thankfully, I met Reda Girgis, who is dry as toast, but he and his team at Johns Hopkins didn't just want me to survive, they wanted me to live a meaningful life. This meant making trade-offs. I come from Colorado. It's a mile high, and I grew up there with my 10 brothers and sisters and two adoring parents. Well, the altitude exacerbated my symptoms. So I moved to Baltimore to be near my doctors and enrolled in a conservatory nearby. I couldn't walk as much as I used to, so I opted for five-inch heels. And I gave up salt, I went vegan, and I started taking huge doses of sildenafil, also known as Viagra.(Laughter)My father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing in alternative or traditional therapies for PH, but after six months, I couldn't walk up a small hill. I couldn't climb a flight of stairs. I could barely stand up without feeling like I was going to faint. I had a heart catheterization, where they measure this internal arterial pulmonary pressure, which is supposed to be between 15 and 20. Mine was 146. I like to do things big, and it meant one thing: there is a big gun treatment for pulmonary hypertension called Flolan, and it's not just a drug; it's a way of life. Doctors insert a catheter into your chest, which is attached to a pump that weighs about four-and-a-half pounds. Every day, 24 hours, that pump is at your side, administering medicine directly to your heart, and it's not a particularly preferable medicine in many senses. This is a list of the side effects: if you eat too much salt, like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you'll probably end up in the ICU. If you go through a metal detector, you'll probably die. If you get a bubble in your medicine \u2014 because you have to mix it every morning \u2014 and it stays in there, you probably die. If you run out of medicine, you definitely die.No one wants to go on Flolan. But when I needed it, it was a godsend. Within a few days, I could walk again. Within a few weeks, I was performing, and in a few months, I debuted at the Kennedy Center. The pump was a little bit problematic when performing, so I'd attach it to my inner thigh with the help of the girdle and an ACE bandage. Literally hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone stuffing the pump into my Spanx, hoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly. And the tubing coming out of my chest was a nightmare for costume designers. I graduated from graduate school in 2006, and I got a fellowship to go back to Europe. A few days after arriving, I met this wonderful, old conductor who started casting me in all of these roles. And before long, I was commuting between Budapest, Milan and Florence. Though I was attached to this ugly, unwanted, high-maintenance, mechanical pet, my life was kind of like the happy part in an opera \u2014 very complicated, but in a good way.Then in February of 2008, my grandfather passed away. He was a big figure in all of our lives, and we loved him very much. It certainly didn't prepare me for what came next. Seven weeks later, I got a call from my family. My father had been in a catastrophic car accident, and he died. At 24, my death would have been entirely expected. But his \u2014 well, the only way I can articulate how it felt was that it precipitated my medical decline. Against my doctors' and family's wishes, I needed to go back for the funeral. I had to say goodbye in some way, shape or form. But soon I was showing signs of right-heart failure, and I had to return to sea level, doing so knowing that I probably would never see my home again.I canceled most of my engagements that summer, but I had one left in Tel Aviv, so I went. After one performance, I could barely drag myself from the stage to the taxicab. I sat down and felt the blood rush down from my face, and in the heat of the desert, I was freezing cold. My fingers started turning blue, and I was like, \"What is going on here?\" I heard my heart's valves snapping open and closed. The cab stopped, and I pulled my body from it feeling each ounce of weight as I walked to the elevator. I fell through my apartment door and crawled to the bathroom where I found my problem: I had forgotten to mix in the most important part of my medicine. I was dying, and if I didn't mix that stuff up fast, I would never leave that apartment alive. I started mixing, and I felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another, but I just kept on going. Finally, with the last bottle in and the last bubble out, I attached the pump to the tubing and lay there hoping it would kick in soon enough. If it didn't, I'd probably see my father sooner than I anticipated. Thankfully, in a few minutes, I saw the signature hive-like rash appear on my legs, which is a side effect of the medication, and I knew I'd be okay.We're not big on fear in my family, but I was scared. I went back to the States, anticipating I'd return to Europe, but the heart catheterization showed that I wasn't going anywhere further that a flight-for-life from Johns Hopkins Hospital. I performed here and there, but as my condition deteriorated, so did my voice. My doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant. I didn't. I had two friends who had recently died months after having very challenging surgeries. I knew another young man, though, who had PH who died while waiting for one. I wanted to live. I thought stem cells were a good option, but they hadn't developed to a point where I could take advantage of them yet. I officially took a break from singing, and I went to the Cleveland Clinic to be reevaluated for the third time in five years, for transplant. I was sitting there kind of unenthusiastically talking with the head transplant surgeon, and I asked him if I needed a transplant, what I could do to prepare. He said, \"Be happy. A happy patient is a healthy patient.\" It was like in one verbal swoop he had channeled my thoughts on life and medicine and Confucius. I still didn't want a transplant, but in a month, I was back in the hospital with some severely edemic kankles \u2014 very attractive. And it was right-heart failure.I finally decided it was time to take my doctor's advice. It was time for me to go to Cleveland and to start the agonizing wait for a match. But the next morning, while I was still in the hospital, I got a telephone call. It was my doctor in Cleveland, Marie Budev. And they had lungs. It was a match. They were from Texas. And everybody was really happy for me, but me. Because, despite their problems, I had spent my whole life training my lungs, and I was not particularly enthusiastic about giving them up. I flew to Cleveland, and my family rushed there in hopes that they would meet me and say what we knew might be our final goodbye. But organs don't wait, and I went into surgery before I could say goodbye. The last thing I remember was lying on a white blanket, telling my surgeon that I needed to see my mother again, and to please try and save my voice. I fell into this apocalyptic dream world.During the thirteen-and-a-half-hour surgery, I flatlined twice, 40 quarts of blood were infused into my body. And in my surgeon's 20-year career, he said it was among the most difficult transplants that he's ever performed. They left my chest open for two weeks. You could see my over-sized heart beating inside of it. I was on a dozen machines that were keeping me alive. An infection ravaged my skin. I had hoped my voice would be saved, but my doctors knew that the breathing tubes going down my throat might have already destroyed it. If they stayed in, there was no way I would ever sing again. So my doctor got the ENT, the top guy at the clinic, to come down and give me surgery to move the tubes around my voice box. He said it would kill me. So my own surgeon performed the procedure in a last-ditch attempt to save my voice.Though my mom couldn't say goodbye to me before the surgery, she didn't leave my side in the months of recovery that followed. And if you want an example of perseverance, grit and strength in a beautiful, little package, it is her. One year ago to this very day, I woke up. I was 95 lbs. There were a dozen tubes coming in and out of my body. I couldn't walk, I couldn't talk, I couldn't eat, I couldn't move, I certainly couldn't sing, I couldn't even breathe, but when I looked up and I saw my mother, I couldn't help but smile.Whether by a Mack truck or by heart failure or faulty lungs, death happens. But life isn't really just about avoiding death, is it? It's about living. Medical conditions don't negate the human condition. And when people are allowed to pursue their passions, doctors will find they have better, happier and healthier patients. My parents were totally stressed out about me going and auditioning and traveling and performing all over the place, but they knew that it was much better for me to do that than be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time. And I'm so grateful they did.This past summer, when I was running and singing and dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews and my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother in the Colorado Rockies, I couldn't help but think of that doctor who told me that I couldn't sing. And I wanted to tell her, and I want to tell you, we need to stop letting disease divorce us from our dreams. When we do, we will find that patients don't just survive; we thrive. And some of us might even sing.(Applause) [Singing: French]Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. And I'd like to thank my pianist, Monica Lee. (Applause) Thank you so much.

I couldn't climb a flight of stairs.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nI could barely stand up\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nwithout feeling like I was going to faint.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nI had a heart catheterization,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nwhere they measure this internal arterial pulmonary pressure,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nwhich is supposed to be between 15 and 20.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nMine was 146.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nI like to do things big,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nand it meant one thing:\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nthere is a big gun treatment\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nfor pulmonary hypertension called Flolan,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nand it's not just a drug;\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nit's a way of life.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nDoctors insert a catheter into your chest,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nwhich is attached to a pump\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nthat weighs about four-and-a-half pounds.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nEvery day, 24 hours, that pump is at your side,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nadministering medicine\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\ndirectly to your heart,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nand it's not\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\na particularly preferable\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nmedicine in many senses.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nThis is a list of the side effects:\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nif you eat too much salt,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nlike a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nyou'll probably end up in the ICU.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nIf you go through a metal detector,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nyou'll probably die.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nIf you get a bubble in your medicine --\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nbecause you have to mix it every morning --\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nand it stays in there,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nyou probably die.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nIf you run out of medicine, you definitely die.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nNo one wants to go on Flolan.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nBut when I needed it,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nit was a godsend.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nWithin a few days, I could walk again.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nWithin a few weeks, I was performing,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nand in a few months,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nI debuted at the Kennedy Center.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nThe pump was a little bit problematic when performing,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nso I'd attach it to my inner thigh\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nwith the help of the girdle and an ACE bandage.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nLiterally hundreds of elevator rides\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nwere spent with me alone\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nstuffing the pump into my Spanx,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nhoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nAnd the tubing coming out of my chest\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nwas a nightmare for costume designers.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nI graduated from graduate school in 2006,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nand I got a fellowship to go back to Europe.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nA few days after arriving,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nI met this wonderful, old conductor\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nwho started casting me in all of these roles.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nAnd before long, I was commuting\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nbetween Budapest, Milan\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nand Florence.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nThough I was attached\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nto this ugly, unwanted,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nhigh-maintenance, mechanical pet,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nmy life was kind of like the happy part in an opera --\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nvery complicated,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nbut in a good way.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nThen in February\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nof 2008,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nmy grandfather passed away.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nHe was a big figure in all of our lives,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nand we loved him very much.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nIt certainly didn't prepare me\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nfor what came next.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nSeven weeks later,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nI got a call from my family.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nMy father had been in a catastrophic car accident,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nand he died.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nAt 24, my death would have been\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nentirely expected.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nBut his --\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nwell, the only way I can articulate how it felt\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nwas that it precipitated\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nmy medical decline.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nAgainst my doctors' and family's wishes,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nI needed to go back for the funeral.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nI had to say goodbye\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nin some way, shape or form.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nBut soon I was showing signs of right-heart failure,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nand I had to return to sea level,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\ndoing so knowing\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nthat I probably would never see my home again.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nI canceled most of my engagements that summer,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nbut I had one left in Tel Aviv, so I went.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAfter one performance,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nI could barely drag myself\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nfrom the stage to the taxicab.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nI sat down and felt the blood\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nrush down from my face,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nand in the heat of the desert,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nI was freezing cold.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nMy fingers started turning blue,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nand I was like, \"What is going on here?\"\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nI heard my heart's valves\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nsnapping open and closed.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nThe cab stopped,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nand I pulled my body from it\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nfeeling each ounce of weight\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nas I walked to the elevator.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nI fell through my apartment door\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nand crawled to the bathroom\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nwhere I found my problem:\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nI had forgotten to mix in\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nthe most important part of my medicine.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nI was dying,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nand if I didn't mix that stuff up fast,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nI would never leave that apartment alive.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nI started mixing,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nand I felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another,\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nbut I just kept on going.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nFinally, with the last bottle in and the last bubble out,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nI attached the pump to the tubing\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nand lay there hoping it would kick in\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nsoon enough.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nIf it didn't, I'd probably see my father\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nsooner than I anticipated.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nThankfully, in a few minutes,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nI saw the signature hive-like rash\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nappear on my legs,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nwhich is a side effect of the medication,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nand I knew I'd be okay.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nWe're not big on fear in my family,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nbut I was scared.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nI went back to the States,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nanticipating I'd return to Europe,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nbut the heart catheterization\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nshowed that I wasn't going anywhere\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nfurther that a flight-for-life from Johns Hopkins Hospital.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nI performed here and there,\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nbut as my condition deteriorated,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nso did my voice.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nMy doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nI didn't.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nI had two friends who had recently died\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nmonths after having very challenging surgeries.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nI knew another young man, though, who had PH\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nwho died while waiting for one.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nI wanted to live.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nI thought stem cells were a good option,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nbut they hadn't developed to a point\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nwhere I could take advantage of them yet.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nI officially took a break from singing,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nand I went to the Cleveland Clinic\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nto be reevaluated\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nfor the third time in five years, for transplant.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nI was sitting there kind of unenthusiastically talking\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nwith the head transplant surgeon,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nand I asked him if I needed a transplant,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nwhat I could do to prepare.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nHe said, \"Be happy.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nA happy patient\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nis a healthy patient.\"\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nIt was like in one verbal swoop\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nhe had channeled my thoughts\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\non life and medicine\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nand Confucius.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nI still didn't want a transplant,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nbut in a month,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nI was back in the hospital\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nwith some severely edemic kankles --\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nvery attractive.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nAnd it was right-heart failure.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nI finally decided\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nit was time to take my doctor's advice.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nIt was time for me to go to Cleveland\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nand to start the agonizing wait\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nfor a match.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nBut the next morning,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nwhile I was still in the hospital,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nI got a telephone call.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nIt was my doctor in Cleveland,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nMarie Budev.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAnd they had lungs.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nIt was a match.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nThey were from Texas.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nAnd everybody was really happy for me,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nbut me.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nBecause, despite their problems,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nI had spent my whole life training my lungs,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nand I was not particularly enthusiastic\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nabout giving them up.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nI flew to Cleveland,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nand my family rushed there\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nin hopes that they would meet me\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nand say what we knew\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nmight be our final goodbye.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nBut organs don't wait,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nand I went into surgery\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nbefore I could say goodbye.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nThe last thing I remember\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nwas lying on a white blanket,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\ntelling my surgeon that I needed to see my mother again,\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nand to please try and save my voice.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nI fell into this apocalyptic dream world.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nDuring the thirteen-and-a-half-hour surgery,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nI flatlined twice,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\n40 quarts of blood\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nwere infused into my body.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nAnd in my surgeon's 20-year career,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nhe said it was among the most difficult transplants\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nthat he's ever performed.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nThey left my chest open for two weeks.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nYou could see my over-sized heart\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nbeating inside of it.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nI was on a dozen machines\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nthat were keeping me alive.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nAn infection ravaged my skin.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nI had hoped my voice would be saved,\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nbut my doctors knew\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nthat the breathing tubes going down my throat\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nmight have already destroyed it.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nIf they stayed in, there was no way I would ever sing again.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nSo my doctor got the ENT,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nthe top guy at the clinic, to come down\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nand give me surgery\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nto move the tubes around my voice box.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nHe said it would kill me.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nSo my own surgeon performed the procedure\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nin a last-ditch attempt to save my voice.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nThough my mom couldn't say goodbye to me\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nbefore the surgery,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nshe didn't leave my side\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nin the months of recovery that followed.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nAnd if you want an example\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nof perseverance,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\ngrit and strength\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nin a beautiful, little package,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nit is her.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nOne year ago\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nto this very day,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nI woke up.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nI was 95 lbs.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nThere were a dozen tubes\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\ncoming in and out of my body.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nI couldn't walk, I couldn't talk,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nI couldn't eat, I couldn't move,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nI certainly couldn't sing,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nI couldn't even breathe,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nbut when I looked up\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nand I saw my mother,\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nI couldn't help but smile.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nWhether by a Mack truck\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nor by heart failure\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nor faulty lungs,\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\ndeath happens.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nBut life isn't really just about avoiding death, is it?\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nIt's about living.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nMedical conditions don't negate the human condition.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nAnd when people are allowed\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nto pursue their passions,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\ndoctors will find they have better,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nhappier and healthier patients.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nMy parents were totally stressed out\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nabout me going and auditioning\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nand traveling and performing all over the place,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nbut they knew that it was much better for me to do that\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nthan be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd I'm so grateful they did.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nThis past summer, when I was running and singing\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nand dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nand my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nin the Colorado Rockies,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nI couldn't help but think of that doctor\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nwho told me that I couldn't sing.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nAnd I wanted to tell her,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nand I want to tell you,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nwe need to stop letting disease\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\ndivorce us from our dreams.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nWhen we do,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nwe will find that patients\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\ndon't just survive;\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nwe thrive.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nAnd some of us\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nmight even sing.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:13.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:17:32.958\n[Singing: French]\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nThank you.\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:41.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nThank you.\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nAnd I'd like to thank my pianist, Monica Lee.\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:51.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nThank you so much.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nThank you."}, {"title": "The economic injustice of plastic", "duration": "769", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/van_jones_the_economic_injustice_of_plastic", "transcript": "I am honored to be here, and I'm honored to talk about this topic, which I think is of grave importance. We've been talking a lot about the horrific impacts of plastic on the planet and on other species, but plastic hurts people, too \u2014 especially poor people. And both in the production of plastic, the use of plastic and the disposal of plastic, the people who have the bull's-eye on their foreheads are poor people. People got very upset when the BP oil spill happened, for very good reason. People thought, \"Oh, my God. This is terrible, this oil \u2014 it's in the water. It's going to destroy the living systems there. People are going to be hurt. This is a terrible thing, this oil is going to hurt the people in the Gulf.\"What people don't think about is: What if the oil had made it safely to shore? What if the oil actually got where it was trying to go? Not only would it have been burned in engines and added to global warming, but there's a place called \"Cancer Alley,\" and the reason it's called \"Cancer Alley\" is because the petrochemical industry takes that oil and turns it into plastic and in the process, kills people. It shortens the lives of the people who live there in the Gulf. So oil and petrochemicals are not just a problem when there's a spill; they're a problem when there's not. And what we don't often appreciate is the price that poor people pay for us to have these disposable products.The other thing we often don't appreciate is, it's not just at the point of production that poor people suffer. Poor people also suffer at the point of use. Those of us who earn a certain income level, we have something called choice. The reason why you want to work hard and have a job and not be poor and broke is so you can have choices, economic choices. We actually get a chance to choose not to use products that have dangerous, poisonous plastic in them. Other people who are poor don't have those choices. So low-income people often are the ones who are buying the products that have those dangerous chemicals in them that their children are using. Those are the people who wind up ingesting a disproportionate amount of this poisonous plastic in using it. And people say, \"Well, they should just buy a different product.\" Well, the problem with being poor is you don't have those choices. You often have to buy the cheapest products. The cheapest products are often the most dangerous.And if that weren't bad enough \u2014 if it wasn't just the production of plastic that's giving people cancer in places like Cancer Alley, and shortening lives and hurting poor kids at the point of use \u2014 at the point of disposal, once again, it's poor people who bear the burden. Often, we think we're doing a good thing: You're in your office, drinking your bottled water or whatever it is, and you think to yourself, \"I'm going to throw this away. No \u2014 I'm going to be virtuous. I'm going to put it in the blue bin.\" You think, \"I put mine in the blue bin.\" And then you look at your colleague and say, \"Why, you cretin! You put yours in the white bin.\" And we use that as a moral tickle. We feel so good about ourselves. If we \u2014 well, OK, I'm just ... me. Not you, but I feel this way often.(Laughter)And so we kind of have this moral feel-good moment. But if we were to be able to follow that little bottle on its journey, we would be shocked to discover that, all too often, that bottle is going to be put on a boat, it's going to go all the way across the ocean at some expense, and it's going to wind up in a developing country, often China. I think in our minds, we imagine somebody's going to take the little bottle and say, \"Oh, little bottle! We're so happy to see you, little bottle.\"(Laughter)\"You've served so well.\"(Laughter)He's given a little bottle massage, a little bottle medal. And they say, \"What would you like to do next?\" The little bottle says, \"I just don't know ...\"(Laughter)But that's not actually what happens. You know? That bottle winds up getting burned. The recycling of plastic in many developing countries means the incineration of the plastic, the burning of the plastic, which releases incredible toxic chemicals and, once again, kills people. And so, poor people who are making these products in petrochemical centers like Cancer Alley, poor people who are consuming these products disproportionately, and then poor people who, even at the tail end of the recycling, are having their lives shortened. They're all being harmed \u2014 greatly \u2014 by this addiction that we have to disposability.Now, you think to yourself \u2014 I know how you are \u2014 you say, \"That sure is terrible for those poor people. It's just awful. Those poor people. I hope someone does something to help them.\" But what we don't understand is \u2014 here we are in Los Angeles. We worked very hard to get the smog reduction happening here in Los Angeles. But guess what? Because they're doing so much dirty production in Asia now, because the environmental laws don't protect the people in Asia now, almost all of the clean air gains and the toxic air gains that we've achieved here in California have been wiped out by dirty air coming over from Asia. So we all are being hit. We all are being impacted. It's just that the poor people get it first and worst. But the dirty production, the burning of toxins, the lack of environmental standards in Asia, is actually creating so much dirty air pollution, it's coming across the ocean, and has erased our gains here in California. We're back where we were in the 1970s. And so we're on one planet, and we have to be able to get to the root of these problems.The root of this problem, in my view, is the idea of disposability itself. You see, if you understand the link between what we're doing to poison and pollute the planet and what we're doing to poor people, you arrive at a very troubling but also very helpful insight: In order to trash the planet, you have to trash people. But if you create a world where you don't trash people, you can't trash the planet. So now we are at a moment where the coming together of social justice as an idea and ecology as an idea, we finally can now see that they are really, at the end of the day, one idea. And it's the idea that we don't have disposable anything. We don't have disposable resources. We don't have disposable species. And we don't have disposable people, either. We don't have a throwaway planet, and we don't have throwaway children \u2014 it's all precious.And as we all begin to come back to that basic understanding, new opportunities for action begin to emerge. Biomimicry, which is an emerging science, winds up being a very important social justice idea. People who are just learning about this stuff: biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species. Democracy, by the way, means respecting the wisdom of all people \u2014 we'll get to that. But biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species. It turns out we're a pretty clever species. We have this big cortex, we're pretty proud of ourselves. But if we want to make something hard, we say, \"I know! I'm going to make a hard substance. I know! I'm going to get vacuums and furnaces and drag stuff out of the ground and get things hot and poison and pollute ... But I got this hard thing!\"(Laughter)\"I'm so clever!\" And you look behind you, and there's destruction all around you. But guess what? You're so clever, but you're not as clever as a clam.A clamshell is hard. There's no vacuums. There's no big furnaces. There's no poison. There's no pollution. It turns out that other species figured out a long time ago how to create many of the things we need using biological processes that nature knows how to use well. That insight of biomimicry, of our scientists finally realizing that we have as much to learn from other species \u2014 I don't mean taking a mouse and sticking it with stuff. I don't mean looking at it from that way, abusing the little species. I mean actually respecting them, respecting what they've achieved. That's called biomimicry, and that opens the door to zero waste production; zero pollution production; that we could actually enjoy a high quality of life, a high standard of living, without trashing the planet.Well, that idea of biomimicry, respecting the wisdom of all species, combined with the idea of democracy and social justice, respecting the wisdom and the worth of all people, would give us a different society. We would have a different economy. We would have a green society that Dr. King would be proud of. That should be the goal. And the way that we get there is to first of all recognize that the idea of disposability not only hurts the species we've talked about, but it even corrupts our own society.We're so proud to live here in California. We just had this vote, and everybody's like, \"Well \u2014 not in our state!\"(Laughter)I don't know what those other states were doing, but ...\"(Laughter)Just so proud. And, yeah, I'm proud, too. But ... California, though we lead the world in some of the green stuff, we also, unfortunately, lead the world in some of the gulag stuff. California has one of the highest incarceration rates of all the 50 states. We have a moral challenge in this movement. We are passionate about rescuing some dead materials from the landfill, but sometimes not as passionate about rescuing living beings, living people. And I would say that we live in a country \u2014 five percent of the world's population, 25 percent of the greenhouse gases, but also 25 percent of the world's prisoners. One of every four people locked up anywhere in the world is locked up right here in the United States. So that is consistent with this idea that disposability is something we believe in.And yet, as a movement that has to broaden its constituency, that has to grow, that has to reach out beyond our natural comfort zone, one of the challenges to the success of this movement, of getting rid of things like plastic and helping the economy shift, is people look at our movement with some suspicion. And they ask a question, and the question is: How can these people be so passionate? A poor person, a low-income person, somebody in Cancer Alley, somebody in Watts, somebody in Harlem, somebody on an Indian reservation, might say to themselves \u2014 and rightfully so \u2014 \"How can these people be so passionate about making sure that a plastic bottle has a second chance in life, or an aluminum can has a second chance, and yet, when my child gets in trouble and goes to prison, he doesn't get a second chance?\" \"How can this movement be so passionate about saying we don't have throwaway stuff, no throwaway dead materials, and yet accept throwaway lives and throwaway communities like Cancer Alley?\" And so, we now get a chance to be truly proud of this movement. When we take on topics like this, it gives us that extra call to reach out to other movements and to become more inclusive and to grow, and we can finally get out of this crazy dilemma that we've been in.Most of you are good, softhearted people. When you were younger, you cared about the whole world, and at some point, somebody said you had to pick an issue, you had to boil your love down to an issue. \"Can't love the whole world \u2014 you've got to work on trees or you've got to work on immigration. You've got to shrink it down and be about one issue.\" And really, they fundamentally told you, \"Are you going to hug a tree? Or are you going to hug a child? Pick. Are you going to hug a tree? Or are you going to hug a child? Pick.\" Well, when you start working on issues like plastic, you realize the whole thing is connected. And luckily, most of us are blessed to have two arms \u2014 we can hug both.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1056, "subtitle":

topic,\n\n00:00:20.347 --> 00:00:22.172\nwhich I think is of grave importance.\n\n00:00:22.196 --> 00:00:23.419\nWe've been talking a lot\n\n00:00:23.443 --> 00:00:29.386\nabout the horrific impacts of plastic\non the planet and on other species,\n\n00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.418\nbut plastic hurts people, too --\n\n00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:33.291\nespecially poor people.\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:37.116\nAnd both in the production of plastic,\n\n00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.858\nthe use of plastic\nand the disposal of plastic,\n\n00:00:39.882 --> 00:00:42.447\nthe people who have\nthe bull's-eye on their foreheads\n\n00:00:42.471 --> 00:00:44.161\nare poor people.\n\n00:00:44.185 --> 00:00:47.262\nPeople got very upset\n\n00:00:47.286 --> 00:00:50.365\nwhen the BP oil spill happened,\n\n00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:51.849\nfor very good reason.\n\n00:00:51.873 --> 00:00:53.497\nPeople thought, \"Oh, my God.\n\n00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:56.297\nThis is terrible, this oil --\nit's in the water.\n\n00:00:56.321 --> 00:01:00.239\nIt's going to destroy\nthe living systems there.\n\n00:01:00.263 --> 00:01:01.697\nPeople are going to be hurt.\n\n00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:03.212\nThis is a terrible thing,\n\n00:01:03.236 --> 00:01:05.571\nthis oil is going to hurt\nthe people in the Gulf.\"\n\n00:01:05.595 --> 00:01:07.665\nWhat people don't think about is:\n\n00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:09.848\nWhat if the oil had made it\nsafely to shore?\n\n00:01:10.442 --> 00:01:13.133\nWhat if the oil actually got\nwhere it was trying to go?\n\n00:01:13.772 --> 00:01:17.769\nNot only would it have been burned\nin engines and added to global warming,\n\n00:01:17.793 --> 00:01:21.154\nbut there's a place called \"Cancer Alley,\"\n\n00:01:21.178 --> 00:01:23.313\nand the reason it's called \"Cancer Alley\"\n\n00:01:23.337 --> 00:01:25.965\nis because the petrochemical industry\n\n00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:28.145\ntakes that oil and turns it into plastic\n\n00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:30.349\nand in the process, kills people.\n\n00:01:30.872 --> 00:01:33.920\nIt shortens the lives of the people\nwho live there in the Gulf.\n\n00:01:33.944 --> 00:01:37.738\nSo oil and petrochemicals are not\njust a problem when there's a spill;\n\n00:01:37.762 --> 00:01:39.472\nthey're a problem when there's not.\n\n00:01:39.496 --> 00:01:41.903\nAnd what we don't often appreciate\n\n00:01:41.927 --> 00:01:43.601\nis the price that poor people pay\n\n00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:45.736\nfor us to have these disposable products.\n\n00:01:46.151 --> 00:01:48.296\nThe other thing\nwe often don't appreciate is,\n\n00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.420\nit's not just at the point of production\nthat poor people suffer.\n\n00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.617\nPoor people also suffer\nat the point of use.\n\n00:01:54.094 --> 00:01:56.179\nThose of us who earn\na certain income level,\n\n00:01:56.203 --> 00:01:58.144\nwe have something called choice.\n\n00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:01.094\nThe reason why you want\nto work hard and have a job\n\n00:02:01.118 --> 00:02:02.789\nand not be poor and broke\n\n00:02:02.813 --> 00:02:05.254\nis so you can have choices,\neconomic choices.\n\n00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.735\nWe actually get a chance\nto choose not to use products\n\n00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.976\nthat have dangerous,\npoisonous plastic in them.\n\n00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.535\nOther people who are poor\ndon't have those choices.\n\n00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:16.533\nSo low-income people often are the ones\n\n00:02:16.557 --> 00:02:20.541\nwho are buying the products that have\nthose dangerous chemicals in them\n\n00:02:20.565 --> 00:02:22.004\nthat their children are using.\n\n00:02:22.028 --> 00:02:25.852\nThose are the people who wind up\ningesting a disproportionate amount\n\n00:02:25.876 --> 00:02:28.043\nof this poisonous plastic in using it.\n\n00:02:28.067 --> 00:02:31.300\nAnd people say, \"Well, they should\njust buy a different product.\"\n\n00:02:31.324 --> 00:02:34.459\nWell, the problem with being poor\nis you don't have those choices.\n\n00:02:34.483 --> 00:02:36.571\nYou often have to buy\nthe cheapest products.\n\n00:02:36.595 --> 00:02:39.574\nThe cheapest products\nare often the most dangerous.\n\n00:02:39.598 --> 00:02:41.194\nAnd if that weren't bad enough --\n\n00:02:41.218 --> 00:02:44.639\nif it wasn't just the production\nof plastic that's giving people cancer\n\n00:02:44.663 --> 00:02:46.167\nin places like Cancer Alley,\n\n00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:49.699\nand shortening lives and hurting\npoor kids at the point of use --\n\n00:02:49.723 --> 00:02:51.806\nat the point of disposal,\n\n00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.088\nonce again, it's poor people\nwho bear the burden.\n\n00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.065\nOften, we think we're doing a good thing:\n\n00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:01.737\nYou're in your office, drinking\nyour bottled water or whatever it is,\n\n00:03:01.761 --> 00:03:04.520\nand you think to yourself,\n\"I'm going to throw this away.\n\n00:03:04.544 --> 00:03:08.074\nNo -- I'm going to be virtuous.\nI'm going to put it in the blue bin.\"\n\n00:03:08.098 --> 00:03:10.130\nYou think, \"I put mine in the blue bin.\"\n\n00:03:10.154 --> 00:03:13.718\nAnd then you look\nat your colleague and say,\n\n00:03:13.742 --> 00:03:16.856\n\"Why, you cretin!\nYou put yours in the white bin.\"\n\n00:03:17.218 --> 00:03:19.504\nAnd we use that as a moral tickle.\n\n00:03:19.528 --> 00:03:21.273\nWe feel so good about ourselves.\n\n00:03:21.297 --> 00:03:24.552\nIf we -- well, OK, I'm just ... me.\n\n00:03:24.576 --> 00:03:26.276\nNot you, but I feel this way often.\n\n00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.849\nAnd so we kind of have\nthis moral feel-good moment.\n\n00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:34.084\nBut if we were to be able\nto follow that little bottle\n\n00:03:34.674 --> 00:03:36.139\non its journey,\n\n00:03:36.163 --> 00:03:38.728\nwe would be shocked\nto discover that, all too often,\n\n00:03:38.752 --> 00:03:41.082\nthat bottle is going to be put on a boat,\n\n00:03:42.007 --> 00:03:44.184\nit's going to go all the way\nacross the ocean\n\n00:03:44.844 --> 00:03:46.160\nat some expense,\n\n00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:49.703\nand it's going to wind up\nin a developing country, often China.\n\n00:03:49.727 --> 00:03:51.315\nI think in our minds, we imagine\n\n00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:53.799\nsomebody's going to take\nthe little bottle

There's no pollution.\n\n00:08:05.075 --> 00:08:09.875\nIt turns out that other species\nfigured out a long time ago\n\n00:08:09.899 --> 00:08:12.234\nhow to create many of the things we

species,\n\n00:08:50.924 --> 00:08:54.796\ncombined with the idea\nof democracy and social justice,\n\n00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.415\nrespecting the wisdom\nand the worth of all

there\nis to first of all recognize\n\n00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:12.667\nthat the idea of disposability\n\n00:09:13.524 --> 00:09:17.634\nnot only hurts the species\nwe've talked about,\n\n00:09:17.658 --> 00:09:20.409\nbut it even corrupts our own society.\n\n00:09:20.433 --> 00:09:23.410\nWe're so proud to live here in California.\n\n00:09:23.434 --> 00:09:25.520\nWe just had this vote,\nand

00:09:39.566\nBut ...\n\n00:09:41.118 --> 00:09:44.634\nCalifornia, though we lead the world\nin some of the green stuff,\n\n00:09:44.658 --> 00:09:46.634\nwe also, unfortunately, lead the world\n\n00:09:46.658 --> 00:09:48.198\nin some of the gulag stuff.\n\n00:09:49.364 --> 00:09:52.904\nCalifornia has one of the highest\nincarceration rates\n\n00:09:52.928 --> 00:09:54.634\nof all

would say\nthat we live in a country --\n\n00:10:10.515 --> 00:10:12.492\nfive percent of the world's population,\n\n00:10:12.516 --> 00:10:14.382\n25 percent of the greenhouse gases,\n\n00:10:15.030

up right here\nin the United States.\n\n00:10:22.924 --> 00:10:25.634\nSo that is consistent with this idea\n\n00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:28.294\nthat disposability\nis something we believe in.\n\n00:10:28.874 --> 00:10:30.033\nAnd yet,\n\n00:10:31.198 --> 00:10:35.720\nas a movement that has to broaden\nits constituency,\n\n00:10:35.744 --> 00:10:37.055\nthat has to

It's really a huge challenge for us. And this is our beast of burden \u2014 this is a Computer Tomography machine, a CT machine. It's a fantastic device. It uses X-rays, X-ray beams, that are rotating very fast around the human body. It takes about 30 seconds to go through the whole machine and is generating enormous amounts of information that comes out of the machine. So this is a fantastic machine that we can use for improving health care, but as I said, it's also a challenge for us. And the challenge is really found in this picture here. It's the medical data explosion that we're having right now. We're facing this problem. And let me step back in time.Let's go back a few years in time and see what happened back then. These machines that came out \u2014 they started coming in the 1970s \u2014 they would scan human bodies, and they would generate about 100 images of the human body. And I've taken the liberty, just for clarity, to translate that to data slices. That would correspond to about 50 megabytes of data, which is small when you think about the data we can handle today just on normal mobile devices. If you translate that to phone books, it's about one meter of phone books in the pile. Looking at what we're doing today with these machines that we have, we can, just in a few seconds, get 24,000 images out of a body, and that would correspond to about 20 gigabytes of data, or 800 phone books, and the pile would then be 200 meters of phone books. What's about to happen \u2014 and we're seeing this; it's beginning \u2014 a technology trend that's happening right now is that we're starting to look at time-resolved situations as well. So we're getting the dynamics out of the body as well. And just assume that we will be collecting data during five seconds, and that would correspond to one terabyte of data \u2014 that's 800,000 books and 16 kilometers of phone books. That's one patient, one data set. And this is what we have to deal with.So this is really the enormous challenge that we have. And already today \u2014 this is 25,000 images. Imagine the days when we had radiologists doing this. They would put up 25,000 images, they would go like this, \"25,0000, okay, okay. There is the problem.\" They can't do that anymore. That's impossible. So we have to do something that's a little bit more intelligent than doing this. So what we do is that we put all these slices together. Imagine that you slice your body in all these directions, and then you try to put the slices back together again into a pile of data, into a block of data. So this is really what we're doing. So this gigabyte or terabyte of data, we're putting it into this block. But of course, the block of data just contains the amount of X-ray that's been absorbed in each point in the human body. So what we need to do is to figure out a way of looking at the things we do want to look at and make things transparent that we don't want to look at. So transforming the data set into something that looks like this. And this is a challenge. This is a huge challenge for us to do that.Using computers, even though they're getting faster and better all the time, it's a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data, terabytes of data and extracting the relevant information. I want to look at the heart. I want to look at the blood vessels. I want to look at the liver. Maybe even find a tumor, in some cases. So this is where this little dear comes into play. This is my daughter. This is as of 9 a.m. this morning. She's playing a computer game. She's only two years old, and she's having a blast. So she's really the driving force behind the development of graphics-processing units. As long as kids are playing computer games, graphics is getting better and better and better. So please go back home, tell your kids to play more games, because that's what I need.So what's inside of this machine is what enables me to do the things that I'm doing with the medical data. So really what I'm doing is using these fantastic little devices. And you know, going back maybe 10 years in time when I got the funding to buy my first graphics computer \u2014 it was a huge machine. It was cabinets of processors and storage and everything. I paid about one million dollars for that machine. That machine is, today, about as fast as my iPhone. So every month there are new graphics cards coming out, and here is a few of the latest ones from the vendors \u2014 NVIDIA, ATI, Intel is out there as well. And you know, for a few hundred bucks you can get these things and put them into your computer, and you can do fantastic things with these graphics cards. So this is really what's enabling us to deal with the explosion of data in medicine, together with some really nifty work in terms of algorithms \u2014 compressing data, extracting the relevant information that people are doing research on.So I'm going to show you a few examples of what we can do. This is a data set that was captured using a CT scanner. You can see that this is a full data [set]. It's a woman. You can see the hair. You can see the individual structures of the woman. You can see that there is [a] scattering of X-rays on the teeth, the metal in the teeth. That's where those artifacts are coming from. But fully interactively on standard graphics cards on a normal computer, I can just put in a clip plane. And of course all the data is inside, so I can start rotating, I can look at it from different angles, and I can see that this woman had a problem. She had a bleeding up in the brain, and that's been fixed with a little stent, a metal clamp that's tightening up the vessel. And just by changing the functions, then I can decide what's going to be transparent and what's going to be visible. I can look at the skull structure, and I can see that, okay, this is where they opened up the skull on this woman, and that's where they went in. So these are fantastic images. They're really high resolution, and they're really showing us what we can do with standard graphics cards today.Now we have really made use of this, and we have tried to squeeze a lot of data into the system. And one of the applications that we've been working on \u2014 and this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide \u2014 is the application of virtual autopsies. So again, looking at very, very large data sets, and you saw those full-body scans that we can do. We're just pushing the body through the whole CT scanner, and just in a few seconds we can get a full-body data set. So this is from a virtual autopsy. And you can see how I'm gradually peeling off. First you saw the body bag that the body came in, then I'm peeling off the skin \u2014 you can see the muscles \u2014 and eventually you can see the bone structure of this woman.Now at this point, I would also like to emphasize that, with the greatest respect for the people that I'm now going to show \u2014 I'm going to show you a few cases of virtual autopsies \u2014 so it's with great respect for the people that have died under violent circumstances that I'm showing these pictures to you. In the forensic case \u2014 and this is something that ... there's been approximately 400 cases so far just in the part of Sweden that I come from that has been undergoing virtual autopsies in the past four years. So this will be the typical workflow situation. The police will decide \u2014 in the evening, when there's a case coming in \u2014 they will decide, okay, is this a case where we need to do an autopsy? So in the morning, in between six and seven in the morning, the body is then transported inside of the body bag to our center and is being scanned through one of the CT scanners. And then the radiologist, together with the pathologist and sometimes the forensic scientist, looks at the data that's coming out, and they have a joint session. And then they decide what to do in the real physical autopsy after that.Now looking at a few cases, here's one of the first cases that we had. You can really see the details of the data set. It's very high-resolution, and it's our algorithms that allow us to zoom in on all the details. And again, it's fully interactive, so you can rotate and you can look at things in real time on these systems here. Without saying too much about this case, this is a traffic accident, a drunk driver hit a woman. And it's very, very easy to see the damages on the bone structure. And the cause of death is the broken neck. And this women also ended up under the car, so she's quite badly beaten up by this injury.Here's another case, a knifing. And this is also again showing us what we can do. It's very easy to look at metal artifacts that we can show inside of the body. You can also see some of the artifacts from the teeth \u2014 that's actually the filling of the teeth \u2014 but because I've set the functions to show me metal and make everything else transparent. Here's another violent case. This really didn't kill the person. The person was killed by stabs in the heart, but they just deposited the knife by putting it through one of the eyeballs. Here's another case. It's very interesting for us to be able to look at things like knife stabbings. Here you can see that knife went through the heart. It's very easy to see how air has been leaking from one part to another part, which is difficult to do in a normal, standard, physical autopsy. So it really, really helps the criminal investigation to establish the cause of death, and in some cases also directing the investigation in the right direction to find out who the killer really was.Here's another case that I think is interesting. Here you can see a bullet that has lodged just next to the spine on this person. And what we've done is that we've turned the bullet into a light source, so that bullet is actually shining, and it makes it really easy to find these fragments. During a physical autopsy, if you actually have to dig through the body to find these fragments, that's actually quite hard to do.One of the things that I'm really, really happy to be able to show you here today is our virtual autopsy table. It's a touch device that we have developed based on these algorithms, using standard graphics GPUs. It actually looks like this, just to give you a feeling for what it looks like. It really just works like a huge iPhone. So we've implemented all the gestures you can do on the table, and you can think of it as an enormous touch interface. So if you were thinking of buying an iPad, forget about it. This is what you want instead. Steve, I hope you're listening to this, all right. So it's a very nice little device. So if you have the opportunity, please try it out. It's really a hands-on experience. So it gained some traction, and we're trying to roll this out and trying to use it for educational purposes, but also, perhaps in the future, in a more clinical situation. There's a YouTube video that you can download and look at this, if you want to convey the information to other people about virtual autopsies.Okay, now that we're talking about touch, let me move on to really \"touching\" data. And this is a bit of science fiction now, so we're moving into really the future. This is not really what the medical doctors are using right now, but I hope they will in the future. So what you're seeing on the left is a touch device. It's a little mechanical pen that has very, very fast step motors inside of the pen. And so I can generate a force feedback. So when I virtually touch data, it will generate forces in the pen, so I get a feedback. So in this particular situation, it's a scan of a living person. I have this pen, and I look at the data, and I move the pen towards the head, and all of a sudden I feel resistance. So I can feel the skin. If I push a little bit harder, I'll go through the skin, and I can feel the bone structure inside. If I push even harder, I'll go through the bone structure, especially close to the ear where the bone is very soft. And then I can feel the brain inside, and this will be the slushy like this.So this is really nice. And to take that even further, this is a heart. And this is also due to these fantastic new scanners, that just in 0.3 seconds, I can scan the whole heart, and I can do that with time resolution. So just looking at this heart, I can play back a video here. And this is Karljohan, one of my graduate students who's been working on this project. And he's sitting there in front of the Haptic device, the force feedback system, and he's moving his pen towards the heart, and the heart is now beating in front of him, so he can see how the heart is beating. He's taken the pen, and he's moving it towards the heart, and he's putting it on the heart, and then he feels the heartbeats from the real living patient. Then he can examine how the heart is moving. He can go inside, push inside of the heart, and really feel how the valves are moving. And this, I think, is really the future for heart surgeons. I mean it's probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon to be able to go inside of the patient's heart before you actually do surgery, and do that with high-quality resolution data. So this is really neat.Now we're going even further into science fiction. And we heard a little bit about functional MRI. Now this is really an interesting project. MRI is using magnetic fields and radio frequencies to scan the brain, or any part of the body. So what we're really getting out of this is information of the structure of the brain, but we can also measure the difference in magnetic properties of blood that's oxygenated and blood that's depleted of oxygen. That means that it's possible to map out the activity of the brain. So this is something that we've been working on. And you just saw Motts the research engineer, there, going into the MRI system, and he was wearing goggles. So he could actually see things in the goggles. So I could present things to him while he's in the scanner. And this is a little bit freaky, because what Motts is seeing is actually this. He's seeing his own brain. So Motts is doing something here, and probably he is going like this with his right hand, because the left side is activated on the motor cortex. And then he can see that at the same time. These visualizations are brand new. And this is something that we've been researching for a little while.This is another sequence of Motts' brain. And here we asked Motts to calculate backwards from 100. So he's going \"100, 97, 94.\" And then he's going backwards. And you can see how the little math processor is working up here in his brain and is lighting up the whole brain. Well this is fantastic. We can do this in real time. We can investigate things. We can tell him to do things. You can also see that his visual cortex is activated in the back of the head, because that's where he's seeing, he's seeing his own brain. And he's also hearing our instructions when we tell him to do things. The signal is really deep inside of the brain as well, and it's shining through, because all of the data is inside this volume. And in just a second here you will see \u2014 okay, here. Motts, now move your left foot. So he's going like this. For 20 seconds he's going like that, and all of a sudden it lights up up here. So we've got motor cortex activation up there. So this is really, really nice, and I think this is a great tool. And connecting also with the previous talk here, this is something that we could use as a tool to really understand how the neurons are working, how the brain is working, and we can do this with very, very high visual quality and very fast resolution.Now we're also having a bit of fun at the center. So this is a CAT scan \u2014 Computer Aided Tomography. So this is a lion from the local zoo outside of Norrkoping in Kolmarden, Elsa. So she came to the center, and they sedated her and then put her straight into the scanner. And then, of course, I get the whole data set from the lion. And I can do very nice images like this. I can peel off the layer of the lion. I can look inside of it. And we've been experimenting with this. And I think this is a great application for the future of this technology, because there's very little known about the animal anatomy. What's known out there for veterinarians is kind of basic information. We can scan all sorts of things, all sorts of animals. The only problem is to fit it into the machine. So here's a bear. It was kind of hard to get it in. And the bear is a cuddly, friendly animal. And here it is. Here is the nose of the bear. And you might want to cuddle this one, until you change the functions and look at this. So be aware of the bear.So with that, I'd like to thank all the people who have helped me to generate these images. It's a huge effort that goes into doing this, gathering the data and developing the algorithms, writing all the software. So, some very talented people. My motto is always, I only hire people that are smarter than I am and most of these are smarter than I am.So thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1057, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nI will start by posing a little bit of a challenge:\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nthe challenge of dealing with data,\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\ndata that we have to deal with\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nin medical situations.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nIt's really a huge challenge for us.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nAnd this is our beast of burden --\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nthis is a Computer Tomography machine,\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\na CT machine.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nIt's a fantastic device.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nIt uses X-rays, X-ray beams,\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nthat are rotating very fast around the human body.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nIt takes about 30 seconds to go through the whole machine\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nand is generating enormous amounts of information\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nthat comes out of the machine.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nSo this is a fantastic machine\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nthat we can use\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nfor improving health care,\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nbut as I said, it's also a challenge for us.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nAnd the challenge is really found in this picture here.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nIt's the medical data explosion\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nthat we're having right now.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nWe're facing this problem.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nAnd let me step back in time.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nLet's go back a few years in time and see what happened back then.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nThese machines that came out --\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nthey started coming in the 1970s --\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nthey would scan human bodies,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nand they would generate about 100 images\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nof the human body.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nAnd I've taken the liberty, just for clarity,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nto translate that to data slices.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nThat would correspond to about 50 megabytes of data,\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nwhich is small\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nwhen you think about the data we can handle today\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\njust on normal mobile devices.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nIf you translate that to phone books,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nit's about one meter of phone books in the pile.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nLooking at what we're doing today\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nwith these machines that we have,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nwe can, just in a few seconds,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nget 24,000 images out of a body,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nand that would correspond to about 20 gigabytes of data,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nor 800 phone books,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nand the pile would then be 200 meters of phone books.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nWhat's about to happen --\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nand we're seeing this; it's beginning --\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\na technology trend that's happening right now\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nis that we're starting to look at time-resolved situations as well.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nSo we're getting the dynamics out of the body as well.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nAnd just assume\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nthat we will be collecting data during five seconds,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nand that would correspond to one terabyte of data --\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nthat's 800,000 books\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nand 16 kilometers of phone books.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nThat's one patient, one data set.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nAnd this is what we have to deal with.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nSo this is really the enormous challenge that we have.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nAnd already today -- this is 25,000 images.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nImagine the days\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nwhen we had radiologists doing this.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nThey would put up 25,000 images,\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nthey would go like this, \"25,0000, okay, okay.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nThere is the problem.\"\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nThey can't do that anymore. That's impossible.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nSo we have to do something that's a little bit more intelligent than doing this.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nSo what we do is that we put all these slices together.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nImagine that you slice your body in all these directions,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nand then you try to put the slices back together again\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\ninto a pile of data, into a block of data.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nSo this is really what we're doing.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nSo this gigabyte or terabyte of data, we're putting it into this block.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nBut of course, the block of data\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\njust contains the amount of X-ray\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nthat's been absorbed in each point in the human body.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nSo what we need to do is to figure out a way\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nof looking at the things we do want to look at\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nand make things transparent that we don't want to look at.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nSo transforming the data set\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\ninto something that looks like this.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nAnd this is a challenge.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nThis is a huge challenge for us to do that.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nUsing computers, even though they're getting faster and better all the time,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nit's a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nterabytes of data\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nand extracting the relevant information.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nI want to look at the heart.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nI want to look at the blood vessels. I want to look at the liver.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nMaybe even find a tumor,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nin some cases.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nSo this is where this little dear comes into play.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nThis is my daughter.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nThis is as of 9 a.m. this morning.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nShe's playing a computer game.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nShe's only two years old,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nand she's having a blast.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nSo she's really the driving force\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nbehind the development of graphics-processing units.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nAs long as kids are playing computer games,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\ngraphics is getting better and better and better.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nSo please go back home, tell your kids to play more games,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nbecause that's what I need.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nSo what's inside of this machine\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nis what enables me to do the things that I'm doing\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nwith the medical data.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nSo really what I'm doing is using these fantastic little devices.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nAnd you know, going back\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nmaybe 10 years in time\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nwhen I got the funding\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nto buy my first graphics computer --\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nit was a huge machine.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nIt was cabinets of processors and storage and everything.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nI paid about one million dollars for that machine.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nThat machine is, today, about as fast as my iPhone.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nSo every month there are new graphics cards coming out,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nand here is a few of the latest ones from the vendors --\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nNVIDIA, ATI, Intel is out there as well.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nAnd you know, for a few hundred bucks\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nyou can get these things and put them into your computer,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nand you can do fantastic things with these graphics cards.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nSo this is really what's enabling us\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nto deal with the explosion of data in medicine,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\ntogether with some really nifty work\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nin terms of algorithms --\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\ncompressing data,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nextracting the relevant information that people are doing research on.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nSo I'm going to show you a few examples of what we can do.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nThis is a data set that was captured using a CT scanner.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nYou can see that this is a full data [set].\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nIt's a woman. You can see the hair.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nYou can see the individual structures of the woman.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nYou can see that there is [a] scattering of X-rays\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\non the teeth, the metal in the teeth.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nThat's where those artifacts are coming from.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nBut fully interactively\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\non standard graphics cards on a normal computer,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nI can just put in a clip plane.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nAnd of course all the data is inside,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nso I can start rotating, I can look at it from different angles,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nand I can see that this woman had a problem.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nShe had a bleeding up in the brain,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nand that's been fixed with a little stent,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\na metal clamp that's tightening up the vessel.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nAnd just by changing the functions,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nthen I can decide what's going to be transparent\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nand what's going to be visible.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nI can look at the skull structure,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nand I can see that, okay, this is where they opened up the skull on this woman,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nand that's where they went in.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nSo these are fantastic images.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nThey're really high resolution,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nand they're really showing us what we can do\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nwith standard graphics cards today.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nNow we have really made use of this,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nand we have tried to squeeze a lot of data\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\ninto the system.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nAnd one of the applications that we've been working on --\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nand this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide --\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nis the application of virtual autopsies.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nSo again, looking at very, very large data sets,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nand you saw those full-body scans that we can do.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nWe're just pushing the body through the whole CT scanner,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nand just in a few seconds we can get a full-body data set.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nSo this is from a virtual autopsy.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nAnd you can see how I'm gradually peeling off.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nFirst you saw the body bag that the body came in,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nthen I'm peeling off the skin -- you can see the muscles --\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nand eventually you can see the bone structure of this woman.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nNow at this point, I would also like to emphasize\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nthat, with the greatest respect\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nfor the people that I'm now going to show --\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nI'm going to show you a few cases of virtual autopsies --\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nso it's with great respect for the people\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nthat have died under violent circumstances\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nthat I'm showing these pictures to you.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nIn the forensic case --\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nand this is something\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nthat ... there's been approximately 400 cases so far\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\njust in the part of Sweden that I come from\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nthat has been undergoing virtual autopsies\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nin the past four years.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nSo this will be the typical workflow situation.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nThe police will decide --\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nin the evening, when there's a case coming in --\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nthey will decide, okay, is this a case where we need to do an autopsy?\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nSo in the morning, in between six and seven in the morning,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nthe body is then transported inside of the body bag\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nto our center\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nand is being scanned through one of the CT scanners.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nAnd then the radiologist, together with the pathologist\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nand sometimes the forensic scientist,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nlooks at the data that's coming out,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nand they have a joint session.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd then they decide what to do in the real physical autopsy after that.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nNow looking at a few cases,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nhere's one of the first cases that we had.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nYou can really see the details of the data set.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nIt's very high-resolution,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nand it's our algorithms that allow us\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nto zoom in on all the details.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nAnd again, it's fully interactive,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nso you can rotate and you can look at things in real time\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\non these systems here.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nWithout saying too much about this case,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nthis is a traffic accident,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\na drunk driver hit a woman.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd it's very, very easy to see the damages on the bone structure.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nAnd the cause of death is the broken neck.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nAnd this women also ended up under the car,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nso she's quite badly beaten up\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nby this injury.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nHere's another case, a knifing.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nAnd this is also again showing us what we can do.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nIt's very easy to look at metal artifacts\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nthat we can show inside of the body.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nYou can also see some of the artifacts from the teeth --\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nthat's actually the filling of the teeth --\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nbut because I've set the functions to show me metal\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nand make everything else transparent.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nHere's another violent case. This really didn't kill the person.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nThe person was killed by stabs in the heart,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nbut they just deposited the knife\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nby putting it through one of the eyeballs.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nHere's another case.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nIt's very interesting for us\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nto be able to look at things like knife stabbings.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nHere you can see that knife went through the heart.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nIt's very easy to see how air has been leaking\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nfrom one part to another part,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nwhich is difficult to do in a normal, standard, physical autopsy.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nSo it really, really helps\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nthe criminal investigation\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nto establish the cause of death,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nand in some cases also directing the investigation in the right direction\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nto find out who the killer really was.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nHere's another case that I think is interesting.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nHere you can see a bullet\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nthat has lodged just next to the spine on this person.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nAnd what we've done is that we've turned the bullet into a light source,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nso that bullet is actually shining,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nand it makes it really easy to find these fragments.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nDuring a physical autopsy,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nif you actually have to dig through the body to find these fragments,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nthat's actually quite hard to do.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nOne of the things that I'm really, really happy\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nto be able to show you here today\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nis our virtual autopsy table.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nIt's a touch device that we have developed\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nbased on these algorithms, using standard graphics GPUs.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nIt actually looks like this,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\njust to give you a feeling for what it looks like.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nIt really just works like a huge iPhone.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nSo we've implemented\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nall the gestures you can do on the table,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nand you can think of it as an enormous touch interface.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nSo if you were thinking of buying an iPad,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nforget about it. This is what you want instead.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nSteve, I hope you're listening to this, all right.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nSo it's a very nice little device.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nSo if you have the opportunity, please try it out.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nIt's really a hands-on experience.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nSo it gained some traction, and we're trying to roll this out\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nand trying to use it for educational purposes,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nbut also, perhaps in the future,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nin a more clinical situation.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nThere's a YouTube video that you can download and look at this,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nif you want to convey the information to other people\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nabout virtual autopsies.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nOkay, now that we're talking about touch,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nlet me move on to really \"touching\" data.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nAnd this is a bit of science fiction now,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nso we're moving into really the future.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nThis is not really what the medical doctors are using right now,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nbut I hope they will in the future.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nSo what you're seeing on the left is a touch device.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nIt's a little mechanical pen\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nthat has very, very fast step motors inside of the pen.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nAnd so I can generate a force feedback.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nSo when I virtually touch data,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nit will generate forces in the pen, so I get a feedback.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nSo in this particular situation,\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nit's a scan of a living person.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nI have this pen, and I look at the data,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nand I move the pen towards the head,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nand all of a sudden I feel resistance.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nSo I can feel the skin.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nIf I push a little bit harder, I'll go through the skin,\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nand I can feel the bone structure inside.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nIf I push even harder, I'll go through the bone structure,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nespecially close to the ear where the bone is very soft.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nAnd then I can feel the brain inside, and this will be the slushy like this.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nSo this is really nice.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nAnd to take that even further, this is a heart.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nAnd this is also due to these fantastic new scanners,\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nthat just in 0.3 seconds,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nI can scan the whole heart,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nand I can do that with time resolution.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nSo just looking at this heart,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nI can play back a video here.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nAnd this is Karljohan, one of my graduate students\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nwho's been working on this project.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nAnd he's sitting there in front of the Haptic device, the force feedback system,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nand he's moving his pen towards the heart,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nand the heart is now beating in front of him,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nso he can see how the heart is beating.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nHe's taken the pen, and he's moving it towards the heart,\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nand he's putting it on the heart,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nand then he feels the heartbeats from the real living patient.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nThen he can examine how the heart is moving.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nHe can go inside, push inside of the heart,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nand really feel how the valves are moving.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nAnd this, I think, is really the future for heart surgeons.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nI mean it's probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nto be able to go inside of the patient's heart\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nbefore you actually do surgery,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nand do that with high-quality resolution data.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nSo this is really neat.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nNow we're going even further into science fiction.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nAnd we heard a little bit about functional MRI.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nNow this is really an interesting project.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nMRI is using magnetic fields\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nand radio frequencies\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nto scan the brain, or any part of the body.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nSo what we're really getting out of this\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nis information of the structure of the brain,\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nbut we can also measure the difference\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nin magnetic properties of blood that's oxygenated\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nand blood that's depleted of oxygen.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nThat means that it's possible\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nto map out the activity of the brain.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nSo this is something that we've been working on.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nAnd you just saw Motts the research engineer, there,\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\ngoing into the MRI system,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nand he was wearing goggles.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nSo he could actually see things in the goggles.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nSo I could present things to him while he's in the scanner.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nAnd this is a little bit freaky,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nbecause what Motts is seeing is actually this.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nHe's seeing his own brain.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nSo Motts is doing something here,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nand probably he is going like this with his right hand,\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nbecause the left side is activated\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\non the motor cortex.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nAnd then he can see that at the same time.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nThese visualizations are brand new.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nAnd this is something that we've been researching for a little while.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nThis is another sequence of Motts' brain.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nAnd here we asked Motts to calculate backwards from 100.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nSo he's going \"100, 97, 94.\"\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nAnd then he's going backwards.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nAnd you can see how the little math processor is working up here in his brain\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nand is lighting up the whole brain.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nWell this is fantastic. We can do this in real time.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nWe can investigate things. We can tell him to do things.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nYou can also see that his visual cortex\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nis activated in the back of the head,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nbecause that's where he's seeing, he's seeing his own brain.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nAnd he's also hearing our instructions\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nwhen we tell him to do things.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nThe signal is really deep inside of the brain as well,\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nand it's shining through,\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nbecause all of the data is inside this volume.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nAnd in just a second here you will see --\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nokay, here. Motts, now move your left foot.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nSo he's going like this.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nFor 20 seconds he's going like that,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nand all of a sudden it lights up up here.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nSo we've got motor cortex activation up there.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nSo this is really, really nice,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nand I think this is a great tool.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nAnd connecting also with the previous talk here,\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nthis is something that we could use as a tool\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nto really understand\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nhow the neurons are working, how the brain is working,\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nand we can do this with very, very high visual quality\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nand very fast resolution.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nNow we're also having a bit of fun at the center.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nSo this is a CAT scan -- Computer Aided Tomography.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nSo this is a lion from the local zoo\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\noutside of Norrkoping in Kolmarden, Elsa.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nSo she came to the center,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nand they sedated her\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nand then put her straight into the scanner.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nAnd then, of course, I get the whole data set from the lion.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nAnd I can do very nice images like this.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nI can peel off the layer of the lion.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nI can look inside of it.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nAnd we've been experimenting with this.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nAnd I think this is a great application\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nfor the future of this technology,\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nbecause there's very little known about the animal anatomy.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nWhat's known out there for veterinarians is kind of basic information.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nWe can scan all sorts of things,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nall sorts of animals.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nThe only problem is to fit it into the machine.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nSo here's a bear.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nIt was kind of hard to get it in.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nAnd the bear is a cuddly, friendly animal.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nAnd here it is. Here is the nose of the bear.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nAnd you might want to cuddle this one,\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nuntil you change the functions and look at this.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nSo be aware of the bear.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nSo with that,\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nI'd like to thank all the people\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nwho have helped me to generate these images.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nIt's a huge effort that goes into doing this,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\ngathering the data and developing the algorithms,\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nwriting all the software.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nSo, some very talented people.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nMy motto is always, I only hire people that are smarter than I am\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nand most of these are smarter than I am.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nSo thank you very much.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:26.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Silicon-based comedy", "duration": "364", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/heather_knight_silicon_based_comedy", "transcript": "Some of the greatest innovations and developments in the world often happen at the intersection of two fields. So tonight I'd like to tell you about the intersection that I'm most excited about at this very moment, which is entertainment and robotics. So if we're trying to make robots that can be more expressive and that can connect better with us in society, maybe we should look to some of the human professionals of artificial emotion and personality that occur in the dramatic arts. I'm also interested in creating new technologies for the arts and to attract people to science and technology. Some people in the last decade or two have started creating artwork with technology. With my new venture, Marilyn Monrobot, I would like to use art to create tech.(Laughter)So we're based in New York City. And if you're a performer that wants to collaborate with an adorable robot, or if you have a robot that needs entertainment representation, please contact me, the Bot-Agent. The bot, our rising celebrity, also has his own Twitter account: @robotinthewild. I'd like to introduce you to one of our first robots, Data. He's named after the Star Trek character. I think he's going to be super popular. We've got the robot \u2014 in his head is a database of a lot of jokes. Now each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes. So it knows something about the subject; it knows about the length. It knows how much it's moving. And so it's going to try to watch your response. I actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today.(Laughter)It can also learn from you about the quality of its jokes and cater things, sort of like Netflix-style, over longer-term to different communities or audiences, children versus adults, different cultures. You can learn something from the robot about the community that you're in. And also I can use each one of you as the acting coach to our future robot companions. Some of you in this middle section \u2014 you have red/green paddles. If you like what's going on, show the green. If you don't like the subject or the performance, you can hold the red. Now don't be shy. It's just a robot. It doesn't have feelings ... yet. (Laughter) And the rest of you, you still count, you still matter. There's also a microphone that's listening to the aggregate laughter and applause and booing \u2014 I hope not \u2014 to help make some of its next decisions. Right, so, let the robot stand-up comedy begin.Data: Hello TEDWomen. It's an honor to be here.(Laughter)(Applause)You guys are looking good out there. Ready for some jokes?Audience: Yeah.Data: Here's the first one. Right, so, a doctor says to his patient, \"I have bad news and worse news. The bad news is that you only have 24 hours to live.\" \"That's terrible,\" said the patient. \"How can the news possibly be worse?\" \"I've been trying to contact you since yesterday.\"(Laughter)(Applause)The Swiss have an interesting army. Five hundred years without a war. Heather Knight: He's talking about the Swiss. Data: Pretty lucky for them. Ever see that little Swiss Army knife they have to fight with? \"Come on buddy, I have the toe clippers right here. You get past me, the guy behind me has a spoon.\"(Laughter)HK: He's a French robot.Data: A couple of New Jersey hunters are out in the woods. One of them falls to the ground. He does not seem to be breathing. The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls 911. He gasps to the operator, \"My friend is dead. What can I do?\" The operator says, \"Just take it easy. I can help. First, let's make sure he's dead.\" There is a silence, and the operator hears a shot. The guy's voice comes back on the line, \"Okay, now what?\"(Laughter)(Applause)Question: Why is television called a medium? Anyone? Because it's neither rare nor well done. But to be completely honest with you, I kind of love television. Any of you like television? Audience: Yes. Data: I find it incredibly educational. Actually, as soon as someone turns it on, I go into the other room and read. (Laughter) That's all for now. Was that okay for my first time?(Applause)You've been a great audience. Thank you.HK: Yay.(Applause)So this is actually the first time we've ever done live audience feedback to a performance. So thank you all for being a part of it. There's a lot more to come.

If you look at the chart at the top here, you'll see that in 2025, these Goldman Sachs projections suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy. And if you look at the chart for 2050, it's projected that the Chinese economy will be twice the size of the American economy, and the Indian economy will be almost the same size as the American economy. And we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the Western financial crisis.A couple of weeks ago, I was looking at the latest projection by BNP Paribas for when China will have a larger economy than the United States. Goldman Sachs projected 2027. The post-crisis projection is 2020. That's just a decade away. China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects. First of all, it's a huge developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people, which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year.And within a decade, it will have the largest economy in the world. Never before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country, rather than a developed country. Secondly, for the first time in the modern era, the dominant country in the world \u2014 which I think is what China will become \u2014 will be not from the West and from very, very different civilizational roots.Now, I know it's a widespread assumption in the West that as countries modernize, they also westernize. This is an illusion. It's an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition, markets and technology. It is not. It is also shaped equally by history and culture. China is not like the West, and it will not become like the West. It will remain in very fundamental respects very different. Now the big question here is obviously, how do we make sense of China? How do we try to understand what China is? And the problem we have in the West at the moment, by and large, is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in Western terms, using Western ideas. We can't. Now I want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what China is like, just as a beginning.The first is this: that China is not really a nation-state. Okay, it's called itself a nation-state for the last hundred years, but everyone who knows anything about China knows it's a lot older than this. This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty in 221 B.C. at the end of the warring-state period \u2014 the birth of modern China. And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China. Or immediately afterward, the Han Dynasty, still 2,000 years ago. And you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as Eastern China, which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then and live now.Now what is extraordinary about this is, what gives China its sense of being China, what gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese, comes not from the last hundred years, not from the nation-state period, which is what happened in the West, but from the period, if you like, of the civilization-state. I'm thinking here, for example, of customs like ancestral worship, of a very distinctive notion of the state, likewise, a very distinctive notion of the family, social relationships like guanxi, Confucian values and so on. These are all things that come from the period of the civilization-state. In other words, China, unlike the Western states and most countries in the world, is shaped by its sense of civilization, its existence as a civilization-state, rather than as a nation-state. And there's one other thing to add to this, and that is this: Of course we know China's big, huge, demographically and geographically, with a population of 1.3 billion people. What we often aren't really aware of is the fact that China is extremely diverse and very pluralistic, and in many ways very decentralized. You can't run a place on this scale simply from Beijing, even though we think this to be the case. It's never been the case.So this is China, a civilization-state, rather than a nation-state. And what does it mean? Well, I think it has all sorts of profound implications. I'll give you two quick ones. The first is that the most important political value for the Chinese is unity, is the maintenance of Chinese civilization. You know, 2,000 years ago, Europe: breakdown \u2014 the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire. It divided, and it's remained divided ever since. China, over the same time period, went in exactly the opposite direction, very painfully holding this huge civilization, civilization-state, together.The second is maybe more prosaic, which is Hong Kong. Do you remember the handover of Hong Kong by Britain to China in 1997? You may remember what the Chinese constitutional proposition was. One country, two systems. And I'll lay a wager that barely anyone in the West believed them. \"Window dressing. When China gets its hands on Hong Kong, that won't be the case.\" Thirteen years on, the political and legal system in Hong Kong is as different now as it was in 1997. We were wrong. Why were we wrong? We were wrong because we thought, naturally enough, in nation-state ways. Think of German unification, 1990. What happened? Well, basically the East was swallowed by the West. One nation, one system. That is the nation-state mentality. But you can't run a country like China, a civilization-state, on the basis of one civilization, one system. It doesn't work. So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong \u2014 as it will be to the question of Taiwan \u2014 was a natural response: one civilization, many systems.Let me offer you another building block to try and understand China \u2014 maybe not sort of a comfortable one. The Chinese have a very, very different conception of race to most other countries. Do you know, of the 1.3 billion Chinese, over 90 percent of them think they belong to the same race, the Han? Now, this is completely different from the world's [other] most populous countries. India, the United States, Indonesia, Brazil \u2014 all of them are multiracial. The Chinese don't feel like that. China is only multiracial really at the margins. So the question is, why? Well the reason, I think, essentially is, again, back to the civilization-state. A history of at least 2,000 years, a history of conquest, occupation, absorption, assimilation and so on, led to the process by which, over time, this notion of the Han emerged \u2014 of course, nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity.Now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that, without the Han, China could never have held together. The Han identity has been the cement which has held this country together. The great disadvantage of it is that the Han have a very weak conception of cultural difference. They really believe in their own superiority, and they are disrespectful of those who are not. Hence their attitude, for example, to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans.Or let me give you my third building block, the Chinese state. Now the relationship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the West. Now we in the West overwhelmingly seem to think \u2014 in these days at least \u2014 that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy. The problem with this proposition is that the Chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the Chinese than is true with any Western state. And the reason for this is because \u2014 well, there are two reasons, I think. And it's obviously got nothing to do with democracy, because in our terms the Chinese certainly don't have a democracy. And the reason for this is, firstly, because the state in China is given a very special \u2014 it enjoys a very special significance as the representative, the embodiment and the guardian of Chinese civilization, of the civilization-state. This is as close as China gets to a kind of spiritual role.And the second reason is because, whereas in Europe and North America, the state's power is continuously challenged \u2014 I mean in the European tradition, historically against the church, against other sectors of the aristocracy, against merchants and so on \u2014 for 1,000 years, the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged. It's had no serious rivals. So you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in China is very different from our experience in Western history. The result, by the way, is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state. Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder, a stranger, certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained, the Chinese don't see the state like that at all. The Chinese view the state as an intimate \u2014 not just as an intimate actually, as a member of the family \u2014 not just in fact as a member of the family, but as the head of the family, the patriarch of the family. This is the Chinese view of the state \u2014 very, very different to ours. It's embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the West.And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here, in the Chinese context, is a new kind of paradigm, which is different from anything we've had to think about in the past. Know that China believes in the market and the state. I mean, Adam Smith, already writing in the late 18th century, said, \"The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in Europe.\" And, apart from the Mao period, that has remained more or less the case ever since. But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state. The state is everywhere in China. I mean, it's leading firms \u2014 many of them are still publicly owned. Private firms, however large they are, like Lenovo, depend in many ways on state patronage. Targets for the economy and so on are set by the state. And the state, of course, its authority flows into lots of other areas \u2014 as we are familiar with \u2014 with something like the one-child policy.Moreover, this is a very old state tradition, a very old tradition of statecraft. I mean, if you want an illustration of this, the Great Wall is one. But this is another, this is the Grand Canal, which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century B.C. and was finally completed in the seventh century A.D. It went for 1,114 miles, linking Beijing with Hangzhou and Shanghai. So there's a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in China, which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today, which is something like the Three Gorges Dam and many other expressions of state competence within China. So there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is China \u2014 the civilization-state, the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society.And yet we still insist, by and large, in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience, looking at it through Western eyes, using Western concepts. If you want to know why we unerringly seem to get China wrong \u2014 our predictions about what's going to happen to China are incorrect \u2014 this is the reason. Unfortunately, I think, I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality. It's kind of arrogant. It's arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best, and therefore we have the universal measure. And secondly, it's ignorant. We refuse to really address the issue of difference. You know, there's a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen, the American historian. And Paul Cohen argues that the West thinks of itself as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures. But it's not. In many ways, it's the most parochial, because for 200 years, the West has been so dominant in the world that it's not really needed to understand other cultures, other civilizations. Because, at the end of the day, it could, if necessary by force, get its own way. Whereas those cultures \u2014 virtually the rest of the world, in fact, which have been in a far weaker position, vis-a-vis the West \u2014 have been thereby forced to understand the West, because of the West's presence in those societies. And therefore, they are, as a result, more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West.I mean, take the question of East Asia. East Asia: Japan, Korea, China, etc. \u2014 a third of the world's population lives there. Now the largest economic region in the world. And I'll tell you now, that East Asianers, people from East Asia, are far more knowledgeable about the West than the West is about East Asia. Now this point is very germane, I'm afraid, to the present. Because what's happening? Back to that chart at the beginning, the Goldman Sachs chart. What is happening is that, very rapidly in historical terms, the world is being driven and shaped, not by the old developed countries, but by the developing world. We've seen this in terms of the G20 usurping very rapidly the position of the G7, or the G8. And there are two consequences of this. First, the West is rapidly losing its influence in the world. There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago \u2014 Copenhagen, climate change conference. Europe was not at the final negotiating table. When did that last happen? I would wager it was probably about 200 years ago. And that is what is going to happen in the future.And the second implication is that the world will inevitably, as a consequence, become increasingly unfamiliar to us, because it'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with, or conversant with. And at last, I'm afraid \u2014 take Europe; America is slightly different \u2014 but Europeans by and large, I have to say, are ignorant, are unaware about the way the world is changing. Some people \u2014 I've got an English friend in China, and he said, \"The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion.\" Well, maybe that's true, maybe that's an exaggeration. But there's another problem which goes along with this \u2014 that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world \u2014 and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future. I mean, Europe once, of course, once commanded the future in its confidence. Take the 19th century, for example. But this, alas, is no longer true.If you want to feel the future, if you want to taste the future, try China \u2014 there's old Confucius. This is a railway station the likes of which you've never seen before. It doesn't even look like a railway station. This is the new [Wuhan] railway station for the high-speed trains. China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together. Or take this: now this is an idea, but it's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing. Here you have a megabus, on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people. It travels on rails down a suburban road, and the cars travel underneath it. And it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour. Now this is the way things are going to move, because China has a very specific problem, which is different from Europe and different from the United States: China has huge numbers of people and no space. So this is a solution to a situation where China's going to have many, many, many cities over 20 million people.Okay, so how would I like to finish? Well, what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us? I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it. But I want to argue, above all, a big-picture positive for this world. For 200 years, the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population. That's what Europe and North America represented. The arrival of countries like China and India \u2014 between them 38 percent of the world's population \u2014 and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on, represent the most important single act of democratization in the last 200 years. Civilizations and cultures, which had been ignored, which had no voice, which were not listened to, which were not known about, will have a different sort of representation in this world. As humanists, we must welcome, surely, this transformation, and we will have to learn about these civilizations.This big ship here was the one sailed in by Zheng He in the early 15th century on his great voyages around the South China Sea, the East China Sea and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa. The little boat in front of it was the one in which, 80 years later, Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic. (Laughter) Or, look carefully at this silk scroll made by ZhuZhou in 1368.

It is also shaped equally\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nby history and culture.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nChina is not like the West,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nand it will not become like the West.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nIt will remain in very fundamental respects\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nvery different.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nNow the big question here is obviously,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nhow do we make sense of China?\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nHow do we try to understand what China is?\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nAnd the problem we have in the West at the moment, by and large,\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nis that the conventional approach\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nis that we understand it really in Western terms,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nusing Western ideas.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nWe can't.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nNow I want to offer you\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nthree building blocks\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nfor trying to understand what China is like,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\njust as a beginning.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nThe first is this:\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nthat China is not really a nation-state.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nOkay, it's called itself a nation-state\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nfor the last hundred years,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nbut everyone who knows anything about China\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nknows it's a lot older than this.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nThis was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nin 221 B.C. at the end of the warring-state period --\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nthe birth of modern China.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nAnd you can see it against the boundaries of modern China.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nOr immediately afterward, the Han Dynasty,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nstill 2,000 years ago.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nAnd you can see already it occupies\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nmost of what we now know as Eastern China,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nwhich is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nand live now.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nNow what is extraordinary about this\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nis, what gives China its sense of being China,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nwhat gives the Chinese\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthe sense of what it is to be Chinese,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\ncomes not from the last hundred years,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nnot from the nation-state period,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nwhich is what happened in the West,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nbut from the period, if you like,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nof the civilization-state.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nI'm thinking here, for example,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nof customs like ancestral worship,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nof a very distinctive notion of the state,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nlikewise, a very distinctive notion of the family,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nsocial relationships like guanxi,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nConfucian values and so on.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nThese are all things that come\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nfrom the period of the civilization-state.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nIn other words, China, unlike the Western states and most countries in the world,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nis shaped by its sense of civilization,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nits existence as a civilization-state,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nrather than as a nation-state.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nAnd there's one other thing to add to this, and that is this:\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nOf course we know China's big, huge,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\ndemographically and geographically,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nwith a population of 1.3 billion people.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nWhat we often aren't really aware of\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nis the fact\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nthat China is extremely diverse\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nand very pluralistic,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nand in many ways very decentralized.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nYou can't run a place on this scale simply from Beijing,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\neven though we think this to be the case.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nIt's never been the case.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nSo this is China, a civilization-state,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nrather than a nation-state.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nAnd what does it mean?\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nWell, I think it has all sorts of profound implications.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nI'll give you two quick ones.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nThe first is that\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nthe most important political value for the Chinese\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nis unity,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nis the maintenance\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nof Chinese civilization.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nYou know, 2,000 years ago, Europe:\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nbreakdown -- the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nIt divided, and it's remained divided ever since.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nChina, over the same time period,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nwent in exactly the opposite direction,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nvery painfully holding this huge civilization,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\ncivilization-state, together.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nThe second\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nis maybe more prosaic,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nwhich is Hong Kong.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nDo you remember the handover of Hong Kong\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nby Britain to China in 1997?\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nYou may remember\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nwhat the Chinese constitutional proposition was.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nOne country, two systems.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nAnd I'll lay a wager\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nthat barely anyone in the West believed them.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\n\"Window dressing.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nWhen China gets its hands on Hong Kong,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nthat won't be the case.\"\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nThirteen years on,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nthe political and legal system in Hong Kong\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nis as different now as it was in 1997.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nWe were wrong. Why were we wrong?\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nWe were wrong because we thought, naturally enough,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nin nation-state ways.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nThink of German unification, 1990.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nWhat happened?\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nWell, basically the East was swallowed by the West.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nOne nation, one system.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nThat is the nation-state mentality.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nBut you can't run a country like China,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\na civilization-state,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\non the basis of one civilization, one system.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nIt doesn't work.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nSo actually the response of China\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nto the question of Hong Kong --\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nas it will be to the question of Taiwan --\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nwas a natural response:\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\none civilization, many systems.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nLet me offer you another building block\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nto try and understand China --\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nmaybe not sort of a comfortable one.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nThe Chinese have a very, very different\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nconception of race\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nto most other countries.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nDo you know,\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nof the 1.3 billion Chinese,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nover 90 percent of them\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nthink they belong to the same race,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nthe Han?\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nNow, this is completely different\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nfrom the world's [other] most populous countries.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nIndia, the United States,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nIndonesia, Brazil --\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nall of them are multiracial.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nThe Chinese don't feel like that.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nChina is only multiracial\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nreally at the margins.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nSo the question is, why?\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nWell the reason, I think, essentially\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nis, again, back to the civilization-state.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nA history of at least 2,000 years,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\na history of conquest, occupation,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nabsorption, assimilation and so on,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nled to the process by which,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nover time, this notion of the Han emerged --\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nof course, nurtured\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nby a growing and very powerful sense\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nof cultural identity.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nNow the great advantage of this historical experience\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nhas been that, without the Han,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nChina could never have held together.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nThe Han identity has been the cement\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nwhich has held this country together.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nThe great disadvantage of it\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nis that the Han have a very weak conception\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nof cultural difference.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nThey really believe\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nin their own superiority,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nand they are disrespectful\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nof those who are not.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nHence their attitude, for example,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nto the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nOr let me give you my third building block,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nthe Chinese state.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nNow the relationship\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nbetween the state and society in China\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nis very different from that in the West.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nNow we in the West\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\noverwhelmingly seem to think -- in these days at least --\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nthat the authority and legitimacy of the state\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nis a function of democracy.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nThe problem with this proposition\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nis that the Chinese state\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nenjoys more legitimacy\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nand more authority\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\namongst the Chinese\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nthan is true\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nwith any Western state.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nAnd the reason for this\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nis because --\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nwell, there are two reasons, I think.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nAnd it's obviously got nothing to do with democracy,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nbecause in our terms the Chinese certainly don't have a democracy.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nAnd the reason for this is,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nfirstly, because the state in China\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nis given a very special --\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nit enjoys a very special significance\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nas the representative,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nthe embodiment and the guardian\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nof Chinese civilization,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nof the civilization-state.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nThis is as close as China gets\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nto a kind of spiritual role.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nAnd the second reason is because,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nwhereas in Europe\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nand North America,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nthe state's power is continuously challenged --\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nI mean in the European tradition,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nhistorically against the church,\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nagainst other sectors of the aristocracy,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nagainst merchants and so on --\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nfor 1,000 years,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nthe power of the Chinese state\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nhas not been challenged.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nIt's had no serious rivals.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nSo you can see\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nthat the way in which power has been constructed in China\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nis very different from our experience\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nin Western history.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nThe result, by the way,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nis that the Chinese have a very different view of the state.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nWhereas we tend to view it as an intruder,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\na stranger,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\ncertainly an organ\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nwhose powers need to be limited\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nor defined and constrained,\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nthe Chinese don't see the state like that at all.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nThe Chinese view the state\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nas an intimate -- not just as an intimate actually,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nas a member of the family --\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nnot just in fact as a member of the family,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nbut as the head of the family,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nthe patriarch of the family.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nThis is the Chinese view of the state --\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nvery, very different to ours.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nIt's embedded in society in a different kind of way\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nto what is the case\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nin the West.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nAnd I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here,\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nin the Chinese context,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nis a new kind of paradigm,\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nwhich is different from anything\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nwe've had to think about in the past.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nKnow that China believes in the market and the state.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nI mean, Adam Smith,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nalready writing in the late 18th century, said,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\n\"The Chinese market is larger and more developed\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nand more sophisticated\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nthan anything in Europe.\"\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nAnd, apart from the Mao period,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nthat has remained more or less the case ever since.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nBut this is combined\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nwith an extremely strong and ubiquitous state.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nThe state is everywhere in China.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nI mean, it's leading firms --\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nmany of them are still publicly owned.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nPrivate firms, however large they are, like Lenovo,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\ndepend in many ways on state patronage.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nTargets for the economy and so on\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nare set by the state.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nAnd the state, of course, its authority flows into lots of other areas --\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nas we are familiar with --\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nwith something like the one-child policy.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nMoreover, this is a very old state tradition,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\na very old tradition of statecraft.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nI mean, if you want an illustration of this,\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nthe Great Wall is one.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nBut this is another, this is the Grand Canal,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nwhich was constructed in the first instance\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nin the fifth century B.C.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nand was finally completed\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nin the seventh century A.D.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nIt went for 1,114 miles,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nlinking Beijing\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nwith Hangzhou and Shanghai.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nSo there's a long history\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nof extraordinary state infrastructural projects\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nin China,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nwhich I suppose helps us to explain what we see today,\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nwhich is something like the Three Gorges Dam\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nand many other expressions\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nof state competence\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nwithin China.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nSo there we have three building blocks\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nfor trying to understand the difference that is China --\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nthe civilization-state,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nthe notion of race\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nand the nature of the state\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nand its relationship to society.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nAnd yet we still insist, by and large,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nin thinking that we can understand China\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nby simply drawing on Western experience,\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nlooking at it through Western eyes,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nusing Western concepts.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nIf you want to know why\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nwe unerringly seem to get China wrong --\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nour predictions about what's going to happen to China are incorrect --\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nthis is the reason.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nUnfortunately, I think,\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nI have to say that I think\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nattitude towards China\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nis that of a kind of little Westerner mentality.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nIt's kind of arrogant.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nIt's arrogant in the sense\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nthat we think that we are best,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nand therefore we have the universal measure.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nAnd secondly, it's ignorant.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nWe refuse to really address\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nthe issue of difference.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nYou know, there's a very interesting passage\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nin a book by Paul Cohen, the American historian.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nAnd Paul Cohen argues\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nthat the West thinks of itself\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nas probably the most cosmopolitan\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nof all cultures.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nBut it's not.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nIn many ways,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nit's the most parochial,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nbecause for 200 years,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nthe West has been so dominant in the world\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nthat it's not really needed\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nto understand other cultures,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nother civilizations.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nBecause, at the end of the day,\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nit could, if necessary by force,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nget its own way.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nWhereas those cultures --\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nvirtually the rest of the world, in fact,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nwhich have been in a far weaker position, vis-a-vis the West --\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nhave been thereby forced to understand the West,\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nbecause of the West's presence in those societies.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nAnd therefore, they are, as a result,\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nmore cosmopolitan in many ways than the West.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nI mean, take the question of East Asia.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nEast Asia: Japan, Korea, China, etc. --\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\na third of the world's population lives there.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nNow the largest economic region in the world.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nAnd I'll tell you now,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nthat East Asianers, people from East Asia,\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nare far more knowledgeable\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nabout the West\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nthan the West is about East Asia.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nNow this point is very germane, I'm afraid,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nto the present.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nBecause what's happening? Back to that chart at the beginning,\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nthe Goldman Sachs chart.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nWhat is happening\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nis that, very rapidly in historical terms,\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nthe world is being driven\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nand shaped,\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nnot by the old developed countries,\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nbut by the developing world.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nWe've seen this\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nin terms of the G20\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nusurping very rapidly the position of the G7,\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nor the G8.\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nAnd there are two consequences of this.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nFirst, the West\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nis rapidly losing\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nits influence in the world.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nThere was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago --\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nCopenhagen, climate change conference.\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nEurope was not at the final negotiating table.\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nWhen did that last happen?\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nI would wager it was probably about 200 years ago.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nAnd that is what is going to happen in the future.\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nAnd the second implication\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nis that the world will inevitably, as a consequence,\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nbecome increasingly unfamiliar to us,\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nbecause it'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nthat we are not really familiar with,\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nor conversant with.\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nAnd at last, I'm afraid -- take Europe;\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nAmerica is slightly different --\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nbut Europeans by and large, I have to say,\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nare ignorant,\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nare unaware\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nabout the way the world is changing.\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nSome people -- I've got an English friend in China,\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nand he said, \"The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion.\"\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nWell, maybe that's true,\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nmaybe that's an exaggeration.\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nBut there's another problem which goes along with this --\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nthat Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world --\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nand that is a sort of\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nloss of a sense of the future.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nI mean, Europe once, of course, once commanded the future\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nin its confidence.\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nTake the 19th century, for example.\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nBut this, alas, is no longer true.\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nIf you want to feel the future, if you want to taste the future,\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:12.958\ntry China -- there's old Confucius.\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nThis is a railway station\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nthe likes of which you've never seen before.\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nIt doesn't even look like a railway station.\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nThis is the new [Wuhan] railway station\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nfor the high-speed trains.\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nChina already has a bigger network\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nthan any other country in the world\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nand will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together.\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nOr take this: now this is an idea,\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nbut it's an idea to be tried out shortly\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nin a suburb of Beijing.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nHere you have a megabus,\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:43.958\non the upper deck carries about 2,000 people.\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nIt travels on rails\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\ndown a suburban road,\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nand the cars travel underneath it.\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nAnd it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour.\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nNow this is the way things are going to move,\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nbecause China has a very specific problem,\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nwhich is different from Europe\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nand different from the United States:\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nChina has huge numbers of people and no space.\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nSo this is a solution to a situation\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nwhere China's going to have\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nmany, many, many cities\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:13.958\nover 20 million people.\n\n00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:16.958\nOkay, so how would I like to finish?\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:19.958\nWell, what should our attitude be\n\n00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:22.958\ntowards this world\n\n00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nthat we see\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nvery rapidly developing\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nbefore us?\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nI think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it.\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:34.958\nBut I want to argue, above all,\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:37.958\na big-picture positive for this world.\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:41.958\nFor 200 years,\n\n00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:47.958\nthe world was essentially governed\n\n00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:51.958\nby a fragment of the human population.\n\n00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:55.958\nThat's what Europe and North America represented.\n\n00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:57.958\nThe arrival of countries\n\n00:19:57.958 --> 00:19:59.958\nlike China and India --\n\n00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:01.958\nbetween them 38 percent of the world's population --\n\n00:20:01.958 --> 00:20:04.958\nand others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on,\n\n00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:10.958\nrepresent the most important single act\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:12.958\nof

had no voice,\n\n00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:21.958\nwhich were not listened to, which were not known about,\n\n00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:23.958\nwill have a different sort\n\n00:20:23.958 --> 00:20:26.958\nof representation in this world.\n\n00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:28.958\nAs humanists, we must welcome, surely,\n\n00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:30.958\nthis transformation,\n\n00:20:30.958 -->

Because we are all patients, we are all people. Even doctors are patients at some point. So I want to talk about that as an opportunity that we really have failed to engage with very well in this country and, in fact, worldwide. If you want to get at the big part \u2014 I mean from a public health level, where my training is \u2014 you're looking at behavioral issues. You're looking at things where people are actually given information, and they're not following through with it. It's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes, obesity, many forms of heart disease, even some forms of cancer \u2014 when you think of smoking. Those are all behaviors where people know what they're supposed to do. They know what they're supposed to be doing, but they're not doing it.Now behavior change is something that is a long-standing problem in medicine. It goes all the way back to Aristotle. And doctors hate it, right? I mean, they complain about it all the time. We talk about it in terms of engagement, or non-compliance. When people don't take their pills, when people don't follow doctors' orders \u2014 these are behavior problems. But for as much as clinical medicine agonizes over behavior change, there's not a lot of work done in terms of trying to fix that problem. So the crux of it comes down to this notion of decision-making \u2014 giving information to people in a form that doesn't just educate them or inform them, but actually leads them to make better decisions, better choices in their lives.One part of medicine, though, has faced the problem of behavior change pretty well, and that's dentistry. Dentistry might seem \u2014 and I think it is \u2014 many dentists would have to acknowledge it's somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine. Not a lot of cool, sexy stuff happening in dentistry. But they have really taken this problem of behavior change and solved it. It's the one great preventive health success we have in our health care system. People brush and floss their teeth. They don't do it as much as they should, but they do it.So I'm going to talk about one experiment that a few dentists in Connecticut cooked up about 30 years ago. So this is an old experiment, but it's a really good one, because it was very simple, so it's an easy story to tell. So these Connecticut dentists decided that they wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often, and they were going to use one variable: they wanted to scare them. They wanted to tell them how bad it would be if they didn't brush and floss their teeth. They had a big patient population. They divided them up into two groups. They had a low-fear population, where they basically gave them a 13-minute presentation, all based in science, but told them that, if you didn't brush and floss your teeth, you could get gum disease. If you get gum disease, you will lose your teeth, but you'll get dentures, and it won't be that bad. So that was the low-fear group. The high-fear group, they laid it on really thick. They showed bloody gums. They showed puss oozing out from between their teeth. They told them that their teeth were going to fall out. They said that they could have infections that would spread from their jaws to other parts of their bodies, and ultimately, yes, they would lose their teeth. They would get dentures, and if you got dentures, you weren't going to be able to eat corn-on-the-cob, you weren't going to be able to eat apples, you weren't going to be able to eat steak. You'll eat mush for the rest of your life. So go brush and floss your teeth. That was the message. That was the experiment.Now they measured one other variable. They wanted to capture one other variable, which was the patients' sense of efficacy. This was the notion of whether the patients felt that they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their teeth. So they asked them at the beginning, \"Do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program?\" And the people who said, \"Yeah, yeah. I'm pretty good about that,\" they were characterized as high efficacy, and the people who said, \"Eh, I never get around to brushing and flossing as much as I should,\" they were characterized as low efficacy. So the upshot was this. The upshot of this experiment was that fear was not really a primary driver of the behavior at all. The people who brushed and flossed their teeth were not necessarily the people who were really scared about what would happen \u2014 it's the people who simply felt that they had the capacity to change their behavior. So fear showed up as not really the driver. It was the sense of efficacy.So I want to isolate this, because it was a great observation \u2014 30 years ago, right, 30 years ago \u2014 and it's one that's laid fallow in research. It was a notion that really came out of Albert Bandura's work, who studied whether people could get a sense of empowerment. The notion of efficacy basically boils down to one \u2014 that if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior. In health care terms, you could characterize this as whether or not somebody feels that they see a path towards better health, that they can actually see their way towards getting better health, and that's a very important notion. It's an amazing notion. We don't really know how to manipulate it, though, that well. Except, maybe we do.So fear doesn't work, right? Fear doesn't work. And this is a great example of how we haven't learned that lesson at all. This is a campaign from the American Diabetes Association. This is still the way we're communicating messages about health. I mean, I showed my three-year-old this slide last night, and he's like, \"Papa, why is an ambulance in these people's homes?\" And I had to explain, \"They're trying to scare people.\" And I don't know if it works.Now here's what does work: personalized information works. Again, Bandura recognized this years ago, decades ago. When you give people specific information about their health, where they stand, and where they want to get to, where they might get to, that path, that notion of a path \u2014 that tends to work for behavior change. So let me just spool it out a little bit. So you start with personalized data, personalized information that comes from an individual, and then you need to connect it to their lives. You need to connect it to their lives, hopefully not in a fear-based way, but one that they understand. Okay, I know where I sit. I know where I'm situated. And that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers \u2014 this overload of health information that we're inundated with. But it actually hits home. It's not just hitting us in our heads; it's hitting us in our hearts. There's an emotional connection to information because it's from us. That information then needs to be connected to choices, needs to be connected to a range of options, directions that we might go to \u2014 trade-offs, benefits. Finally, we need to be presented with a clear point of action. We need to connect the information always with the action, and then that action feeds back into different information, and it creates, of course, a feedback loop.Now this is a very well-observed and well-established notion for behavior change. But the problem is that things \u2014 in the upper-right corner there \u2014 personalized data, it's been pretty hard to come by. It's a difficult and expensive commodity, until now. So I'm going to give you an example, a very simple example of how this works. So we've all seen these. These are the \"your speed limit\" signs. You've seen them all around, especially these days as radars are cheaper. And here's how they work in the feedback loop. So you start with the personalized data where the speed limit on the road that you are at that point is 25, and, of course, you're going faster than that. We always are. We're always going above the speed limit. The choice in this case is pretty simple. We either keep going fast, or we slow down. We should probably slow down, and that point of action is probably now. We should take our foot off the pedal right now, and generally we do. These things are shown to be pretty effective in terms of getting people to slow down. They reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent. They last for about five miles, in which case we put our foot back on the pedal. But it works, and it even has some health repercussions. Your blood pressure might drop a little bit. Maybe there's fewer accidents, so there's public health benefits.But by and large, this is a feedback loop that's so nifty and too rare. Because in health care, most health care, the data is very removed from the action. It's very difficult to line things up so neatly. But we have an opportunity. So I want to talk about, I want to shift now to think about how we deliver health information in this country, how we actually get information. This is a pharmaceutical ad. Actually, it's a spoof. It's not a real pharmaceutical ad. Nobody's had the brilliant idea of calling their drug Havidol quite yet. But it looks completely right. So it's exactly the way we get health information and pharmaceutical information, and it just sounds perfect. And then we turn the page of the magazine, and we see this \u2014 now this is the page the FDA requires pharmaceutical companies to put into their ads, or to follow their ads, and to me, this is one of the most  cynical exercises in medicine. Because we know. Who among us would actually say that people read this? And who among us would actually say that people who do try to read this actually get anything out of it? This is a bankrupt effort at communicating health information. There is no good faith in this.So this is a different approach. This is an approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at Dartmouth Medical School, Lisa Schwartz and Steven Woloshin. And they created this thing called the \"drug facts box.\" They took inspiration from, of all things, Cap'n Crunch. They went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal, works for our food, actually helps people understand what's in their food. God forbid we should use that same standard that we make Cap'n Crunch live by and bring it to drug companies. So let me just walk through this quickly. It says very clearly what the drug is for, specifically who it is good for, so you can start to personalize your understanding of whether the information is relevant to you or whether the drug is relevant to you. You can understand exactly what the benefits are. It isn't this kind of vague promise that it's going to work no matter what, but you get the statistics for how effective it is. And finally, you understand what those choices are. You can start to unpack the choices involved because of the side effects. Every time you take a drug, you're walking into a possible side effect. So it spells those out in very clean terms, and that works.So I love this. I love that drug facts box. And so I was thinking about, what's an opportunity that I could have to help people understand information? What's another latent body of information that's out there that people are really not putting to use? And so I came up with this: lab test results. Blood test results are this great source of information. They're packed with information. They're just not for us. They're not for people. They're not for patients. They go right to doctors. And God forbid \u2014 I think many doctors, if you really asked them, they don't really understand all this stuff either. This is the worst presented information. You ask Tufte, and he would say, \"Yes, this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible.\"What we did at Wired was we went, and I got our graphic design department to re-imagine these lab reports. So that's what I want to walk you through. So this is the general blood work before, and this is the after, this is what we came up with. The after takes what was four pages \u2014 that previous slide was actually the first of four pages of data that's just the general blood work. It goes on and on and on, all these values, all these numbers you don't know. This is our one-page summary. We use the notion of color. It's an amazing notion that color could be used. So on the top-level you have your overall results, the things that might jump out at you from the fine print. Then you can drill down and understand how actually we put your level in context, and we use color to illustrate exactly where your value falls. In this case, this patient is slightly at risk of diabetes because of their glucose level.Likewise, you can go over your lipids and, again, understand what your overall cholesterol level is and then break down into the HDL and the LDL if you so choose. But again, always using color and personalized proximity to that information. All those other values, all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing, we summarize. We tell you that you're okay, you're normal. But you don't have to wade through it. You don't have to go through the junk. And then we do two other very important things that kind of help fill in this feedback loop: we help people understand in a little more detail what these values are and what they might indicate. And then we go a further step \u2014 we tell them what they can do. We give them some insight into what choices they can make, what actions they can take. So that's our general blood work test.Then we went to CRP test. In this case, it's a sin of omission. They have this huge amount of space, and they don't use it for anything, so we do. Now the CRP test is often done following a cholesterol test, or in conjunction with a cholesterol test. So we take the bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page, which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it. So we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well. It's a protein that shows up when your blood vessels might be inflamed, which might be a risk for heart disease. What you're actually measuring is spelled out in clean language. Then we use the information that's already in the lab report. We use the person's age and their gender to start to fill in the personalized risks. So we start to use the data we have to run a very simple calculation that's on all sorts of online calculators to get a sense of what the actual risk is.The last one I'll show you is a PSA test. Here's the before, and here's the after. Now a lot of our effort on this one \u2014 as many of you probably know, a PSA test is a very controversial test. It's used to test for prostate cancer, but there are all sorts of reasons why your prostate might be enlarged. And so we spent a good deal of our time indicating that. We again personalized the risks. So this patient is in their 50s, so we can actually give them a very precise estimate of what their risk for prostate cancer is. In this case it's about 25 percent, based on that. And then again, the follow-up actions.So our cost for this was less than 10,000 dollars, all right. That's what Wired magazine spent on this. Why is Wired magazine doing this? (Laughter) Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp, the two largest lab testing companies \u2014 last year, they made profits of over 700 million dollars and over 500 million dollars respectively. Now this is not a problem of resources; this is a problem of incentives. We need to recognize that the target of this information should not be the doctor, should not be the insurance company. It should be the patient. It's the person who actually, in the end, is going to be having to change their lives and then start adopting new behaviors.This is information that is incredibly powerful. It's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change. But we're not using it. It's just sitting there. It's being lost. So I want to just offer four questions that every patient should ask, because I don't actually expect people to start developing these lab test reports. But you can create your own feedback loop. Anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions: Can I have my results? And the only acceptable answer is \u2014 (Audience: Yes.) \u2014 yes. What does this mean? Help me understand what the data is. What are my options? What choices are now on the table? And then, what's next? How do I integrate this information into the longer course of my life?So I want to wind up by just showing that people have the capacity to understand this information. This is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people. You do not need to have the education level of people in this room. Ordinary people are capable of understanding this information, if we only go to the effort of presenting it to them in a form that they can engage with. And engagement is essential here, because it's not just giving them information; it's giving them an opportunity to act. That's what engagement is. It's different from compliance. It works totally different from the way we talk about behavior in medicine today. And this information is out there.I've been talking today about latent information, all this information that exists in the system that we're not putting to use. But there are all sorts of other bodies of information that are coming online, and we need to recognize the capacity of this information to engage people, to help people and to change the course of their lives.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1060, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nI'm going to be talking to you\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nabout how we can tap\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\na really underutilized resource in health care,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nwhich is the patient,\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nor, as I like to use the scientific term,\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\npeople.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nBecause we are all patients, we are all people.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nEven doctors are patients at some point.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nSo I want to talk about that\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nas an opportunity\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nthat we really have failed to engage with very well in this country\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nand, in fact, worldwide.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nIf you want to get at the big part --\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nI mean from a public health level, where my training is --\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nyou're looking at behavioral issues.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nYou're looking at things where people are actually given information,\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nand they're not following through with it.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nIt's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nobesity, many forms of heart disease,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\neven some forms of cancer -- when you think of smoking.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nThose are all behaviors where people know what they're supposed to do.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nThey know what they're supposed to be doing,\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nbut they're not doing it.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nNow behavior change is something\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nthat is a long-standing problem in medicine.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nIt goes all the way back to Aristotle.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nAnd doctors hate it, right?\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nI mean, they complain about it all the time.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nWe talk about it in terms of engagement, or non-compliance.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nWhen people don't take their pills,\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nwhen people don't follow doctors' orders --\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nthese are behavior problems.\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nBut for as much as clinical medicine\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nagonizes over behavior change,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nthere's not a lot of work done\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nin terms of trying to fix that problem.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nSo the crux of it\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\ncomes down to this notion of decision-making --\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\ngiving information to people in a form\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nthat doesn't just educate them\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nor inform them,\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nbut actually leads them to make better decisions,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nbetter choices in their lives.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nOne part of medicine, though,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nhas faced the problem of behavior change pretty well,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nand that's dentistry.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nDentistry might seem -- and I think it is --\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nmany dentists would have to acknowledge\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nit's somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nNot a lot of cool, sexy stuff happening in dentistry.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nBut they have really taken this problem of behavior change\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nand solved it.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nIt's the one great preventive health success\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nwe have in our health care system.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nPeople brush and floss their teeth.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nThey don't do it as much as they should, but they do it.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nSo I'm going to talk about one experiment\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nthat a few dentists in Connecticut\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\ncooked up about 30 years ago.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nSo this is an old experiment, but it's a really good one,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nbecause it was very simple,\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nso it's an easy story to tell.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nSo these Connecticut dentists decided\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nthat they wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nand they were going to use one variable:\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nthey wanted to scare them.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nThey wanted to tell them how bad it would be\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nif they didn't brush and floss their teeth.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nThey had a big patient population.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nThey divided them up into two groups.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThey had a low-fear population,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nwhere they basically gave them a 13-minute presentation,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nall based in science,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nbut told them that, if you didn't brush and floss your teeth,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nyou could get gum disease. If you get gum disease, you will lose your teeth,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nbut you'll get dentures, and it won't be that bad.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nSo that was the low-fear group.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nThe high-fear group, they laid it on really thick.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nThey showed bloody gums.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nThey showed puss oozing out from between their teeth.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nThey told them that their teeth were going to fall out.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nThey said that they could have infections\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nthat would spread from their jaws to other parts of their bodies,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nand ultimately, yes, they would lose their teeth.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nThey would get dentures, and if you got dentures,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nyou weren't going to be able to eat corn-on-the-cob,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nyou weren't going to be able to eat apples,\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nyou weren't going to be able to eat steak.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nYou'll eat mush for the rest of your life.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nSo go brush and floss your teeth.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nThat was the message. That was the experiment.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nNow they measured one other variable.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nThey wanted to capture one other variable,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nwhich was the patients' sense of efficacy.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nThis was the notion of whether the patients felt\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nthat they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their teeth.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nSo they asked them at the beginning,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\n\"Do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program?\"\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nAnd the people who said, \"Yeah, yeah. I'm pretty good about that,\"\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthey were characterized as high efficacy,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nand the people who said,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\n\"Eh, I never get around to brushing and flossing as much as I should,\"\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nthey were characterized as low efficacy.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nSo the upshot was this.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nThe upshot of this experiment\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nwas that fear was not really a primary driver\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nof the behavior at all.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nThe people who brushed and flossed their teeth\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nwere not necessarily the people\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nwho were really scared about what would happen --\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nit's the people who simply felt that they had the capacity\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nto change their behavior.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nSo fear showed up as not really the driver.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nIt was the sense of efficacy.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nSo I want to isolate this,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nbecause it was a great observation --\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\n30 years ago, right, 30 years ago --\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nand it's one that's laid fallow in research.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nIt was a notion that really came out\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nof Albert Bandura's work,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nwho studied whether\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\npeople could get a sense of empowerment.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nThe notion of efficacy basically boils down to one -- that\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nif somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nIn health care terms, you could characterize this\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nas whether or not somebody feels\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nthat they see a path towards better health,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nthat they can actually see their way towards getting better health,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nand that's a very important notion.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nIt's an amazing notion.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nWe don't really know how to manipulate it, though, that well.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nExcept, maybe we do.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nSo fear doesn't work, right? Fear doesn't work.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAnd this is a great example\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nof how we haven't learned that lesson at all.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nThis is a campaign from the American Diabetes Association.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nThis is still the way we're communicating messages about health.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nI mean, I showed my three-year-old this slide last night,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nand he's like, \"Papa, why is an ambulance in these people's homes?\"\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nAnd I had to explain, \"They're trying to scare people.\"\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nAnd I don't know if it works.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nNow here's what does work:\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\npersonalized information works.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nAgain, Bandura recognized this\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nyears ago, decades ago.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nWhen you give people specific information\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nabout their health, where they stand,\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand where they want to get to, where they might get to,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nthat path, that notion of a path --\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nthat tends to work for behavior change.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nSo let me just spool it out a little bit.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nSo you start with personalized data, personalized information\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nthat comes from an individual,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nand then you need to connect it to their lives.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nYou need to connect it to their lives,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nhopefully not in a fear-based way, but one that they understand.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nOkay, I know where I sit. I know where I'm situated.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nAnd that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers --\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nthis overload of health information\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nthat we're inundated with.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nBut it actually hits home.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nIt's not just hitting us in our heads; it's hitting us in our hearts.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nThere's an emotional connection to information\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nbecause it's from us.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nThat information then needs to be connected to choices,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nneeds to be connected to a range of options,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\ndirections that we might go to --\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\ntrade-offs, benefits.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nFinally, we need to be presented with a clear point of action.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nWe need to connect the information\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nalways with the action,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nand then that action feeds back\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\ninto different information,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nand it creates, of course, a feedback loop.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nNow this is a very well-observed and well-established notion\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nfor behavior change.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nBut the problem is that things -- in the upper-right corner there --\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\npersonalized data, it's been pretty hard to come by.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nIt's a difficult and expensive commodity,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nuntil now.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nSo I'm going to give you an example, a very simple example of how this works.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nSo we've all seen these. These are the \"your speed limit\" signs.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nYou've seen them all around,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nespecially these days as radars are cheaper.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAnd here's how they work in the feedback loop.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nSo you start with the personalized data\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nwhere the speed limit on the road that you are at that point\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nis 25,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nand, of course, you're going faster than that.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nWe always are. We're always going above the speed limit.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nThe choice in this case is pretty simple.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nWe either keep going fast, or we slow down.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nWe should probably slow down,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nand that point of action is probably now.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nWe should take our foot off the pedal right now,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nand generally we do. These things are shown to be pretty effective\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nin terms of getting people to slow down.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nThey reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nThey last for about five miles,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nin which case we put our foot back on the pedal.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nBut it works, and it even has some health repercussions.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nYour blood pressure might drop a little bit.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nMaybe there's fewer accidents, so there's public health benefits.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nBut by and large, this is a feedback loop\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nthat's so nifty and too rare.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nBecause in health care, most health care,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nthe data is very removed from the action.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nIt's very difficult to line things up so neatly.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nBut we have an opportunity.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nSo I want to talk about, I want to shift now to think about\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nhow we deliver health information in this country,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nhow we actually get information.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nThis is a pharmaceutical ad.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nActually, it's a spoof. It's not a real pharmaceutical ad.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nNobody's had the brilliant idea\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nof calling their drug Havidol quite yet.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nBut it looks completely right.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nSo it's exactly the way we get\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nhealth information and pharmaceutical information,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nand it just sounds perfect.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nAnd then we turn the page of the magazine,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nand we see this --\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nnow this is the page the FDA requires pharmaceutical companies\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nto put into their ads, or to follow their ads,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nand to me, this is one of the most \ncynical exercises in medicine.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nBecause we know.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nWho among us would actually say that people read this?\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nAnd who among us would actually say\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nthat people who do try to read this\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nactually get anything out of it?\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nThis is a bankrupt effort\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nat communicating health information.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nThere is no good faith in this.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nSo this is a different approach.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nThis is an approach that has been developed\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nby a couple researchers at Dartmouth Medical School,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nLisa Schwartz and Steven Woloshin.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nAnd they created this thing called the \"drug facts box.\"\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nThey took inspiration from, of all things,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nCap'n Crunch.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nThey went to the nutritional information box\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nand saw that what works for cereal, works for our food,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nactually helps people understand what's in their food.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nGod forbid we should use that same standard\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nthat we make Cap'n Crunch live by\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nand bring it to drug companies.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nSo let me just walk through this quickly.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nIt says very clearly what the drug is for, specifically who it is good for,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nso you can start to personalize your understanding\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nof whether the information is relevant to you\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nor whether the drug is relevant to you.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nYou can understand exactly what the benefits are.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nIt isn't this kind of vague promise that it's going to work no matter what,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nbut you get the statistics for how effective it is.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nAnd finally, you understand what those choices are.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nYou can start to unpack the choices involved\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nbecause of the side effects.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nEvery time you take a drug, you're walking into a possible side effect.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nSo it spells those out in very clean terms,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nand that works.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nSo I love this. I love that drug facts box.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nAnd so I was thinking about,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nwhat's an opportunity that I could have\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nto help people understand information?\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nWhat's another latent body of information that's out there\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nthat people are really not putting to use?\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nAnd so I came up with this: lab test results.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nBlood test results are this great source of information.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nThey're packed with information.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nThey're just not for us. They're not for people. They're not for patients.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nThey go right to doctors.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nAnd God forbid -- I think many doctors, if you really asked them,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nthey don't really understand all this stuff either.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nThis is the worst presented information.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nYou ask Tufte, and he would say,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\n\"Yes, this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible.\"\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nWhat we did at Wired\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nwas we went, and I got our graphic design department\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nto re-imagine these lab reports.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nSo that's what I want to walk you through.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nSo this is the general blood work before,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nand this is the after, this is what we came up with.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nThe after takes what was four pages --\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nthat previous slide was actually\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nthe first of four pages of data\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nthat's just the general blood work.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nIt goes on and on and on, all these values, all these numbers you don't know.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nThis is our one-page summary.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nWe use the notion of color.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nIt's an amazing notion that color could be used.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nSo on the top-level you have your overall results,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nthe things that might jump out at you from the fine print.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nThen you can drill down\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nand understand how actually we put your level in context,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nand we use color to illustrate\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nexactly where your value falls.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nIn this case, this patient is slightly at risk of diabetes\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nbecause of their glucose level.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nLikewise, you can go over your lipids\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nand, again, understand what your overall cholesterol level is\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nand then break down into the HDL and the LDL if you so choose.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nBut again, always using color\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nand personalized proximity\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nto that information.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nAll those other values,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nall those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nwe summarize.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nWe tell you that you're okay, you're normal.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nBut you don't have to wade through it. You don't have to go through the junk.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAnd then we do two other very important things\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nthat kind of help fill in this feedback loop:\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nwe help people understand in a little more detail\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nwhat these values are and what they might indicate.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nAnd then we go a further step -- we tell them what they can do.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nWe give them some insight\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\ninto what choices they can make, what actions they can take.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nSo that's our general blood work test.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nThen we went to CRP test.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nIn this case, it's a sin of omission.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nThey have this huge amount of space,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nand they don't use it for anything, so we do.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nNow the CRP test is often done\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nfollowing a cholesterol test,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nor in conjunction with a cholesterol test.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nSo we take the bold step\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nof putting the cholesterol information on the same page,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nwhich is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nSo we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nIt's a protein that shows up\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nwhen your blood vessels might be inflamed,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nwhich might be a risk for heart disease.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nWhat you're actually measuring\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nis spelled out in clean language.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nThen we use the information\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nthat's already in the lab report.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nWe use the person's age and their gender\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nto start to fill in the personalized risks.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nSo we start to use the data we have\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nto run a very simple calculation\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nthat's on all sorts of online calculators\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nto get a sense of what the actual risk is.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nThe last one I'll show you is a PSA test.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nHere's the before, and here's the after.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nNow a lot of our effort on this one --\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nas many of you probably know,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\na PSA test is a very controversial test.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nIt's used to test for prostate cancer,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nbut there are all sorts of reasons\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nwhy your prostate might be enlarged.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nAnd so we spent a good deal of our

50s,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nso we can actually give them a very precise estimate\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nof what their risk for prostate cancer is.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nIn this case it's about 25 percent, based on that.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nAnd then again, the follow-up actions.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nSo our cost for this was less than 10,000 dollars, all right.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nThat's what Wired magazine spent on this.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nWhy is Wired magazine doing this?\n\n00:14:15.958 -->

00:14:40.958\nshould not be the doctor, should not be the insurance company.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nIt should be the patient.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nIt's the person who actually, in the end,\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nis going to be having to change their lives\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nand then start adopting new behaviors.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nThis is information that is incredibly powerful.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nIt's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nBut we're not using it. It's just sitting there.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nIt's being lost.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nSo I want to just offer four questions\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nthat every patient should ask,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nbecause I don't actually expect people\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nto start developing these lab test reports.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nBut you can create your own feedback loop.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nAnybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions:\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nCan I have my results?\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nAnd the only acceptable answer is --\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\n(Audience: Yes.) -- yes.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nWhat does this mean? Help me understand what the data is.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nWhat are my options? What choices are now on the table?\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nAnd then, what's next?\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nHow do I integrate this information\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\ninto the longer course of my life?\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nSo I want to wind up by just showing\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nthat people have the capacity to understand this information.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nThis is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people.\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nYou do not need to have the education level of people in this room.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nOrdinary people are capable of understanding this information,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nif we only go to the effort of presenting it to them\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nin a form that they can engage with.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nAnd engagement is essential here,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nbecause it's not just giving them information;\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nit's giving them an opportunity to act.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nThat's what engagement is. It's different from compliance.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nIt works totally different from the way we talk about behavior\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nin medicine today.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nAnd this information is out there.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nI've been talking today about latent information,\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nall this information that exists in the system\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nthat we're not putting to use.\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nBut there are all sorts of other bodies of information\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nthat are coming online,\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nand we need to recognize the capacity of this information\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nto engage people, to help people\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nand to change the course of their lives.\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:23.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Drawing on humor for change", "duration": "402", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/liza_donnelly_drawing_upon_humor_for_change", "transcript": "(Laughter)I was afraid of womanhood. Not that I'm not afraid now, but I've learned to pretend. I've learned to be flexible. In fact, I've developed some interesting tools to help me deal with this fear. Let me explain. Back in the '50s and '60s, when I was growing up, little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft, and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy \u2014 really not quite clear what we were supposed to be.(Laughter)There were plenty of role models all around us. We had our mothers, our aunts, our cousins, our sisters, and of course, the ever-present media bombarding us with images and words, telling us how to be. Now my mother was different. She was a homemaker, but she and I didn't go out and do girlie things together, and she didn't buy me pink outfits. Instead, she knew what I needed, and she bought me a book of cartoons. And I just ate it up. I drew, and I drew, and since I knew that humor was acceptable in my family, I could draw, do what I wanted to do, and not have to perform, not have to speak \u2014 I was very shy \u2014 and I could still get approval. I was launched as a cartoonist. Now when we're young, we don't always know. We know there are rules out there, but we don't always know \u2014 we don't perform them right, even though we are imprinted at birth with these things, and we're told what the most important color in the world is. We're told what shape we're supposed to be in. (Laughter) We're told what to wear \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 and how to do our hair \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 and how to behave.Now the rules that I'm talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture. We're being corrected, and the primary policemen are women, because we are the carriers of the tradition. We pass it down from generation to generation. Not only that \u2014 we always have this vague notion that something's expected of us. And on top of all off these rules, they keep changing. (Laughter) We don't know what's going on half the time, so it puts us in a very tenuous position.(Laughter)Now if you don't like these rules, and many of us don't \u2014 I know I didn't, and I still don't, even though I follow them half the time, not quite aware that I'm following them \u2014 what better way than to change them [than] with humor? Humor relies on the traditions of a society. It takes what we know, and it twists it. It takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress, and it makes it unexpected, and that's what elicits a laugh. Now what if you put together women and humor? I think you can get change. Because women are on the ground floor, and we know the traditions so well, we can bring a different voice to the table.Now I started drawing in the middle of a lot of chaos. I grew up not far from here in Washington D.C. during the Civil Rights movement, the assassinations, the Watergate hearings and then the feminist movement, and I think I was drawing, trying to figure out what was going on. And then also my family was in chaos, and I drew to try to bring my family together \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 try to bring my family together with laughter. It didn't work. My parents got divorced, and my sister was arrested. But I found my place. I found that I didn't have to wear high heels, I didn't have to wear pink, and I could feel like I fit in.Now when I was a little older, in my 20s, I realized there are not many women in cartooning. And I thought, \"Well, maybe I can break the little glass ceiling of cartooning,\" and so I did. I became a cartoonist. And then I thought \u2014 in my 40s I started thinking, \"Well, why don't I do something? I always loved political cartoons, so why don't I do something with the content of my cartoons to make people think about the stupid rules that we're following as well as laugh?\"Now my perspective is a particularly \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 my perspective is a particularly American perspective. I can't help it. I live here. Even though I've traveled a lot, I still think like an American woman. But I believe that the rules that I'm talking about are universal, of course \u2014 that each culture has its different codes of behavior and dress and traditions, and each woman has to deal with these same things that we do here in the U.S. Consequently, we have. Women, because we're on the ground, we know the tradition. We have amazing antennae.Now my work lately has been to collaborate with international cartoonists, which I so enjoy, and it's given me a greater appreciation for the power of cartoons to get at the truth, to get at the issues quickly and succinctly. And not only that, it can get to the viewer through not only the intellect, but through the heart. My work also has allowed me to collaborate with women cartoonists from across the world \u2014 countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Argentina, France \u2014 and we have sat together and laughed and talked and shared our difficulties. And these women are working so hard to get their voices heard in some very difficult circumstances. But I feel blessed to be able to work with them.And we talk about how women have such strong perceptions, because of our tenuous position and our role as tradition-keepers, that we can have the great potential to be change-agents.

Some attribute this golden world knowledge to Plato, others to Pythagoras. But the truth is it doesn't really matter which sage said it first, because it's still sage advice, even today. \"Know thyself.\" It's pithy almost to the point of being meaningless, but it rings familiar and true, doesn't it? \"Know thyself.\" I understand this timeless dictum as a statement about the problems, or more exactly, the confusions, of consciousness. I've always been fascinated with knowing the self. This fascination led me to submerge myself in art, study neuroscience, and later, to become a psychotherapist.Today I combine all my passions as the CEO of InteraXon, a thought-controlled computing company. My goal, quite simply, is to help people become more in tune with themselves. I take it from this little dictum, \"Know thyself.\" If you think about it, this imperative is kind of the defining characteristic of our species, isn't it? I mean, it's self-awareness that separates Homo sapiens from earlier instances of our mankind.Today we're often too busy tending to our iPhones and iPods to really stop and get to know ourselves. Under the deluge of minute-to-minute text conversations, e-mails, relentless exchange of media channels and passwords and apps and reminders and Tweets and tags, we lose sight of what all this fuss is supposed to be about in the first place: Ourselves. Much of the time we're transfixed by all of the ways we can reflect ourselves out into the world. And we can barely find the time to reflect deeply back in on our own selves. We've cluttered ourselves up with all this. And we feel like we have to get far, far away to a secluded retreat, leaving it all behind.So we go far away to the top of a mountain, assuming that perching ourselves on a piece is bound to give us the respite we need to sort the clutter, the chaotic everyday, and find ourselves again. But on that mountain where we gain that beautiful peace of mind, what are we really achieving? It's really only a successful escape. Think of the term we use, \"Retreat.\" This is the term that armies use when they've lost a battle. It means we've got to get out of here. Is this how we feel about the pressures of our world, that in order to get inside ourselves, you have to run for the hills? And the problem with escaping your day-to-day life is that you have to come home, eventually. So when you think about it, we're almost like a tourist visiting ourselves over there. And eventually, that vacation's got to come to an end.So my question to you is, can we find ways to know ourselves without the escape? Can we redefine our relationship with the technologized world in order to have the heightened sense of self-awareness that we seek? Can we live here and now in our wired web and still follow those ancient instructions, \"Know thyself?\" I say the answer is yes. And I'm here today to share a new way that we're working with technology to this end, to get familiar with our inner self like never before \u2014 humanizing technology and furthering that age-old quest of ours to more fully know the self. It's called thought-controlled computing.You may or may not have noticed that I'm wearing a tiny electrode on my forehead. This is actually a brainwave sensor that's reading the electrical activity of my brain as I give this talk. These brainwaves are being analyzed and we can see them as a graph. Let me show you what it looks like. That blue line there is my brainwave. It's the direct signal being recorded from my head, rendered in real time. The green and red bars show that same signal displayed by frequency, with lower frequencies here and higher frequencies up here. You're actually looking inside my head as I speak. These graphs are compelling, they're undulating, but from a human's perspective, they're actually not very useful. That's why we've spent a lot of time thinking about how to make this data meaningful to the people who use it.For instance, what if I could use this data to find out how relaxed I am at any moment? Or what if I can take that information and put it into an organic shape up on the screen? The shape on the right over here has become an indicator of what's going on in my head. The more relaxed I am, the more the energy's going to fall through it. I may also be interested in knowing how focused I am, so I can put my level of attention into the circuit board on the other side. And the more focused my brain is, the more the circuit board is going to surge with energy.Ordinarily, I would have no way of knowing how focused or relaxed I was in any tangible way. As we know, our feelings about how we're feeling are notoriously unreliable. We've all had stress creep up on us without even noticing it until we lost it on someone who didn't deserve it, and then we realize that we probably should have checked in with ourselves a little earlier. This new awareness opens up vast possibilities for applications that help improve our lives and ourselves. We're trying to create technology that uses the insights to make our work more efficient, our breaks more relaxing and our connections deeper and more fulfilling than ever. I'm going to share some of these visions with you in a bit, but first I want to take a look at how we got here. By the way, feel free to check in on my head at any time.(Laughter)My team at InteraXon and I have been developing thought-controlled application for almost a decade now. In the first phase of development, we were really enthused by all the things we could control with our mind. We were making things activate, light up and work just by thinking. We were transcending the space between the mind and the device. We brought to life a vast array of prototypes and products that you could control with your mind, like thought-controlled home appliances or slot-car games or video games or a levitating chair. We created technology and applications that engaged people's imaginations, and it was really exciting.And then we were asked to do something really big for the Olympics. We were invited to create a massive installation at the Vancouver 2010 winter Olympics, were used in Vancouver, got to control the lighting on the CN Tower, the Canadian Parliament buildings and Niagara Falls from all the way across the country using their minds. Over 17 days at the Olympics, 7,000 visitors from all over the world actually got to individually control the light from the CN Tower, parliament and Niagara in real time with their minds from across the country, 3,000 km away. So controlling stuff with your mind is pretty cool.But we're always interested in multitiered levels of human interaction. And so we began looking into inventing thought-controlled applications in a more complex frame than just control. And that was responsiveness. We realized that we had a system that allowed technology to know something about you. And it could join into the relationship with you. We created the responsive room where the lights, music and blinds adjusted to your state. They followed these little shifts in your mental activity. So as you settled into relaxation at the end of a hard day, on the couch in our office, the music would mellow with you. When you read, the desk lamp would get brighter. If you nod off, the system would know, dimming to darkness as you do.We then realized that if technology could know something about you and use it to help you, there's an even more valuable application than that. That you could know something about yourself. We could know sides of ourselves that were all but invisible and come to see things that were previously hidden. Let me show you an example of what I'm talking about here.Here's an application that I created for the iPad. So the goal of the original game Zen Bound is to wrap a rope around a wooden form. So you use it with your headset. The headset connects wirelessly to an iPad or a smartphone. In that headset, you have fabric sensors on your forehead and above the ear. In the original Zen Bound game, you play it by scrolling your fingers over the pad. In the game that we created, of course, you control the wooden form that's on the screen there with your mind. As you focus on the wooden form, it rotates. The more you focus, the faster the rotation. This is for real. This is not a fake. What's really interesting to me though is at the end of the game, you get stats and feedback about how you did. You have graphs and charts that tell you how your brain was doing \u2014 not just how much rope you used or what your high score is, but what was going on inside of your mind. And this is valuable feedback that we can use to understand what's going on inside of ourselves.I like to call this \"intra-active.\" Normally, we think about technology as interactive. This technology is intra-active. It understands what's inside of you and builds a sort of responsive relationship between you and your technology so that you can use this information to move you forward. So you can use this information to understand you in a responsive loop. At InteraXon \u2014 intra-active technology is one of our really defining mandates. It's how we understand the world inside and reflect it outside into this tight loop.For example, thought-controlled computing can teach children with ADD how to improve their focus. With ADD, children have a low proportion of beta waves for focus states and a high proportion of theta states. So you can create applications that reward focused brain states. So you can imagine kids playing video games with their brain waves and improving their ADD symptoms as they do it. This can be as effective as Ritalin. Perhaps even more importantly, thought-controlled computing can give children with ADD insights into their own fluctuating mental states, so they can better understand themselves and their learning needs. The way these children will be able to use their new awareness to improve themselves will upend many of the damaging and widespread social stigmas that people who are diagnosed as different are challenged with.We can peer inside our heads and interact with what was once locked away from us, what once mystified and separated us. Brainwave technology can understand us, anticipate our emotions and find the best solutions for our needs. Imagine this collected awareness of the individual computed and reflected across an entire lifespan. Imagine the insights that you can gain from this kind of second sight. It would be like plugging into your own personal Google.On the subject of Google, today you can search and tag images based on the thoughts and feelings you had while you watched them. You can tag pictures of baby animals as happy, or whatever baby animals are to you, and then you can search that database, navigating with your feelings, rather than the keywords that just hint at them. Or you could tag Facebook photos with the emotions that you had associated with those memories and then instantly prioritize the streams that catch your attention, just like this. Humanizing technology is about taking what's already natural about the human-tech experience and building technology seamlessly in tandem with it. As it aligns with our human behaviors, it can allow us to make better sense of what we do and, more importantly, why. Creating a big picture out of all the important little details that make up who we are.With humanized technology we can monitor the quality of your sleep cycles. When our productivity starts to slacken, we can go back to that data and see how we can make more effective balance between work and play. Do you know what causes fatigue in you or what brings out your energetic self, what triggers cause you to be depressed or what fun things are going to bring you out of that funk? Imagine if you had access to data that allowed you to rank on a scale of overall happiness which people in your life made you the happiest, or what activities brought you joy. Would you make more time for those people? Would you prioritize? Would you get a divorce?(Laughter)What thought-controlled computing can allow you to do is build colorful layered pictures of our lives. And with this, we can get the skinny on our psychological happenings and build a story of our behaviors over time. We can begin to see the underlying narratives that propel us forward and tell us about what's going on. And from this, we can learn how to change the plot, the outcome and the character of our personal stories.Two millennia ago, those Greeks had some powerful insights. They knew that a fundamental piece falls into place when you start to live out their little phrase, when you come into contact with yourself. They understood the power of human narrative and the value that we place on humans as changing, evolving and growing. But they understood something more fundamental \u2014 the sheer joy in discovery, the delight and fascination that we get from the world and being ourselves in it; the richness that we get from seeing, feeling and knowing the lives that we are.My mom's an artist, and as a child, I'd often see her bring things to life with the stroke of a brush. One moment, it was all white space, pure possibility. The next, it was alive with her colorful ideas and expressions. As I sat easel-side, watching her transform canvas after canvas, I learned that you could create your own world. I learned that our own inner worlds \u2014 our ideas, emotions and imaginations \u2014 were, in fact, not bound by our brains and bodies. If you could think it, if you could discover it, you could bring it to life.To me, thought-controlled computing is as simple and powerful as a paintbrush \u2014 one more tool to unlock and enliven the hidden worlds within us. I look forward to the day that I can sit beside you, easel-side, watching the world that we can create with our new toolboxes and the discoveries that we can make about ourselves.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1338, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:16.937\nThe maxim, \"Know thyself\"\nhas been around since the ancient Greeks.\n\n00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:21.162\nSome attribute this golden world\nknowledge to Plato, others to Pythagoras.\n\n00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:24.362\nBut the truth is it doesn't really matter\nwhich sage said it first,\n\n00:00:24.386 --> 00:00:27.173\nbecause it's still\nsage advice, even today.\n\n00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:30.189\n\"Know thyself.\"\n\n00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:34.143\nIt's pithy almost to the point\nof being meaningless,\n\n00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:36.702\nbut it rings familiar\nand true, doesn't it?\n\n00:00:37.853 --> 00:00:39.163\n\"Know thyself.\"\n\n00:00:40.792 --> 00:00:44.107\nI understand this timeless dictum\nas a statement about the problems,\n\n00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:46.933\nor more exactly, the confusions,\nof consciousness.\n\n00:00:47.408 --> 00:00:49.770\nI've always been fascinated\nwith knowing the self.\n\n00:00:49.794 --> 00:00:52.301\nThis fascination led me\nto submerge myself in art,\n\n00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:55.782\nstudy neuroscience,\nand later, to become a psychotherapist.\n\n00:00:55.806 --> 00:00:59.482\nToday I combine all my passions\nas the CEO of InteraXon,\n\n00:00:59.506 --> 00:01:01.551\na thought-controlled computing company.\n\n00:01:01.922 --> 00:01:06.933\nMy goal, quite simply, is to help people\nbecome more in tune with themselves.\n\n00:01:07.264 --> 00:01:10.360\nI take it from this\nlittle dictum, \"Know thyself.\"\n\n00:01:11.082 --> 00:01:12.565\nIf you think about it,\n\n00:01:12.589 --> 00:01:17.133\nthis imperative is kind of the defining\ncharacteristic of our species, isn't it?\n\n00:01:17.816 --> 00:01:19.458\nI mean, it's self-awareness\n\n00:01:19.482 --> 00:01:23.098\nthat separates Homo sapiens\nfrom earlier instances of our mankind.\n\n00:01:24.624 --> 00:01:26.686\nToday we're often too busy\n\n00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.491\ntending to our iPhones and iPods\nto really stop and get to know ourselves.\n\n00:01:31.895 --> 00:01:34.522\nUnder the deluge of minute-to-minute\ntext conversations,\n\n00:01:34.546 --> 00:01:37.606\ne-mails, relentless exchange\nof media channels\n\n00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.431\nand passwords and apps\nand reminders and Tweets and tags,\n\n00:01:40.455 --> 00:01:44.181\nwe lose sight of what all this fuss is\nsupposed to be about in the first place:\n\n00:01:44.205 --> 00:01:45.820\nOurselves.\n\n00:01:45.844 --> 00:01:47.896\nMuch of the time we're transfixed\n\n00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.212\nby all of the ways we can reflect\nourselves out into the world.\n\n00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:56.417\nAnd we can barely find the time to reflect\ndeeply back in on our own selves.\n\n00:01:57.514 --> 00:02:00.073\nWe've cluttered ourselves up\nwith all this.\n\n00:02:00.097 --> 00:02:03.528\nAnd we feel like we have to get\nfar, far away to a secluded retreat,\n\n00:02:03.552 --> 00:02:05.002\nleaving it all behind.\n\n00:02:05.026 --> 00:02:08.134\nSo we go far away\nto the top of a mountain,\n\n00:02:08.158 --> 00:02:10.188\nassuming that perching\nourselves on a piece\n\n00:02:10.212 --> 00:02:14.701\nis bound to give us the respite we need\nto sort the clutter, the chaotic everyday,\n\n00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:16.399\nand find ourselves again.\n\n00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:21.581\nBut on that mountain where we gain\nthat beautiful peace of mind,\n\n00:02:22.097 --> 00:02:23.662\nwhat are we really achieving?\n\n00:02:24.242 --> 00:02:27.370\nIt's really only a successful escape.\n\n00:02:28.426 --> 00:02:30.246\nThink of the term we use, \"Retreat.\"\n\n00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.091\nThis is the term that armies use\nwhen they've lost a battle.\n\n00:02:33.115 --> 00:02:34.944\nIt means we've got to get out of here.\n\n00:02:34.968 --> 00:02:37.463\nIs this how we feel\nabout the pressures of our world,\n\n00:02:37.487 --> 00:02:39.481\nthat in order to get inside ourselves,\n\n00:02:39.505 --> 00:02:40.934\nyou have to run for the hills?\n\n00:02:41.573 --> 00:02:44.789\nAnd the problem with escaping\nyour day-to-day life\n\n00:02:44.813 --> 00:02:47.228\nis that you have to come home, eventually.\n\n00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:49.862\nSo when you think about it,\n\n00:02:49.886 --> 00:02:54.340\nwe're almost like a tourist\nvisiting ourselves over there.\n\n00:02:54.364 --> 00:02:56.933\nAnd eventually, that vacation's got\nto come to an end.\n\n00:02:57.533 --> 00:03:00.282\nSo my question to you is,\n\n00:03:00.306 --> 00:03:04.385\ncan we find ways to know ourselves\nwithout the escape?\n\n00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.700\nCan we redefine our relationship\nwith the technologized world\n\n00:03:08.724 --> 00:03:12.372\nin order to have the heightened\nsense of self-awareness that we seek?\n\n00:03:12.396 --> 00:03:15.872\nCan we live here and now in our wired web\n\n00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:20.418\nand still follow those ancient\ninstructions, \"Know thyself?\"\n\n00:03:22.018 --> 00:03:23.624\nI say the answer is yes.\n\n00:03:23.648 --> 00:03:25.694\nAnd I'm here today to share a new way\n\n00:03:25.718 --> 00:03:28.128\nthat we're working\nwith technology to this end,\n\n00:03:28.152 --> 00:03:31.607\nto get familiar with our inner self\nlike never before --\n\n00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:36.124\nhumanizing technology\nand furthering that age-old quest of ours\n\n00:03:36.148 --> 00:03:37.686\nto more fully know the self.\n\n00:03:38.641 --> 00:03:41.958\nIt's called thought-controlled computing.\n\n00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.306\nYou may or may not have noticed\n\n00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.639\nthat I'm wearing a tiny\nelectrode on my forehead.\n\n00:03:48.663 --> 00:03:50.334\nThis is actually a brainwave sensor\n\n00:03:50.358 --> 00:03:52.714\nthat's reading the electrical\nactivity of my brain\n\n00:03:52.738 --> 00:03:53.934\nas I give this talk.\n\n00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:57.939\nThese brainwaves are being analyzed\nand we can see them as a graph.\n\n00:03:57.963 --> 00:03:59.934\nLet me show you what it looks like.\n\n00:04:00.825 --> 00:04:03.436\nThat blue line there is my brainwave.\n\n00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.595\nIt's the direct signal being recorded\nfrom my head, rendered in real time.\n\n00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:11.030\nThe green and red bars show\nthat same signal displayed by frequency,\n\n00:04:11.054 --> 00:04:12.768\nwith lower frequencies here\n\n00:04:12.792 --> 00:04:14.495\nand higher frequencies up here.\n\n00:04:14.948 --> 00:04:18.107\nYou're actually looking\ninside my head as I speak.\n\n00:04:19.663 --> 00:04:22.663\nThese graphs are compelling,\nthey're undulating,\n\n00:04:22.687 --> 00:04:25.933\nbut from a human's perspective,\nthey're actually not very useful.\n\n00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:28.744\nThat's why we've spent a lot of time\n\n00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:32.545\nthinking about how to make this data\nmeaningful to the people who use it.\n\n00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:34.083\nFor instance,\n\n00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:38.062\nwhat if I could use this data to find out\nhow relaxed I am at any moment?\n\n00:04:38.086 --> 00:04:39.907\nOr what if I can take that information\n\n00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:42.913\nand put it into an organic\nshape up on the screen?\n\n00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:45.471\nThe shape on the right over here\n\n00:04:45.495 --> 00:04:48.172\nhas become an indicator\nof what's going on in my head.\n\n00:04:48.196 --> 00:04:49.690\nThe more relaxed I am,\n\n00:04:49.714 --> 00:04:52.176\nthe more the energy's going\nto fall through it.\n\n00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.054\nI may also be interested in knowing\nhow focused I am,\n\n00:04:55.078 --> 00:04:58.836\nso I can put my level of attention\ninto the circuit board on the other side.\n\n00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.475\nAnd the more focused my brain is,\n\n00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:03.380\nthe more the circuit board\nis going to surge with energy.\n\n00:05:03.404 --> 00:05:06.828\nOrdinarily, I would have no way\nof knowing how focused or relaxed I was\n\n00:05:06.852 --> 00:05:08.591\nin any tangible way.\n\n00:05:09.554 --> 00:05:11.813\nAs we know, our feelings\nabout how we're feeling\n\n00:05:11.837 --> 00:05:13.666\nare notoriously unreliable.\n\n00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.523\nWe've all had stress creep up\non us without even noticing it\n\n00:05:16.547 --> 00:05:18.963\nuntil we lost it on someone\nwho didn't deserve it,\n\n00:05:18.987 --> 00:05:22.561\nand then we realize that we probably\nshould have checked in with ourselves\n\n00:05:22.585 --> 00:05:23.738\na little earlier.\n\n00:05:23.762 --> 00:05:26.880\nThis new awareness\nopens up vast possibilities\n\n00:05:26.904 --> 00:05:29.934\nfor applications that help\nimprove our lives and ourselves.\n\n00:05:31.157 --> 00:05:33.842\nWe're trying to create technology\nthat uses the insights\n\n00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:36.549\nto make our work more efficient,\nour breaks more relaxing\n\n00:05:36.573 --> 00:05:39.573\nand our connections deeper\nand more fulfilling than ever.\n\n00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:43.322\nI'm going to share some of these\nvisions with you in a bit,\n\n00:05:43.346 --> 00:05:45.934\nbut first I want to take\na look at how we got here.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.934\nBy the way, feel free to check\nin on my head at any time.\n\n00:05:49.426 --> 00:05:51.403\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:51.427 --> 00:05:52.934\nMy team at InteraXon and I\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:56.747\nhave been developing thought-controlled\napplication for almost a decade now.\n\n00:05:56.771 --> 00:05:58.391\nIn the first phase of development,\n\n00:05:58.415 --> 00:06:01.851\nwe were really enthused by all the things\nwe could control with our mind.\n\n00:06:01.875 --> 00:06:06.149\nWe were making things activate,\nlight up and work just by thinking.\n\n00:06:06.697 --> 00:06:10.313\nWe were transcending the space\nbetween the mind and the device.\n\n00:06:10.956 --> 00:06:13.707\nWe brought to life a vast array\nof prototypes and products\n\n00:06:13.731 --> 00:06:15.752\nthat you could control with your mind,\n\n00:06:15.776 --> 00:06:17.692\nlike thought-controlled home appliances\n\n00:06:17.716 --> 00:06:21.432\nor slot-car games or video games\nor a levitating chair.\n\n00:06:22.202 --> 00:06:25.831\nWe created technology and applications\nthat engaged people's imaginations,\n\n00:06:25.855 --> 00:06:27.316\nand it was really exciting.\n\n00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.172\nAnd then we were asked to do something\nreally big for the Olympics.\n\n00:06:31.797 --> 00:06:34.060\nWe were invited to create\na massive installation\n\n00:06:34.084 --> 00:06:35.922\nat the Vancouver 2010 winter Olympics,\n\n00:06:35.946 --> 00:06:37.477\nwere used in Vancouver,\n\n00:06:37.501 --> 00:06:40.218\ngot to control the lighting\non the CN Tower,\n\n00:06:40.242 --> 00:06:43.157\nthe Canadian Parliament\nbuildings and Niagara Falls\n\n00:06:43.181 --> 00:06:46.933\nfrom all the way across the country\nusing their minds.\n\n00:06:47.262 --> 00:06:50.481\nOver 17 days at the Olympics,\n7,000 visitors from all over the world\n\n00:06:50.505 --> 00:06:52.670\nactually got to individually\ncontrol the light\n\n00:06:52.694 --> 00:06:55.325\nfrom the CN Tower, parliament\nand Niagara in real time\n\n00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:58.370\nwith their minds from across\nthe country, 3,000 km away.\n\n00:06:58.394 --> 00:07:01.933\nSo controlling stuff\nwith your mind is pretty cool.\n\n00:07:02.768 --> 00:07:06.230\nBut we're always interested in multitiered\nlevels of human interaction.\n\n00:07:06.254 --> 00:07:09.655\nAnd so we began looking into inventing\nthought-controlled applications\n\n00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:11.950\nin a more complex frame than just control.\n\n00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.934\nAnd that was responsiveness.\n\n00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:17.270\nWe realized that we had a system\n\n00:07:17.294 --> 00:07:19.900\nthat allowed technology\nto know something about you.\n\n00:07:19.924 --> 00:07:22.559\nAnd it could join\ninto the relationship with you.\n\n00:07:23.283 --> 00:07:25.407\nWe created the responsive room\n\n00:07:25.431 --> 00:07:28.423\nwhere the lights, music and blinds\nadjusted to your state.\n\n00:07:28.798 --> 00:07:31.801\nThey followed these little shifts\nin your mental activity.\n\n00:07:31.825 --> 00:07:34.619\nSo as you settled into relaxation\nat the end of a hard day,\n\n00:07:34.643 --> 00:07:35.974\non the couch in our office,\n\n00:07:35.998 --> 00:07:38.154\nthe music would mellow with you.\n\n00:07:38.178 --> 00:07:40.784\nWhen you read, the desk lamp\nwould get brighter.\n\n00:07:40.808 --> 00:07:45.323\nIf you nod off, the system would know,\ndimming to darkness as you do.\n\n00:07:46.583 --> 00:07:50.258\nWe then realized that if technology\ncould know something about you\n\n00:07:50.282 --> 00:07:51.488\nand use it to help you,\n\n00:07:51.512 --> 00:07:54.332\nthere's an even more valuable\napplication than that.\n\n00:07:54.356 --> 00:07:57.427\nThat you could know\nsomething about yourself.\n\n00:07:58.182 --> 00:08:01.360\nWe could know sides of ourselves\nthat were all but invisible\n\n00:08:01.384 --> 00:08:03.933\nand come to see things\nthat were previously hidden.\n\n00:08:04.791 --> 00:08:07.537\nLet me show you an example\nof what I'm talking about here.\n\n00:08:07.561 --> 00:08:10.104\nHere's an application\nthat I created for the iPad.\n\n00:08:10.128 --> 00:08:15.367\nSo the goal of the original game Zen Bound\nis to wrap a rope around a wooden form.\n\n00:08:15.391 --> 00:08:16.935\nSo you use it with your headset.\n\n00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:19.815\nThe headset connects wirelessly\nto an iPad or a smartphone.\n\n00:08:20.156 --> 00:08:24.486\nIn that headset, you have fabric sensors\non your forehead and above the ear.\n\n00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:26.032\nIn the original Zen Bound game,\n\n00:08:26.056 --> 00:08:28.934\nyou play it by scrolling\nyour fingers over the pad.\n\n00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:31.384\nIn the game that we created, of course,\n\n00:08:31.408 --> 00:08:35.560\nyou control the wooden form\nthat's on the screen there with your mind.\n\n00:08:35.964 --> 00:08:38.183\nAs you focus on the wooden form,\n\n00:08:38.207 --> 00:08:39.402\nit rotates.\n\n00:08:39.426 --> 00:08:42.459\nThe more you focus,\nthe faster the rotation.\n\n00:08:42.816 --> 00:08:44.466\nThis is for real.\n\n00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.934\nThis is not a fake.\n\n00:08:46.556 --> 00:08:48.396\nWhat's really interesting to me though\n\n00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:52.290\nis at the end of the game, you get stats\nand feedback about how you did.\n\n00:08:52.314 --> 00:08:56.403\nYou have graphs and charts\nthat tell you how your brain was doing --\n\n00:08:56.427 --> 00:08:59.479\nnot just how much rope you used\nor what your high score is,\n\n00:08:59.503 --> 00:09:03.351\nbut what was going on inside of your mind.\n\n00:09:03.756 --> 00:09:05.625\nAnd this is valuable feedback\n\n00:09:05.649 --> 00:09:10.168\nthat we can use to understand\nwhat's going on inside of ourselves.\n\n00:09:11.992 --> 00:09:15.186\nI like to call this \"intra-active.\"\n\n00:09:16.048 --> 00:09:19.249\nNormally, we think\nabout technology as interactive.\n\n00:09:19.749 --> 00:09:22.460\nThis technology is intra-active.\n\n00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.109\nIt understands what's inside of you\n\n00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:29.498\nand builds a sort\nof responsive relationship\n\n00:09:29.522 --> 00:09:31.519\nbetween you and your technology\n\n00:09:31.543 --> 00:09:35.498\nso that you can use this information\nto move you forward.\n\n00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:40.392\nSo you can use this information\nto understand you in a responsive loop.\n\n00:09:40.852 --> 00:09:42.605\nAt InteraXon --\n\n00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:49.944\nintra-active technology\nis one of our really defining mandates.\n\n00:09:50.626 --> 00:09:55.526\nIt's how we understand the world inside\nand reflect it outside\n\n00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.593\ninto this tight loop.\n\n00:09:58.623 --> 00:10:01.752\nFor example, thought-controlled computing\n\n00:10:01.776 --> 00:10:04.933\ncan teach children with ADD\nhow to improve their focus.\n\n00:10:05.384 --> 00:10:09.699\nWith ADD, children have a low proportion\nof beta waves for focus states\n\n00:10:09.723 --> 00:10:11.756\nand a high proportion of theta states.\n\n00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.966\nSo you can create applications\nthat reward focused brain states.\n\n00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:18.195\nSo you can imagine kids playing\nvideo games with their brain waves\n\n00:10:18.219 --> 00:10:20.688\nand improving their ADD\nsymptoms as they do it.\n\n00:10:20.712 --> 00:10:22.606\nThis can be as effective as Ritalin.\n\n00:10:23.543 --> 00:10:25.384\nPerhaps even more importantly,\n\n00:10:25.408 --> 00:10:27.985\nthought-controlled computing\ncan give children with ADD\n\n00:10:28.009 --> 00:10:30.912\ninsights into their own fluctuating\nmental states,\n\n00:10:30.936 --> 00:10:34.568\nso they can better understand themselves\nand their learning needs.\n\n00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:38.568\nThe way these children will be able to use\ntheir new awareness to improve themselves\n\n00:10:38.592 --> 00:10:41.516\nwill upend many of the damaging\nand widespread social stigmas\n\n00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.380\nthat people who are diagnosed\nas different are challenged with.\n\n00:10:45.872 --> 00:10:47.228\nWe can peer inside our heads\n\n00:10:47.252 --> 00:10:50.035\nand interact with what was once\nlocked away from us,\n\n00:10:50.059 --> 00:10:52.957\nwhat once mystified and separated us.\n\n00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.590\nBrainwave technology can understand us,\nanticipate our emotions\n\n00:10:57.614 --> 00:10:59.627\nand find the best solutions for our needs.\n\n00:10:59.651 --> 00:11:02.397\nImagine this collected\nawareness of the individual\n\n00:11:02.421 --> 00:11:04.933\ncomputed and reflected\nacross an entire lifespan.\n\n00:11:05.416 --> 00:11:08.933\nImagine the insights that you can gain\nfrom this kind of second sight.\n\n00:11:09.439 --> 00:11:12.384\nIt would be like plugging\ninto your own personal Google.\n\n00:11:12.754 --> 00:11:14.004\nOn the subject of Google,\n\n00:11:14.028 --> 00:11:15.934\ntoday you can search and tag images\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:19.330\nbased on the thoughts and feelings\nyou had while you watched them.\n\n00:11:19.354 --> 00:11:22.098\nYou can tag pictures\nof baby animals as happy,\n\n00:11:22.122 --> 00:11:24.592\nor whatever baby animals are to you,\n\n00:11:24.616 --> 00:11:28.436\nand then you can search that database,\nnavigating with your feelings,\n\n00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.934\nrather than the keywords\nthat just hint at them.\n\n00:11:31.527 --> 00:11:33.786\nOr you could tag Facebook photos\n\n00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:38.402\nwith the emotions that you had\nassociated with those memories\n\n00:11:38.426 --> 00:11:42.128\nand then instantly prioritize\nthe streams that catch your attention,\n\n00:11:42.852 --> 00:11:44.081\njust like this.\n\n00:11:45.405 --> 00:11:48.491\nHumanizing technology\nis about taking what's already natural\n\n00:11:48.515 --> 00:11:50.115\nabout the human-tech experience\n\n00:11:50.139 --> 00:11:53.525\nand building technology\nseamlessly in tandem with it.\n\n00:11:53.549 --> 00:11:55.858\nAs it aligns with our human behaviors,\n\n00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:59.058\nit can allow us to make\nbetter sense of what we do\n\n00:11:59.082 --> 00:12:01.317\nand, more importantly, why.\n\n00:12:01.824 --> 00:12:04.934\nCreating a big picture\nout of all the important little details\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.208\nthat make up who we are.\n\n00:12:07.872 --> 00:12:11.420\nWith humanized technology we can monitor\nthe quality of your sleep cycles.\n\n00:12:11.961 --> 00:12:16.213\nWhen our productivity starts to slacken,\nwe can go back to that data\n\n00:12:16.237 --> 00:12:20.185\nand see how we can make more effective\nbalance between work and play.\n\n00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.823\nDo you know what causes fatigue in you\nor what brings out your energetic self,\n\n00:12:24.847 --> 00:12:26.765\nwhat triggers cause you to be depressed\n\n00:12:26.789 --> 00:12:30.307\nor what fun things are going\nto bring you out of that funk?\n\n00:12:31.715 --> 00:12:33.361\nImagine if you had access to data\n\n00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:36.582\nthat allowed you to rank\non a scale of overall happiness\n\n00:12:36.606 --> 00:12:39.462\nwhich people in your life\nmade you the happiest,\n\n00:12:40.185 --> 00:12:42.581\nor what activities brought you joy.\n\n00:12:42.605 --> 00:12:45.660\nWould you make more time for those people?\nWould you prioritize?\n\n00:12:45.684 --> 00:12:46.959\nWould you get a divorce?\n\n00:12:46.983 --> 00:12:48.368\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:48.392 --> 00:12:50.881\nWhat thought-controlled computing\ncan allow you to do\n\n00:12:50.905 --> 00:12:53.697\nis build colorful layered\npictures of our lives.\n\n00:12:53.721 --> 00:12:57.207\nAnd with this, we can get the skinny\non our psychological happenings\n\n00:12:57.231 --> 00:12:59.639\nand build a story\nof our behaviors over time.\n\n00:13:00.077 --> 00:13:03.296\nWe can begin to see the underlying\nnarratives that propel us forward\n\n00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.909\nand tell us about what's going on.\n\n00:13:06.731 --> 00:13:11.259\nAnd from this, we can learn\nhow to change the plot, the outcome\n\n00:13:11.283 --> 00:13:14.269\nand the character of our personal stories.\n\n00:13:15.524 --> 00:13:19.665\nTwo millennia ago, those Greeks\nhad some powerful insights.\n\n00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.800\nThey knew that a fundamental\npiece falls into place\n\n00:13:22.824 --> 00:13:25.563\nwhen you start to live\nout their little phrase,\n\n00:13:25.587 --> 00:13:27.934\nwhen you come into contact with yourself.\n\n00:13:28.379 --> 00:13:31.730\nThey understood the power\nof human narrative\n\n00:13:31.754 --> 00:13:35.750\nand the value that we place on humans\nas changing, evolving and growing.\n\n00:13:36.306 --> 00:13:38.934\nBut they understood something\nmore fundamental --\n\n00:13:39.783 --> 00:13:41.934\nthe sheer joy in discovery,\n\n00:13:43.064 --> 00:13:45.593\nthe delight and fascination\nthat we get from the world\n\n00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:47.193\nand being ourselves in it;\n\n00:13:47.816 --> 00:13:52.609\nthe richness that we get from seeing,\nfeeling and knowing the lives that we are.\n\n00:13:53.485 --> 00:13:54.652\nMy mom's an artist,\n\n00:13:54.676 --> 00:13:58.534\nand as a child, I'd often see her bring\nthings to life with the stroke of a brush.\n\n00:13:58.558 --> 00:14:01.166\nOne moment, it was\nall white space, pure possibility.\n\n00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.686\nThe next, it was alive\nwith her colorful ideas and expressions.\n\n00:14:05.415 --> 00:14:10.260\nAs I sat easel-side, watching her\ntransform canvas after canvas,\n\n00:14:11.111 --> 00:14:13.676\nI learned that you could\ncreate your own world.\n\n00:14:14.791 --> 00:14:16.995\nI learned that our own inner worlds --\n\n00:14:17.019 --> 00:14:20.159\nour ideas, emotions and imaginations --\n\n00:14:20.183 --> 00:14:22.934\nwere, in fact, not bound\nby our brains and bodies.\n\n00:14:23.466 --> 00:14:26.809\nIf you could think it,\nif you could discover it,\n\n00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:28.546\nyou could bring it to life.\n\n00:14:29.795 --> 00:14:31.934\nTo me, thought-controlled computing\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.361\nis as simple and powerful\nas a paintbrush --\n\n00:14:34.385 --> 00:14:37.933\none more tool to unlock and enliven\nthe hidden worlds within us.\n\n00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:43.190\nI look forward to the day\nthat I can sit beside you, easel-side,\n\n00:14:43.748 --> 00:14:47.863\nwatching the world that we can create\nwith our new toolboxes\n\n00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:50.933\nand the discoveries\nthat we can make about ourselves.\n\n00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:53.657\nThank you.\n\n00:14:53.681 --> 00:14:55.481\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The council of dads", "duration": "1233", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/bruce_feiler_the_council_of_dads", "transcript": "My story actually began when I was four years old and my family moved to a new neighborhood in our hometown of Savannah, Georgia. And this was the 1960s when actually all the streets in this neighborhood were named after Confederate war generals. We lived on Robert E. Lee Boulevard. And when I was five, my parents gave me an orange Schwinn Sting-Ray bicycle. It had a swooping banana seat and those ape hanger handlebars that made the rider look like an orangutan. That's why they were called ape hangers. They were actually modeled on hotrod motorcycles of the 1960s, which I'm sure my mom didn't know. And one day I was exploring this cul-de-sac hidden away a few streets away. And I came back, and I wanted to turn around and get back to that street more quickly, so I decided to turn around in this big street that intersected our neighborhood, and wham! I was hit by a passing sedan. My mangled body flew in one direction, my mangled bike flew in the other. And I lay on the pavement stretching over that yellow line, and one of my neighbors came running over. \"Andy, Andy, how are you doing?\" she said, using the name of my older brother. (Laughter) \"I'm Bruce,\" I said, and promptly passed out.I broke my left femur that day \u2014 it's the largest bone in your body \u2014 and spent the next two months in a body cast that went from my chin to the tip of my toe to my right knee, and a steel bar went from my right knee to my left ankle. And for the next 38 years, that accident was the only medically interesting thing that ever happened to me. In fact, I made a living by walking. I traveled around the world, entered different cultures, wrote a series of books about my travels, including \"Walking the Bible.\" I hosted a television show by that name on PBS. I was, for all the world, the \"walking guy.\" Until, in May 2008, a routine visit to my doctor and a routine blood test produced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number that something might be wrong with my bones. And my doctor, on a whim, sent me to get a full-body bone scan, which showed that there was some growth in my left leg. That sent me to an X-ray, then to an MRI. And one afternoon, I got a call from my doctor. \"The tumor in your leg is not consistent with a benign tumor.\" I stopped walking, and it took my mind a second to convert that double negative into a much more horrifying negative. I have cancer. And to think that the tumor was in the same bone, in the same place in my body as the accident 38 years earlier \u2014 it seemed like too much of a coincidence.So that afternoon, I went back to my house, and my three year-old identical twin daughters, Eden and Tybee Feiler, came running to meet me. They'd just turned three, and they were into all things pink and purple. In fact, we called them Pinkalicious and Purplicious \u2014 although I must say, our favorite nickname occurred on their birthday, April 15th. When they were born at 6:14 and 6:46 on April 15, 2005, our otherwise grim, humorless doctor looked at his watch, and was like, \"Hmm, April 15th \u2014 tax day. Early filer and late filer.\" (Laughter) The next day I came to see him. I was like, \"Doctor, that was a really good joke.\" And he was like, \"You're the writer, kid.\" Anyway \u2014 so they had just turned three, and they came and they were doing this dance they had just made up where they were twirling faster and faster until they tumbled to the ground, laughing with all the glee in the world. I crumbled. I kept imagining all the walks I might not take with them, the art projects I might not mess up, the boyfriends I might not scowl at, the aisles I might not walk down. Would they wonder who I was, I thought. Would they yearn for my approval, my love, my voice?A few days later, I woke with an idea of how I might give them that voice. I would reach out to six men from all parts of my life and ask them to be present in the passages of my daughters' lives. \"I believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives,\" I wrote these men. \"They'll have loving families and welcoming homes, but they may not have me. They may not have their dad. Will you help be their dad?\" And I said to myself I would call this group of men \"the Council of Dads.\"Now as soon as I had this idea, I decided I wouldn't tell my wife. Okay. She's a very upbeat, naturally excited person. There's this idea in this culture \u2014 I don't have to tell you \u2014 that you sort of \"happy\" your way through a problem. We should focus on the positive. My wife, as I said, she grew up outside of Boston. She's got a big smile. She's got a big personality. She's got big hair \u2014 although, she told me recently, I can't say she has big hair, because if I say she has big hair, people will think she's from Texas. And it's apparently okay to marry a boy from Georgia, but not to have hair from Texas. And actually, in her defense, if she were here right now, she would point out that, when we got married in Georgia, there were three questions on the marriage certificate license, the third of which was, \"Are you related?\" (Laughter) I said, \"Look, in Georgia at least we want to know. In Arkansas they don't even ask.\" What I didn't tell her is, if she said, \"Yes,\" you could jump. You don't need the 30-day waiting period. Because you don't need the get-to-know-you session at that point.So I wasn't going to tell her about this idea, but the next day I couldn't control myself, I told her. And she loved the idea, but she quickly started rejecting my nominees. She was like, \"Well, I love him, but I would never ask him for advice.\" So it turned out that starting a council of dads was a very efficient way to find out what my wife really thought of my friends.(Laughter)So we decided that we needed a set of rules, and we came up with a number. And the first one was no family, only friends. We thought our family would already be there. Second, men only. We were trying to fill the dad-space in the girls' lives. And then third, sort of a dad for every side. We kind of went through my personality and tried to get a dad who represented each different thing. So what happened was I wrote a letter to each of these men. And rather than send it, I decided to read it to them in person. Linda, my wife, joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals. I sort of friend-married each of these guys.And the first of these guys was Jeff Schumlin. Now Jeff led this trip I took to Europe when I graduated from high school in the early 1980s. And on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle. And I snuck out behind, and there was a moat, a fence and a field of cows. And Jeff came up beside me and said, \"So, have you ever been cow tipping?\" I was like, \"Cow tipping? He was like, \"Yeah. Cows sleep standing up. So if you approach them from behind, down wind, you can push them over and they go thud in the mud.\" So before I had a chance to determine whether this was right or not, we had jumped the moat, we had climbed the fence, we were tiptoeing through the dung and approaching some poor, dozing cow.So a few weeks after my diagnosis, we went up to Vermont, and I decided to put Jeff as the first person in the Council of Dads. And we went to this apple orchard, and I read him this letter. \"Will you help be their dad?\" And I got to the end \u2014 he was crying and I was crying \u2014 and then he looked at me, and he said, \"Yes.\" I was like, \"Yes?\" I kind of had forgotten there was a question at the heart of my letter. And frankly, although I keep getting asked this, it never occurred to me that anybody would turn me down under the circumstances. And then I asked him a question, which I ended up asking to all the dads and ended up really encouraging me to write this story down in a book. And that was, \"What's the one piece of advice you would give to my girls?\"And Jeff's advice was, \"Be a traveller, not a tourist. Get off the bus. Seek out what's different. Approach the cow.\" \"So it's 10 years from now,\" I said, \"and my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad, and I'm not here. What would you tell them?\" He said, \"I would approach this journey as a young child might approach a mud puddle. You can bend over and look at your reflection in the mirror and maybe run your finger and make a small ripple, or you can jump in and thrash around and see what it feels like, what it smells like.\" And as he talked he had that glint in his eye that I first saw back in Holland \u2014 the glint that says, \"Let's go cow tipping,\" even though we never did tip the cow, even though no one tips the cow, even though cows don't sleep standing up. He said, \"I want to see you back here girls, at the end of this experience, covered in mud.\"Two weeks after my diagnosis, a biopsy confirmed I had a seven-inch osteosarcoma in my left femur. Six hundred Americans a year get an osteosarcoma. Eighty-five percent are under 21. Only a hundred adults a year get one of these diseases. Twenty years ago, doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped, and there was a 15 percent survival rate. And then in the 1980's, they determined that one particular cocktail of chemo could be effective, and within weeks I had started that regimen. And since we are in a medical room, I went through four and a half months of chemo. Actually I had Cisplatin, Doxorubicin and very high-dose Methotrexate.And then I had a 15-hour surgery in which my surgeon, Dr. John Healey at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York, took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium. And if you did see the Sanjay special, you saw these enormous screws that they screwed into my pelvis. Then he took my fibula from my calf, cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh, where it now lives. And what he actually did was he de-vascularized it from my calf and re-vascularized it in my thigh and then connected it to the good parts of my knee and my hip. And then he took out a third of my quadriceps muscle. This is a surgery so rare only two human beings have survived it before me. And my reward for surviving it was to go back for four more months of chemo. It was, as we said in my house, a lost year.Because in those opening weeks, we all had nightmares. And one night I had a nightmare that I was walking through my house, sat at my desk and saw photographs of someone else's children sitting on my desk. And I remember a particular one night that, when you told that story of \u2014 I don't know where you are Dr. Nuland \u2014 of William Sloane Coffin \u2014 it made me think of it. Because I was in the hospital after, I think it was my fourth round of chemo when my numbers went to zero, and I had basically no immune system. And they put me in an infectious disease ward at the hospital. And anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body. And one night I got a call from my mother-in-law that my daughters, at that time three and a half, were missing me and feeling my absence. And I hung up the phone, and I put my face in my hands, and I screamed this silent scream. And what you said, Dr. Nuland \u2014 I don't know where you are \u2014 made me think of this today. Because the thought that came to my mind was that the feeling that I had was like a primal scream.And what was so striking \u2014 and one of the messages I want to leave you here with today \u2014 is the experience. As I became less and less human \u2014 and at this moment in my life, I was probably 30 pounds less than I am right now. Of course, I had no hair and no immune system. They were actually putting blood inside my body. At that moment I was less and less human, I was also, at the same time, maybe the most human I've ever been. And what was so striking about that time was, instead of repulsing people, I was actually proving to be a magnet for people. People were incredibly drawn. When my wife and I had kids, we thought it would be all-hands-on-deck. Instead, it was everybody running the other way. And when I had cancer, we thought it'd be everybody running the other way. Instead, it was all-hands-on-deck. And when people came to me, rather than being incredibly turned off by what they saw \u2014 I was like a living ghost \u2014 they were incredibly moved to talk about what was going on in their own lives.Cancer, I found, is a passport to intimacy. It is an invitation, maybe even a mandate, to enter the most vital arenas of human life, the most sensitive and the most frightening, the ones that we never want to go to, but when we do go there, we feel incredibly transformed when we do. And this also happened to my girls as they began to see, and, we thought, maybe became an ounce more compassionate. One day, my daughter Tybee, Tybee came to me, and she said, \"I have so much love for you in my body, daddy, I can't stop giving you hugs and kisses. And when I have no more love left, I just drink milk, because that's where love comes from.\" (Laughter) And one night my daughter Eden came to me. And as I lifted my leg out of bed, she reached for my crutches and handed them to me. In fact, if I cling to one memory of this year, it would be walking down a darkened hallway with five spongy fingers grasping the handle underneath my hand. I didn't need the crutch anymore, I was walking on air.And one of the profound things that happened was this act of actually connecting to all these people. And it made me think \u2014 and I'll just note for the record \u2014 one word that I've only heard once actually was when we were all doing Tony Robbins yoga yesterday \u2014 the one word that has not been mentioned in this seminar actually is the word \"friend.\" And yet from everything we've been talking about \u2014 compliance, or addiction, or weight loss \u2014 we now know that community is important, and yet it's one thing we don't actually bring in. And there was something incredibly profound about sitting down with my closest friends and telling them what they meant to me. And one of the things that I learned is that over time, particularly men, who used to be non-communicative, are becoming more and more communicative. And that particularly happened \u2014 there was one in my life \u2014 is this Council of Dads that Linda said, what we were talking about, it's like what the moms talk about at school drop-off.And no one captures this modern manhood to me more than David Black. Now David is my literary agent. He's about five-foot three and a half on a good day, standing fully upright in cowboy boots. And on kind of the manly-male front, he answers the phone \u2014 I can say this I guess because you've done it here \u2014 he answers the phone, \"Yo, motherfucker.\" He gives boring speeches about obscure bottles of wine, and on his 50th birthday he bought a convertible sports car \u2014 although, like a lot of men, he's impatient; he bought it on his 49th. But like a lot of modern men, he hugs, he bakes, he leaves work early to coach Little League. Someone asked me if he cried when I asked him to be in the council of dads. I was like, \"David cries when you invite him to take a walk.\" (Laughter) But he's a literary agent, which means he's a broker of dreams in a world where most dreams don't come true. And this is what we wanted him to capture \u2014 what it means to have setbacks and then aspirations. And I said, \"What's the most valuable thing you can give to a dreamer?\" And he said, \"A belief in themselves.\" \"But when I came to see you,\" I said, \"I didn't believe in myself. I was at a wall.\" He said, \"I don't see the wall,\" and I'm telling you the same, Don't see the wall. You may encounter one from time to time, but you've got to find a way to get over it, around it, or through it. But whatever you do, don't succumb to it. Don't give in to the wall.My home is not far from the Brooklyn Bridge, and during the year and a half I was on crutches, it became a sort of symbol to me. So one day near the end of my journey, I said, \"Come on girls, let's take a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.\" We set out on crutches. I was on crutches, my wife was next to me, my girls were doing these rockstar poses up ahead. And because walking was one of the first things I lost, I spent most of that year thinking about this most elemental of human acts. Walking upright, we are told, is the threshold of what made us human. And yet, for the four million years humans have been walking upright, the act is essentially unchanged. As my physical therapist likes to say, \"Every step is a tragedy waiting to happen.\" You nearly fall with one leg, then you catch yourself with the other. And the biggest consequence of walking on crutches \u2014 as I did for a year and a half \u2014 is that you walk slower. You hurry, you get where you're going, but you get there alone. You go slow, you get where you're going, but you get there with this community you built along the way.At the risk of admission, I was never nicer than the year I was on crutches. 200 years ago, a new type of pedestrian appeared in Paris. He was called a \"flaneur,\" one who wanders the arcades. And it was the custom of those flaneurs to show they were men of leisure by taking turtles for walks and letting the reptile set the pace. And I just love this ode to slow moving. And it's become my own motto for my girls. Take a walk with a turtle. Behold the world in pause. And this idea of pausing may be the single biggest lesson I took from my journey.There's a quote from Moses on the side of the Liberty Bell, and it comes from a passage in the book of Leviticus, that every seven years you should let the land lay fallow. And every seven sets of seven years, the land gets an extra year of rest during which time all families are reunited and people surrounded with the ones they love. That 50th year is called the jubilee year, and it's the origin of that term. And though I'm shy of 50, it captures my own experience. My lost year was my jubilee year. By laying fallow, I planted the seeds for a healthier future and was reunited with the ones I love.Come the one year anniversary of my journey, I went to see my surgeon, Dr. John Healey \u2014 and by the way, Healey, great name for a doctor. He's the president of the International Society of Limb Salvage, which is the least euphemistic term I've ever heard. And I said, \"Dr. Healey, if my daughters come to you one day and say, 'What should I learn from my daddy's story?' what would you tell them?\" He said, \"I would tell them what I know, and that is everybody dies, but not everybody lives. I want you to live.\"I wrote a letter to my girls that appears at the end of my book, \"The Council of Dads,\" and I listed these lessons, a few of which you've heard here today: Approach the cow, pack your flipflops, don't see the wall, live the questions, harvest miracles. As I looked at this list \u2014 to me it was sort of like a psalm book of living \u2014 I realized, we may have done it for our girls, but it really changed us. And that is, the secret of the Council of Dads, is that my wife and I did this in an attempt to help our daughters, but it really changed us.So I stand here today as you see now, walking without crutches or a cane. And last week I had my 18-month scans. And as you all know, anybody with cancer has to get follow-up scans. In my case it's quarterly. And all the collective minds in this room, I dare say, can never find a solution for scan-xiety. As I was going there, I was wondering, what would I say depending on what happened here. I got good news that day, and I stand here today cancer-free, walking without aid and hobbling forward.And I just want to mention briefly in passing \u2014 I'm past my time limit \u2014 but I just want to briefly mention in passing that one of the nice things that can come out of a conference like this is, at a similar meeting, back in the spring, Anne Wojcicki heard about our story and very quickly \u2014 in a span of three weeks \u2014 put the full resources of 23andMe, and we announced an initiative in July to get to decode the genome of anybody, a living person with a heart tissue, bone sarcoma. And she told me last night, in the three months since we've done it, we've gotten 300 people who've contributed to this program. And the epidemiologists here will tell you, that's half the number of people who get the disease in one year in the United States. So if you go to 23andMe, or if you go to councilofdads.com, you can click on a link. And we encourage anybody to join this effort.But I'll just close what I've been talking about by leaving you with this message: May you find an excuse to reach out to some long-lost pal, or to that college roommate, or to some person you may have turned away from. May you find a mud puddle to jump in someplace, or find a way to get over, around, or through any wall that stands between you and one of your dreams. And every now and then, find a friend, find a turtle, and take a long, slow walk.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1062, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nMy story actually began when I was four years old\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nand my family moved to a new neighborhood\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nin our hometown of Savannah, Georgia.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nAnd this was the 1960s\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nwhen actually all the streets in this neighborhood\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nwere named after Confederate war generals.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nWe lived on Robert E. Lee Boulevard.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nAnd when I was five,\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nmy parents gave me an orange Schwinn Sting-Ray bicycle.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nIt had a swooping banana seat and those ape hanger handlebars\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nthat made the rider look like an orangutan.\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nThat's why they were called ape hangers.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nThey were actually modeled on hotrod motorcycles of the 1960s,\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nwhich I'm sure my mom didn't know.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nAnd one day I was exploring this cul-de-sac\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nhidden away a few streets away.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nAnd I came back,\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nand I wanted to turn around and get back to that street more quickly,\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nso I decided to turn around in this big street\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nthat intersected our neighborhood,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nand wham! I was hit by a passing sedan.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nMy mangled body flew in one direction,\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nmy mangled bike flew in the other.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nAnd I lay on the pavement stretching over that yellow line,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nand one of my neighbors came running over.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\n\"Andy, Andy, how are you doing?\" she said, using the name of my older brother.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\n\"I'm Bruce,\" I said, and promptly passed out.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nI broke my left femur that day --\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nit's the largest bone in your body --\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nand spent the next two months in a body cast\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nthat went from my chin to the tip of my toe\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nto my right knee,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nand a steel bar went from my right knee\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nto my left ankle.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nAnd for the next 38 years,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nthat accident was the only medically interesting thing\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nthat ever happened to me.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nIn fact, I made a living by walking.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nI traveled around the world, entered different cultures,\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nwrote a series of books about my travels,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nincluding \"Walking the Bible.\"\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nI hosted a television show by that name\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\non PBS.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nI was, for all the world, the \"walking guy.\"\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nUntil, in May 2008,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\na routine visit to my doctor\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nand a routine blood test\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nproduced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nthat something might be wrong with my bones.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nAnd my doctor, on a whim, sent me to get a full-body bone scan,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nwhich showed that there was some growth in my left leg.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nThat sent me to an X-ray, then to an MRI.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nAnd one afternoon, I got a call from my doctor.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\n\"The tumor in your leg\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nis not consistent with a benign tumor.\"\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nI stopped walking,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nand it took my mind a second to convert that double negative\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\ninto a much more horrifying negative.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nI have cancer.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nAnd to think that the tumor was in the same bone,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nin the same place in my body\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nas the accident 38 years earlier --\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nit seemed like too much of a coincidence.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nSo that afternoon, I went back to my house,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nand my three year-old identical twin daughters, Eden and Tybee Feiler,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\ncame running to meet me.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nThey'd just turned three,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nand they were into all things pink and purple.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nIn fact, we called them Pinkalicious and Purplicious --\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nalthough I must say, our favorite nickname\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\noccurred on their birthday, April 15th.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nWhen they were born at 6:14 and 6:46\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\non April 15, 2005,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nour otherwise grim, humorless doctor looked at his watch,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nand was like, \"Hmm, April 15th -- tax day.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nEarly filer and late filer.\"\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nThe next day I came to see him. I was like, \"Doctor, that was a really good joke.\"\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAnd he was like, \"You're the writer, kid.\"\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nAnyway -- so they had just turned three,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nand they came and they were doing this dance they had just made up\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nwhere they were twirling faster and faster until they tumbled to the ground,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nlaughing with all the glee in the world.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nI crumbled.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nI kept imagining all the walks I might not take with them,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nthe art projects I might not mess up,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nthe boyfriends I might not scowl at,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nthe aisles I might not walk down.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nWould they wonder who I was, I thought.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nWould they yearn for my approval,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nmy love, my voice?\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nA few days later, I woke with an idea\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nof how I might give them that voice.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nI would reach out to six men\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nfrom all parts of my life\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nand ask them to be present\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nin the passages of my daughters' lives.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\n\"I believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives,\"\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nI wrote these men.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\n\"They'll have loving families and welcoming homes,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nbut they may not have me.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nThey may not have their dad.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nWill you help be their dad?\"\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nAnd I said to myself\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nI would call this group of men \"the Council of Dads.\"\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nNow as soon as I had this idea,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nI decided I wouldn't tell my wife. Okay.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nShe's a very upbeat,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nnaturally excited person.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nThere's this idea in this culture -- I don't have to tell you --\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nthat you sort of \"happy\" your way through a problem.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nWe should focus on the positive.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nMy wife, as I said, she grew up outside of Boston.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nShe's got a big smile. She's got a big personality.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nShe's got big hair --\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nalthough, she told me recently, I can't say she has big hair,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nbecause if I say she has big hair,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\npeople will think she's from Texas.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAnd it's apparently okay to marry a boy from Georgia,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nbut not to have hair from Texas.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nAnd actually, in her defense, if she were here right now,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nshe would point out that, when we got married in Georgia,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nthere were three questions\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\non the marriage certificate license,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nthe third of which was, \"Are you related?\"\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nI said, \"Look, in Georgia at least we want to know.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nIn Arkansas they don't even ask.\"\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nWhat I didn't tell her is, if she said, \"Yes,\" you could jump.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nYou don't need the 30-day waiting period.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nBecause you don't need the get-to-know-you session at that point.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nSo I wasn't going to tell her about this idea,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nbut the next day I couldn't control myself, I told her.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nAnd she loved the idea,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nbut she quickly started rejecting my nominees.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nShe was like, \"Well, I love him, but I would never ask him for advice.\"\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nSo it turned out that starting a council of dads\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nwas a very efficient way to find out\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nwhat my wife really thought of my friends.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nSo we decided that we needed a set of rules,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nand we came up with a number.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nAnd the first one was no family, only friends.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nWe thought our family would already be there.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nSecond, men only.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nWe were trying to fill the dad-space in the girls' lives.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nAnd then third, sort of a dad for every side.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nWe kind of went through my personality\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nand tried to get a dad who represented each different thing.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nSo what happened was I wrote a letter to each of these men.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd rather than send it,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nI decided to read it to them in person.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nLinda, my wife, joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nI sort of friend-married each of these guys.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nAnd the first of these guys was Jeff Schumlin.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nNow Jeff led this trip I took to Europe\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nwhen I graduated from high school in the early 1980s.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nAnd on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nAnd I snuck out behind,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nand there was a moat, a fence and a field of cows.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nAnd Jeff came up beside me and said,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\n\"So, have you ever been cow tipping?\"\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nI was like, \"Cow tipping?\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nHe was like, \"Yeah. Cows sleep standing up.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nSo if you approach them from behind, down wind,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nyou can push them over and they go thud in the mud.\"\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nSo before I had a chance to determine whether this was right or not,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nwe had jumped the moat, we had climbed the fence,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nwe were tiptoeing through the dung\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nand approaching some poor, dozing cow.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nSo a few weeks after my diagnosis,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nwe went up to Vermont,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nand I decided to put Jeff as the first person in the Council of Dads.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nAnd we went to this apple orchard, and I read him this letter.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\n\"Will you help be their dad?\"\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAnd I got to the end -- he was crying and I was crying --\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nand then he looked at me, and he said, \"Yes.\"\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nI was like, \"Yes?\"\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nI kind of had forgotten there was a question at the heart of my letter.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nAnd frankly, although I keep getting asked this,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nit never occurred to me that anybody would turn me down\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nunder the circumstances.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAnd then I asked him a question, which I ended up asking to all the dads\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nand ended up really encouraging me to write this story down in a book.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nAnd that was, \"What's the one piece of advice\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nyou would give to my girls?\"\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nAnd Jeff's advice was,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\n\"Be a traveller, not a tourist.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nGet off the bus. Seek out what's different.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nApproach the cow.\"\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\n\"So it's 10 years from now,\" I said,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\n\"and my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad, and I'm not here.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nWhat would you tell them?\"\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nHe said, \"I would approach this journey\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nas a young child might approach a mud puddle.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nYou can bend over and look at your reflection in the mirror\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nand maybe run your finger and make a small ripple,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nor you can jump in and thrash around\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nand see what it feels like, what it smells like.\"\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nAnd as he talked he had that glint in his eye\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nthat I first saw back in Holland --\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nthe glint that says, \"Let's go cow tipping,\"\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\neven though we never did tip the cow,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\neven though no one tips the cow,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\neven though cows don't sleep standing up.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nHe said, \"I want to see you back here girls, at the end of this experience,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\ncovered in mud.\"\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nTwo weeks after my diagnosis, a biopsy confirmed\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nI had a seven-inch osteosarcoma\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nin my left femur.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nSix hundred Americans a year get an osteosarcoma.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nEighty-five percent are under 21.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nOnly a hundred adults a year\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nget one of these diseases.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nTwenty years ago, doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped,\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nand there was a 15 percent survival rate.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nAnd then in the 1980's, they determined\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nthat one particular cocktail of chemo could be effective,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nand within weeks I had started that regimen.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nAnd since we are in a medical room,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nI went through four and a half months of chemo.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nActually I had Cisplatin, Doxorubicin\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nand very high-dose Methotrexate.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nAnd then I had a 15-hour surgery\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nin which my surgeon, Dr. John Healey\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nat Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\ntook out my left femur\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nand replaced it with titanium.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nAnd if you did see the Sanjay special,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nyou saw these enormous screws\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nthat they screwed into my pelvis.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nThen he took my fibula from my calf,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\ncut it out and then relocated it to my thigh,\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nwhere it now lives.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nAnd what he actually did was he de-vascularized it from my calf\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nand re-vascularized it in my thigh\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nand then connected it\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nto the good parts of my knee and my hip.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nAnd then he took out a third of my quadriceps muscle.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nThis is a surgery so rare\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nonly two human beings have survived it before me.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nAnd my reward for surviving it\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nwas to go back for four more months of chemo.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nIt was, as we said in my house,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\na lost year.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nBecause in those opening weeks, we all had nightmares.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nAnd one night I had a nightmare that I was walking through my house,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nsat at my desk and saw photographs of someone else's children\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nsitting on my desk.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nAnd I remember a particular one night that, when you told that story of --\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nI don't know where you are Dr. Nuland --\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nof William Sloane Coffin --\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nit made me think of it.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nBecause I was in the hospital after, I think it was my fourth round of chemo\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nwhen my numbers went to zero, and I had basically no immune system.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nAnd they put me in an infectious disease ward at the hospital.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nAnd anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nand cover all of the extraneous parts of their body.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nAnd one night I got a call from my mother-in-law\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nthat my daughters, at that time three and a half,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nwere missing me and feeling my absence.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nAnd I hung up the phone,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nand I put my face in my hands,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nand I screamed this silent scream.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nAnd what you said, Dr. Nuland -- I don't know where you are --\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nmade me think of this today.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nBecause the thought that came to my mind\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nwas that the feeling that I had\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nwas like a primal scream.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nAnd what was so striking --\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nand one of the messages I want to leave you here with today --\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nis the experience.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nAs I became less and less human --\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nand at this moment in my life, I was probably 30 pounds less than I am right now.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nOf course, I had no hair and no immune system.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nThey were actually putting blood inside my body.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAt that moment I was less and less human,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nI was also, at the same time,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nmaybe the most human I've ever been.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nAnd what was so striking about that time\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nwas, instead of repulsing people,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nI was actually proving to be a magnet for people.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nPeople were incredibly drawn.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nWhen my wife and I had kids, we thought it would be all-hands-on-deck.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nInstead, it was everybody running the other way.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nAnd when I had cancer, we thought it'd be everybody running the other way.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nInstead, it was all-hands-on-deck.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nAnd when people came to me,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nrather than being incredibly turned off by what they saw --\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nI was like a living ghost --\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nthey were incredibly moved\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nto talk about what was going on in their own lives.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nCancer, I found, is a passport to intimacy.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nIt is an invitation, maybe even a mandate,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nto enter the most vital arenas of human life,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nthe most sensitive and the most frightening,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nthe ones that we never want to go to,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nbut when we do go there,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nwe feel incredibly transformed when we do.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nAnd this also happened to my girls as they began to see,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand, we thought, maybe became an ounce more compassionate.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nOne day, my daughter Tybee,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nTybee came to me, and she said, \"I have so much love for you in my body, daddy,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nI can't stop giving you hugs and kisses.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nAnd when I have no more love left, I just drink milk,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nbecause that's where love comes from.\"\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nAnd one night my daughter Eden came to me.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nAnd as I lifted my leg out of bed,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nshe reached for my crutches and handed them to me.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nIn fact, if I cling to one memory of this year,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nit would be walking down a darkened hallway\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nwith five spongy fingers\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\ngrasping the handle underneath my hand.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nI didn't need the crutch anymore,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nI was walking on air.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nAnd one of the profound things that happened\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nwas this act of actually connecting to all these people.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nAnd it made me think -- and I'll just note for the record --\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\none word that I've only heard once actually\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nwas when we were all doing Tony Robbins yoga yesterday --\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nthe one word that has not been mentioned in this seminar actually\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nis the word \"friend.\"\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nAnd yet from everything we've been talking about --\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\ncompliance, or addiction, or weight loss --\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nwe now know that community is important,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nand yet it's one thing we don't actually bring in.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nAnd there was something incredibly profound\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nabout sitting down with my closest friends\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nand telling them what they meant to me.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nAnd one of the things that I learned is that over time,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nparticularly men, who used to be non-communicative,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nare becoming more and more communicative.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nAnd that particularly happened -- there was one in my life --\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nis this Council of Dads\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nthat Linda said, what we were talking about,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nit's like what the moms talk about at school drop-off.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nAnd no one captures this modern manhood to me\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nmore than David Black.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nNow David is my literary agent.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nHe's about five-foot three and a half on a good day,\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nstanding fully upright in cowboy boots.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nAnd on kind of the manly-male front, he answers the phone --\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nI can say this I guess because you've done it here --\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nhe answers the phone, \"Yo, motherfucker.\"\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nHe gives boring speeches about obscure bottles of wine,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nand on his 50th birthday he bought a convertible sports car --\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nalthough, like a lot of men, he's impatient; he bought it on his 49th.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nBut like a lot of modern men, he hugs, he bakes,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nhe leaves work early to coach Little League.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nSomeone asked me if he cried when I asked him to be in the council of dads.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nI was like, \"David cries when you invite him to take a walk.\"\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nBut he's a literary agent,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nwhich means he's a broker of dreams in a world where most dreams don't come true.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nAnd this is what we wanted him to capture --\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nwhat it means to have setbacks and then aspirations.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nAnd I said, \"What's the most valuable thing you can give to a dreamer?\"\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nAnd he said, \"A belief in themselves.\"\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\n\"But when I came to see you,\" I said, \"I didn't believe in myself.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nI was at a wall.\"\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nHe said, \"I don't see the wall,\" and I'm telling you the same,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nDon't see the wall.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nYou may encounter one from time to time,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nbut you've got to find a way to get over it, around it, or through it.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nBut whatever you do, don't succumb to it.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nDon't give in to the wall.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nMy home is not far from the Brooklyn Bridge,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nand during the year and a half I was on crutches,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nit became a sort of symbol to me.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nSo one day near the end of my journey,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nI said, \"Come on girls, let's take a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.\"\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nWe set out on crutches.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nI was on crutches, my wife was next to me,\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nmy girls were doing these rockstar poses up ahead.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nAnd because walking was one of the first things I lost,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nI spent most of that year\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nthinking about this most elemental of human acts.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nWalking upright, we are told,\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nis the threshold of what made us human.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nAnd yet, for the four million years humans have been walking upright,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nthe act is essentially unchanged.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nAs my physical therapist likes to say,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\n\"Every step is a tragedy waiting to happen.\"\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nYou nearly fall with one leg,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nthen you catch yourself with the other.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nAnd the biggest consequence of walking on crutches --\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nas I did for a year and a half --\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nis that you walk slower.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nYou hurry,\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nyou get where you're going, but you get there alone.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nYou go slow, you get where you're going,\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nbut you get there with this community\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nyou built along the way.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nAt the risk of admission, I was never nicer\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nthan the year I was on crutches.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\n200 years ago,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\na new type of pedestrian appeared in Paris.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nHe was called a \"flaneur,\" one who wanders the arcades.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nAnd it was the custom of those flaneurs\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nto show they were men of leisure\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nby taking turtles for walks\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nand letting the reptile set the pace.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nAnd I just love this ode to slow moving.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nAnd it's become my own motto for my girls.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nTake a walk with a turtle.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nBehold the world in pause.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nAnd this idea of pausing\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nmay be the single biggest lesson I took from my journey.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nThere's a quote from Moses\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.958\non the side of the Liberty Bell,\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nand it comes from a passage in the book of Leviticus,\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nthat every seven years you should let the land lay fallow.\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nAnd every seven sets of seven years,\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nthe land gets an extra year of rest\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nduring which time all families are reunited\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nand people surrounded with the ones they love.\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nThat 50th year is called the jubilee year,\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nand it's the origin of that term.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nAnd though I'm shy of 50,\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nit captures my own experience.\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nMy lost year was my jubilee year.\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nBy laying fallow,\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nI planted the seeds for a healthier future\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nand was reunited with the ones I love.\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nCome the one year anniversary of my journey,\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nI went to see my surgeon, Dr. John Healey --\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nand by the way, Healey, great name for a doctor.\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nHe's the president of the International Society of Limb Salvage,\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nwhich is the least euphemistic term I've ever heard.\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nAnd I said, \"Dr. Healey, if my daughters come to you one day\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nand say, 'What should I learn from my daddy's story?'\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nwhat would you tell them?\"\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nHe said, \"I would tell them what I know,\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nand that is everybody dies,\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nbut not everybody lives.\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nI want you to live.\"\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nI wrote a letter to my girls\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nthat appears at the end of my book, \"The Council of Dads,\"\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nand I listed these lessons,\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:57.958\na few of which you've heard here today:\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nApproach the cow, pack your flipflops,\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:01.958\ndon't see the wall,\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nlive the questions,\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nharvest miracles.\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nAs I looked at this list -- to me it was sort of like a psalm book of living --\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nI realized, we may have done it for our girls,\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nbut it really changed us.\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:15.958\nAnd that is, the secret of the Council of Dads,\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nis that my wife and I did this\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nin an attempt to help our daughters,\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nbut it really changed us.\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nSo I stand here

00:18:32.958\nAnd as you all know,\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nanybody with cancer has to get follow-up scans.\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nIn my case it's quarterly.\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:38.958\nAnd all the collective minds in this room, I dare say,\n\n00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:41.958\ncan never find a solution for scan-xiety.\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nAs I was going there, I was wondering, what would I say\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:45.958\ndepending on what happened here.\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nI got good news that day,\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nand I stand here today cancer-free,\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nwalking without aid\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nand hobbling forward.\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:59.958\nAnd I just want to mention briefly in passing -- I'm past my time limit --\n\n00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nbut I just want to briefly mention in passing\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:03.958\nthat one of the nice things that can come out of a conference like this\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nis, at a similar meeting,\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nback in the spring,\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nAnne Wojcicki heard about our story\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nand very quickly -- in a span of three weeks --\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:13.958\nput the full resources of 23andMe,\n\n00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:16.958\nand we announced an initiative in July\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nto get to decode the genome\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nof anybody, a living person\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nwith a heart tissue, bone sarcoma.\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:27.958\nAnd she told me last night, in the three months since we've done it,\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:30.958\nwe've gotten 300 people who've contributed to this program.\n\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nAnd the epidemiologists here will tell you,\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:34.958\nthat's half the number of people who get the disease\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:36.958\nin one year in the United States.\n\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:38.958\nSo if you go to 23andMe,\n\n00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:41.958\nor if you go to councilofdads.com, you can click on a link.\n\n00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:44.958\nAnd we encourage anybody to join this effort.\n\n00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:47.958\nBut I'll just close what I've been talking about\n\n00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:49.958\nby leaving you with this message:\n\n00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:51.958\nMay you find an excuse to reach out to some long-lost pal,\n\n00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:53.958\nor to that college roommate,\n\n00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:55.958\nor to some person you may have turned away from.\n\n00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:58.958\nMay you find a mud puddle to jump in someplace,\n\n00:19:58.958 --> 00:20:00.958\nor find a way to get over, around, or through any wall\n\n00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:03.958\nthat stands between you and one of your dreams.\n\n00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:05.958\nAnd every now and then,\n\n00:20:05.958 --> 00:20:07.958\nfind a friend, find a turtle,\n\n00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:10.958\nand take a long, slow walk.\n\n00:20:10.958 -->

"https://www.ted.com/talks/kate_orff_oysters_as_architecture", "transcript": "I am passionate about the American landscape and how the physical form of the land, from the great Central Valley of California to the bedrock of Manhattan, has really shaped our history and our character. But one thing is clear. In the last 100 years alone, our country \u2014 and this is a sprawl map of America \u2014 our country has systematically flattened and homogenized the landscape to the point where we've forgotten our relationship with the plants and animals that live alongside us and the dirt beneath our feet. And so, how I see my work contributing is sort of trying to literally re-imagine these connections and physically rebuild them. This graph represents what we're dealing with now in the built environment. And it's really a conflux of urban population rising, biodiversity plummeting and also, of course, sea levels rising and climate changing.So when I also think about design, I think about trying to rework and re-engage the lines on this graph in a more productive way. And you can see from the arrow here indicating \"you are here,\" I'm trying to sort of blend and meld these two very divergent fields of urbanism and ecology, and sort of bring them together in an exciting new way. So the era of big infrastructure is over. I mean, these sort of top-down, mono-functional, capital-intensive solutions are really not going to cut it. We need new tools and new approaches. Similarly, the idea of architecture as this sort of object in the field, devoid of context, is really not the \u2014 excuse me, it's fairly blatant \u2014 is really not the approach that we need to take. So we need new stories, new heroes and new tools.So now I want to introduce you to my new hero in the global climate change war, and that is the eastern oyster. So, albeit a very small creature and very modest, this creature is incredible, because it can agglomerate into these mega-reef structures. It can grow; you can grow it; and \u2014 did I mention? \u2014 it's quite tasty. So the oyster was the basis for a manifesto-like urban design project that I did about the New York Harbor called \"oyster-tecture.\" And the core idea of oyster-tecture is to harness the biological power of mussels, eelgrass and oysters \u2014 species that live in the harbor \u2014 and, at the same time, harness the power of people who live in the community towards making change now.Here's a map of my city, New York City, showing inundation in red. And what's circled is the site that I'm going to talk about, the Gowanus Canal and Governors Island. If you look here at this map, showing everything in blue is out in the water, and everything in yellow is upland. But you can see, even just intuit, from this map, that the harbor has dredged and flattened, and went from a rich, three-dimensional mosaic to flat muck in really a matter of years. Another set of views of actually the Gowanus Canal itself. Now the Gowanus is particularly smelly \u2014 I will admit it. There are problems of sewage overflow and contamination, but I would also argue that almost every city has this exact condition, and it's a condition that we're all facing. And here's a map of that condition, showing the contaminants in yellow and green, exacerbated by this new flow of storm-surge and sea-level rise. So we really had a lot to deal with.When we started this project, one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there. And you can see from this map, there's this incredible geographical signature of a series of islands that were out in the harbor and a matrix of salt marshes and beaches that served as natural wave attenuation for the upland settlement. We also learned at this time that you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate in the Gowanus Canal itself. So our concept is really this back-to-the-future concept, harnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern. And the idea has two core stages. One is to develop a new artificial ecology, a reef out in the harbor, that would then protect new settlement patterns inland and the Gowanus. Because if you have cleaner water and slower water, you can imagine a new way of living with that water.So the project really addresses these three core issues in a new and exciting way, I think. Here we are, back to our hero, the oyster. And again, it's this incredibly exciting animal. It accepts algae and detritus in one end, and through this beautiful, glamorous set of stomach organs, out the other end comes cleaner water. And one oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water a day. Oyster reefs also covered about a quarter of our harbor and were capable of filtering water in the harbor in a matter of days. They were key in our culture and our economy. Basically, New York was built on the backs of oystermen, and our streets were literally built over oyster shells. This image is an image of an oyster cart, which is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today. So again, we got the short end of the deal there. (Laughter) Finally, oysters can attenuate and agglomerate onto each other and form these amazing natural reef structures. They really become nature's wave attenuators. And they become the bedrock of any harbor ecosystem. Many, many species depend on them.So we were inspired by the oyster, but I was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster. It can move from a fertilized egg to a spat, which is when they're floating through the water, and when they're ready to attach onto another oyster, to an adult male oyster or female oyster, in a number of weeks. We reinterpreted this life cycle on the scale of our sight and took the Gowanus as a giant oyster nursery where oysters would be grown up in the Gowanus, then paraded down in their spat stage and seeded out on the Bayridge Reef. And so the core idea here was to hit the reset button and regenerate an ecology over time that was regenerative and cleaning and productive.How does the reef work? Well, it's very, very simple. A core concept here is that climate change isn't something that \u2014 the answers won't land down from the Moon. And with a $20 billion price tag, we should simply start and get to work with what we have now and what's in front of us. So this image is simply showing \u2014 it's a field of marine piles interconnected with this woven fuzzy rope. What is fuzzy rope, you ask? It's just that; it's this very inexpensive thing, available practically at your hardware store, and it's very cheap. So we imagine that we would actually potentially even host a bake sale to start our new project. (Laughter) So in the studio, rather than drawing, we began to learn how to knit. The concept was to really knit this rope together and develop this new soft infrastructure for the oysters to grow on. You can see in the diagram how it grows over time from an infrastructural space into a new public urban space. And that grows over time dynamically with the threat of climate change.It also creates this incredibly interesting, I think, new amphibious public space, where you can imagine working, you can imagine recreating in a new way. In the end, what we realized we were making was a new blue-green watery park for the next watery century \u2014 an amphibious park, if you will. So get your Tevas on. So you can imagine scuba diving here. This is an image of high school students, scuba divers that we worked with on our team. So you can imagine a sort of new manner of living with a new relationship with the water, and also a hybridizing of recreational and science programs in terms of monitoring.Another new vocabulary word for the brave new world: this is the word \"flupsy\" \u2014 it's short for \"floating upwelling system.\" And this glorious, readily available device is basically a floating raft with an oyster nursery below. So the water is churned through this raft. You can see the eight chambers on the side host little baby oysters and essentially force-feed them. So rather than having 10 oysters, you have 10,000 oysters. And then those spat are then seeded. Here's the Gowanus future with the oyster rafts on the shorelines \u2014 the flupsification of the Gowanus. New word. And also showing oyster gardening for the community along its edges. And finally, how much fun it would be to watch the flupsy parade and cheer on the oyster spats as they go down to the reef.I get asked two questions about this project. One is: why isn't it happening now? And the second one is: when can we eat the oysters? And the answer is: not yet, they're working. But we imagine, with our calculations, that by 2050, you might be able to sink your teeth into a Gowanus oyster.To conclude, this is just one cross-section of one piece of city, but my dream is, my hope is, that when you all go back to your own cities that we can start to work together and collaborate on remaking and reforming a new urban landscape towards a more sustainable, a more livable and a more delicious future.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1064, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nI am passionate about the American

incredible geographical signature\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nof a series of islands\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nthat were out in the harbor\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nand a matrix of salt marshes and beaches\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nthat served as natural wave attenuation\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nfor the upland settlement.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nWe also learned at this time\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nthat you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nin the Gowanus Canal itself.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nSo our concept is really this back-to-the-future concept,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nharnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAnd the idea has two core stages.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nOne is to develop a new artificial ecology,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\na reef out in the harbor,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nthat would then protect new settlement patterns\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\ninland and the Gowanus.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nBecause if you have cleaner water and slower water,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nyou can imagine a new way of living with that water.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nSo the project really addresses these three core issues\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nin a new and exciting way, I think.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nHere we are, back to our hero, the oyster.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nAnd again, it's this incredibly exciting animal.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nIt accepts algae and detritus in one end,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nand through this beautiful, glamorous\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nset of stomach organs,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nout the other end comes cleaner water.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nAnd one oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water a day.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nOyster reefs also covered\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nabout a quarter of our harbor\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nand were capable of filtering water in the harbor in a matter of days.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nThey were key in our culture and our economy.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nBasically, New York was built\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\non the backs of oystermen,\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nand our streets were literally built over oyster shells.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nThis image\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nis an image of an oyster cart,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nwhich is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nSo again, we got the short end of the deal there.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nFinally, oysters can attenuate\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nand agglomerate onto each other\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nand form these amazing natural reef structures.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nThey really become nature's wave attenuators.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nAnd they become the bedrock\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nof any harbor ecosystem.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nMany, many species depend on them.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nSo we were inspired by the oyster,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nbut I was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nIt can move from a fertilized egg\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nto a spat, which is when they're floating through the water,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nand when they're ready to attach onto another oyster,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nto an adult male oyster or female oyster,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nin a number of weeks.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nWe reinterpreted this life cycle\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\non the scale of our sight\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nand took the Gowanus\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nas a giant oyster nursery\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nwhere oysters would be grown up in the Gowanus,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nthen paraded down in their spat stage\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nand seeded out on the Bayridge Reef.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nAnd so the core idea here\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nwas to hit the reset button\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nand regenerate an ecology over time\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nthat was regenerative and cleaning\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nand productive.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nHow does the reef work? Well, it's very, very simple.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nA core concept here\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nis that climate change\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nisn't something that --\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nthe answers won't land down from the Moon.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd with a $20 billion price tag,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nwe should simply start and get to work with what we have now\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nand what's in front of us.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nSo this image is simply showing --\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nit's a field of marine piles\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\ninterconnected with this woven fuzzy rope.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nWhat is fuzzy rope, you ask?\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nIt's just that; it's this very inexpensive thing,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\navailable practically at your hardware store, and it's very cheap.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nSo we imagine that we would actually\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\npotentially even host a bake sale\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nto start our new project.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nSo in the studio, rather than drawing,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nwe began to learn how to knit.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nThe concept was to really knit this rope together\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nand develop this new soft infrastructure\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nfor the oysters to grow on.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nYou can see in the diagram how it grows over time\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nfrom an infrastructural space\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\ninto a new public urban space.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nAnd that grows over time dynamically\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nwith the threat of climate change.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nIt also creates this incredibly interesting, I think,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nnew amphibious public space,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nwhere you can imagine working,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nyou can imagine recreating in a new way.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nIn the end, what we realized we were making\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nwas a new blue-green watery park\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nfor the next watery century --\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nan amphibious park, if you will.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nSo get your Tevas on.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nSo you can imagine scuba diving here.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nThis is an image of high school students,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nscuba divers that we worked with on our team.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nSo you can imagine a sort of new manner of living\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nwith a new relationship with the water,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nand also a hybridizing of recreational and science programs\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nin terms of monitoring.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nAnother new vocabulary word for the brave new world:\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nthis is the word \"flupsy\" --\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nit's short for \"floating upwelling system.\"\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nAnd this glorious, readily available device\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nis basically a floating raft\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nwith an oyster nursery below.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nSo the water is churned through this raft.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nYou can see the eight chambers on the side\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nhost little baby oysters and essentially force-feed them.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nSo rather than having 10 oysters,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nyou have 10,000 oysters.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nAnd then those spat are then seeded.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nHere's the Gowanus future\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nwith the oyster rafts on the shorelines --\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nthe flupsification of the Gowanus.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nNew word.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nAnd also showing oyster gardening for the community\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nalong its edges.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nAnd finally, how much fun it would be\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nto watch the flupsy parade\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nand cheer on the oyster spats\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nas they go down to the reef.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nI get asked two questions about this project.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nOne is: why isn't it happening now?\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nAnd the second one is: when can we eat the oysters?\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nAnd the answer is: not yet, they're working.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nBut we imagine, with our calculations,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nthat by 2050,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nyou might be able to sink your teeth into a Gowanus oyster.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nTo conclude, this is just one cross-section\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nof one piece of city,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nbut my dream is, my hope is,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nthat when you all go back to your own cities\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nthat we can start to work together and collaborate\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\non remaking and reforming\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\na new urban landscape\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\ntowards a more sustainable, a more livable\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nand a more delicious future.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nThank you.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:57.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "We are makers", "duration": "707", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/dale_dougherty_we_are_makers", "transcript": "I'm going to have a pretty simple idea that I'm just going to tell you over and over until I get you to believe it, and that is all of us are makers. I really believe that. All of us are makers. We're born makers. We have this ability to make things, to grasp things with our hands. We use words like \"grasp\" metaphorically to also think about understanding things. We don't just live, but we make. We create things. Well I'm going to show you a group of makers from Maker Faire and various places. It doesn't come out particularly well, but that's a particularly tall bicycle. It's a scraper bike; it's called \u2014 from Oakland. And this is a particularly small scooter for a gentleman of this size. But he's trying to power it, or motorize it, with a drill. (Laughter) And the question he had is, \"Can I do it? Can it be done?\" Apparently it can. So makers are enthusiasts; they're amateurs; they're people who love doing what they do. They don't always even know why they're doing it.We have begun organizing makers at our Maker Faire. There was one held in Detroit here last summer, and it will be held again next summer, at the Henry Ford. But we hold them in San Francisco \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 and in New York. And it's a fabulous event to just meet and talk to these people who make things and are there to just show them to you and talk about them and have a great conversation.(Video) Guy: I might get one of those.Dale Dougherty: These are electric muffins.Guy: Where did you guys get those?Muffin: Will you glide with us? (Guy: No.)DD: I know Ford has new electric vehicles coming out. We got there first.Lady: Will you glide with us?DD: This is something I call \"swinging in the rain.\" And you can barely see it, but it's \u2014 a controller at top cycles the water to fall just before and after you pass through the bottom of the arc. So imagine a kid: \"Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet? No, I didn't get wet. Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet?\" That's the experience of a clever ride. And of course, we have fashion. People are remaking things into fashion. I don't know if this is called a basket-bra, but it ought to be something like that. We have art students getting together, taking old radiator parts and doing an iron-pour to make something new out of it. They did that in the summer, and it was very warm.Now this one takes a little bit of explaining. You know what those are, right? Billy-Bob, or Billy Bass, or something like that. Now the background is \u2014 the guy who did this is a physicist. And here he'll explain a little bit about what it does.(Video) Richard Carter: I'm Richard Carter, and this is the Sashimi Tabernacle Choir.Choir: \u266b When you hold me in your arms \u266bDD: This is all computer-controlled in an old Volvo.Choir: \u266b I'm hooked on a feelin' \u266b \u266b I'm high on believin' \u266b \u266b That you're in love with me \u266bDD: So Richard came up from Houston last year to visit us in Detroit here and show the wonderful Sashimi Tabernacle Choir. So, are you a maker? How many people here would say you're a maker, if you raise your hand? That's a pretty good \u2014 but there's some of you out there that won't admit that you're makers. And again, think about it. You're makers of food; you're makers of shelter; you're makers of lots of different things, and partly what interests me today is you're makers of your own world, and particularly the role that technology has in your life. You're really a driver or a passenger \u2014 to use a Volkswagen phrase. Makers are in control. That's what fascinates them. That's why they do what they do. They want to figure out how things work; they want to get access to it; and they want to control it. They want to use it to their own purpose.Makers today, to some degree, are out on the edge. They're not mainstream. They're a little bit radical. They're a bit subversive in what they do. But at one time, it was fairly commonplace to think of yourself as a maker. It was not something you'd even remark upon. And I found this old video. And I'll tell you more about it, but just ...(Music)(Video) Narrator: Of all things Americans are, we are makers. With our strengths and our minds and spirit, we gather, we form, and we fashion. Makers and shapers and put-it-togetherers.DD: So it goes on to show you people making things out of wood, a grandfather making a ship in a bottle, a woman making a pie \u2014 somewhat standard fare of the day. But it was a sense of pride that we made things, that the world around us was made by us. It didn't just exist. We made it, and we were connected to it that way. And I think that's tremendously important. Now I'm going to tell you one funny thing about this. This particular reel \u2014 it's an industrial video \u2014 but it was shown in drive-in theaters in 1961 \u2014 in the Detroit area, in fact \u2014 and it preceded Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho.\" (Laughter) So I like to think there was something going on there of the new generation of makers coming out of this, plus \"Psycho.\"This is Andrew Archer. I met Andrew at one of our community meetings putting together Maker Faire. Andrew had moved to Detroit from Duluth, Minnesota. And I talked to his mom, and I ended up doing a story on him for a magazine called Kidrobot. He's just a kid that grew up playing with tools instead of toys. He liked to take things apart. His mother gave him a part of the garage, and he collected things from yard sales, and he made stuff. And then he didn't particularly like school that much, but he got involved in robotics competitions, and he realized he had a talent, and, more importantly, he had a real passion for it. And he began building robots. And when I sat down next to him, he was telling me about a company he formed, and he was building some robots for automobile factories to move things around on the factory floor. And that's why he moved to Michigan. But he also moved here to meet other people doing what he's doing. And this kind of gets to this important idea today.This is Jeff and Bilal and several others here in a hackerspace. And there's about three hackerspaces or more in Detroit. And there's probably even some new ones since I've been here last. But these are like clubs \u2014 they're sharing tools, sharing space, sharing expertise in what to make. And so it's a very interesting phenomenon that's going across the world. But essentially these are people that are playing with technology. Let me say that again: playing. They don't necessarily know what they're doing or why they're doing it. They're playing to discover what the technology can do, and probably to discover what they can do themselves, what their own capabilities are.Now the other thing that I think is taking off, another reason making is taking off today, is there's some great new tools out there. And you can't see this very well on the screen, but Arduino \u2014 Arduino is an open-source hardware platform. It's a micro-controller. If you don't know what those are, they're just the \"brains.\" So they're the brains of maker projects, and here's an example of one. And I don't know if you can see it that well, but that's a mailbox \u2014 so an ordinary mailbox and an Arduino. So you figure out how to program this, and you put this in your mailbox. And when someone opens your mailbox, you get a notification, an alert message goes to your iPhone. Now that could be a dog door, it could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn't, like a little brother into a little sister's room. There's all kinds of different things that you can imagine for that.Now here's something \u2014 a 3D printer. That's another tool that's really taken off \u2014 really, really interesting. This is Makerbot. And there are industrial versions of this \u2014 about 20,000 dollars. These guys came up with a kit version for 750 dollars, and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks can get a hold of this and begin playing with 3D printers. Now they don't know what they want to do with it, but they're going to figure it out. They will only figure it out by getting their hands on it and playing with it. One of the coolest things is, Makerbot sent out an upgrade, some new brackets for the box. Well you printed out the brackets and then replaced the old brackets with the new ones. Isn't that cool?So makers harvest technology from all the places around us. This is a radar speed detector that was developed from a Hot Wheels toy. And they do interesting things. They're really creating new areas and exploring areas that you might only think \u2014 the military is doing drones \u2014 well, there is a whole community of people building autonomous airplanes, or vehicles \u2014 something that you could program to fly on its own, without a stick or anything, to figure out what path it's going. Fascinating work they're doing.We just had an issue on space exploration, DIY space exploration. This is probably the best time in the history of mankind to love space. You could build your own satellite and get it into space for like 8,000 dollars. Think how much money and how many years it took NASA to get satellites into space. In fact, these guys actually work for NASA, and they're trying to pioneer using off-the-shelf components, cheap things that aren't specialized that they can combine and send up into space.Makers are a source of innovation, and I think it relates back to something like the birth of the personal computer industry. This is Steve Wozniak. Where does he learn about computers? It's the Homebrew Computer Club \u2014 just like a hackerspace. And he says, \"I could go there all day long and talk to people and share ideas for free.\" Well he did a little bit better than free. But it's important to understand that a lot of the origins of our industries \u2014 even like Henry Ford \u2014 come from this idea of playing and figuring things out in groups.Well, if I haven't convinced you that you're a maker, I hope I could convince you that our next generation should be makers, that kids are particularly interested in this, in this ability to control the physical world and be able to use things like micro-controllers and build robots. And we've got to get this into schools, or into communities in many, many ways \u2014 the ability to tinker, to shape and reshape the world around us. There's a great opportunity today \u2014 and that's what I really care about the most. An the answer to the question: what will America make? It's more makers.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1065, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nI'm going to have a pretty simple idea\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nthat I'm just going to tell you over and over until I get you to believe it,\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nand that is all of us are makers.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nI really believe that.\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nAll of us are makers.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nWe're born makers.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nWe have this ability\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nto make things,\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nto grasp things with our hands.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nWe use words like \"grasp\" metaphorically\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nto also think about understanding things.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nWe don't just live, but we make.\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nWe create things.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nWell I'm going to show you a group of makers\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nfrom Maker Faire and various places.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nIt doesn't come out particularly well,\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nbut that's a particularly tall bicycle.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nIt's a scraper bike; it's called --\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nfrom Oakland.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nAnd this is a particularly small scooter\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nfor a gentleman of this size.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nBut he's trying to power it, or motorize it,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nwith a drill.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nAnd the question he had is,\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\n\"Can I do it? Can it be done?\"\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nApparently it can.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nSo makers are enthusiasts; they're amateurs;\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nthey're people who love\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\ndoing what they do.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nThey don't always even know why they're doing it.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nWe have begun organizing makers\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nat our Maker Faire.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nThere was one held in Detroit here last summer,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nand it will be held again next summer, at the Henry Ford.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nBut we hold them in San Francisco --\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\n-- and in New York.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nAnd it's a fabulous event\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nto just meet and talk to these people who make things\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nand are there to just show them to you and talk about them\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nand have a great conversation.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\n(Video) Guy: I might get one of those.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nDale Dougherty: These are electric muffins.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nGuy: Where did you guys get those?\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nMuffin: Will you glide with us? (Guy: No.)\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nDD: I know Ford has new electric vehicles coming out.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nWe got there first.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nLady: Will you glide with us?\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nDD: This is something I call \"swinging in the rain.\"\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nAnd you can barely see it,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nbut it's -- a controller at top cycles the water to fall\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\njust before and after you pass through the bottom of the arc.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nSo imagine a kid: \"Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet?\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nNo, I didn't get wet. Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet?\"\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nThat's the experience of a clever ride.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nAnd of course, we have fashion.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nPeople are remaking things into fashion.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nI don't know if this is called a basket-bra,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nbut it ought to be something like that.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nWe have art students getting together,\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\ntaking old radiator parts\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nand doing an iron-pour to make something new out of it.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nThey did that in the summer, and it was very warm.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nNow this one takes a little bit of explaining.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nYou know what those are, right?\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nBilly-Bob, or Billy Bass, or something like that.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nNow the background is -- the guy who did this is a physicist.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nAnd here he'll explain a little bit about what it does.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\n(Video) Richard Carter: I'm Richard Carter,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nand this is the Sashimi Tabernacle Choir.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nChoir: \u266b When you hold me in your arms \u266b\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nDD: This is all computer-controlled\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nin an old Volvo.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nChoir: \u266b I'm hooked on a feelin' \u266b\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:18.958\n\u266b I'm high on believin' \u266b\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\n\u266b That you're in love with me \u266b\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nDD: So Richard came up from Houston last year\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nto visit us in Detroit here\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nand show the wonderful Sashimi Tabernacle Choir.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nSo, are you a maker?\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nHow many people here would say you're a maker, if you raise your hand?\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nThat's a pretty good --\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nbut there's some of you out there that won't admit that you're makers.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nAnd again, think about it.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nYou're makers of food; you're makers of shelter;\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nyou're makers of lots of different things,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nand partly what interests me today\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nis you're makers of your own world,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nand particularly the role that technology has\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nin your life.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nYou're really a driver or a passenger --\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nto use a Volkswagen phrase.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nMakers are in control.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nThat's what fascinates them. That's why they do what they do.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nThey want to figure out how things work;\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nthey want to get access to it;\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nand they want to control it.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nThey want to use it to their own purpose.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nMakers today, to some degree, are out on the edge.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nThey're not mainstream.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nThey're a little bit radical.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nThey're a bit subversive in what they do.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nBut at one time,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nit was fairly commonplace to think of yourself as a maker.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nIt was not something you'd even remark upon.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nAnd I found this old video.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nAnd I'll tell you more about it, but just ...\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:41.958\n(Music)\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\n(Video) Narrator: Of all things Americans are,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nwe are makers.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nWith our strengths and our minds and spirit,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nwe gather, we form, and we fashion.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nMakers and shapers\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nand put-it-togetherers.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nDD: So it goes on to show you\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\npeople making things out of wood,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\na grandfather making a ship in a bottle,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\na woman making a pie --\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nsomewhat standard fare of the day.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nBut it was a sense of pride\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nthat we made things,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nthat the world around us was made by us.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nIt didn't just exist.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nWe made it, and we were connected to it that way.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nAnd I think that's tremendously important.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nNow I'm going to tell you one funny thing about this.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nThis particular reel --\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nit's an industrial video --\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nbut it was shown in drive-in theaters\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nin 1961 --\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nin the Detroit area, in fact --\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nand it preceded Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho.\"\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nSo I like to think there was something going on there\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nof the new generation of makers\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\ncoming out of this, plus \"Psycho.\"\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nThis is Andrew Archer.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nI met Andrew at one of our community meetings\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nputting together Maker Faire.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nAndrew had moved to Detroit\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nfrom Duluth, Minnesota.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nAnd I talked to his mom,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nand I ended up doing a story on him\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nfor a magazine called Kidrobot.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nHe's just a kid that grew up\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nplaying with tools instead of toys.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nHe liked to take things apart.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nHis mother gave him a part of the garage,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nand he collected things from yard sales, and he made stuff.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nAnd then he didn't particularly like school that much,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nbut he got involved in robotics competitions,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand he realized he had a talent,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nand, more importantly, he had a real passion for it.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd he began building robots.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nAnd when I sat down next to him,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nhe was telling me about a company he formed,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nand he was building some robots for automobile factories\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nto move things around on the factory floor.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd that's why he moved to Michigan.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nBut he also moved here\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nto meet other people doing what he's doing.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nAnd this kind of gets to this important idea today.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nThis is Jeff and Bilal and several others here\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nin a hackerspace.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAnd there's about three hackerspaces or more in Detroit.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nAnd there's probably even some new ones since I've been here last.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nBut these are like clubs --\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nthey're sharing tools, sharing space,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nsharing expertise in what to make.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nAnd so it's a very interesting phenomenon\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nthat's going across the world.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nBut essentially these are people that are playing with technology.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nLet me say that again: playing.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nThey don't necessarily know what they're doing or why they're doing it.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nThey're playing\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nto discover what the technology can do,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nand probably to discover what they can do themselves,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nwhat their own capabilities are.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nNow the other thing that I think is taking off,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nanother reason making is taking off today,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nis there's some great new tools out there.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd you can't see this very well on the screen,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nbut Arduino -- Arduino is an open-source hardware platform.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nIt's a micro-controller.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nIf you don't know what those are, they're just the \"brains.\"\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nSo they're the brains of maker projects,\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nand here's an example of one.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nAnd I don't know if you can see it that well, but that's a mailbox --\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nso an ordinary mailbox and an Arduino.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nSo you figure out how to program this,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nand you put this in your mailbox.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nAnd when someone opens your mailbox,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nyou get a notification,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nan alert message goes to your iPhone.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nNow that could be a dog door,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nit could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn't,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nlike a little brother into a little sister's room.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nThere's all kinds of different things\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nthat you can imagine for that.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nNow here's something -- a 3D printer.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nThat's another tool that's really taken off -- really, really interesting.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nThis is Makerbot.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nAnd there are industrial versions of this --\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nabout 20,000 dollars.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nThese guys came up with a kit version\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nfor 750 dollars,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nand that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\ncan get a hold of this and begin playing with 3D printers.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nNow they don't know what they want to do with it,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nbut they're going to figure it out.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nThey will only figure it out by getting their hands on it and playing with it.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nOne of the coolest things is, Makerbot sent out an upgrade,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nsome new brackets for the box.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nWell you printed out the brackets\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nand then replaced the old brackets with the new ones.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nIsn't that cool?\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nSo makers harvest technology\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nfrom all the places around us.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nThis is a radar speed detector\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nthat was developed from a Hot Wheels toy.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nAnd they do interesting things.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nThey're really creating new areas and exploring areas\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nthat you might only think --\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nthe military is doing drones --\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nwell, there is a whole community of people\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nbuilding autonomous airplanes, or vehicles --\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nsomething that you could program to fly on its own,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nwithout a stick or anything, to figure out what path it's going.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nFascinating work they're doing.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nWe just had an issue on space exploration,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nDIY space exploration.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nThis is probably the best time in the history of mankind\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nto love space.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nYou could build your own satellite and get it into space\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nfor like 8,000 dollars.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nThink how much money and how many years it took NASA\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nto get satellites into space.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nIn fact, these guys actually work for NASA,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nand they're trying to pioneer using off-the-shelf components,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\ncheap things that aren't specialized\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nthat they can combine\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nand send up into space.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nMakers are a source of innovation,\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nand I think it relates back to something\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nlike the birth of the personal computer industry.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nThis is Steve Wozniak. Where does he learn about computers?\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nIt's the Homebrew Computer Club -- just like a hackerspace.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nAnd he says, \"I could go there all day long\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nand talk to people\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nand share ideas for free.\"\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nWell he did a little bit better than free.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nBut it's important to understand\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nthat a lot of the origins of our industries --\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\neven like Henry Ford --\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\ncome from this idea of playing\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nand figuring things out in groups.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nWell, if I haven't convinced you that you're a maker,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nI hope I could convince you\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nthat our next generation should be makers,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nthat kids are particularly interested in this,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nin this ability to control the physical world\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nand be able to use things like micro-controllers\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nand build robots.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nAnd we've got to get this into schools,\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nor into communities in many, many ways --\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nthe ability to tinker,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nto shape and reshape the world around us.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nThere's a great opportunity today --\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nand that's what I really care about the most.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nAn the answer to the question: what will America make?\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nIt's more makers.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Social media and the end of gender", "duration": "507", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/johanna_blakley_social_media_and_the_end_of_gender", "transcript": "I'm going to make an argument today that may seem a little bit crazy: social media and the end of gender. Let me connect the dots. I'm going to argue today that the social media applications that we all know and love, or love to hate, are actually going to help free us from some of the absurd assumptions that we have as a society about gender. I think that social media is actually going to help us dismantle some of the silly and demeaning stereotypes that we see in media and advertising about gender.If you hadn't noticed, our media climate generally provides a very distorted mirror of our lives and of our gender, and I think that's going to change. Now most media companies \u2014 television, radio, publishing, games, you name it \u2014 they use very rigid segmentation methods in order to understand their audiences. It's old-school demographics. They come up with these very restrictive labels to define us. Now the crazy thing is that media companies believe that if you fall within a certain demographic category then you are predictable in certain ways \u2014 you have certain taste, that you like certain things. And so the bizarre result of this is that most of our popular culture is actually based on these presumptions about our demographics.Age demographics: the 18 to 49 demo has had a huge impact on all mass media programming in this country since the 1960s, when the baby boomers were still young. Now they've aged out of that demographic, but it's still the case that powerful ratings companies like Nielson don't even take into account viewers of television shows over age 54. In our media environment, it's as if they don't even exist. Now, if you watch \"Mad Men,\" like I do \u2014 it's a popular TV show in the States \u2014 Dr. Faye Miller does something called psychographics, which first came about in the 1960s, where you create these complex psychological profiles of consumers. But psychographics really haven't had a huge impact on the media business. It's really just been basic demographics.So I'm at the Norman Lear Center at USC, and we've done a lot of research over the last seven, eight years on demographics and how they affect media and entertainment in this country and abroad. And in the last three years, we've been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed, and we've discovered some very interesting things. All the people who participate in social media networks belong to the same old demographic categories that media companies and advertisers have used in order to understand them. But those categories mean even less now than they did before, because with online networking tools, it's much easier for us to escape some of our demographic boxes. We're able to connect with people quite freely and to redefine ourselves online. And we can lie about our age online, too, pretty easily. We can also connect with people based on our very specific interests. We don't need a media company to help do this for us.So the traditional media companies, of course, are paying very close attention to these online communities. They know this is the mass audience of the future; they need to figure it out. But they're having a hard time doing it because they're still trying to use demographics in order to understand them, because that's how ad rates are still determined. When they're monitoring your clickstream \u2014 and you know they are \u2014 they have a really hard time figuring out your age, your gender and your income. They can make some educated guesses. But they get a lot more information about what you do online, what you like, what interests you. That's easier for them to find out than who you are. And even though that's still sort of creepy, there is an upside to having your taste monitored. Suddenly our taste is being respected in a way that it hasn't been before. It had been presumed before.So when you look online at the way people aggregate, they don't aggregate around age, gender and income. They aggregate around the things they love, the things that they like, and if you think about it, shared interests and values are a far more powerful aggregator of human beings than demographic categories. I'd much rather know whether you like \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" rather than how old you are. That would tell me something more substantial about you.Now there's something else that we've discovered about social media that's actually quite surprising. It turns out that women are really driving the social media revolution. If you look at the statistics \u2014 these are worldwide statistics \u2014 in every single age category, women actually outnumber men in their use of social networking technologies. And then if you look at the amount of time that they spend on these sites, they truly dominate the social media space, which is a space that's having a huge impact on old media. The question is: what sort of impact is this going to have on our culture, and what's it going to mean for women? If the case is that social media is dominating old media and women are dominating social media, then does that mean that women are going to take over global media? Are we suddenly going to see a lot more female characters in cartoons and in games and on TV shows? Will the next big-budget blockbuster movies actually be chick flicks? Could this be possible, that suddenly our media landscape will become a feminist landscape?Well, I actually don't think that's going to be the case. I think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women, because they realize this is important for their business, and I think that women are also going to continue to dominate the social media sphere. But I think women are actually going to be \u2014 ironically enough \u2014 responsible for driving a stake through the heart of cheesy genre categories like the \"chick flick\" and all these other genre categories that presume that certain demographic groups like certain things \u2014 that Hispanics like certain things, that young people like certain things. This is far too simplistic. The future entertainment media that we're going to see is going to be very data-driven, and it's going to be based on the information that we ascertain from taste communities online, where women are really driving the action.So you may be asking, well why is it important that I know what entertains people? Why should I know this? Of course, old media companies and advertisers need to know this. But my argument is that, if you want to understand the global village, it's probably a good idea that you figure out what they're passionate about, what amuses them, what they choose to do in their free time. This is a very important thing to know about people. I've spent most of my professional life researching media and entertainment and its impact on people's lives. And I do it not just because it's fun \u2014 though actually, it is really fun \u2014 but also because our research has shown over and over again that entertainment and play have a huge impact on people's lives \u2014 for instance, on their political beliefs and on their health. And so, if you have any interest in understanding the world, looking at how people amuse themselves is a really good way to start.So imagine a media atmosphere that isn't dominated by lame stereotypes about gender and other demographic characteristics. Can you even imagine what that looks like? I can't wait to find out what it looks like.Thank you so much.(Applause)", "id": 1066, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nI'm going

--> 00:02:21.958\nof consumers.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nBut psychographics really haven't had a huge impact on the media business.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nIt's really just been basic demographics.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nSo I'm at the Norman Lear Center at USC,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nand we've done a lot of research over the last seven, eight years\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\non demographics\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nand how they affect media and entertainment\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nin this country and abroad.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nAnd in the last three years,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nwe've been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nand we've discovered some very interesting things.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nAll the people who participate in social media networks\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nbelong to the same old demographic categories\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nthat media companies and advertisers\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nhave used in order to understand them.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nBut those categories mean even less now\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nthan they did before,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nbecause with online networking tools,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nit's much easier for us\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nto escape some of our demographic boxes.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nWe're able to connect with people quite freely\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nand to redefine ourselves online.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nAnd we can lie about our age online, too, pretty easily.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nWe can also connect with people\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nbased on our very specific interests.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nWe don't need a media company\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nto help do this for us.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nSo the traditional media companies, of course,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nare paying very close attention to these online communities.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nThey know this is the mass audience of the future;\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nthey need to figure it out.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nBut they're having a hard time doing it\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nbecause they're still trying to use demographics in order to understand them,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nbecause that's how ad rates are still determined.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nWhen they're monitoring your clickstream --\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nand you know they are --\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nthey have a really hard time\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nfiguring out your age, your gender and your income.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nThey can make some educated guesses.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nBut they get a lot more information\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nabout what you do online,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nwhat you like, what interests you.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nThat's easier for them to find out than who you are.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nAnd even though that's still sort of creepy,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nthere is an upside\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nto having your taste monitored.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nSuddenly our taste is being respected\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nin a way that it hasn't been before.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nIt had been presumed before.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nSo when you look online at the way people aggregate,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nthey don't aggregate\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\naround age, gender and income.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nThey aggregate around the things they love,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nthe things that they like,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nand if you think about it, shared interests and values\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nare a far more powerful aggregator of human beings\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nthan demographic categories.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nI'd much rather know\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nwhether you like \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\"\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nrather than how old you are.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nThat would tell me something more substantial about you.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nNow there's something else that we've discovered about social media\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nthat's actually quite surprising.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nIt turns out that women\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nare really driving the social media revolution.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nIf you look at the statistics --\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nthese are worldwide statistics --\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nin every single age category,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nwomen actually outnumber men\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nin their use of social networking technologies.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nAnd then if you look at the amount of time\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nthat they spend on these sites,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nthey truly dominate the social media space,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nwhich is a space that's having a huge impact\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\non old media.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nThe question is: what sort of impact\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nis this going to have on our culture,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nand what's it going to mean for women?\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nIf the case is that social media\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nis dominating old media\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nand women are dominating social media,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nthen does that mean that women\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nare going to take over global media?\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nAre we suddenly going to see\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\na lot more female characters in cartoons\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nand in games and on TV shows?\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nWill the next big-budget blockbuster movies\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nactually be chick flicks?\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nCould this be possible,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nthat suddenly our media landscape\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nwill become a feminist landscape?\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nWell, I actually don't think that's going to be the case.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nI think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nbecause they realize this is important for their business,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nand I think that women\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nare also going to continue to dominate\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nthe social media sphere.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nBut I think women are actually going to be -- ironically enough --\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nresponsible for driving a stake through the heart\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nof cheesy genre categories\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nlike the \"chick flick\"\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nand all these other genre categories\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nthat presume that certain demographic groups\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nlike certain things --\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nthat Hispanics like certain things,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nthat young people like certain things.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nThis is far too simplistic.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nThe future entertainment media that we're going to see\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nis going to be very data-driven,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nand it's going to be based on the information\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nthat we ascertain from taste communities online,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nwhere women are really driving the action.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nSo you may be asking, well why is it important\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nthat I know what entertains people?\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nWhy should I know this?\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nOf course, old media companies and advertisers\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nneed to know this.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nBut my argument is that,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nif you want to understand the global village,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nit's probably a good idea that you figure out\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nwhat they're passionate about, what amuses them,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nwhat they choose to do in their free time.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nThis is a very important thing to know about people.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nI've spent most of my professional life\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nresearching media and entertainment\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nand its impact on people's lives.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nAnd I do it not just because it's fun --\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nthough actually, it is really fun --\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nbut also because\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nour research has shown over and over again\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nthat entertainment and play\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nhave a huge impact on people's lives --\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nfor instance, on their political beliefs\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nand on their health.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nAnd so, if you have any interest in understanding the world,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nlooking at how people amuse themselves\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nis a really good way to start.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nSo imagine a media atmosphere\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nthat isn't dominated by lame stereotypes\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nabout gender\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nand other demographic characteristics.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nCan you even imagine what that looks like?\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nI can't wait to find out what it looks like.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nThank you so much.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:17.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Are we born to run?", "duration": "952", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/christopher_mcdougall_are_we_born_to_run", "transcript": "Running: it's basically just right, left, right, left, yeah? I mean, we've been doing it for two million years, so it's kind of arrogant to assume that I've got something to say that hasn't been said and performed better a long time ago. But the cool thing about running, as I've discovered, is that something bizarre happens in this activity all the time. Case in point: A couple months ago, if you saw the New York City Marathon, I guarantee you, you saw something that no one has ever seen before.An Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu turns up at the starting line. She's 37 years old. She hasn't won a marathon of any kind in eight years, and a few months previously, she had almost died in childbirth. Derartu Tulu was ready to hang it up and retire from the sport, but she decided she'd go for broke and try for one last big payday in the marquee event, the New York City Marathon. Except \u2014 bad news for Derartu Tulu \u2014 some other people had the same idea, including the Olympic gold medalist, and Paula Radcliffe, who is a monster, the fastest woman marathoner in history by far. Only 10 minutes off the men's world record, Paula Radcliffe is essentially unbeatable. That's her competition.The gun goes off, and \u2014 I mean, she's not even an underdog; she's, like, under the underdogs. But the under-underdog hangs tough, and 22 miles into a 26-mile race, there is Derartu Tulu, up there with the lead pack. Now, this is when something really bizarre happens. Paula Radcliffe, the one person who is sure to snatch the big paycheck from Derartu Tulu's under-underdog hands, suddenly grabs her leg and starts to fall back. So we all know what to do in this situation, right? You give her a quick crack in the teeth with your elbow and blaze for the finish line. Derartu Tulu ruins the script. Instead of taking off, she falls back and she grabs Paula Radcliffe, and says, \"Come on. Come with us. You can do it.\" So Paula Radcliffe, unfortunately, does it. She catches up with the lead pack and is pushing toward the finish line. But then she falls back again. The second time, Derartu Tulu grabs her and tries to pull her. And Paula Radcliffe, at that point, says, \"I'm done. Go.\" So that's a fantastic story, and we all know how it ends. She loses the check, but she goes home with something bigger and more important. Except Derartu Tulu ruins the script again. Instead of losing, she blazes past the lead pack and wins. Wins the New York City Marathon, goes home with a big fat check.It's a heartwarming story, but if you drill a little bit deeper, you've got to sort of wonder about what exactly was going on there. When you have two outliers in one organism, it's not a coincidence. When you have someone who is more competitive and more compassionate than anybody else in the race, again, it's not a coincidence. You show me a creature with webbed feet and gills; somehow water's involved.Someone with that kind of heart, there's some kind of connection there. And the answer to it, I think, can be found down in the Copper Canyons of Mexico, where there's a reclusive tribe, called the Tarahumara Indians. Now, the Tarahumara are remarkable for three things. Number one is: they have been living essentially unchanged for the past 400 years. When the conquistadors arrived in North America you had two choices: you either fight back and engage or you could take off. The Mayans and Aztecs engaged, which is why there are very few Mayans and Aztecs. The Tarahumara had a different strategy. They took off and hid in this labyrinthine, networking, spider-webbing system of canyons called the Copper Canyons. And there they've remained since the 1600s, essentially the same way they've always been.The second thing remarkable about the Tarahumara is: deep into old age \u2014 70 to 80 years old \u2014 these guys aren't running marathons; they're running mega-marathons. They're not doing 26 miles, they're doing 100, 150 miles at a time, and apparently without injury, without problems.The last thing that's remarkable about the Tarahumara is: all the things we're going to be talking about today, all the things we're trying to use all of our technology and brain power to solve \u2014 things like heart disease and cholesterol and cancer; crime, warfare and violence; clinical depression \u2014 all this stuff \u2014 the Tarahumara don't know what you're talking about. They are free from all of these modern ailments.So what's the connection? Again, we're talking about outliers; there's got to be some kind of cause and effect. Well, there are teams of scientists at Harvard and the University of Utah that are bending their brains and trying to figure out what the Tarahumara have known forever. They're trying to solve those same kinds of mysteries. And once again, a mystery wrapped inside of a mystery \u2014 perhaps the key to Derartu Tulu and the Tarahumara is wrapped in three other mysteries, which go like this: Three things \u2014 if you have the answer, come up and take the microphone, because nobody else knows the answer. If you know it, you're smarter than anybody on planet Earth.Mystery number one is this: Two million years ago, the human brain exploded in size. Australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain. Suddenly humans show up, Homo erectus, big old melon head. To have a brain of that size, you need to have a source of condensed caloric energy. In other words, early humans are eating dead animals \u2014 no argument, that's a fact. The only problem is, the first edged weapons only appeared about 200,000 years ago.So somehow, for nearly two million years, we are killing animals without any weapons. Now, we're not using our strength, because we are the biggest sissies in the jungle. Every other animal is stronger than we are, they have fangs, they have claws, they have nimbleness, they have speed. We think Usain Bolt is fast. Usain Bolt can get his ass kicked by a squirrel. We're not fast. That would be an Olympic event: turn a squirrel loose, whoever catches it gets a gold medal.(Laughter)So no weapons, no speed, no strength, no fangs, no claws. How were we killing these animals? Mystery number one.Mystery number two: Women have been in the Olympics for quite some time now, but one thing that's remarkable about all women sprinters: they all suck; they're terrible. There's not a fast woman on the planet and there never has been. The fastest woman to ever run a mile did it in 4:15. I could throw a rock and hit a high-school boy who can run faster than 4:15. For some reason, you guys are just really slow. But \u2014(Laughter)But, you get to the marathon we were just talking about \u2014 you've only been allowed to run the marathon for 20 years, because prior to the 1980s, medical science said if a woman tried to run 26 miles \u2014 does anyone know what would happen if you tried to run 26 miles? Why you were banned from the marathon before the 1980s?Audience Member: Her uterus would be torn.Christopher McDougall: Her uterus would be torn, yes. Torn reproductive organs. The uterus would literally fall out of the body.(Laughter)Now, I've been to a lot of marathons, and I've yet to see any ...(Laughter)So it's only been 20 years that women have been allowed to run the marathon. In that very short learning curve, you've gone from broken organs up to the fact that you're only 10 minutes off the male world record.Then you go beyond 26 miles, into the distance that medical science also told us would be fatal to humans \u2014 remember Pheidippides died when he ran 26 miles \u2014 you get to 50 and 100 miles, and suddenly, it's a different game. You take a runner like Ann Trason or Nikki Kimball or Jenn Shelton, put them in a race of 50 or 100 miles against anybody in the world, and it's a coin toss who's going to win. I'll give you an example. A couple years ago, Emily Baer signed up for a race called the Hardrock 100, which tells you all you need to know about the race. They give you 48 hours to finish this race. Well, Emily Baer \u2014 500 runners \u2014 she finishes in eighth place, in the top 10, even though she stopped at all the aid stations to breastfeed her baby during the race.(Laughter)And yet, she beat 492 other people. The last mystery: Why is it that women get stronger as distances get longer? The third mystery is this: At the University of Utah, they started tracking finishing times for people running the marathon. What they found is that if you start running the marathon at age 19, you'll get progressively faster, year by year, until you reach your peak at age 27. And then after that, you succumb to the rigors of time. And you'll get slower and slower, until eventually you're back to running the same speed you were at age 19. So about seven, eight years to reach your peak, and then gradually you fall off your peak, until you go back to the starting point. You'd think it might take eight years to go back to the same speed, maybe 10 years \u2014 no, it's 45 years. 64-year-old men and women are running as fast as they were at age 19. Now, I defy you to come up with any other physical activity \u2014 and please don't say golf \u2014 something that's actually hard \u2014(Laughter)where geriatrics are performing as well as they did as teenagers.So you have these three mysteries. Is there one piece in the puzzle which might wrap all these things up? You've got to be careful anytime someone looks back in prehistory and tries to give you a global answer because, it being prehistory, you can say whatever the hell you want and get away with it. But I'll submit this to you: If you put one piece in the middle of this jigsaw puzzle, suddenly it all starts to form a coherent picture. If you're wondering why the Tarahumara don't fight and don't die of heart disease, why a poor Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu can be the most compassionate and yet the most competitive, and why we somehow were able to find food without weapons, perhaps it's because humans, as much as we like to think of ourselves as masters of the universe, actually evolved as nothing more than a pack of hunting dogs.Maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal. Because the one advantage we have in the wilderness \u2014 again, it's not our fangs, our claws or our speed \u2014 the only thing we do really well is sweat. We're really good at being sweaty and smelly. Better than any other mammal on Earth, we can sweat really well. But the advantage of that little bit of social discomfort is the fact that, when it comes to running under hot heat for long distances, we're superb \u2014 the best on the planet. You take a horse on a hot day, and after about five or six miles, that horse has a choice: it's either going to breathe or it's going to cool off. But it ain't doing both. We can. So what if we evolved as hunting pack animals? What if the only natural advantage we had in the world was the fact that we could get together as a group, go out there on that African savanna, pick out an antelope, go out as a pack, and run that thing to death? That's all we could do. We could run really far on a hot day.Well, if that's true, a couple other things had to be true as well. The key to being part of a hunting pack is the word \"pack.\" If you go out by yourself and try to chase an antelope, I guarantee there will be two cadavers out in the savanna. You need a pack to pull together. You need to have those 64- and 65-year-olds who have been doing this for a long time to understand which antelope you're trying to catch. The herd explodes and it gathers back again. Those expert trackers have to be part of the pack. They can't be 10 miles behind. You need the women and the adolescents there, because the two times in your life you most benefit from animal protein is when you're a nursing mother and a developing adolescent. It makes no sense to have the antelope over there, dead, and the people who want to eat it 50 miles away. They need to be part of the pack. You need those 27-year-old studs at the peak of their powers ready to drop the kill, and you need those teenagers who are learning the whole thing involved. The pack stays together.Another thing that has to be true: this pack cannot be materialistic. You can't be hauling all your crap around, trying to chase the antelope. You can't be a pissed-off pack. You can't be bearing grudges, like, \"I'm not chasing that guy's antelope. He pissed me off. Let him go chase his own antelope.\" The pack has got to be able to swallow its ego, be cooperative, and pull together. What you end up with, in other words, is a culture remarkably similar to the Tarahumara, a tribe that has remained unchanged since the Stone Age. It's a really compelling argument that maybe the Tarahumara are doing exactly what all of us had done for two million years, that it's us in modern times who have sort of gone off the path.You know, we look at running as this kind of alien, foreign thing, this punishment you've got to do because you ate pizza the night before. But maybe it's something different. Maybe we're the ones who have taken this natural advantage we had and we spoiled it. How do we spoil it? Well, how do we spoil anything? We try to cash in on it. Right? We try to can it and package it and make it \"better\" and then sell it to people. And then what happened was, we started creating these fancy cushioned things which can make running \"better,\" called running shoes.The reason I get personally pissed-off about running shoes is because I bought a million of them and I kept getting hurt. And I think if anybody in here runs \u2014 I just had a conversation with Carol. We talked for two minutes backstage, and she talked about plantar fasciitis. You talk to a runner, I guarantee within 30 seconds, the conversation turns to injury. So if humans evolved as runners, if that's our one natural advantage, then why are we so bad at it? Why do we keep getting hurt?A curious thing about running and running injuries is that the running injury is new to our time. If you read folklore and mythology, any kind of myths, any kind of tall tales, running is always associated with freedom and vitality and youthfulness and eternal vigor. It's only in our lifetime that running has become associated with fear and pain. Geronimo used to say, \"My only friends are my legs. I only trust my legs.\" That's because an Apache triathlon used to be you'd run 50 miles across the desert, engage in hand-to-hand combat, steal a bunch of horses, and slap leather for home. Geronimo was never saying, \"You know something, my Achilles \u2014 I'm tapering. I've got to take this week off.\" Or, \"I need to cross-train. I didn't do yoga. I'm not ready.\"(Laughter)Humans ran and ran all the time. We are here today. We have our digital technology. All of our science comes from the fact that our ancestors were able to do something extraordinary every day, which was just rely on their naked feet and legs to run long distances.So how do we get back to that again? Well, I would submit to you the first thing is: get rid of all packaging, all the sales, all the marketing. Get rid of all the stinking running shoes. Stop focusing on urban marathons, which, if you do four hours, you suck, and if you do 3:59:59, you're awesome, because you qualified for another race. We need to get back to that sense of playfulness and joyfulness and, I would say, nakedness, that has made the Tarahumara one of the healthiest and serene cultures in our time. So what's the benefit? So what? So you burn off the H\u00e4agen-Dazs from the night before.But maybe there's another benefit there as well. Without getting too extreme about this, imagine a world where everybody could go out the door and engage in the kind of exercise that's going to make them more relaxed, more serene, more healthy, burn off stress \u2014 where you don't come back into your office a raging maniac anymore, or go home with a lot of stress on top of you again. Maybe there's something between what we are today and what the Tarahumara have always been. I don't say let's go back to the Copper Canyons and live on corn and maize, which is the Tarahumara's preferred diet, but maybe there's somewhere in between. And if we find that thing, maybe there is a big fat Nobel Prize out there. Because if somebody could find a way to restore that natural ability that we all enjoyed for most of our existence up until the 1970s or so, the benefits \u2014 social and physical and political and mental \u2014 could be astounding.What I've been seeing today is there is a growing subculture of barefoot runners, people who've gotten rid of their shoes. And what they have found uniformly is, you get rid of the shoes, you get rid of the stress, you get rid of the injuries and the ailments. And what you find is something the Tarahumara have known for a very long time: that this can be a whole lot of fun. I've experienced it personally myself. I was injured all my life; then in my early 40s, I got rid of my shoes and my running ailments have gone away, too.So hopefully it's something we can all benefit from. I appreciate your listening to this story.Thanks very much.(Applause)", "id": 1067, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.529\nRunning: it's basically just\nright, left, right, left, yeah?\n\n00:00:15.553 --> 00:00:17.982\nI mean, we've been doing it\nfor two million years,\n\n00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:21.552\nso it's kind of arrogant to assume\nthat I've got something to say\n\n00:00:21.576 --> 00:00:24.796\nthat hasn't been said and performed\nbetter a long time ago.\n\n00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:27.750\nBut the cool thing about running,\nas I've discovered,\n\n00:00:27.774 --> 00:00:31.359\nis that something bizarre happens\nin this activity all the time.\n\n00:00:31.383 --> 00:00:34.958\nCase in point: A couple months ago,\nif you saw the New York City Marathon,\n\n00:00:34.982 --> 00:00:38.570\nI guarantee you, you saw something\nthat no one has ever seen before.\n\n00:00:39.185 --> 00:00:43.022\nAn Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu\nturns up at the starting line.\n\n00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.072\nShe's 37 years old.\n\n00:00:45.096 --> 00:00:47.782\nShe hasn't won a marathon\nof any kind in eight years,\n\n00:00:47.806 --> 00:00:49.234\nand a few months previously,\n\n00:00:49.258 --> 00:00:51.234\nshe had almost died in childbirth.\n\n00:00:51.258 --> 00:00:54.749\nDerartu Tulu was ready to hang it up\nand retire from the sport,\n\n00:00:54.773 --> 00:00:56.645\nbut she decided she'd go for broke\n\n00:00:56.669 --> 00:01:00.457\nand try for one last big payday\nin the marquee event,\n\n00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:02.096\nthe New York City Marathon.\n\n00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.834\nExcept -- bad news for Derartu Tulu --\nsome other people had the same idea,\n\n00:01:05.858 --> 00:01:07.712\nincluding the Olympic gold medalist,\n\n00:01:07.736 --> 00:01:10.834\nand Paula Radcliffe, who is a monster,\n\n00:01:10.858 --> 00:01:14.430\nthe fastest woman marathoner\nin history by far.\n\n00:01:14.454 --> 00:01:16.731\nOnly 10 minutes\noff the men's world record,\n\n00:01:16.755 --> 00:01:19.659\nPaula Radcliffe is essentially unbeatable.\n\n00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:21.834\nThat's her competition.\n\n00:01:21.858 --> 00:01:24.806\nThe gun goes off, and -- I mean,\nshe's not even an underdog;\n\n00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.645\nshe's, like, under the underdogs.\n\n00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:28.714\nBut the under-underdog hangs tough,\n\n00:01:28.738 --> 00:01:31.549\nand 22 miles into a 26-mile race,\n\n00:01:31.573 --> 00:01:34.469\nthere is Derartu Tulu,\nup there with the lead pack.\n\n00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:37.953\nNow, this is when something\nreally bizarre happens.\n\n00:01:37.977 --> 00:01:41.739\nPaula Radcliffe, the one person\nwho is sure to snatch the big paycheck\n\n00:01:41.763 --> 00:01:44.834\nfrom Derartu Tulu's under-underdog hands,\n\n00:01:44.858 --> 00:01:47.255\nsuddenly grabs her leg\nand starts to fall back.\n\n00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:49.690\nSo we all know what to do\nin this situation, right?\n\n00:01:49.714 --> 00:01:52.400\nYou give her a quick crack\nin the teeth with your elbow\n\n00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:53.923\nand blaze for the finish line.\n\n00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:56.437\nDerartu Tulu ruins the script.\n\n00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:57.910\nInstead of taking off,\n\n00:01:57.934 --> 00:02:00.183\nshe falls back and she grabs\nPaula Radcliffe,\n\n00:02:00.207 --> 00:02:02.545\nand says, \"Come on.\nCome with us. You can do it.\"\n\n00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:04.980\nSo Paula Radcliffe,\nunfortunately, does it.\n\n00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:06.617\nShe catches up with the lead pack\n\n00:02:06.641 --> 00:02:08.504\nand is pushing toward the finish line.\n\n00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:10.047\nBut then she falls back again.\n\n00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:13.063\nThe second time, Derartu Tulu\ngrabs her and tries to pull her.\n\n00:02:13.087 --> 00:02:15.925\nAnd Paula Radcliffe, at that point,\nsays, \"I'm done. Go.\"\n\n00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.225\nSo that's a fantastic story,\nand we all know how it ends.\n\n00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:20.539\nShe loses the check,\n\n00:02:20.563 --> 00:02:23.488\nbut she goes home with something\nbigger and more important.\n\n00:02:23.512 --> 00:02:26.008\nExcept Derartu Tulu\nruins the script again.\n\n00:02:26.032 --> 00:02:29.532\nInstead of losing, she blazes\npast the lead pack and wins.\n\n00:02:29.556 --> 00:02:31.218\nWins the New York City Marathon,\n\n00:02:31.242 --> 00:02:32.876\ngoes home with a big fat check.\n\n00:02:33.635 --> 00:02:35.171\nIt's a heartwarming story,\n\n00:02:35.195 --> 00:02:37.172\nbut if you drill a little bit deeper,\n\n00:02:37.196 --> 00:02:40.604\nyou've got to sort of wonder\nabout what exactly was going on there.\n\n00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:42.763\nWhen you have two outliers\nin one organism,\n\n00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:44.161\nit's not a coincidence.\n\n00:02:44.185 --> 00:02:47.676\nWhen you have someone who is more\ncompetitive and more compassionate\n\n00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.677\nthan anybody else in the race,\nagain, it's not a coincidence.\n\n00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:53.144\nYou show me a creature\nwith webbed feet and gills;\n\n00:02:53.168 --> 00:02:54.816\nsomehow water's involved.\n\n00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.222\nSomeone with that kind of heart,\nthere's some kind of connection there.\n\n00:02:58.246 --> 00:03:00.813\nAnd the answer to it,\nI think, can be found\n\n00:03:00.837 --> 00:03:03.246\ndown in the Copper Canyons of Mexico,\n\n00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.147\nwhere there's a reclusive tribe,\ncalled the Tarahumara Indians.\n\n00:03:07.171 --> 00:03:10.730\nNow, the Tarahumara\nare remarkable for three things.\n\n00:03:10.754 --> 00:03:12.229\nNumber one is:\n\n00:03:12.253 --> 00:03:16.459\nthey have been living essentially\nunchanged for the past 400 years.\n\n00:03:16.483 --> 00:03:20.097\nWhen the conquistadors arrived\nin North America you had two choices:\n\n00:03:20.121 --> 00:03:22.834\nyou either fight back and engage\nor you could take off.\n\n00:03:22.858 --> 00:03:24.716\nThe Mayans and Aztecs engaged,\n\n00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.186\nwhich is why there are very few\nMayans and Aztecs.\n\n00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.195\nThe Tarahumara had a different strategy.\n\n00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:31.083\nThey took off and hid\n\n00:03:31.107 --> 00:03:35.962\nin this labyrinthine, networking,\nspider-webbing system of canyons\n\n00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:37.387\ncalled the Copper Canyons.\n\n00:03:37.411 --> 00:03:40.834\nAnd there they've remained\nsince the 1600s,\n\n00:03:40.858 --> 00:03:43.461\nessentially the same way\nthey've always been.\n\n00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:47.436\nThe second thing remarkable\nabout the Tarahumara is:\n\n00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.588\ndeep into old age -- 70 to 80 years old --\n\n00:03:50.612 --> 00:03:52.589\nthese guys aren't running marathons;\n\n00:03:52.613 --> 00:03:54.460\nthey're running mega-marathons.\n\n00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:56.129\nThey're not doing 26 miles,\n\n00:03:56.153 --> 00:03:58.775\nthey're doing 100, 150 miles at a time,\n\n00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.268\nand apparently without injury,\nwithout problems.\n\n00:04:01.914 --> 00:04:04.630\nThe last thing that's remarkable\nabout the Tarahumara is:\n\n00:04:04.654 --> 00:04:07.171\nall the things we're going\nto be talking about today,\n\n00:04:07.195 --> 00:04:10.000\nall the things we're trying to use\nall of our technology\n\n00:04:10.024 --> 00:04:11.362\nand brain power to solve --\n\n00:04:11.386 --> 00:04:13.936\nthings like heart disease\nand cholesterol and cancer;\n\n00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.558\ncrime, warfare and violence;\nclinical depression -- all this stuff --\n\n00:04:17.582 --> 00:04:20.054\nthe Tarahumara don't know\nwhat you're talking about.\n\n00:04:20.078 --> 00:04:23.834\nThey are free from all\nof these modern ailments.\n\n00:04:24.686 --> 00:04:25.915\nSo what's the connection?\n\n00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:27.677\nAgain, we're talking about outliers;\n\n00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:29.992\nthere's got to be some kind\nof cause and effect.\n\n00:04:30.016 --> 00:04:33.834\nWell, there are teams of scientists\nat Harvard and the University of Utah\n\n00:04:33.858 --> 00:04:36.438\nthat are bending their brains\nand trying to figure out\n\n00:04:36.462 --> 00:04:38.405\nwhat the Tarahumara have known forever.\n\n00:04:38.429 --> 00:04:41.093\nThey're trying to solve\nthose same kinds of mysteries.\n\n00:04:41.117 --> 00:04:44.540\nAnd once again, a mystery\nwrapped inside of a mystery --\n\n00:04:44.564 --> 00:04:47.683\nperhaps the key to Derartu Tulu\nand the Tarahumara\n\n00:04:47.707 --> 00:04:50.344\nis wrapped in three other\nmysteries, which go like this:\n\n00:04:50.368 --> 00:04:53.777\nThree things -- if you have the answer,\ncome up and take the microphone,\n\n00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:55.630\nbecause nobody else knows the answer.\n\n00:04:55.654 --> 00:04:58.539\nIf you know it, you're smarter\nthan anybody on planet Earth.\n\n00:04:58.563 --> 00:04:59.986\nMystery number one is this:\n\n00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.764\nTwo million years ago,\nthe human brain exploded in size.\n\n00:05:02.788 --> 00:05:04.899\nAustralopithecus\nhad a tiny little pea brain.\n\n00:05:04.923 --> 00:05:07.969\nSuddenly humans show up,\nHomo erectus, big old melon head.\n\n00:05:07.993 --> 00:05:09.516\nTo have a brain of that size,\n\n00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.143\nyou need to have a source\nof condensed caloric energy.\n\n00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:15.788\nIn other words, early humans\nare eating dead animals --\n\n00:05:15.812 --> 00:05:17.144\nno argument, that's a fact.\n\n00:05:17.858 --> 00:05:19.075\nThe only problem is,\n\n00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.689\nthe first edged weapons only appeared\nabout 200,000 years ago.\n\n00:05:22.713 --> 00:05:25.408\nSo somehow, for nearly two million years,\n\n00:05:25.432 --> 00:05:28.103\nwe are killing animals\nwithout any weapons.\n\n00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:29.827\nNow, we're not using our strength,\n\n00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:32.209\nbecause we are the biggest\nsissies in the jungle.\n\n00:05:32.233 --> 00:05:34.275\nEvery other animal\nis stronger than we are,\n\n00:05:34.299 --> 00:05:37.729\nthey have fangs, they have claws,\nthey have nimbleness, they have speed.\n\n00:05:37.753 --> 00:05:39.124\nWe think Usain Bolt is fast.\n\n00:05:39.148 --> 00:05:41.492\nUsain Bolt can get\nhis ass kicked by a squirrel.\n\n00:05:41.516 --> 00:05:42.667\nWe're not fast.\n\n00:05:42.691 --> 00:05:44.182\nThat would be an Olympic event:\n\n00:05:44.206 --> 00:05:47.043\nturn a squirrel loose,\nwhoever catches it gets a gold medal.\n\n00:05:47.067 --> 00:05:48.082\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:48.106 --> 00:05:50.824\nSo no weapons, no speed,\nno strength, no fangs, no claws.\n\n00:05:50.848 --> 00:05:53.490\nHow were we killing these animals?\nMystery number one.\n\n00:05:53.514 --> 00:05:54.955\nMystery number two:\n\n00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:58.032\nWomen have been in the Olympics\nfor quite some time now,\n\n00:05:58.056 --> 00:06:00.864\nbut one thing that's remarkable\nabout all women sprinters:\n\n00:06:00.888 --> 00:06:02.643\nthey all suck; they're terrible.\n\n00:06:02.667 --> 00:06:06.395\nThere's not a fast woman on the planet\nand there never has been.\n\n00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.396\nThe fastest woman\nto ever run a mile did it in 4:15.\n\n00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.638\nI could throw a rock\nand hit a high-school boy\n\n00:06:11.662 --> 00:06:13.158\nwho can run faster than 4:15.\n\n00:06:13.182 --> 00:06:15.373\nFor some reason,\nyou guys are just really slow.\n\n00:06:15.397 --> 00:06:16.555\nBut --\n\n00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:17.638\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:17.662 --> 00:06:20.408\nBut, you get to the marathon\nwe were just talking about --\n\n00:06:20.432 --> 00:06:23.210\nyou've only been allowed to run\nthe marathon for 20 years,\n\n00:06:23.234 --> 00:06:25.505\nbecause prior to the 1980s,\nmedical science said\n\n00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:28.893\nif a woman tried to run 26 miles --\ndoes anyone know what would happen\n\n00:06:28.917 --> 00:06:30.350\nif you tried to run 26 miles?\n\n00:06:30.374 --> 00:06:32.990\nWhy you were banned\nfrom the marathon before the 1980s?\n\n00:06:33.014 --> 00:06:35.100\nAudience Member: Her uterus would be torn.\n\n00:06:35.124 --> 00:06:37.652\nChristopher McDougall:\nHer uterus would be torn, yes.\n\n00:06:37.676 --> 00:06:38.916\nTorn reproductive organs.\n\n00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.199\nThe uterus would literally\nfall out of the body.\n\n00:06:41.223 --> 00:06:42.244\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:44.087\nNow, I've been to a lot of marathons,\n\n00:06:44.111 --> 00:06:45.752\nand I've yet to see any ...\n\n00:06:45.776 --> 00:06:48.685\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:50.076\nSo it's only been 20 years\n\n00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.479\nthat women have been allowed\nto run the marathon.\n\n00:06:52.503 --> 00:06:56.524\nIn that very short learning curve,\nyou've gone from broken organs\n\n00:06:56.548 --> 00:07:00.349\nup to the fact that you're only 10 minutes\noff the male world record.\n\n00:07:00.373 --> 00:07:02.678\nThen you go beyond 26 miles,\ninto the distance\n\n00:07:02.702 --> 00:07:05.635\nthat medical science also told us\nwould be fatal to humans --\n\n00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:08.025\nremember Pheidippides died\nwhen he ran 26 miles --\n\n00:07:08.049 --> 00:07:11.317\nyou get to 50 and 100 miles,\nand suddenly, it's a different game.\n\n00:07:11.341 --> 00:07:14.584\nYou take a runner like Ann Trason\nor Nikki Kimball or Jenn Shelton,\n\n00:07:14.608 --> 00:07:18.035\nput them in a race of 50 or 100 miles\nagainst anybody in the world,\n\n00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:20.036\nand it's a coin toss who's going to win.\n\n00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.406\nI'll give you an example.\n\n00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.945\nA couple years ago,\nEmily Baer signed up for a race\n\n00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:25.659\ncalled the Hardrock 100,\n\n00:07:25.683 --> 00:07:28.245\nwhich tells you all you need\nto know about the race.\n\n00:07:28.269 --> 00:07:30.308\nThey give you 48 hours\nto finish this race.\n\n00:07:30.332 --> 00:07:32.237\nWell, Emily Baer -- 500 runners --\n\n00:07:32.261 --> 00:07:34.608\nshe finishes in eighth place,\nin the top 10,\n\n00:07:34.632 --> 00:07:36.886\neven though she stopped\nat all the aid stations\n\n00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.805\nto breastfeed her baby during the race.\n\n00:07:38.829 --> 00:07:39.843\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:39.867 --> 00:07:41.565\nAnd yet, she beat 492 other people.\n\n00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:43.246\nThe last mystery:\n\n00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.054\nWhy is it that women get stronger\nas distances get longer?\n\n00:07:46.078 --> 00:07:47.414\nThe third mystery is this:\n\n00:07:47.438 --> 00:07:50.906\nAt the University of Utah,\nthey started tracking finishing times\n\n00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.590\nfor people running the marathon.\n\n00:07:52.614 --> 00:07:56.421\nWhat they found is that if you start\nrunning the marathon at age 19,\n\n00:07:56.445 --> 00:07:58.698\nyou'll get progressively\nfaster, year by year,\n\n00:07:58.722 --> 00:08:00.699\nuntil you reach your peak at age 27.\n\n00:08:00.723 --> 00:08:04.699\nAnd then after that,\nyou succumb to the rigors of time.\n\n00:08:04.723 --> 00:08:06.315\nAnd you'll get slower and slower,\n\n00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:09.928\nuntil eventually you're back to running\nthe same speed you were at age 19.\n\n00:08:09.952 --> 00:08:12.193\nSo about seven, eight years\nto reach your peak,\n\n00:08:12.217 --> 00:08:14.293\nand then gradually you fall off your peak,\n\n00:08:14.317 --> 00:08:16.595\nuntil you go back to the starting point.\n\n00:08:16.619 --> 00:08:19.839\nYou'd think it might take eight years\nto go back to the same speed,\n\n00:08:19.863 --> 00:08:22.595\nmaybe 10 years -- no, it's 45 years.\n\n00:08:22.619 --> 00:08:24.596\n64-year-old men and women\n\n00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.659\nare running as fast\nas they were at age 19.\n\n00:08:27.683 --> 00:08:30.671\nNow, I defy you to come\nup with any other physical activity --\n\n00:08:30.695 --> 00:08:33.657\nand please don't say golf --\nsomething that's actually hard --\n\n00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:34.729\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:34.753 --> 00:08:39.300\nwhere geriatrics are performing\nas well as they did as teenagers.\n\n00:08:39.324 --> 00:08:41.124\nSo you have these three mysteries.\n\n00:08:41.619 --> 00:08:45.596\nIs there one piece in the puzzle\nwhich might wrap all these things up?\n\n00:08:45.899 --> 00:08:48.987\nYou've got to be careful anytime\nsomeone looks back in prehistory\n\n00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:51.317\nand tries to give you\na global answer because,\n\n00:08:51.341 --> 00:08:54.128\nit being prehistory, you can say\nwhatever the hell you want\n\n00:08:54.152 --> 00:08:55.311\nand get away with it.\n\n00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:56.701\nBut I'll submit this to you:\n\n00:08:56.725 --> 00:08:59.426\nIf you put one piece in the middle\nof this jigsaw puzzle,\n\n00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.828\nsuddenly it all starts\nto form a coherent picture.\n\n00:09:01.852 --> 00:09:04.240\nIf you're wondering\nwhy the Tarahumara don't fight\n\n00:09:04.264 --> 00:09:05.788\nand don't die of heart disease,\n\n00:09:05.812 --> 00:09:08.572\nwhy a poor Ethiopian\nwoman named Derartu Tulu\n\n00:09:08.596 --> 00:09:11.425\ncan be the most compassionate\nand yet the most competitive,\n\n00:09:11.449 --> 00:09:15.272\nand why we somehow were able\nto find food without weapons,\n\n00:09:15.296 --> 00:09:17.273\nperhaps it's because humans,\n\n00:09:17.297 --> 00:09:20.519\nas much as we like to think of ourselves\nas masters of the universe,\n\n00:09:20.543 --> 00:09:23.961\nactually evolved as nothing more\nthan a pack of hunting dogs.\n\n00:09:24.366 --> 00:09:27.820\nMaybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal.\n\n00:09:28.191 --> 00:09:30.767\nBecause the one advantage\nwe have in the wilderness --\n\n00:09:30.791 --> 00:09:33.247\nagain, it's not our fangs,\nour claws or our speed --\n\n00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:35.596\nthe only thing we do really well is sweat.\n\n00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.398\nWe're really good\nat being sweaty and smelly.\n\n00:09:38.422 --> 00:09:41.660\nBetter than any other mammal\non Earth, we can sweat really well.\n\n00:09:41.684 --> 00:09:45.548\nBut the advantage of that little bit\nof social discomfort\n\n00:09:45.572 --> 00:09:50.679\nis the fact that, when it comes to running\nunder hot heat for long distances,\n\n00:09:50.703 --> 00:09:52.947\nwe're superb -- the best on the planet.\n\n00:09:52.971 --> 00:09:55.056\nYou take a horse on a hot day,\n\n00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.968\nand after about five or six miles,\nthat horse has a choice:\n\n00:09:57.992 --> 00:10:00.645\nit's either going to breathe\nor it's going to cool off.\n\n00:10:00.669 --> 00:10:02.247\nBut it ain't doing both.

Right?\n\n00:12:07.918 --> 00:12:10.684\nWe try to can it and package it\nand make it \"better\"\n\n00:12:10.708 --> 00:12:12.097\nand then sell it to people.\n\n00:12:12.121 --> 00:12:14.615\nAnd then what happened was,\nwe started creating\n\n00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:18.073\nthese fancy cushioned things\nwhich can make running \"better,\"\n\n00:12:18.097 --> 00:12:19.513\ncalled running shoes.\n\n00:12:19.537 --> 00:12:22.469\nThe reason I get personally\npissed-off about running shoes\n\n00:12:22.493 --> 00:12:25.470\nis because I bought a million of them\nand I kept getting hurt.\n\n00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:27.471\nAnd I think if anybody in here runs --\n\n00:12:27.495 --> 00:12:29.275\nI just had a conversation with Carol.\n\n00:12:29.299 --> 00:12:32.930\nWe talked for two minutes backstage,\nand she talked about plantar fasciitis.\n\n00:12:32.954 --> 00:12:35.505\nYou talk to a runner,\nI guarantee within 30 seconds,\n\n00:12:35.529 --> 00:12:37.158\nthe conversation turns to injury.\n\n00:12:37.182 --> 00:12:40.469\nSo if humans evolved as runners,\nif that's our one natural advantage,\n\n00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:41.966\nthen why are we so bad at it?\n\n00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:43.601\nWhy do we keep getting hurt?\n\n00:12:43.625 --> 00:12:45.997\nA curious thing about running\nand running injuries\n\n00:12:46.021 --> 00:12:48.509\nis that the running injury\nis new to our time.\n\n00:12:48.533 --> 00:12:50.357\nIf you read folklore and mythology,\n\n00:12:50.381 --> 00:12:52.382\nany kind of myths, any kind of tall tales,\n\n00:12:52.406 --> 00:12:56.014\nrunning is always associated\nwith freedom and vitality\n\n00:12:56.038 --> 00:12:57.834\nand youthfulness and eternal vigor.\n\n00:12:57.858 --> 00:13:00.752\nIt's only in our lifetime\nthat running has become associated\n\n00:13:00.776 --> 00:13:01.931\nwith fear and pain.\n\n00:13:01.955 --> 00:13:06.066\nGeronimo used to say, \"My only friends\nare my legs. I only trust my legs.\"\n\n00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:09.709\nThat's because an Apache triathlon\nused to be you'd run 50 miles\n\n00:13:09.733 --> 00:13:10.884\nacross the desert,\n\n00:13:10.908 --> 00:13:13.520\nengage in hand-to-hand combat,\nsteal a bunch of horses,\n\n00:13:13.544 --> 00:13:14.874\nand slap leather for home.\n\n00:13:14.898 --> 00:13:18.623\nGeronimo was never saying, \"You know\nsomething, my Achilles -- I'm tapering.\n\n00:13:18.647 --> 00:13:20.207\nI've got to take this week off.\"\n\n00:13:20.231 --> 00:13:23.248\nOr, \"I need to cross-train.\nI didn't do yoga.

So what?\n\n00:14:09.727 --> 00:14:12.596\nSo you burn off the H\u00e4agen-Dazs\nfrom the night before.\n\n00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.042\nBut maybe there's another\nbenefit there as well.\n\n00:14:15.066 --> 00:14:18.199\nWithout getting too extreme about this,\n\n00:14:18.223 --> 00:14:22.834\nimagine a world where everybody\ncould go out the door\n\n00:14:22.858 --> 00:14:24.834\nand engage in the kind of exercise\n\n00:14:24.858 --> 00:14:27.834\nthat's going to make them\nmore relaxed, more serene,\n\n00:14:27.858 --> 00:14:29.163\nmore healthy,\n\n00:14:29.187 --> 00:14:30.499\nburn off stress --\n\n00:14:30.523 --> 00:14:33.712\nwhere you don't come back into your office\na raging maniac anymore,\n\n00:14:33.736 --> 00:14:36.220\nor go home with a lot of stress\non top of you again.\n\n00:14:36.244 --> 00:14:38.575\nMaybe there's something\nbetween what we are today\n\n00:14:38.599 --> 00:14:41.107\nand what the Tarahumara have always been.\n\n00:14:41.131 --> 00:14:43.360\nI don't say let's go back\nto the Copper Canyons\n\n00:14:43.384 --> 00:14:46.769\nand live on corn and maize,\nwhich is the Tarahumara's preferred diet,\n\n00:14:46.793 --> 00:14:48.873\nbut maybe there's somewhere in between.\n\n00:14:48.897 --> 00:14:50.564\nAnd if we find that thing,\n\n00:14:50.588 --> 00:14:53.168\nmaybe there is a big fat\nNobel Prize out there.\n\n00:14:53.192 --> 00:14:58.079\nBecause if somebody could find a way\nto restore that natural ability\n\n00:14:58.103 --> 00:15:00.275\nthat we all enjoyed\nfor most of our existence\n\n00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:01.870\nup until the 1970s or so,\n\n00:15:01.894 --> 00:15:07.285\nthe benefits -- social and physical\nand political and mental --\n\n00:15:07.309 --> 00:15:08.582\ncould be astounding.\n\n00:15:08.606 --> 00:15:12.675\nWhat I've been seeing today\nis there is a growing subculture\n\n00:15:12.699 --> 00:15:15.618\nof barefoot runners,\npeople who've gotten rid of their shoes.\n\n00:15:15.642 --> 00:15:17.528\nAnd what they have found uniformly is,\n\n00:15:17.552 --> 00:15:20.079\nyou get rid of the shoes,\nyou get rid of the stress,\n\n00:15:20.103 --> 00:15:22.571\nyou get rid of the injuries\nand the ailments.\n\n00:15:22.595 --> 00:15:25.385\nAnd what you find is something\nthe Tarahumara have known\n\n00:15:25.409 --> 00:15:26.574\nfor a very long time:\n\n00:15:26.598 --> 00:15:28.360\nthat this can be a whole lot of fun.\n\n00:15:28.384 --> 00:15:30.211\nI've experienced it personally myself.\n\n00:15:30.235 --> 00:15:33.591\nI was injured all my life; then\nin my early 40s, I got rid of my shoes\n\n00:15:33.615 --> 00:15:35.834\nand my running ailments\nhave gone away, too.\n\n00:15:35.858 --> 00:15:38.416\nSo hopefully it's something\nwe can all benefit from.\n\n00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.482\nI appreciate your listening to this story.\n\n00:15:40.506 --> 00:15:41.657\nThanks very much.\n\n00:15:41.681 --> 00:15:43.672\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Poems of war, peace, women, power", "duration": "353", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/suheir_hammad_poems_of_war_peace_women_power", "transcript": "\"What I Will\"I will not dance to your war drum. I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum. I will not dance to that beating. I know that beat. It is lifeless. I know intimately that skin you are hitting. It was alive once, hunted, stolen, stretched. I will not dance to your drummed-up war. I will not pop, spin, break for you. I will not hate for you or even hate you. I will not kill for you. Especially I will not die for you. I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide. I will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing. Everyone can be wrong.

I understand.I've been wrong a lot lately. Like a lot. So I couldn't figure out what to read today. I mean, I've been saying I've been prepping. What that means is prepping my outfit, (Laughter) prepping options, trying to figure out what I'm coming behind and going in front of. Poetry does that. It preps you. It aims you.So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now. But I'm going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here. Hold her now with you. You don't need to say her name out loud, you can just hold her. Are you holding her?This is \"Break Clustered.\"All holy history banned. Unwritten books predicted the future, projected the past. But my head unwraps around what appears limitless, man's creative violence. Whose son shall it be? Which male child will perish a new day? Our boys' deaths galvanize. We cherish corpses. We mourn women, complicated. Bitches get beat daily. Profits made, prophets ignored. War and tooth, enameled salted lemon childhoods. All colors run, none of us solid. Don't look for shadow behind me. I carry it within. I live cycles of light and darkness. Rhythm is half silence. I see now, I never was one and not the other. Sickness, health, tender violence. I think now I never was pure. Before form I was storm, blind, ign'ant \u2014 still am. Human contracted itself blind, malignant. I never was pure. Girl spoiled before ripened. Language can't math me. I experience exponentially. Everything is everything. One woman loses 15, maybe 20, members of her family. One woman loses six. One woman loses her head. One woman searches rubble. One woman feeds on trash. One woman shoots her face. One woman shoots her husband. One woman straps herself. One woman gives birth to a baby. One woman gives birth to borders. One woman no longer believes love will ever find her. One woman never did. Where do refugee hearts go? Broken, dissed, placed where they're not from, don't want to be missed. Faced with absence. We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all. My spine curves spiral. Precipice running to and running from human beings. Cluster bombs left behind. De facto landmines. A smoldering grief. Harvest contaminated tobacco. Harvest bombs. Harvest baby teeth. Harvest palms, smoke. Harvest witness, smoke. Resolutions, smoke. Salvation, smoke. Redemption, smoke. Breathe.

I'd like all of you to pause for a moment, you wretched weaklings, and take stock of your miserable existence. (Laughter)Now that was the advice that St. Benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century. It was the advice that I decided to follow myself when I turned 40. Up until that moment, I had been that classic corporate warrior \u2014 I was eating too much, I was drinking too much, I was working too hard and I was neglecting the family. And I decided that I would try and turn my life around. In particular, I decided I would try to address the thorny issue of work-life balance. So I stepped back from the workforce, and I spent a year at home with my wife and four young children. But all I learned about work-life balance from that year was that I found it quite easy to balance work and life when I didn't have any work. (Laughter) Not a very useful skill, especially when the money runs out.So I went back to work, and I've spent these seven years since struggling with, studying and writing about work-life balance. And I have four observations I'd like to share with you today. The first is: if society's to make any progress on this issue, we need an honest debate. But the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work-life balance. All the discussions about flexi-time or dress-down Fridays or paternity leave only serve to mask the core issue, which is that certain job and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningfully engaged on a day-to-day basis with a young family. Now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in. And the reality of the society that we're in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet, screaming desperation, where they work long, hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don't need to impress people they don't like. (Laughter) (Applause) It's my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and [a] T-shirt isn't really getting to the nub of the issue.(Laughter)The second observation I'd like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations aren't going to solve this issue for us. We should stop looking outside. It's up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead. If you don't design your life, someone else will design it for you, and you may just not like their idea of balance. It's particularly important \u2014 this isn't on the World Wide Web, is it? I'm about to get fired \u2014 it's particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial corporation. Now I'm not talking here just about the bad companies \u2014 the \"abattoirs of the human soul,\" as I call them. (Laughter) I'm talking about all companies. Because commercial companies are inherently designed to get as much out of you [as] they can get away with. It's in their nature; it's in their DNA; it's what they do \u2014 even the good, well-intentioned companies. On the one hand, putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened. On the other hand, it's a nightmare \u2014 it just means you spend more time at the bloody office. We have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life.The third observation is we have to be careful with the time frame that we choose upon which to judge our balance. Before I went back to work after my year at home, I sat down and I wrote out a detailed, step-by-step description of the ideal balanced day that I aspired to. And it went like this: wake up well rested after a good night's sleep. Have sex. Walk the dog. Have breakfast with my wife and children. Have sex again. (Laughter) Drive the kids to school on the way to the office. Do three hours' work. Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime. Do another three hours' work. Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink. Drive home for dinner with my wife and kids. Meditate for half an hour. Have sex. Walk the dog. Have sex again. Go to bed. (Applause) How often do you think I have that day? (Laughter) We need to be realistic. You can't do it all in one day. We need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life, but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of the \"I'll have a life when I retire, when my kids have left home, when my wife has divorced me, my health is failing, I've got no mates or interests left.\" (Laughter) A day is too short; \"after I retire\" is too long. There's got to be a middle way.A fourth observation: We need to approach balance in a balanced way. A friend came to see me last year \u2014 and she doesn't mind me telling this story \u2014 a friend came to see me last year and said, \"Nigel, I've read your book. And I realize that my life is completely out of balance. It's totally dominated by work. I work 10 hours a day; I commute two hours a day. All of my relationships have failed. There's nothing in my life apart from my work. So I've decided to get a grip and sort it out. So I joined a gym.\" (Laughter) Now I don't mean to mock, but being a fit 10-hour-a-day office rat isn't more balanced; it's more fit. (Laughter) Lovely though physical exercise may be, there are other parts to life \u2014 there's the intellectual side; there's the emotional side; there's the spiritual side. And to be balanced, I believe we have to attend to all of those areas \u2014 not just do 50 stomach crunches.Now that can be daunting. Because people say, \"Bloody hell mate, I haven't got time to get fit. You want me to go to church and call my mother.\" And I understand. I truly understand how that can be daunting. But an incident that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new perspective. My wife, who is somewhere in the audience today, called me up at the office and said, \"Nigel, you need to pick our youngest son\" \u2014 Harry \u2014 \"up from school.\" Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening. So I left work an hour early that afternoon and picked Harry up at the school gates. We walked down to the local park, messed around on the swings, played some silly games. I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe, and we shared a pizza for two, then walked down the hill to our home, and I gave him his bath and put him in his Batman pajamas. I then read him a chapter of Roald Dahl's \"James and the Giant Peach.\" I then put him to bed, tucked him in, gave him a kiss on his forehead and said, \"Goodnight, mate,\" and walked out of his bedroom. As I was walking out of his bedroom, he said, \"Dad?\" I went, \"Yes, mate?\" He went, \"Dad, this has been the best day of my life, ever.\" I hadn't done anything, hadn't taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation.Now my point is the small things matter. Being more balanced doesn't mean dramatic upheaval in your life. With the smallest investment in the right places, you can radically transform the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life. Moreover, I think, it can transform society. Because if enough people do it, we can change society's definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins, to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like. And that, I think, is an idea worth spreading.(Applause)", "id": 1069, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nWhat I thought I would

And as a little girl, I loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful, trusted sidekick \u2014 something that would delight us, enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two. I knew robots like that didn't really exist, but I knew I wanted to build them.So 20 years pass \u2014 I am now a graduate student at MIT studying artificial intelligence, the year is 1997, and NASA has just landed the first robot on Mars. But robots are still not in our home, ironically. And I remember thinking about all the reasons why that was the case. But one really struck me. Robotics had really been about interacting with things, not with people \u2014 certainly not in a social way that would be natural for us and would really help people accept robots into our daily lives. For me, that was the white space; that's what robots could not do yet. And so that year, I started to build this robot, Kismet, the world's first social robot. Three years later \u2014 a lot of programming, working with other graduate students in the lab \u2014 Kismet was ready to start interacting with people.(Video) Scientist: I want to show you something.Kismet: (Nonsense)Scientist: This is a watch that my girlfriend gave me.Kismet: (Nonsense)Scientist: Yeah, look, it's got a little blue light in it too. I almost lost it this week.Cynthia Breazeal: So Kismet interacted with people like kind of a non-verbal child or pre-verbal child, which I assume was fitting because it was really the first of its kind. It didn't speak language, but it didn't matter. This little robot was somehow able to tap into something deeply social within us \u2014 and with that, the promise of an entirely new way we could interact with robots.So over the past several years I've been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots, now at the media lab with my own team of incredibly talented students. And one of my favorite robots is Leonardo. We developed Leonardo in collaboration with Stan Winston Studio. And so I want to show you a special moment for me of Leo. This is Matt Berlin interacting with Leo, introducing Leo to a new object. And because it's new, Leo doesn't really know what to make of it. But sort of like us, he can actually learn about it from watching Matt's reaction.(Video) Matt Berlin: Hello, Leo. Leo, this is Cookie Monster. Can you find Cookie Monster? Leo, Cookie Monster is very bad. He's very bad, Leo. Cookie Monster is very, very bad. He's a scary monster. He wants to get your cookies.(Laughter)CB: All right, so Leo and Cookie might have gotten off to a little bit of a rough start, but they get along great now.So what I've learned through building these systems is that robots are actually a really intriguing social technology, where it's actually their ability to push our social buttons and to interact with us like a partner that is a core part of their functionality. And with that shift in thinking, we can now start to imagine new questions, new possibilities for robots that we might not have thought about otherwise. But what do I mean when I say \"push our social buttons?\" Well, one of the things that we've learned is that, if we design these robots to communicate with us using the same body language, the same sort of non-verbal cues that people use \u2014 like Nexi, our humanoid robot, is doing here \u2014 what we find is that people respond to robots a lot like they respond to people. People use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is, how likable, how engaging, how trustworthy. It turns out it's the same for robots.It's turning out now that robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific tool to understand human behavior. To answer questions like, how is it that, from a brief encounter, we're able to make an estimate of how trustworthy another person is? Mimicry's believed to play a role, but how? Is it the mimicking of particular gestures that matters? It turns out it's really hard to learn this or understand this from watching people because when we interact we do all of these cues automatically. We can't carefully control them because they're subconscious for us. But with the robot, you can.And so in this video here \u2014 this is a video taken from David DeSteno's lab at Northeastern University. He's a psychologist we've been collaborating with. There's actually a scientist carefully controlling Nexi's cues to be able to study this question. And the bottom line is \u2014 the reason why this works is because it turns out people just behave like people even when interacting with a robot. So given that key insight, we can now start to imagine new kinds of applications for robots. For instance, if robots do respond to our non-verbal cues, maybe they would be a cool, new communication technology. So imagine this: What about a robot accessory for your cellphone? You call your friend, she puts her handset in a robot, and, bam! You're a MeBot \u2014 you can make eye contact, you can talk with your friends, you can move around, you can gesture \u2014 maybe the next best thing to really being there, or is it?To explore this question, my student, Siggy Adalgeirsson, did a study where we brought human participants, people, into our lab to do a collaborative task with a remote collaborator. The task involved things like looking at a set of objects on the table, discussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task \u2014 this ended up being a survival task \u2014 and then rating them in terms of how valuable and important they thought they were. The remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group who used one of three different technologies to interact with the participants. The first was just the screen. This is just like video conferencing today. The next was to add mobility \u2014 so, have the screen on a mobile base. This is like, if you're familiar with any of the telepresence robots today \u2014 this is mirroring that situation. And then the fully expressive MeBot.So after the interaction, we asked people to rate their quality of interaction with the technology, with a remote collaborator through this technology, in a number of different ways. We looked at psychological involvement \u2014 how much empathy did you feel for the other person? We looked at overall engagement. We looked at their desire to cooperate. And this is what we see when they use just the screen. It turns out, when you add mobility \u2014 the ability to roll around the table \u2014 you get a little more of a boost. And you get even more of a boost when you add the full expression. So it seems like this physical, social embodiment actually really makes a difference.Now let's try to put this into a little bit of context. Today we know that families are living further and further apart, and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships and family bonds over distance. For me, I have three young boys, and I want them to have a really good relationship with their grandparents. But my parents live thousands of miles away, so they just don't get to see each other that often. We try Skype, we try phone calls, but my boys are little \u2014 they don't really want to talk; they want to play. So I love the idea of thinking about robots as a new kind of distance-play technology. I imagine a time not too far from now \u2014 my mom can go to her computer, open up a browser and jack into a little robot. And as grandma-bot, she can now play, really play, with my sons, with her grandsons, in the real world with his real toys. I could imagine grandmothers being able to do social-plays with their granddaughters, with their friends, and to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house, like sharing a bedtime story. And through this technology, being able to be an active participant in their grandchildren's lives in a way that's not possible today.Let's think about some other domains, like maybe health. So in the United States today, over 65 percent of people are either overweight or obese, and now it's a big problem with our children as well. And we know that as you get older in life, if you're obese when you're younger, that can lead to chronic diseases that not only reduce your quality of life, but are a tremendous economic burden on our health care system. But if robots can be engaging, if we like to cooperate with robots, if robots are persuasive, maybe a robot can help you maintain a diet and exercise program, maybe they can help you manage your weight. Sort of like a digital Jiminy \u2014 as in the well-known fairy tale \u2014 a kind of friendly, supportive presence that's always there to be able to help you make the right decision in the right way at the right time to help you form healthy habits. So we actually explored this idea in our lab.This is a robot, Autom. Cory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work. And it was designed to be a robot diet-and-exercise coach. It had a couple of simple non-verbal skills it could do. It could make eye contact with you. It could share information looking down at a screen. You'd use a screen interface to enter information, like how many calories you ate that day, how much exercise you got. And then it could help track that for you. And the robot spoke with a synthetic voice to engage you in a coaching dialogue modeled after trainers and patients and so forth. And it would build a working alliance with you through that dialogue. It could help you set goals and track your progress, and it would help motivate you.So an interesting question is, does the social embodiment really matter? Does it matter that it's a robot? Is it really just the quality of advice and information that matters? To explore that question, we did a study in the Boston area where we put one of three interventions in people's homes for a period of several weeks. One case was the robot you saw there, Autom. Another was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface, ran exactly the same dialogues. The quality of advice was identical. And the third was just a pen and paper log, because that's the standard intervention you typically get when you start a diet-and-exercise program.So one of the things we really wanted to look at was not how much weight people lost, but really how long they interacted with the robot. Because the challenge is not losing weight, it's actually keeping it off. And the longer you could interact with one of these interventions, well that's indicative, potentially, of longer-term success. So the first thing I want to look at is how long, how long did people interact with these systems. It turns out that people interacted with the robot significantly more, even though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer. When it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance, people rated the robot higher and they trusted the robot more. (Laughter) And when you look at emotional engagement, it was completely different. People would name the robots. They would dress the robots. (Laughter) And even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study, they would come out to the car and say good-bye to the robots. They didn't do this with a computer.The last thing I want to talk about today is the future of children's media. We know that kids spend a lot of time behind screens today, whether it's television or computer games or whatnot. My sons, they love the screen. They love the screen. But I want them to play; as a mom, I want them to play, like, real-world play. And so I have a new project in my group I wanted to present to you today called Playtime Computing that's really trying to think about how we can take what's so engaging about digital media and literally bring it off the screen into the real world of the child, where it can take on many of the properties of real-world play. So here's the first exploration of this idea, where characters can be physical or virtual, and where the digital content can literally come off the screen into the world and back. I like to think of this as the Atari Pong of this blended-reality play.But we can push this idea further. What if \u2014 (Game) Nathan: Here it comes. Yay! CB: \u2014 the character itself could come into your world? It turns out that kids love it when the character becomes real and enters into their world. And when it's in their world, they can relate to it and play with it in a way that's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen. Another important idea is this notion of persistence of character across realities. So changes that children make in the real world need to translate to the virtual world. So here, Nathan has changed the letter A to the number 2. You can imagine maybe these symbols give the characters special powers when it goes into the virtual world. So they are now sending the character back into that world. And now it's got number power.And then finally, what I've been trying to do here is create a really immersive experience for kids, where they really feel like they are part of that story, a part of that experience. And I really want to spark their imaginations the way mine was sparked as a little girl watching \"Star Wars.\" But I want to do more than that. I actually want them to create those experiences. I want them to be able to literally build their imagination into these experiences and make them their own. So we've been exploring a lot of ideas in telepresence and mixed reality to literally allow kids to project their ideas into this space where other kids can interact with them and build upon them. I really want to come up with new ways of children's media that foster creativity and learning and innovation. I think that's very, very important.So this is a new project. We've invited a lot of kids into this space, and they think it's pretty cool. But I can tell you, the thing that they love the most is the robot. What they care about is the robot. Robots touch something deeply human within us. And so whether they're helping us to become creative and innovative, or whether they're helping us to feel more deeply connected despite distance, or whether they are our trusted sidekick who's helping us attain our personal goals in becoming our highest and best selves, for me, robots are all about people.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1070, "subtitle":

00:02:04.958\nI've been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots,\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nnow at the media lab\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nwith my own team of

bit of a rough start,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nbut they get along great now.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nSo what I've learned\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nthrough building these systems\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nis that robots are actually\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\na really intriguing social technology,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nwhere it's actually their ability\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nto push our social buttons\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nand to interact with us like a partner\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nthat is a core

robots\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nthat we might not have thought about otherwise.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nBut what do I mean when I say \"push our social buttons?\"\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nWell, one of the things that we've learned\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nis that, if we design these robots to communicate with us\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nusing the same body language,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nthe same sort of non-verbal cues that people use --\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nlike Nexi, our humanoid robot, is doing here --\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nwhat we find is that people respond to robots\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\na lot like they respond to people.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nPeople use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nhow likable, how engaging,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nhow trustworthy.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nIt turns out it's the same for robots.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nIt's turning out now\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nthat robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific tool\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nto understand human behavior.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nTo answer questions like, how is it that, from a brief encounter,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nwe're able to make an estimate of how trustworthy another person is?\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nMimicry's believed to play a role, but how?\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nIs it the mimicking of particular gestures that matters?\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nIt turns out it's really hard\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nto learn this or understand this from watching people\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nbecause when we interact we do all of these cues automatically.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nWe can't carefully control them because they're subconscious for us.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nBut with the robot, you can.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nAnd so in this video here --\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nthis is a video taken from David DeSteno's lab at Northeastern University.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nHe's a psychologist we've been collaborating with.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nThere's actually a scientist carefully controlling Nexi's cues\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nto be able to study this question.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nAnd the bottom line is -- the reason why this works is\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nbecause it turns out people just behave like people\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\neven when interacting with a robot.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nSo given that key insight,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nwe can now start to imagine\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nnew kinds of applications for robots.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nFor instance, if robots do respond to our non-verbal cues,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nmaybe they would be a cool, new communication technology.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nSo imagine this:\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nWhat about a robot accessory for your cellphone?\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nYou call your friend, she puts her handset in a robot,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nand, bam! You're a MeBot --\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nyou can make eye contact, you can talk with your friends,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nyou can move around, you can gesture --\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nmaybe the next best thing to really being there, or is it?\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nTo explore this question,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nmy student, Siggy Adalgeirsson, did a study\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nwhere we brought human participants, people, into our lab\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nto do a collaborative task\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nwith a remote collaborator.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nThe task involved things\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nlike looking at a set of objects on the table,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\ndiscussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task --\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nthis ended up being a survival task --\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand then rating them in terms\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nof how valuable and important they thought they were.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nThe remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nwho used one of three different technologies\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nto interact with the participants.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nThe first was just the screen.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nThis is just like video conferencing today.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nThe next was to add mobility -- so, have the screen on a mobile base.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nThis is like, if you're familiar with any of the telepresence robots today --\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nthis is mirroring that situation.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nAnd then the fully expressive MeBot.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nSo after the interaction,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nwe asked people to rate their quality of interaction\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nwith the technology, with a remote collaborator\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nthrough this technology, in a number of different ways.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nWe looked at psychological involvement --\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nhow much empathy did you feel for the other person?\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nWe looked at overall engagement.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nWe looked at their desire to cooperate.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nAnd this is what we see when they use just the screen.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nIt turns out, when you add mobility -- the ability to roll around the table --\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nyou get a little more of a boost.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nAnd you get even more of a boost when you add the full expression.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nSo it seems like this physical, social embodiment\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nactually really makes a difference.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nNow let's try to put this into a little bit of context.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nToday we know that families are living further and further apart,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nand that definitely takes a toll on family relationships\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nand family bonds over distance.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nFor me, I have three young boys,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nand I want them to have a really good relationship\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nwith their grandparents.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nBut my parents live thousands of miles away,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nso they just don't get to see each other that often.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nWe try Skype, we try phone calls,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nbut my boys are little -- they don't really want to talk;\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nthey want to play.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nSo I love the idea of thinking about robots\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nas a new kind of distance-play technology.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nI imagine a time not too far from now --\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nmy mom can go to her computer,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nopen up a browser and jack into a little robot.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nAnd as grandma-bot,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nshe can now play, really play,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nwith my sons, with her grandsons,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nin the real world with his real toys.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nI could imagine grandmothers being able to do social-plays\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nwith their granddaughters, with their friends,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nand to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nlike sharing a bedtime story.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nAnd through this technology,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nbeing able to be an active participant\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nin their grandchildren's lives\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nin a way that's not possible today.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nLet's think about some other domains,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nlike maybe health.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nSo in the United States today,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nover 65 percent of people are either overweight or obese,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nand now it's a big problem with our children as well.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nAnd we know that as you get older in life,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nif you're obese when you're younger, that can lead to chronic diseases\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nthat not only reduce your quality of life,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nbut are a tremendous economic burden on our health care system.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nBut if robots can be engaging,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nif we like to cooperate with robots,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nif robots are persuasive,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nmaybe a robot can help you\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nmaintain a diet and exercise program,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nmaybe they can help you manage your weight.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nSort of like a digital Jiminy --\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nas in the well-known fairy tale --\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\na kind of friendly, supportive presence that's always there\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nto be able to help you make the right decision\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nin the right way at the right time\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nto help you form healthy habits.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nSo we actually explored this idea in our lab.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nThis is a robot, Autom.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nCory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nAnd it was designed to be a robot diet-and-exercise coach.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nIt had a couple of simple non-verbal skills it could do.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nIt could make eye contact with you.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nIt could share information looking down at a screen.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nYou'd use a screen interface to enter information,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nlike how many calories you ate that day,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nhow much exercise you got.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nAnd then it could help track that for you.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nAnd the robot spoke with a synthetic voice\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nto engage you in a coaching dialogue\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nmodeled after trainers\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nand patients and so forth.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nAnd it would build a working alliance with you\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nthrough that dialogue.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nIt could help you set goals and track your progress,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nand it would help motivate you.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nSo an interesting question is,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\ndoes the social embodiment really matter? Does it matter that it's a robot?\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nIs it really just the quality of advice and information that matters?\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nTo explore that question,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nwe did a study in the Boston area\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nwhere we put one of three interventions in people's homes\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nfor a period of several weeks.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nOne case was the robot you saw there, Autom.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nAnother was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nran exactly the same dialogues.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nThe quality of advice was identical.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nAnd the third was just a pen and paper log,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nbecause that's the standard intervention you typically get\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nwhen you start a diet-and-exercise program.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nSo one of the things we really wanted to look at\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nwas not how much weight people lost,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nbut really how long they interacted with the robot.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nBecause the challenge is not losing weight, it's actually keeping it off.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nAnd the longer you could interact with one of these interventions,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nwell that's indicative, potentially, of longer-term success.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nSo the first thing I want to look at is how long,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nhow long did people interact with these systems.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nIt turns out that people interacted with the robot\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nsignificantly more,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\neven though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nWhen it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\npeople rated the robot higher\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nand they trusted the robot more.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nAnd when you look at emotional engagement,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nit was completely different.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nPeople would name the robots.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nThey would dress the robots.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nAnd even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nthey would come out to the car and say good-bye to the robots.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nThey didn't do this with a computer.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nThe last thing I want to talk about today\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nis the future of children's media.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nWe know that kids spend a lot of time behind screens today,\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nwhether it's television or computer games or whatnot.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nMy sons, they love the screen. They love the screen.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nBut I want them to play; as a mom, I want them to play,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nlike, real-world play.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nAnd so I have a new project in my group I wanted to present to you today\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\ncalled Playtime Computing\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nthat's really trying to think about how we can take\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nwhat's so engaging about digital media\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nand literally bring it off the screen\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\ninto the real world of the child,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nwhere it can take on many of the properties of real-world play.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nSo here's the first exploration of this idea,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nwhere characters can be physical or virtual,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nand where the digital content\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\ncan literally come off the screen\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\ninto the world and back.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nI like to think of this\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nas the Atari Pong\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nof this blended-reality play.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nBut we can push this idea further.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nWhat if --\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\n(Game) Nathan: Here it comes. Yay!\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nCB: -- the character itself could come into your world?\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nIt turns out that kids love it\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nwhen the character becomes real and enters into their world.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nAnd when it's in their world,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nthey can relate to it and play with it in a way\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nthat's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nAnother important idea is this notion\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nof persistence of character across realities.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nSo changes that children make in the real world\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nneed to translate to the virtual world.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nSo here, Nathan has changed the letter A to the number 2.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nYou can imagine maybe these symbols\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\ngive the characters special powers when it goes into the virtual world.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nSo they are now sending the character back into that world.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nAnd now it's got number power.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nAnd then finally, what I've been trying to do here\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nis create a really immersive experience for kids,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nwhere they really feel like they are part of that story,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\na part of that experience.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nAnd I really want to spark their imaginations\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nthe way mine was sparked as a little girl watching \"Star Wars.\"\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nBut I want to do more than that.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nI actually want them to create those experiences.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nI want them to be able to literally build their imagination\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\ninto these experiences and make them their own.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nSo we've been exploring a lot of ideas\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nin telepresence and mixed reality\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nto literally allow kids to project their ideas into this space\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nwhere other kids can interact with them\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nand build upon them.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nI really want to come up with new ways of children's media\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nthat foster creativity and learning and innovation.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nI think that's very, very important.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nSo this is a new project.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nWe've invited a lot of kids into this space,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nand they think it's pretty cool.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nBut I can tell you, the thing that they love the most\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nis the robot.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nWhat they care about is the robot.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nRobots touch something deeply human within us.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nAnd so whether they're helping us\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nto become creative and innovative,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nor whether they're helping us\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nto feel more deeply connected despite distance,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nor whether they are our trusted sidekick\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nwho's helping us attain our personal goals\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nin becoming our highest and best selves,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nfor me, robots are all about people.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nThank you.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:53.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Mother and daughter doctor-heroes", "duration": "523", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/mother_and_daughter_doctor_heroes_hawa_abdi_deqo_mohamed", "transcript": "Hawa Abdi: Many people \u2014 20 years for Somalia \u2014 [were] fighting. So there was no job, no food. Children, most of them, became very malnourished, like this. Deqo Mohamed: So as you know, always in a civil war, the ones affected most [are] the women and children. So our patients are women and children. And they are in our backyard. It's our home. We welcome them. That's the camp that we have in now 90,000 people, where 75 percent of them are women and children. Pat Mitchell: And this is your hospital. This is the inside. HA: We are doing C-sections and different operations because people need some help. There is no government to protect them. DM: Every morning we have about 400 patients, maybe more or less. But sometimes we are only five doctors and 16 nurses, and we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them. But we take the severe ones, and we reschedule the other ones the next day. It is very tough. And as you can see, it's the women who are carrying the children; it's the women who come into the hospitals; it's the women [are] building the houses. That's their house. And we have a school. This is our bright \u2014 we opened [in the] last two years [an] elementary school where we have 850 children, and the majority are women and girls. (Applause) PM: And the doctors have some very big rules about who can get treated at the clinic. Would you explain the rules for admission? HA: The people who are coming to us, we are welcoming. We are sharing with them whatever we have. But there are only two rules. First rule: there is no clan distinguished and political division in Somali society. [Whomever] makes those things we throw out. The second: no man can beat his wife. If he beat, we will put [him] in jail, and we will call the eldest people. Until they identify this case, we'll never release him. That's our two rules. (Applause) The other thing that I have realized, that the woman is the most strong person all over the world. Because the last 20 years, the Somali woman has stood up. They were the leaders, and we are the leaders of our community and the hope of our future generations. We are not just the helpless and the victims of the civil war. We can reconcile. We can do everything. (Applause) DM: As my mother said, we are the future hope, and the men are only killing in Somalia. So we came up with these two rules. In a camp with 90,000 people, you have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights. So there is no clan division, and no man can beat his wife. And we have a little storage room where we converted a jail. So if you beat your wife, you're going to be there. (Applause) So empowering the women and giving the opportunity \u2014 we are there for them. They are not alone for this. PM: You're running a medical clinic. It brought much, much needed medical care to people who wouldn't get it. You're also running a civil society. You've created your own rules, in which women and children are getting a different sense of security. Talk to me about your decision, Dr. Abdi, and your decision, Dr. Mohamed, to work together \u2014 for you to become a doctor and to work with your mother in these circumstances. HA: My age \u2014 because I was born in 1947 \u2014 we were having, at that time, government, law and order. But one day, I went to the hospital \u2014 my mother was sick \u2014 and I saw the hospital, how they [were] treating the doctors, how they [are] committed to help the sick people. I admired them, and I decided to become a doctor. My mother died, unfortunately, when I was 12 years [old]. Then my father allowed me to proceed [with] my hope. My mother died in [a] gynecology complication, so I decided to become a gynecology specialist. That's why I became a doctor. So Dr. Deqo has to explain. DM: For me, my mother was preparing [me] when I was a child to become a doctor, but I really didn't want to. Maybe I should become an historian, or maybe a reporter. I loved it, but it didn't work. When the war broke out \u2014 civil war \u2014 I saw how my mother was helping and how she really needed the help, and how the care is essential to the woman to be a woman doctor in Somalia and help the women and children. And I thought, maybe I can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist. (Laughter) So I went to Russia, and my mother also, [during the] time of [the] Soviet Union. So some of our character, maybe we will come with a strong Soviet background of training. So that's how I decided [to do] the same. My sister was different. She's here. She's also a doctor. She graduated in Russia also. (Applause) And to go back and to work with our mother is just what we saw in the civil war \u2014 when I was 16, and my sister was 11, when the civil war broke out. So it was the need and the people we saw in the early '90s \u2014 that's what made us go back and work for them. PM: So what is the biggest challenge working, mother and daughter, in such dangerous and sometimes scary situations? HA: Yes, I was working in a tough situation, very dangerous. And when I saw the people who needed me, I was staying with them to help, because I [could] do something for them. Most people fled abroad. But I remained with those people, and I was trying to do something \u2014 [any] little thing I [could] do. I succeeded in my place. Now my place is 90,000 people who are respecting each other, who are not fighting. But we try to stand on our feet, to do something, little things, we can for our people. And I'm thankful for my daughters. When they come to me, they help me to treat the people, to help. They do everything for them. They have done what I desire to do for them. PM: What's the best part of working with your mother, and the most challenging part for you? DM: She's very tough; it's most challenging. She always expects us to do more. And really when you think [you] cannot do it, she will push you, and I can do it. That's the best part. She shows us, trains us how to do and how to be better [people] and how to do long hours in surgery \u2014 300 patients per day, 10, 20 surgeries, and still you have to manage the camp \u2014 that's how she trains us. It is not like beautiful offices here, 20 patients, you're tired. You see 300 patients, 20 surgeries and 90,000 people to manage. PM: But you do it for good reasons. (Applause) Wait. Wait. HA: Thank you. DM: Thank you. (Applause) HA: Thank you very much.

These are spinneret glands on the abdomen of a spider. They produce six different types of silk, which is spun together into a fiber, tougher than any fiber humans have ever made. The nearest we've come is with aramid fiber. And to make that, it involves extremes of temperature, extremes of pressure and loads of pollution. And yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure with raw materials of dead flies and water. It does suggest we've still got a bit to learn. This beetle can detect a forest fire at 80 kilometers away. That's roughly 10,000 times the range of man-made fire detectors. And what's more, this guy doesn't need a wire connected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels.So these two examples give a sense of what biomimicry can deliver. If we could learn to make things and do things the way nature does, we could achieve factor 10, factor 100, maybe even factor 1,000 savings in resource and energy use. And if we're to make progress with the sustainability revolution, I believe there are three really big changes we need to bring about. Firstly, radical increases in resource efficiency. Secondly, shifting from a linear, wasteful, polluting way of using resources to a closed-loop model. And thirdly, changing from a fossil fuel economy to a solar economy. And for all three of these, I believe, biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need.You could look at nature as being like a catalog of products, and all of those have benefited from a 3.8-billion-year research and development period. And given that level of investment, it makes sense to use it. So I'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas. And let's start with radical increases in resource efficiency. When we were working on the Eden Project, we had to create a very large greenhouse in a site that was not only irregular, but it was continually changing because it was still being quarried. It was a hell of a challenge, and it was actually examples from biology that provided a lot of the clues. So for instance, it was soap bubbles that helped us generate a building form that would work regardless of the final ground levels. Studying pollen grains and radiolaria and carbon molecules helped us devise the most efficient structural solution using hexagons and pentagons.The next move was that we wanted to try and maximize the size of those hexagons. And to do that we had to find an alternative to glass, which is really very limited in terms of its unit sizes. And in nature there are lots of examples of very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes. So we started exploring this material called ETFE. It's a high-strength polymer. And what you do is you put it together in three layers, you weld it around the edge, and then you inflate it. And the great thing about this stuff is you can make it in units of roughly seven times the size of glass, and it was only one percent of the weight of double-glazing. So that was a factor-100 saving. And what we found is that we got into a positive cycle in which one breakthrough facilitated another. So with such large, lightweight pillows, we had much less steel. With less steel we were getting more sunlight in, which meant we didn't have to put as much extra heat in winter. And with less overall weight in the superstructure, there were big savings in the foundations. And at the end of the project we worked out that the weight of that superstructure was actually less than the weight of the air inside the building.So I think the Eden Project is a fairly good example of how ideas from biology can lead to radical increases in resource efficiency \u2014 delivering the same function, but with a fraction of the resource input. And actually there are loads of examples in nature that you could turn to for similar solutions. So for instance, you could develop super-efficient roof structures based on giant Amazon water lilies, whole buildings inspired by abalone shells, super-lightweight bridges inspired by plant cells. There's a world of beauty and efficiency to explore here using nature as a design tool.So now I want to go onto talking about the linear-to-closed-loop idea. The way we tend to use resources is we extract them, we turn them into short-life products and then dispose of them. Nature works very differently. In ecosystems, the waste from one organism becomes the nutrient for something else in that system. And there are some examples of projects that have deliberately tried to mimic ecosystems. And one of my favorites is called the Cardboard to Caviar Project by Graham Wiles. And in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurants that were producing lots of food, cardboard and plastic waste. It was ending up in landfills. Now the really clever bit is what they did with the cardboard waste. And I'm just going to talk through this animation.So they were paid to collect it from the restaurants. They then shredded the cardboard and sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding. When that was soiled, they were paid again to collect it. They put it into worm recomposting systems, which produced a lot of worms, which they fed to Siberian sturgeon, which produced caviar, which they sold back to the restaurants. So it transformed a linear process into a closed-loop model, and it created more value in the process. Graham Wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this, turning waste streams into schemes that create value. And just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time, there's a real sense with this project that the number of possibilities just continue increasing. And I know it's a quirky example, but I think the implications of this are quite radical, because it suggests that we could actually transform a big problem \u2014 waste \u2014 into a massive opportunity.And particularly in cities \u2014 we could look at the whole metabolism of cities, and look at those as opportunities. And that's what we're doing on the next project I'm going to talk about, the Mobius Project, where we're trying to bring together a number of activities, all within one building, so that the waste from one can be the nutrient for another. And the kind of elements I'm talking about are, firstly, we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse, a bit like this one in Amsterdam called De Kas. Then we would have an anaerobic digester, which could deal with all the biodegradable waste from the local area, turn that into heat for the greenhouse and electricity to feed back into the grid. We'd have a water treatment system treating wastewater, turning that into fresh water and generating energy from the solids using just plants and micro-organisms. We'd have a fish farm fed with vegetable waste from the kitchen and worms from the compost and supplying fish back to the restaurant. And we'd also have a coffee shop, and the waste grains from that could be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms.So you can see that we're bringing together cycles of food, energy and water and waste all within one building. And just for fun, we've proposed this for a roundabout in central London, which at the moment is a complete eyesore. Some of you may recognize this. And with just a little bit of planning, we could transform a space dominated by traffic into one that provides open space for people, reconnects people with food and transforms waste into closed loop opportunities.So the final project I want to talk about is the Sahara Forest Project, which we're working on at the moment. It may come as a surprise to some of you to hear that quite large areas of what are currently desert were actually forested a fairly short time ago. So for instance, when Julius Caesar arrived in North Africa, huge areas of North Africa were covered in cedar and cypress forests. And during the evolution of life on the Earth, it was the colonization of the land by plants that helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy. The converse is also true. The more vegetation we lose, the more that's likely to exacerbate climate change and lead to further desertification. And this animation, this shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years, and what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts shift quite a lot, and that raises the question of whether we can intervene at the boundary conditions to halt, or maybe even reverse, desertification.And if you look at some of the organisms that have evolved to live in deserts, there are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity. This is the Namibian fog-basking beetle, and it's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert. The way it does this is it comes out at night, crawls to the top of a sand dune, and because it's got a matte black shell, is able to radiate heat out to the night sky and become slightly cooler than its surroundings. So when the moist breeze blows in off the sea, you get these droplets of water forming on the beetle's shell. Just before sunrise, he tips his shell up, the water runs down into his mouth, has a good drink, goes off and hides for the rest of the day. And the ingenuity, if you could call it that, goes even further. Because if you look closely at the beetle's shell, there are lots of little bumps on that shell. And those bumps are hydrophilic; they attract water. Between them there's a waxy finish which repels water. And the effect of this is that as the droplets start to form on the bumps, they stay in tight, spherical beads, which means they're much more mobile than they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle's shell. So even when there's only a small amount of moisture in the air, it's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth. So amazing example of an adaptation to a very resource-constrained environment \u2014 and in that sense, very relevant to the kind of challenges we're going to be facing over the next few years, next few decades.We're working with the guy who invented the Seawater Greenhouse. This is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions, and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills, and you trickle seawater over that so that wind blows through, it picks up a lot of moisture and is cooled in the process. So inside it's cool and humid, which means the plants need less water to grow. And then at the back of the greenhouse, it condenses a lot of that humidity as freshwater in a process that is effectively identical to the beetle. And what they found with the first Seawater Greenhouse that was built was it was producing slightly more freshwater than it needed for the plants inside. So they just started spreading this on the land around, and the combination of that and the elevated humidity had quite a dramatic effect on the local area. This photograph was taken on completion day, and just one year later, it looked like that. So it was like a green inkblot spreading out from the building turning barren land back into biologically productive land \u2014 and in that sense, going beyond sustainable design to achieve restorative design.So we were keen to scale this up and apply biomimicry ideas to maximize the benefits. And when you think about nature, often you think about it as being all about competition. But actually in mature ecosystems, you're just as likely to find examples of symbiotic relationships. So an important biomimicry principle is to find ways of bringing technologies together in symbiotic clusters. And the technology that we settled on as an ideal partner for the Seawater Greenhouse is concentrated solar power, which uses solar-tracking mirrors to focus the sun's heat to create electricity. And just to give you some sense of the potential of CSP, consider that we receive 10,000 times as much energy from the sun every year as we use in energy from all forms \u2014 10,000 times. So our energy problems are not intractable. It's a challenge to our ingenuity. And the kind of synergies I'm talking about are, firstly, both these technologies work very well in hot, sunny deserts. CSP needs a supply of demineralized freshwater. That's exactly what the Seawater Greenhouse produces. CSP produces a lot of waste heat. We'll be able to make use of all that to evaporate more seawater and enhance the restorative benefits. And finally, in the shade under the mirrors, it's possible to grow all sorts of crops that would not grow in direct sunlight. So this is how this scheme would look. The idea is we create this long hedge of greenhouses facing the wind. We'd have concentrated solar power plants at intervals along the way.Some of you might be wondering what we would do with all the salts. And with biomimicry, if you've got an underutilized resource, you don't think, \"How am I going to dispose of this?\" You think, \"What can I add to the system to create more value?\" And it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages. When you evaporate seawater, the first thing to crystallize out is calcium carbonate. And that builds up on the evaporators \u2014 and that's what that image on the left is \u2014 gradually getting encrusted with the calcium carbonate. So after a while, we could take that out, use it as a lightweight building block. And if you think about the carbon in that, that would have come out of the atmosphere, into the sea and then locked away in a building product.The next thing is sodium chloride. You can also compress that into a building block, as they did here. This is a hotel in Bolivia. And then after that, there are all sorts of compounds and elements that we can extract, like phosphates, that we need to get back into the desert soils to fertilize them. And there's just about every element of the periodic table in seawater. So it should be possible to extract valuable elements like lithium for high-performance batteries. And in parts of the Arabian Gulf, the seawater, the salinity is increasing steadily due to the discharge of waste brine from desalination plants. And it's pushing the ecosystem close to collapse. Now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine. We could evaporate it to enhance the restorative benefits and capture the salts, transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity. Really the Sahara Forest Project is a model for how we could create zero-carbon food, abundant renewable energy in some of the most water-stressed parts of the planet as well as reversing desertification in certain areas.So returning to those big challenges that I mentioned at the beginning: radical increases in resource efficiency, closing loops and a solar economy. They're not just possible; they're critical. And I firmly believe that studying the way nature solves problems will provide a lot of the solutions. But perhaps more than anything, what this thinking provides is a really positive way of talking about sustainable design. Far too much of the talk about the environment uses very negative language. But here it's about synergies and abundance and optimizing. And this is an important point.Antoine de Saint-Exupery once said, \"If you want to build a flotilla of ships, you don't sit around talking about carpentry. No, you need to set people's souls ablaze with visions of exploring distant shores.\" And that's what we need to do, so let's be positive, and let's make progress with what could be the most exciting period of innovation we've ever seen.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1072, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nI'd like to start with a couple of quick examples.\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nThese are spinneret glands\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.958\non the abdomen of a spider.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nThey produce six different types of silk, which is spun together into a fiber,\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.958\ntougher than any fiber humans have ever made.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nThe nearest we've come is with aramid fiber.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nAnd to make that, it involves extremes of temperature,\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nextremes of pressure and loads of pollution.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nAnd yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nwith raw materials of dead flies and water.\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nIt does suggest we've still got a bit to learn.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nThis beetle can detect a forest fire at 80 kilometers away.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nThat's roughly 10,000 times the range\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nof man-made fire detectors.\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nAnd what's more, this guy doesn't need a wire\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nconnected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nSo these two examples give a sense of what biomimicry can deliver.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nIf we could learn to make things and do things the way nature does,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nwe could achieve factor 10, factor 100,\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nmaybe even factor 1,000 savings\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nin resource and energy use.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nAnd if we're to make progress with the sustainability revolution,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nI believe there are three really big changes\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nwe need to bring about.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nFirstly, radical increases in resource efficiency.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nSecondly, shifting from a linear, wasteful,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\npolluting way of using resources\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nto a closed-loop model.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nAnd thirdly, changing from a fossil fuel economy\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nto a solar economy.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nAnd for all three of these, I believe,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nbiomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nYou could look at nature as being like a catalog of products,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nand all of those have benefited\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nfrom a 3.8-billion-year research and development period.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nAnd given that level of investment, it makes sense to use it.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nSo I'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nAnd let's start with radical increases\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nin resource efficiency.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nWhen we were working on the Eden Project,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nwe had to create a very large greenhouse\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nin a site that was not only irregular,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nbut it was continually changing because it was still being quarried.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nIt was a hell of a challenge,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nand it was actually examples from biology\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nthat provided a lot of the clues.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nSo for instance,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nit was soap bubbles that helped us generate a building form\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nthat would work regardless of the final ground levels.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nStudying pollen grains\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nand radiolaria and carbon molecules\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nhelped us devise the most efficient structural solution\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nusing hexagons and pentagons.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nThe next move was that we wanted\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nto try and maximize the size of those hexagons.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nAnd to do that we had to find an alternative to glass,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nwhich is really very limited in terms of its unit sizes.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nAnd in nature there are lots of examples\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nof very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nSo we started exploring this material called ETFE.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nIt's a high-strength polymer.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nAnd what you do is you put it together in three layers,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nyou weld it around the edge, and then you inflate it.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nAnd the great thing about this stuff\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nis you can make it in units\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nof roughly seven times the size of glass,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nand it was only one percent of the weight of double-glazing.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nSo that was a factor-100 saving.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nAnd what we found is that we got into a positive cycle\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nin which one breakthrough facilitated another.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nSo with such large, lightweight pillows,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nwe had much less steel.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nWith less steel we were getting more sunlight in,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nwhich meant we didn't have to put as much extra heat in winter.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nAnd with less overall weight in the superstructure,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nthere were big savings in the foundations.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nAnd at the end of the project we worked out\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nthat the weight of that superstructure\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nwas actually less than the weight of the air inside the building.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nSo I think the Eden Project is a fairly good example\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nof how ideas from biology\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\ncan lead to radical increases in resource efficiency --\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\ndelivering the same function,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nbut with a fraction of the resource input.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nAnd actually there are loads of examples in nature\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nthat you could turn to for similar solutions.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nSo for instance, you could develop super-efficient roof structures\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nbased on giant Amazon water lilies,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nwhole buildings inspired by abalone shells,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nsuper-lightweight bridges inspired by plant cells.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nThere's a world of beauty and efficiency to explore here\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nusing nature as a design tool.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nSo now I want to go onto talking about the linear-to-closed-loop idea.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nThe way we tend to use resources\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nis we extract them,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nwe turn them into short-life products and then dispose of them.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nNature works very differently.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nIn ecosystems, the waste from one organism\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nbecomes the nutrient for something else in that system.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nAnd there are some examples of projects\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nthat have deliberately tried to mimic ecosystems.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nAnd one of my favorites\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nis called the Cardboard to Caviar Project\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nby Graham Wiles.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nAnd in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurants\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nthat were producing lots of food, cardboard and plastic waste.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nIt was ending up in landfills.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nNow the really clever bit is what they did with the cardboard waste.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nAnd I'm just going to talk through this animation.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nSo they were paid to collect it from the restaurants.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nThey then shredded the cardboard\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nand sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nWhen that was soiled, they were paid again to collect it.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nThey put it into worm recomposting systems,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nwhich produced a lot of worms, which they fed to Siberian sturgeon,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nwhich produced caviar, which they sold back to the restaurants.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nSo it transformed a linear process\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\ninto a closed-loop model,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nand it created more value in the process.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nGraham Wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nturning waste streams into schemes that create value.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nAnd just as natural systems\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\ntend to increase in diversity and resilience over time,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nthere's a real sense with this project\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nthat the number of possibilities\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\njust continue increasing.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAnd I know it's a quirky example,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nbut I think the implications of this are quite radical,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nbecause it suggests that we could actually\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\ntransform a big problem -- waste -- into a massive opportunity.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd particularly in cities --\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nwe could look at the whole metabolism of cities,\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nand look at those as opportunities.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nAnd that's what we're doing on the next project I'm going to talk about,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nthe Mobius Project,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nwhere we're trying to bring together a number of activities,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nall within one building,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nso that the waste from one can be the nutrient for another.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nAnd the kind of elements I'm talking about\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nare, firstly, we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\na bit like this one in Amsterdam called De Kas.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nThen we would have an anaerobic digester,\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nwhich could deal with all the biodegradable waste from the local area,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nturn that into heat for the greenhouse\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nand electricity to feed back into the grid.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nWe'd have a water treatment system\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\ntreating wastewater, turning that into fresh water\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nand generating energy from the solids\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nusing just plants and micro-organisms.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nWe'd have a fish farm fed with vegetable waste from the kitchen\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nand worms from the compost\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nand supplying fish back to the restaurant.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd we'd also have a coffee shop, and the waste grains from that\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\ncould be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nSo you can see that we're bringing together\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\ncycles of food, energy and water and waste\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nall within one building.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nAnd just for fun, we've proposed this for a roundabout in central London,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nwhich at the moment is a complete eyesore.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nSome of you may recognize this.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nAnd with just a little bit of planning,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nwe could transform a space dominated by traffic\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\ninto one that provides open space for people,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nreconnects people with food\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nand transforms waste into closed loop opportunities.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nSo the final project I want to talk about\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nis the Sahara Forest Project, which we're working on at the moment.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nIt may come as a surprise to some of you\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nto hear that quite large areas of what are currently desert\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nwere actually forested a fairly short time ago.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nSo for instance, when Julius Caesar arrived in North Africa,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nhuge areas of North Africa\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nwere covered in cedar and cypress forests.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nAnd during the evolution of life on the Earth,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nit was the colonization\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nof the land by plants\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nthat helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nThe converse is also true.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nThe more vegetation we lose,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nthe more that's likely to exacerbate climate change\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nand lead to further desertification.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd this animation,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nthis shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nand what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nshift quite a lot,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nand that raises the question\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nof whether we can intervene at the boundary conditions\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nto halt, or maybe even reverse, desertification.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nAnd if you look at some of the organisms\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nthat have evolved to live in deserts,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nthere are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nThis is the Namibian fog-basking beetle,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nand it's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nThe way it does this is it comes out at night,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\ncrawls to the top of a sand dune,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nand because it's got a matte black shell,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nis able to radiate heat out to the night sky\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nand become slightly cooler than its surroundings.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nSo when the moist breeze blows in off the sea,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nyou get these droplets of water forming on the beetle's shell.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nJust before sunrise, he tips his shell up, the water runs down into his mouth,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nhas a good drink, goes off and hides for the rest of the day.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nAnd the ingenuity, if you could call it that,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\ngoes even further.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nBecause if you look closely at the beetle's shell,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nthere are lots of little bumps on that shell.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nAnd those bumps are hydrophilic; they attract water.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nBetween them there's a waxy finish which repels water.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nAnd the effect of this is that\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nas the droplets start to form on the bumps,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nthey stay in tight, spherical beads,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nwhich means they're much more mobile\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nthan they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle's shell.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nSo even when there's only a small amount of moisture in the air,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nit's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nSo amazing example of an adaptation\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nto a very resource-constrained environment --\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nand in that sense, very relevant\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nto the kind of challenges we're going to be facing\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nover the next few years, next few decades.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nWe're working with the guy who invented the Seawater Greenhouse.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nThis is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nand the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nand you trickle seawater over that\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nso that wind blows through, it picks up a lot of moisture\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nand is cooled in the process.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nSo inside it's cool and humid,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nwhich means the plants need less water to grow.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nAnd then at the back of the greenhouse,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nit condenses a lot of that humidity as freshwater\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nin a process that is effectively identical to the beetle.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nAnd what they found with the first Seawater Greenhouse that was built\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nwas it was producing slightly more freshwater\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nthan it needed for the plants inside.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nSo they just started spreading this on the land around,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nand the combination of that and the elevated humidity\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nhad quite a dramatic effect on the local area.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nThis photograph was taken on completion day,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nand just one year later, it looked like that.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nSo it was like a green inkblot spreading out from the building\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nturning barren land back into biologically productive land --\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nand in that sense, going beyond sustainable design\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nto achieve restorative design.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nSo we were keen to scale this up\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nand apply biomimicry ideas to maximize the benefits.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nAnd when you think about nature,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\noften you think about it as being all about competition.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nBut actually in mature ecosystems,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nyou're just as likely to find examples\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nof symbiotic relationships.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nSo an important biomimicry principle\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nis to find ways of bringing technologies together\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nin symbiotic clusters.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nAnd the technology that we settled on\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nas an ideal partner for the Seawater Greenhouse\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nis concentrated solar power,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nwhich uses solar-tracking mirrors to focus the sun's heat\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nto create electricity.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nAnd just to give you some sense of the potential of CSP,\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nconsider that we receive\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\n10,000 times as much energy from the sun every year\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nas we use in energy from all forms --\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\n10,000 times.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nSo our energy problems are not intractable.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nIt's a challenge to our ingenuity.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nAnd the kind of synergies I'm talking about\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nare, firstly, both these technologies work very well in hot, sunny deserts.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nCSP needs a supply of demineralized freshwater.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nThat's exactly what the Seawater Greenhouse produces.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nCSP produces a lot of waste heat.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nWe'll be able to make use of all that to evaporate more seawater\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nand enhance the restorative benefits.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nAnd finally, in the shade under the mirrors,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nit's possible to grow all sorts of crops\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nthat would not grow in direct sunlight.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nSo this is how this scheme would look.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nThe idea is we create this long hedge of greenhouses facing the wind.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nWe'd have concentrated solar power plants\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nat intervals along the way.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nSome of you might be wondering what we would do with all the salts.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nAnd with biomimicry, if you've got an underutilized resource,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nyou don't think, \"How am I going to dispose of this?\"\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nYou think, \"What can I add to the system to create more value?\"\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nAnd it turns out\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nthat different things crystallize out at different stages.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nWhen you evaporate seawater, the first thing to crystallize out\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nis calcium carbonate.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nAnd that builds up on the evaporators --\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nand that's what that image on the left is --\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\ngradually getting encrusted with the calcium carbonate.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nSo after a while, we could take that out,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nuse it as a lightweight building block.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nAnd if you think about the carbon in that,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nthat would have come out of the atmosphere, into the sea\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nand then locked away in a building product.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nThe next thing is sodium chloride.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nYou can also compress that into a building block,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nas they did here.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nThis is a hotel in Bolivia.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nAnd then after that, there are all sorts\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nof compounds and elements that we can extract,\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nlike phosphates, that we need to get back into the desert soils to fertilize them.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nAnd there's just about every element of the periodic table\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nin seawater.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nSo it should be possible to extract valuable elements\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nlike lithium for high-performance batteries.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nAnd in parts of the Arabian Gulf,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nthe seawater, the salinity is increasing steadily\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\ndue to the discharge of waste brine\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nfrom desalination plants.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nAnd it's pushing the ecosystem close to collapse.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nNow we would be able to make use of all that waste brine.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nWe could evaporate it\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nto enhance the restorative benefits\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nand capture the salts,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\ntransforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nReally the Sahara Forest Project is a model\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nfor how we could create zero-carbon food,\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nabundant renewable energy in some of the most water-stressed parts of the planet\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nas well as reversing desertification in certain areas.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nSo returning to those big challenges that I mentioned at the beginning:\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nradical increases in resource efficiency,\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nclosing loops and a solar economy.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nThey're not just possible; they're critical.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nAnd I firmly believe that studying the way nature solves problems\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nwill provide a lot of the solutions.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nBut perhaps more than anything, what this thinking provides\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nis a really positive way of talking about sustainable design.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nFar too much of the talk about the environment\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nuses very negative language.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nBut here it's about synergies and abundance and optimizing.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nAnd this is an important point.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nAntoine de Saint-Exupery once said,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\n\"If you want to build a flotilla of ships,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nyou don't sit around talking about carpentry.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nNo, you need to set people's souls ablaze\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nwith visions of exploring distant shores.\"\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd that's what we need to do, so let's be positive,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nand let's make progress with what could be\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nthe most exciting period of innovation we've ever seen.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nThank you.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A whistleblower you haven't heard", "duration": "716",

That was whistling. I'm trying to do this in English. What is a chubby, curly-haired guy from Holland \u2014 why is he whistling? Well actually, I've been whistling since the age of four, about four. My dad was always whistling around the house, and I just thought that's part of communication in my family. So I whistled along with him. And actually, until I was 34, I always annoyed and irritated people with whistling, because, to be honest, my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior. I whistled alone, I whistled in the classroom, I whistled on bike, I whistled everywhere.And I also whistled at a Christmas Eve party with my family-in-law. And they had some, in my opinion, terrible Christmas music. And when I hear music that I don't like, I try to make it better.(Laughter)So when \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" \u2014 you know it?(Whistling)But it can also sound like this.(Whistling)But during a Christmas party \u2014 at dinner, actually \u2014 it's very annoying. So my sister-in-law asked me a few times, \"Please stop whistling.\" And I just couldn't. And at one point \u2014 and I had some wine, I have to admit that \u2014 at one point I said, \"If there was a contest, I would join.\"And two weeks later, I received a text message: \"You're going to America.\"(Laughter)So, OK, I'm going to America. I would love to, but why? So I immediately called her up, of course. She googled, and she found this World Whistling Championship in America, of course.(Laughter)She didn't expect me to go there. And I would have lost my face. I don't know if that's correct English. But the Dutch people here will understand what I mean.(Laughter)I lost my face.(Applause)And she thought, \"He will never go there.\" But actually, I did. So I went to Louisburg, North Carolina, southeast of the United States, and I entered the world of whistling. And I also entered the World Championship, and I won there, in 2004.(Applause)That was great fun, of course. And to defend my title \u2014 like judokas do and sportsmen \u2014 I thought, well let's go back in 2005 \u2014 and I won again.(Laughter)Then I couldn't participate for a few years. And in 2008, I entered again in Japan, Tokyo, and I won again. So what happened now is I'm standing here in Rotterdam, in the beautiful city, on a big stage, and I'm talking about whistling. And actually, I earn my money whistling, at the moment. So I quit my day job as a nurse.(Applause)And I try to live my dream \u2014 well, actually, it was never my dream, but it sounds so good.(Laughter)OK, I'm not the only one whistling here. You say, \"Huh, what do you mean?\" Well actually, you are going to whistle along. And then always the same thing happens: people are watching each other and think, \"Oh, my God. Why? Can I go away?\" No, you can't.(Laughter)Actually, it's very simple. The track that I will whistle is called \"F\u00eate de la Belle.\" It's about 80 minutes long.(Laughter)No, no, no. It's four minutes long. And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling. Yes, so I whistle the tone.(Whistling)(Laughter)Sorry, I forgot one thing \u2014 you whistle the same tone as me.(Laughter)I heard a wide variety of tones.(Geert Chatrou and audience whistling)(Whistling ends)This is very promising.(Laughter)This is very promising. I'll ask the technicians to start the music. And if it's started, I just point where you whistle along, and we will see what happens.(Laughter)Oh, I'm so sorry, technicians.(Laughter)I'm so used to that.(Laughter)I start it myself.(Laughter)OK, here it is.(Laughter)(Music)(Whistling)(Whistling ends)(Music)OK.(Whistling)It's easy, isn't it?(Whistling)Now comes the solo, I propose I do that myself, OK?(Music)(Whistling)(Applause)Max Westerman: Geert Chatrou, the World Champion of Whistling.Geert Chatrou: Thank you.

Thank you."}, {"title": "Reconnecting with compassion", "duration": "953", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/krista_tippett_reconnecting_with_compassion", "transcript": "We're here to celebrate compassion. But compassion, from my vantage point, has a problem. As essential as it is across our traditions, as real as so many of us know it to be in particular lives, the word \"compassion\" is hollowed out in our culture, and it is suspect in my field of journalism. It's seen as a squishy kumbaya thing, or it's seen as potentially depressing. Karen Armstrong has told what I think is an iconic story of giving a speech in Holland and, after the fact, the word \"compassion\" was translated as \"pity.\"Now compassion, when it enters the news, too often comes in the form of feel-good feature pieces or sidebars about heroic people you could never be like or happy endings or examples of self-sacrifice that would seem to be too good to be true most of the time. Our cultural imagination about compassion has been deadened by idealistic images. And so what I'd like to do this morning for the next few minutes is perform a linguistic resurrection. And I hope you'll come with me on my basic premise that words matter, that they shape the way we understand ourselves, the way we interpret the world and the way we treat others.When this country first encountered genuine diversity in the 1960s, we adopted tolerance as the core civic virtue with which we would approach that. Now the word \"tolerance,\" if you look at it in the dictionary, connotes \"allowing,\" \"indulging\" and \"enduring.\" In the medical context that it comes from, it is about testing the limits of thriving in an unfavorable environment. Tolerance is not really a lived virtue; it's more of a cerebral ascent. And it's too cerebral to animate guts and hearts and behavior when the going gets rough. And the going is pretty rough right now. I think that without perhaps being able to name it, we are collectively experiencing that we've come as far as we can with tolerance as our only guiding virtue.Compassion is a worthy successor. It is organic, across our religious, spiritual and ethical traditions, and yet it transcends them. Compassion is a piece of vocabulary that could change us if we truly let it sink into the standards to which we hold ourselves and others, both in our private and in our civic spaces. So what is it, three-dimensionally? What are its kindred and component parts? What's in its universe of attendant virtues? To start simply, I want to say that compassion is kind. Now \"kindness\" might sound like a very mild word, and it's prone to its own abundant cliche. But kindness is an everyday byproduct of all the great virtues. And it is a most edifying form of instant gratification.Compassion is also curious. Compassion cultivates and practices curiosity. I love a phrase that was offered me by two young women who are interfaith innovators in Los Angeles, Aziza Hasan and Malka Fenyvesi. They are working to create a new imagination about shared life among young Jews and Muslims, and as they do that, they cultivate what they call \"curiosity without assumptions.\" Well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion.Compassion can be synonymous with empathy. It can be joined with the harder work of forgiveness and reconciliation, but it can also express itself in the simple act of presence. It's linked to practical virtues like generosity and hospitality and just being there, just showing up. I think that compassion also is often linked to beauty \u2014 and by that I mean a willingness to see beauty in the other, not just what it is about them that might need helping. I love it that my Muslim conversation partners often speak of beauty as a core moral value. And in that light, for the religious, compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery \u2014 encouraging us not just to see beauty, but perhaps also to look for the face of God in the moment of suffering, in the face of a stranger, in the face of the vibrant religious other.I'm not sure if I can show you what tolerance looks like, but I can show you what compassion looks like \u2014 because it is visible. When we see it, we recognize it and it changes the way we think about what is doable, what is possible. It is so important when we're communicating big ideas \u2014 but especially a big spiritual idea like compassion \u2014 to root it as we present it to others in space and time and flesh and blood \u2014 the color and complexity of life.And compassion does seek physicality. I first started to learn this most vividly from Matthew Sanford. And I don't imagine that you will realize this when you look at this photograph of him, but he's paraplegic. He's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was 13, in a car crash that killed his father and his sister. Matthew's legs don't work, and he'll never walk again, and \u2014 and he does experience this as an \"and\" rather than a \"but\" \u2014 and he experiences himself to be healed and whole. And as a teacher of yoga, he brings that experience to others across the spectrum of ability and disability, health, illness and aging. He says that he's just at an extreme end of the spectrum we're all on. He's doing some amazing work now with veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. And Matthew has made this remarkable observation that I'm just going to offer you and let it sit. I can't quite explain it, and he can't either. But he says that he has yet to experience someone who became more aware of their body, in all its frailty and its grace, without, at the same time, becoming more compassionate towards all of life.Compassion also looks like this. This is Jean Vanier. Jean Vanier helped found the L'Arche communities, which you can now find all over the world, communities centered around life with people with mental disabilities \u2014 mostly Down syndrome. The communities that Jean Vanier founded, like Jean Vanier himself, exude tenderness. \"Tender\" is another word I would love to spend some time resurrecting. We spend so much time in this culture being driven and aggressive, and I spend a lot of time being those things too. And compassion can also have those qualities. But again and again, lived compassion brings us back to the wisdom of tenderness. Jean Vanier says that his work, like the work of other people \u2014 his great, beloved, late friend Mother Teresa \u2014 is never in the first instance about changing the world; it's in the first instance about changing ourselves. He's says that what they do with L'Arche is not a solution, but a sign. Compassion is rarely a solution, but it is always a sign of a deeper reality, of deeper human possibilities.And compassion is unleashed in wider and wider circles by signs and stories, never by statistics and strategies. We need those things too, but we're also bumping up against their limits. And at the same time that we are doing that, I think we are rediscovering the power of story \u2014 that as human beings, we need stories to survive, to flourish, to change. Our traditions have always known this, and that is why they have always cultivated stories at their heart and carried them forward in time for us. There is, of course, a story behind the key moral longing and commandment of Judaism to repair the world \u2014 tikkun olam.And I'll never forget hearing that story from Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen, who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her, that in the beginning of the Creation something happened and the original light of the universe was shattered into countless pieces. It lodged as shards inside every aspect of the Creation. And that the highest human calling is to look for this light, to point at it when we see it, to gather it up, and in so doing, to repair the world. Now this might sound like a fanciful tale. Some of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way. Rachel Naomi Remen says this is an important and empowering story for our time, because this story insists that each and every one of us, frail and flawed as we may be, inadequate as we may feel, has exactly what's needed to help repair the part of the world that we can see and touch.Stories like this, signs like this, are practical tools in a world longing to bring compassion to abundant images of suffering that can otherwise overwhelm us. Rachel Naomi Remen is actually bringing compassion back to its rightful place alongside science in her field of medicine in the training of new doctors. And this trend of what Rachel Naomi Remen is doing, how these kinds of virtues are finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine \u2014 the work Fred Luskin is doing \u2014 I think this is one of the most fascinating developments of the 21st century \u2014 that science, in fact, is taking a virtue like compassion definitively out of the realm of idealism. This is going to change science, I believe, and it will change religion.But here's a face from 20th century science that might surprise you in a discussion about compassion. We all know about the Albert Einstein who came up with E = mc2. We don't hear so much about the Einstein who invited the African American opera singer, Marian Anderson, to stay in his home when she came to sing in Princeton because the best hotel there was segregated and wouldn't have her. We don't hear about the Einstein who used his celebrity to advocate for political prisoners in Europe or the Scottsboro boys in the American South.Einstein believed deeply that science should transcend national and ethnic divisions. But he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction in the early 20th century. He once said that science in his generation had become like a razor blade in the hands of a three-year-old. And Einstein foresaw that as we grow more modern and technologically advanced, we need the virtues our traditions carry forward in time more, not less. He liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages. Some of his favorites were Moses, Jesus, Buddha, St. Francis of Assisi, Gandhi \u2014 he adored his contemporary, Gandhi. And Einstein said \u2014 and I think this is a quote, again, that has not been passed down in his legacy \u2014 that \"these kinds of people are geniuses in the art of living, more necessary to the dignity, security and joy of humanity than the discoverers of objective knowledge.\"Now invoking Einstein might not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth and make it seem accessible to all the rest of us, but actually it is. I want to show you the rest of this photograph, because this photograph is analogous to what we do to the word \"compassion\" in our culture \u2014 we clean it up and we diminish its depths and its grounding in life, which is messy. So in this photograph you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral \u2014 it's not. This is the full photograph, and you see a middle-aged man wearing a leather jacket, smoking a cigar. And by the look of that paunch, he hasn't been doing enough yoga. We put these two photographs side-by-side on our website, and someone said, \"When I look at the first photo, I ask myself, what was he thinking? And when I look at the second, I ask, what kind of person was he? What kind of man is this?\"Well, he was complicated. He was incredibly compassionate in some of his relationships and terribly inadequate in others. And it is much harder, often, to be compassionate towards those closest to us, which is another quality in the universe of compassion, on its dark side, that also deserves our serious attention and illumination. Gandhi, too, was a real flawed human being. So was Martin Luther King, Jr. So was Dorothy Day. So was Mother Teresa. So are we all. And I want to say that it is a liberating thing to realize that that is no obstacle to compassion \u2014 following on what Fred Luskin says \u2014 that these flaws just make us human.Our culture is obsessed with perfection and with hiding problems. But what a liberating thing to realize that our problems, in fact, are probably our richest sources for rising to this ultimate virtue of compassion, towards bringing compassion towards the suffering and joys of others. Rachel Naomi Remen is a better doctor because of her life-long struggle with Crohn's disease. Einstein became a humanitarian, not because of his exquisite knowledge of space and time and matter, but because he was a Jew as Germany grew fascist. And Karen Armstrong, I think you would also say that it was some of your very wounding experiences in a religious life that, with a zigzag, have led to the Charter for Compassion. Compassion can't be reduced to sainthood any more than it can be reduced to pity.So I want to propose a final definition of compassion \u2014 this is Einstein with Paul Robeson by the way \u2014 and that would be for us to call compassion a spiritual technology. Now our traditions contain vast wisdom about this, and we need them to mine it for us now. But compassion is also equally at home in the secular as in the religious.So I will paraphrase Einstein in closing and say that humanity, the future of humanity, needs this technology as much as it needs all the others that have now connected us and set before us the terrifying and wondrous possibility of actually becoming one human race.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1074, "subtitle":

if you look at it in the dictionary,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nconnotes \"allowing,\" \"indulging\"\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nand \"enduring.\"\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nIn the

00:02:20.958\nthat we've come as far as we can\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nwith tolerance as our only guiding virtue.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nCompassion is a worthy

00:02:57.958\nTo start simply,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nI want to say that compassion is kind.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nNow \"kindness\" might sound like a very mild word,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nand it's prone to its own abundant cliche.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nBut kindness is an everyday byproduct\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nof all the great virtues.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nAnd it is a most edifying form\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nof instant gratification.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nCompassion is also

up.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nI think that compassion\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nalso is often linked to beauty --\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nand by that I mean a willingness\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nto see beauty in the other,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nnot just what it is about them\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nthat might need

00:04:40.958\nencouraging us not just\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nto see beauty,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nbut perhaps also to look for the face of God\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nin the moment of suffering,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nin the face of a stranger,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nin the face of the vibrant religious other.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nI'm not sure if I can show you\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nwhat tolerance looks like,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nbut I can show you what compassion looks like

--\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nbut especially a big spiritual idea like compassion --\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nto root it as we present it to others\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nin

00:05:29.958\nI first started to learn this most vividly\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nfrom Matthew Sanford.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nAnd I don't imagine that you will realize

waist down since he was 13,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nin a car crash that killed his father and his sister.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nMatthew's legs don't work, and he'll never walk again,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nand -- and he does experience this as an \"and\"\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nrather than a \"but\" --\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand he experiences himself\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nto be healed and whole.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nAnd as a teacher of yoga,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nhe brings that experience to others\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nacross the spectrum of ability and disability,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nhealth, illness and aging.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nHe says that he's just at an extreme end\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nof the spectrum we're all on.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nHe's doing some amazing work now\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nwith veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nAnd Matthew has made this remarkable observation\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nthat I'm just going to offer you and let it sit.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nI can't quite explain it, and he can't either.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nBut he says that he has yet to experience someone\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nwho became more aware of their body,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nin all its frailty and its grace,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nwithout, at the same time,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nbecoming more compassionate towards all of life.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nCompassion also looks like this.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nThis is Jean Vanier.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nJean Vanier helped found the L'Arche communities,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nwhich you can now find all over the world,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\ncommunities centered around life\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nwith people with mental disabilities --\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nmostly Down syndrome.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nThe communities that Jean Vanier founded,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nlike Jean Vanier himself,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nexude tenderness.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\n\"Tender\" is another word\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nI would love to spend some time resurrecting.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nWe spend so much time in this culture\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nbeing driven and aggressive,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nand I spend a lot of time being those things too.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nAnd compassion can also have those qualities.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nBut again and again, lived compassion\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nbrings us back to the wisdom of tenderness.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nJean Vanier says\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nthat his work,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nlike the work of other people --\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nhis great, beloved, late friend Mother Teresa --\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nis never in the first instance about changing the world;\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nit's in the first instance about changing ourselves.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nHe's says that what they do with L'Arche\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nis not a solution, but a sign.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nCompassion is rarely a solution,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nbut it is always a sign of a deeper reality,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nof deeper human possibilities.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nAnd compassion is unleashed\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nin wider and wider circles\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nby signs and stories,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nnever by statistics and strategies.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nWe need those things too,\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nbut we're also bumping up against their limits.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nAnd at the same time that we are doing that,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nI think we are rediscovering the power of story --\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nthat as human beings, we need stories\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nto survive, to flourish,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nto change.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nOur traditions have always known this,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nand that is why they have always cultivated stories at their heart\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nand carried them forward in time for us.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nThere is, of course, a story\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nbehind the key moral longing\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nand commandment of Judaism\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nto repair the world -- tikkun olam.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nAnd I'll never forget hearing that story\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nfrom Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nwho told it to me as her grandfather told it to her,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nthat in the beginning of the Creation\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nsomething happened\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nand the original light of the universe\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nwas shattered into countless pieces.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nIt lodged as shards\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\ninside every aspect of the Creation.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nAnd that the highest human calling\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nis to look for this light, to point at it when we see it,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nto gather it up,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nand in so doing, to repair the world.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nNow this might sound like a fanciful tale.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nSome of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nRachel Naomi Remen says\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nthis is an important and empowering story\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nfor our time,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nbecause this story insists\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nthat each and every one of us,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nfrail and flawed as we may be,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\ninadequate as we may feel,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nhas exactly what's needed\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nto help repair the part of the world\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nthat we can see and touch.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nStories like this,\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nsigns like this,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nare practical tools\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nin a world longing to bring compassion\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nto abundant images of suffering\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nthat can otherwise overwhelm us.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nRachel Naomi Remen\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nis actually bringing compassion\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nback to its rightful place alongside science\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nin her field of medicine\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nin the training of new doctors.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nAnd this trend\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nof what Rachel Naomi Remen is doing,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nhow these kinds of virtues\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nare finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine --\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nthe work Fred Luskin is doing --\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nI think this is one of the most fascinating developments\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nof the 21st century --\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nthat science, in fact,\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nis taking a virtue like compassion\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\ndefinitively out of the realm of idealism.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nThis is going to change science, I believe,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nand it will change religion.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nBut here's a face\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nfrom 20th century science\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nthat might surprise you\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nin a discussion about compassion.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nWe all know about the Albert Einstein\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nwho came up with E = mc2.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nWe don't hear so much about the Einstein\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nwho invited the African American opera singer, Marian Anderson,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nto stay in his home when she came to sing in Princeton\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nbecause the best hotel there\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nwas segregated and wouldn't have her.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nWe don't hear about the Einstein who used his celebrity\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nto advocate for political prisoners in Europe\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nor the Scottsboro boys\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nin the American South.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nEinstein believed deeply\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nthat science should transcend\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nnational and ethnic divisions.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nBut he watched physicists and chemists\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nbecome the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nin the early 20th century.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nHe once said that science in his generation\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nhad become like a razor blade\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nin the hands of a three-year-old.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nAnd Einstein foresaw\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nthat as we grow more modern\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nand technologically advanced,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nwe need the virtues\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nour traditions carry forward in time\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nmore, not less.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nHe liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nSome of his favorites were Moses,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nJesus, Buddha, St. Francis of Assisi,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nGandhi -- he adored his contemporary, Gandhi.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nAnd Einstein said --\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nand I think this is a quote,\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nagain, that has not been passed down in his legacy --\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nthat \"these kinds of people\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nare geniuses in the art of living,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nmore necessary\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nto the dignity, security and joy of humanity\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nthan the discoverers of objective knowledge.\"\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nNow invoking Einstein\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nmight not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nand make it seem accessible to all the rest of us,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nbut actually it is.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nI want to show you\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nthe rest of this photograph,\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nbecause this photograph\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nis analogous to what we do to the word \"compassion\" in our culture --\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nwe clean it up\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nand we diminish its depths and its grounding\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nin life, which is messy.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nSo in this photograph\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nyou see a mind looking out a window\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nat what might be a cathedral -- it's not.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nThis is the full photograph,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nand you see a middle-aged man wearing a leather jacket,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nsmoking a cigar.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nAnd by the look of that paunch,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nhe hasn't been doing enough yoga.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nWe put these two photographs side-by-side on our

What you're drawn to are her eyes and the skin you love to touch. But today I'm going to talk to you about something you can't see. What's going on up in that little brain of hers. The modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us that what's going on up there is nothing short of rocket science. And what we're learning is going to shed some light on what the romantic writers and poets described as the \"celestial openness\" of the child's mind.What we see here is a mother in India, and she's speaking Koro, which is a newly discovered language. And she's talking to her baby. What this mother \u2014 and the 800 people who speak Koro in the world \u2014 understands is that, to preserve this language, they need to speak it to the babies. And therein lies a critical puzzle. Why is it that you can't preserve a language by speaking to you and I, to the adults? Well, it's got to do with your brain. What we see here is that language has a critical period for learning. The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis.(Laughter)And you'll see on the vertical your skill at acquiring a second language. The babies and children are geniuses until they turn seven, and then there's a systematic decline. After puberty, we fall off the map. No scientists dispute this curve, but laboratories all over the world are trying to figure out why it works this way.Work in my lab is focused on the first critical period in development, and that is the period in which babies try to master which sounds are used in their language. We think, by studying how the sounds are learned, we'll have a model for the rest of language, and perhaps for critical periods that may exist in childhood for social, emotional and cognitive development. So we've been studying the babies using a technique that we're using all over the world and the sounds of all languages. The baby sits on a parent's lap, and we train them to turn their heads when a sound changes \u2014 like from \"ah\" to \"ee.\" If they do so at the appropriate time, the black box lights up and a panda bear pounds a drum. A six-monther adores the task.What have we learned? Well, babies all over the world are what I like to describe as \"citizens of the world.\" They can discriminate all the sounds of all languages, no matter what country we're testing and what language we're using, and that's remarkable because you and I can't do that. We're culture-bound listeners. We can discriminate the sounds of our own language, but not those of foreign languages. So the question arises: When do those citizens of the world turn into the language-bound listeners that we are? And the answer: before their first birthdays. What you see here is performance on that head-turn task for babies tested in Tokyo and the United States, here in Seattle, as they listened to \"ra\" and \"la\" \u2014 sounds important to English, but not to Japanese. So at six to eight months, the babies are totally equivalent. Two months later, something incredible occurs. The babies in the United States are getting a lot better, babies in Japan are getting a lot worse, but both of those groups of babies are preparing for exactly the language that they are going to learn.So the question is: What's happening during this critical two-month period? This is the critical period for sound development, but what's going on up there? So there are two things going on. The first is that the babies are listening intently to us, and they're taking statistics as they listen to us talk \u2014 they're taking statistics. So listen to two mothers speaking motherese \u2014 the universal language we use when we talk to kids \u2014 first in English and then in Japanese.(Video) Ah, I love your big blue eyes \u2014 so pretty and nice.(Japanese)Patricia Kuhl: During the production of speech, when babies listen, what they're doing is taking statistics on the language that they hear. And those distributions grow. And what we've learned is that babies are sensitive to the statistics, and the statistics of Japanese and English are very, very different. English has a lot of Rs and Ls. The distribution shows. And the distribution of Japanese is totally different, where we see a group of intermediate sounds, which is known as the Japanese \"R.\" So babies absorb the statistics of the language and it changes their brains; it changes them from the citizens of the world to the culture-bound listeners that we are. But we as adults are no longer absorbing those statistics. We are governed by the representations in memory that were formed early in development.So what we're seeing here is changing our models of what the critical period is about. We're arguing from a mathematical standpoint that the learning of language material may slow down when our distributions stabilize. It's raising lots of questions about bilingual people. Bilinguals must keep two sets of statistics in mind at once and flip between them, one after the other, depending on who they're speaking to.So we asked ourselves, can the babies take statistics on a brand new language? And we tested this by exposing American babies who'd never heard a second language to Mandarin for the first time during the critical period. We knew that, when monolinguals were tested in Taipei and Seattle on the Mandarin sounds, they showed the same pattern. Six to eight months, they're totally equivalent. Two months later, something incredible happens. But the Taiwanese babies are getting better, not the American babies. What we did was expose American babies, during this period, to Mandarin. It was like having Mandarin relatives come and visit for a month and move into your house and talk to the babies for 12 sessions. Here's what it looked like in the laboratory.(Mandarin)PK: So what have we done to their little brains?(Laughter)We had to run a control group to make sure that coming into the laboratory didn't improve your Mandarin skills. So a group of babies came in and listened to English. And we can see from the graph that exposure to English didn't improve their Mandarin. But look at what happened to the babies exposed to Mandarin for 12 sessions. They were as good as the babies in Taiwan who'd been listening for 10 and a half months. What it demonstrated is that babies take statistics on a new language. Whatever you put in front of them, they'll take statistics on.But we wondered what role the human being played in this learning exercise. So we ran another group of babies in which the kids got the same dosage, the same 12 sessions, but over a television set. And another group of babies who had just audio exposure and looked at a teddy bear on the screen. What did we do to their brains? What you see here is the audio result \u2014 no learning whatsoever \u2014 and the video result \u2014 no learning whatsoever. It takes a human being for babies to take their statistics. The social brain is controlling when the babies are taking their statistics.We want to get inside the brain and see this thing happening as babies are in front of televisions, as opposed to in front of human beings. Thankfully, we have a new machine, magnetoencephalography, that allows us to do this. It looks like a hair dryer from Mars. But it's completely safe, completely noninvasive and silent. We're looking at millimeter accuracy with regard to spatial and millisecond accuracy using 306 SQUIDs \u2014 these are superconducting quantum interference devices \u2014 to pick up the magnetic fields that change as we do our thinking. We're the first in the world to record babies in an MEG machine while they are learning.So this is little Emma. She's a six-monther. And she's listening to various languages in the earphones that are in her ears. You can see, she can move around. We're tracking her head with little pellets in a cap, so she's free to move completely unconstrained. It's a technical tour de force. What are we seeing? We're seeing the baby brain. As the baby hears a word in her language, the auditory areas light up, and then subsequently areas surrounding it that we think are related to coherence, getting the brain coordinated with its different areas, and causality, one brain area causing another to activate.We are embarking on a grand and golden age of knowledge about child's brain development. We're going to be able to see a child's brain as they experience an emotion, as they learn to speak and read, as they solve a math problem, as they have an idea. And we're going to be able to invent brain-based interventions for children who have difficulty learning. Just as the poets and writers described, we're going to be able to see, I think, that wondrous openness, utter and complete openness, of the mind of a child. In investigating the child's brain, we're going to uncover deep truths about what it means to be human, and in the process, we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning for our entire lives.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1075, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.982 --> 00:00:15.665\nI want you to take a look at this baby.\n\n00:00:16.137

your big blue eyes --\n\n00:04:04.152 --> 00:04:06.958\nso pretty and nice.\n\n00:04:08.007 --> 00:04:13.934\n(Japanese)\n\n00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.777\nPatricia Kuhl: During the production\nof speech, when babies listen,\n\n00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:22.570\nwhat they're doing is taking statistics\non the language that they hear.\n\n00:04:23.311 --> 00:04:26.221\nAnd those distributions grow.\n\n00:04:26.245 --> 00:04:30.618\nAnd what we've learned is that babies\nare sensitive to the statistics,\n\n00:04:30.642 --> 00:04:34.470\nand the statistics of Japanese\nand English are very, very different.\n\n00:04:34.494 --> 00:04:37.151\nEnglish has a lot of Rs and Ls.\n\n00:04:37.175 --> 00:04:38.934\nThe distribution shows.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.798\nAnd the distribution of Japanese\nis totally different,\n\n00:04:41.822 --> 00:04:44.823\nwhere we see a group\nof intermediate sounds,\n\n00:04:44.847 --> 00:04:47.262\nwhich is known as the Japanese \"R.\"\n\n00:04:47.286 --> 00:04:51.394\nSo babies absorb\nthe statistics of the language\n\n00:04:51.418 --> 00:04:53.096\nand it changes their brains;\n\n00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.271\nit changes them\nfrom the citizens of the world\n\n00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:58.241\nto the culture-bound\nlisteners that we are.\n\n00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:02.978\nBut we as adults are no longer\nabsorbing those statistics.\n\n00:05:03.002 --> 00:05:05.559\nWe are governed\nby the representations in memory\n\n00:05:05.583 --> 00:05:08.132\nthat were formed early in development.\n\n00:05:08.156 --> 00:05:09.934\nSo what we're seeing here\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:13.191\nis changing our models\nof what the critical period is about.\n\n00:05:13.215 --> 00:05:15.984\nWe're arguing from\na mathematical standpoint\n\n00:05:16.008 --> 00:05:19.148\nthat the learning of language\nmaterial may slow down\n\n00:05:19.172 --> 00:05:21.552\nwhen our distributions stabilize.\n\n00:05:21.576 --> 00:05:24.438\nIt's raising lots of questions\nabout bilingual people.\n\n00:05:24.876 --> 00:05:28.907\nBilinguals must keep two sets\nof statistics in mind at once\n\n00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:31.814\nand flip between them,\none after the other,\n\n00:05:31.838 --> 00:05:33.610\ndepending on who they're speaking to.\n\n00:05:33.634 --> 00:05:34.788\nSo we asked ourselves,\n\n00:05:34.812 --> 00:05:38.219\ncan the babies take statistics\non a brand new language?\n\n00:05:38.243 --> 00:05:41.521\nAnd we tested this\nby exposing American babies\n\n00:05:41.545 --> 00:05:43.234\nwho'd never heard a second language\n\n00:05:43.258 --> 00:05:45.974\nto Mandarin for the first time\nduring the critical period.\n\n00:05:45.998 --> 00:05:49.535\nWe knew that, when monolinguals\nwere tested in Taipei and Seattle\n\n00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:52.221\non the Mandarin sounds,\nthey showed the same pattern.\n\n00:05:52.245 --> 00:05:54.716\nSix to eight months,\nthey're totally equivalent.\n\n00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.276\nTwo months later,\nsomething incredible happens.\n\n00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.852\nBut the Taiwanese babies are getting\nbetter, not the American babies.\n\n00:06:00.876 --> 00:06:05.758\nWhat we did was expose American babies,\nduring this period, to Mandarin.\n\n00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:08.790\nIt was like having Mandarin relatives\ncome and visit for a month\n\n00:06:08.814 --> 00:06:12.611\nand move into your house\nand talk to the babies for 12 sessions.\n\n00:06:12.635 --> 00:06:14.841\nHere's what it looked like\nin the laboratory.\n\n00:06:14.865 --> 00:06:20.421\n(Mandarin)\n\n00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.866\nPK: So what have we done\nto their little brains?\n\n00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.629\nWe had to run a control group to make sure\n\n00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:46.865\nthat coming into the laboratory\ndidn't improve your Mandarin skills.\n\n00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:49.542\nSo a group of babies came in\nand listened to English.\n\n00:06:49.566 --> 00:06:50.968\nAnd we can see from the graph\n\n00:06:50.992 --> 00:06:53.575\nthat exposure to English\ndidn't improve their Mandarin.\n\n00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:57.194\nBut look at what happened to the babies\nexposed to Mandarin for 12 sessions.\n\n00:06:57.218 --> 00:06:59.618\nThey were as good as the babies in Taiwan\n\n00:06:59.642 --> 00:07:02.618\nwho'd been listening\nfor 10 and a half months.\n\n00:07:02.642 --> 00:07:06.466\nWhat it demonstrated is that babies\ntake statistics on a new language.\n\n00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.934\nWhatever you put in front of them,\nthey'll take statistics on.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.548\nBut we wondered what role\n\n00:07:11.572 --> 00:07:15.809\nthe human being played\nin this learning exercise.\n\n00:07:16.126 --> 00:07:20.442\nSo we ran another group of babies\nin which the kids got the same dosage,\n\n00:07:20.466 --> 00:07:22.934\nthe same 12 sessions,\nbut over a television set.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:26.619\nAnd another group of babies\nwho had just audio exposure\n\n00:07:26.643 --> 00:07:28.731\nand looked at a teddy bear on the screen.\n\n00:07:28.755 --> 00:07:30.934\nWhat did we do to their brains?\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:34.333\nWhat you see here is the audio result --\n\n00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:36.619\nno learning whatsoever --\n\n00:07:36.643 --> 00:07:38.401\nand the video result --\n\n00:07:39.194 --> 00:07:41.039\nno learning whatsoever.\n\n00:07:41.063 --> 00:07:45.204\nIt takes a human being\nfor babies to take their statistics.\n\n00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.746\nThe social brain is controlling\n\n00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:49.875\nwhen the babies\nare taking their statistics.\n\n00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:53.392\nWe want to get inside the brain\nand see this thing happening\n\n00:07:53.416 --> 00:07:57.354\nas babies are in front of televisions,\nas opposed to in front of human beings.\n\n00:07:57.378 --> 00:08:02.075\nThankfully, we have a new machine,\nmagnetoencephalography,\n\n00:08:02.099 --> 00:08:03.392\nthat allows us to do this.\n\n00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:06.001\nIt looks like a hair dryer from Mars.\n\n00:08:06.025 --> 00:08:10.508\nBut it's completely safe,\ncompletely noninvasive and silent.\n\n00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:12.975\nWe're looking at millimeter accuracy\n\n00:08:12.999 --> 00:08:16.315\nwith regard to spatial\nand millisecond accuracy\n\n00:08:16.339 --> 00:08:18.961\nusing 306 SQUIDs --\n\n00:08:18.985 --> 00:08:22.085\nthese are superconducting\nquantum interference devices --\n\n00:08:22.109 --> 00:08:25.740\nto pick up the magnetic fields\nthat change as we do our thinking.\n\n00:08:26.207 --> 00:08:31.816\nWe're the first in the world\nto record babies in an MEG machine\n\n00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.231\nwhile they are learning.\n\n00:08:34.255 --> 00:08:35.934\nSo this is little Emma.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.866\nShe's a six-monther.\n\n00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:43.008\nAnd she's listening to various languages\nin the earphones that are in her ears.\n\n00:08:43.032 --> 00:08:45.256\nYou can see, she can move around.\n\n00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.050\nWe're tracking her head\nwith little pellets in a cap,\n\n00:08:49.074 --> 00:08:52.049\nso she's free to move\ncompletely unconstrained.\n\n00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:54.286\nIt's a technical tour de force.\n\n00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.894\nWhat are we seeing?\n\n00:08:55.918 --> 00:08:57.812\nWe're seeing the baby brain.\n\n00:08:57.836 --> 00:09:03.122\nAs the baby hears a word in her language,\nthe auditory areas light up,\n\n00:09:03.146 --> 00:09:07.934\nand then subsequently areas surrounding it\nthat we think are related to coherence,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:11.934\ngetting the brain coordinated\nwith its different areas, and causality,\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.934\none brain area\ncausing another to activate.\n\n00:09:15.559 --> 00:09:20.943\nWe are embarking on a grand\nand golden age of knowledge\n\n00:09:20.967 --> 00:09:23.203\nabout child's brain development.\n\n00:09:23.227 --> 00:09:25.648\nWe're going to be able\nto see a child's brain\n\n00:09:25.672 --> 00:09:29.913\nas they experience an emotion,\nas they learn to speak and read,\n\n00:09:29.937 --> 00:09:33.139\nas they solve a math problem,\nas they have an idea.\n\n00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:36.822\nAnd we're going to be able to invent\nbrain-based interventions\n\n00:09:36.846 --> 00:09:39.116\nfor children who have difficulty learning.\n\n00:09:39.529 --> 00:09:42.595\nJust as the poets and writers described,\n\n00:09:42.619 --> 00:09:46.773\nwe're going to be able to see, I think,\nthat wondrous openness,\n\n00:09:46.797 --> 00:09:50.221\nutter and complete openness,\nof the mind of a child.\n\n00:09:50.982 --> 00:09:53.658\nIn investigating the child's brain,\n\n00:09:53.682 --> 00:09:57.678\nwe're going to uncover deep truths\nabout what it means to be human,\n\n00:09:57.702 --> 00:09:58.857\nand in the process,\n\n00:09:58.881 --> 00:10:01.952\nwe may be able to help keep\nour own minds open to learning\n\n00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:03.667\nfor our entire lives.\n\n00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:04.934\nThank you.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Inspiring a life of immersion", "duration": "1068", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jacqueline_novogratz_inspiring_a_life_of_immersion", "transcript": "I've been spending a lot of time traveling around the world these days, talking to groups of students and professionals, and everywhere I'm finding that I hear similar themes. On the one hand, people say, \"The time for change is now.\" They want to be part of it. They talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning. But on the other hand, I hear people talking about fear, a sense of risk-aversion. They say, \"I really want to follow a life of purpose, but I don't know where to start. I don't want to disappoint my family or friends.\" I work in global poverty. And they say, \"I want to work in global poverty, but what will it mean about my career? Will I be marginalized? Will I not make enough money? Will I never get married or have children?\" And as a woman who didn't get married until I was a lot older \u2014 and I'm glad I waited \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 and has no children, I look at these young people and I say, \"Your job is not to be perfect. Your job is only to be human. And nothing important happens in life without a cost.\" These conversations really reflect what's happening at the national and international level. Our leaders and ourselves want everything, but we don't talk about the costs. We don't talk about the sacrifice.One of my favorite quotes from literature was written by Tillie Olsen, the great American writer from the South. In a short story called \"Oh Yes,\" she talks about a white woman in the 1950s who has a daughter who befriends a little African American girl, and she looks at her child with a sense of pride, but she also wonders, what price will she pay? \"Better immersion than to live untouched.\" But the real question is, what is the cost of not daring? What is the cost of not trying?I've been so privileged in my life to know extraordinary leaders who have chosen to live lives of immersion. One woman I knew who was a fellow at a program that I ran at the Rockefeller Foundation was named Ingrid Washinawatok. She was a leader of the Menominee tribe, a Native American peoples. And when we would gather as fellows, she would push us to think about how the elders in Native American culture make decisions. And she said they would literally visualize the faces of children for seven generations into the future, looking at them from the Earth, and they would look at them, holding them as stewards for that future. Ingrid understood that we are connected to each other, not only as human beings, but to every living thing on the planet.And tragically, in 1999, when she was in Colombia working with the U'wa people, focused on preserving their culture and language, she and two colleagues were abducted and tortured and killed by the FARC. And whenever we would gather the fellows after that, we would leave a chair empty for her spirit. And more than a decade later, when I talk to NGO fellows, whether in Trenton, New Jersey or the office of the White House, and we talk about Ingrid, they all say that they're trying to integrate her wisdom and her spirit and really build on the unfulfilled work of her life's mission. And when we think about legacy, I can think of no more powerful one, despite how short her life was.And I've been touched by Cambodian women \u2014 beautiful women, women who held the tradition of the classical dance in Cambodia. And I met them in the early '90s. In the 1970s, under the Pol Pot regime, the Khmer Rouge killed over a million people, and they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals, the artists, the dancers. And at the end of the war, there were only 30 of these classical dancers still living. And the women, who I was so privileged to meet when there were three survivors, told these stories about lying in their cots in the refugee camps. They said they would try so hard to remember the fragments of the dance, hoping that others were alive and doing the same.And one woman stood there with this perfect carriage, her hands at her side, and she talked about the reunion of the 30 after the war and how extraordinary it was. And these big tears fell down her face, but she never lifted her hands to move them. And the women decided that they would train not the next generation of girls, because they had grown too old already, but the next generation. And I sat there in the studio watching these women clapping their hands \u2014 beautiful rhythms \u2014 as these little fairy pixies were dancing around them, wearing these beautiful silk colors. And I thought, after all this atrocity, this is how human beings really pray. Because they're focused on honoring what is most beautiful about our past and building it into the promise of our future. And what these women understood is sometimes the most important things that we do and that we spend our time on are those things that we cannot measure.I also have been touched by the dark side of power and leadership. And I have learned that power, particularly in its absolute form, is an equal opportunity provider. In 1986, I moved to Rwanda, and I worked with a very small group of Rwandan women to start that country's first microfinance bank. And one of the women was Agnes \u2014 there on your extreme left \u2014 she was one of the first three women parliamentarians in Rwanda, and her legacy should have been to be one of the mothers of Rwanda. We built this institution based on social justice, gender equity, this idea of empowering women.But Agnes cared more about the trappings of power than she did principle at the end. And though she had been part of building a liberal party, a political party that was focused on diversity and tolerance, about three months before the genocide, she switched parties and joined the extremist party, Hutu Power, and she became the Minister of Justice under the genocide regime and was known for inciting men to kill faster and stop behaving like women. She was convicted of category one crimes of genocide. And I would visit her in the prisons, sitting side-by-side, knees touching, and I would have to admit to myself that monsters exist in all of us, but that maybe it's not monsters so much, but the broken parts of ourselves, sadnesses, secret shame, and that ultimately it's easy for demagogues to prey on those parts, those fragments, if you will, and to make us look at other beings, human beings, as lesser than ourselves \u2014 and in the extreme, to do terrible things.And there is no group more vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations than young men. I've heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet is the adolescent male. And so in a gathering where we're focused on women, while it is so critical that we invest in our girls and we even the playing field and we find ways to honor them, we have to remember that the girls and the women are most isolated and violated and victimized and made invisible in those very societies where our men and our boys feel disempowered, unable to provide. And that, when they sit on those street corners and all they can think of in the future is no job, no education, no possibility, well then it's easy to understand how the greatest source of status can come from a uniform and a gun.Sometimes very small investments can release enormous, infinite potential that exists in all of us. One of the Acumen Fund fellows at my organization, Suraj Sudhakar, has what we call moral imagination \u2014 the ability to put yourself in another person's shoes and lead from that perspective. And he's been working with this young group of men who come from the largest slum in the world, Kibera. And they're incredible guys. And together they started a book club for a hundred people in the slums, and they're reading many TED authors and liking it. And then they created a business plan competition. Then they decided that they would do TEDx's.And I have learned so much from Chris and Kevin and Alex and Herbert and all of these young men. Alex, in some ways, said it best. He said, \"We used to feel like nobodies, but now we feel like somebodies.\" And I think we have it all wrong when we think that income is the link. What we really yearn for as human beings is to be visible to each other. And the reason these young guys told me that they're doing these TEDx's is because they were sick and tired of the only workshops coming to the slums being those workshops focused on HIV, or at best, microfinance. And they wanted to celebrate what's beautiful about Kibera and Mathare \u2014 the photojournalists and the creatives, the graffiti artists, the teachers and the entrepreneurs. And they're doing it. And my hat's off to you in Kibera.My own work focuses on making philanthropy more effective and capitalism more inclusive. At Acumen Fund, we take philanthropic resources and we invest what we call patient capital \u2014 money that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor not as passive recipients of charity, but as full-bodied agents of change who want to solve their own problems and make their own decisions. We leave our money for 10 to 15 years, and when we get it back, we invest in other innovations that focus on change. I know it works. We've invested more than 50 million dollars in 50 companies, and those companies have brought another 200 million dollars into these forgotten markets. This year alone, they've delivered 40 million services like maternal health care and housing, emergency services, solar energy, so that people can have more dignity in solving their problems.Patient capital is uncomfortable for people searching for simple solutions, easy categories, because we don't see profit as a blunt instrument. But we find those entrepreneurs who put people and the planet before profit. And ultimately, we want to be part of a movement that is about measuring impact, measuring what is most important to us. And my dream is we'll have a world one day where we don't just honor those who take money and make more money from it, but we find those individuals who take our resources and convert it into changing the world in the most positive ways. And it's only when we honor them and celebrate them and give them status that the world will really change.Last May I had this extraordinary 24-hour period where I saw two visions of the world living side-by-side \u2014 one based on violence and the other on transcendence. I happened to be in Lahore, Pakistan on the day that two mosques were attacked by suicide bombers. And the reason these mosques were attacked is because the people praying inside were from a particular sect of Islam who fundamentalists don't believe are fully Muslim. And not only did those suicide bombers take a hundred lives, but they did more, because they created more hatred, more rage, more fear and certainly despair.But less than 24 hours, I was 13 miles away from those mosques, visiting one of our Acumen investees, an incredible man, Jawad Aslam, who dares to live a life of immersion. Born and raised in Baltimore, he studied real estate, worked in commercial real estate, and after 9/11 decided he was going to Pakistan to make a difference. For two years, he hardly made any money, a tiny stipend, but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer named Tasneem Saddiqui. And he had a dream that he would build a housing community on this barren piece of land using patient capital, but he continued to pay a price. He stood on moral ground and refused to pay bribes. It took almost two years just to register the land. But I saw how the level of moral standard can rise from one person's action.Today, 2,000 people live in 300 houses in this beautiful community. And there's schools and clinics and shops. But there's only one mosque. And so I asked Jawad, \"How do you guys navigate? This is a really diverse community. Who gets to use the mosque on Fridays?\" He said, \"Long story. It was hard, it was a difficult road, but ultimately the leaders of the community came together, realizing we only have each other. And we decided that we would elect the three most respected imams, and those imams would take turns, they would rotate who would say Friday prayer. But the whole community, all the different sects, including Shi'a and Sunni, would sit together and pray.\"We need that kind of moral leadership and courage in our worlds. We face huge issues as a world \u2014 the financial crisis, global warming and this growing sense of fear and otherness. And every day we have a choice. We can take the easier road, the more cynical road, which is a road based on sometimes dreams of a past that never really was, a fear of each other, distancing and blame. Or we can take the much more difficult path of transformation, transcendence, compassion and love, but also accountability and justice.I had the great honor of working with the child psychologist Dr. Robert Coles, who stood up for change during the Civil Rights movement in the United States. And he tells this incredible story about working with a little six-year-old girl named Ruby Bridges, the first child to desegregate schools in the South \u2014 in this case, New Orleans. And he said that every day this six-year-old, dressed in her beautiful dress, would walk with real grace through a phalanx of white people screaming angrily, calling her a monster, threatening to poison her \u2014 distorted faces. And every day he would watch her, and it looked like she was talking to the people. And he would say, \"Ruby, what are you saying?\" And she'd say, \"I'm not talking.\" And finally he said, \"Ruby, I see that you're talking. What are you saying?\" And she said, \"Dr. Coles, I am not talking; I'm praying.\" And he said, \"Well, what are you praying?\" And she said, \"I'm praying, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing.'\" At age six, this child was living a life of immersion, and her family paid a price for it. But she became part of history and opened up this idea that all of us should have access to education.My final story is about a young, beautiful man named Josephat Byaruhanga, who was another Acumen Fund fellow, who hails from Uganda, a farming community. And we placed him in a company in Western Kenya, just 200 miles away. And he said to me at the end of his year, \"Jacqueline, it was so humbling, because I thought as a farmer and as an African I would understand how to transcend culture. But especially when I was talking to the African women, I sometimes made these mistakes \u2014 it was so hard for me to learn how to listen.\" And he said, \"So I conclude that, in many ways, leadership is like a panicle of rice. Because at the height of the season, at the height of its powers, it's beautiful, it's green, it nourishes the world, it reaches to the heavens.\" And he said, \"But right before the harvest, it bends over with great gratitude and humility to touch the earth from where it came.\"We need leaders. We ourselves need to lead from a place that has the audacity to believe we can, ourselves, extend the fundamental assumption that all men are created equal to every man, woman and child on this planet. And we need to have the humility to recognize that we cannot do it alone. Robert Kennedy once said that \"few of us have the greatness to bend history itself, but each of us can work to change a small portion of events.\" And it is in the total of all those acts that the history of this generation will be written. Our lives are so short, and our time on this planet is so precious, and all we have is each other. So may each of you live lives of immersion. They won't necessarily be easy lives, but in the end, it is all that will sustain us.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1076, "subtitle":

days,\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.958\ntalking to groups of students and professionals,\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nand everywhere I'm finding that I hear similar themes.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nOn the one hand, people say,\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\n\"The time for change is now.\"\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nThey want to be part of it.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nThey talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nBut on the other hand,\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nI hear people talking about fear,\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\na sense of risk-aversion.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nThey say, \"I really want to follow a life of purpose,\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nbut I don't know where to start.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nI don't want to disappoint my family or friends.\"\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nI work in global poverty.\n\n00:00:45.958 -->

marginalized?\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nWill I not make enough money?\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nWill I never get married or have children?\"\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nAnd as a woman who didn't get married until I was a lot older --\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nand I'm glad I waited --\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\n-- and has no children,\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nI look at these young people\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nand I say, \"Your job is not to be perfect.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nYour job is only to be human.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nAnd nothing important happens in life\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nwithout a cost.\"\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nThese conversations really reflect what's happening\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nat the national and international level.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nOur leaders and ourselves\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nwant everything,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nbut we don't talk about the costs.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nWe don't talk about the sacrifice.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nOne of my favorite quotes from literature\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nwas written by Tillie Olsen,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nthe great American writer from the South.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nIn a short story called \"Oh Yes,\"\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nshe talks about a white woman in the 1950s\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nwho has a daughter\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nwho befriends a little African American girl,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nand she looks at her child with a sense of pride,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nbut she also wonders,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nwhat price will she pay?\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\n\"Better immersion\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nthan to live untouched.\"\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nBut the real question is,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nwhat is the cost of not daring?\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nWhat is the cost of not trying?\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nI've been so privileged in my life\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nto know extraordinary leaders\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nwho have chosen to live lives of immersion.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nOne woman I knew who was a fellow\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nat a program that I ran at the Rockefeller Foundation\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nwas named Ingrid Washinawatok.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nShe was a leader of the Menominee tribe,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\na Native American peoples.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nAnd when we would gather as fellows,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nshe would push us to think about\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nhow the elders in Native American culture\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nmake decisions.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nAnd she said they would literally visualize\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nthe faces of children\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nfor seven generations into the future,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nlooking at them from the Earth,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nand they would look at them, holding them as stewards\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nfor that future.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nIngrid understood that we are connected to each other,\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nnot only as human beings,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nbut to every living thing on the planet.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nAnd tragically, in 1999,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nwhen she was in Colombia\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nworking with the U'wa people,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nfocused on preserving their culture and language,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nshe and two colleagues were abducted\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nand tortured and killed by the FARC.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nAnd whenever we would gather the fellows after that,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nwe would leave a chair empty for her spirit.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nAnd more than a decade later,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nwhen I talk to NGO fellows,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nwhether in Trenton, New Jersey or the office of the White House,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nand we talk about Ingrid,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nthey all say that they're trying to integrate her wisdom\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nand her spirit\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nand really build on the unfulfilled work\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nof her life's mission.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nAnd when we think about legacy,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nI can think of no more powerful one,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\ndespite how short her life was.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nAnd I've been touched by Cambodian women --\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nbeautiful women,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nwomen who held the tradition of the classical dance in Cambodia.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAnd I met them in the early '90s.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nIn the 1970s, under the Pol Pot regime,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthe Khmer Rouge killed over a million people,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nand they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nthe artists, the dancers.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nAnd at the end of the war,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nthere were only 30 of these classical dancers still living.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nAnd the women, who I was so privileged to meet\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nwhen there were three survivors,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\ntold these stories about lying in their cots\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nin the refugee camps.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nThey said they would try so hard\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nto remember the fragments of the dance,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nhoping that others were alive and doing the same.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nAnd one woman stood there with this perfect carriage,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nher hands at her side,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nand she talked about\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nthe reunion of the 30 after the war\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nand how extraordinary it was.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nAnd these big tears fell down her face,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nbut she never lifted her hands to move them.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nAnd the women decided that they would train\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nnot the next generation of girls, because they had grown too old already,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nbut the next generation.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nAnd I sat there in the studio\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nwatching these women clapping their hands --\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nbeautiful rhythms --\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nas these little fairy pixies\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nwere dancing around them,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nwearing these beautiful silk colors.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAnd I thought, after all this atrocity,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nthis is how human beings really pray.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nBecause they're focused on honoring\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nwhat is most beautiful about our past\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nand building it into\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nthe promise of our future.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nAnd what these women understood\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nis sometimes the most important things that we do\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nand that we spend our time on\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nare those things that we cannot measure.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nI also have been touched\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nby the dark side of power and leadership.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nAnd I have learned that power,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nparticularly in its absolute form,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nis an equal opportunity provider.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nIn 1986, I moved to Rwanda,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nand I worked with a very small group of Rwandan women\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nto start that country's first microfinance bank.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAnd one of the women was Agnes --\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nthere on your extreme left --\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nshe was one of the first three\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nwomen parliamentarians in Rwanda,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nand her legacy should have been\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nto be one of the mothers of Rwanda.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nWe built this institution based on social justice,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\ngender equity,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nthis idea of empowering women.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nBut Agnes cared more about the trappings of power\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nthan she did principle at the end.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nAnd though she had been part of building a liberal party,\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\na political party\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nthat was focused on diversity and tolerance,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nabout three months before the genocide, she switched parties\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nand joined the extremist party, Hutu Power,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nand she became the Minister of Justice\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nunder the genocide regime\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nand was known for inciting men to kill faster\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nand stop behaving like women.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nShe was convicted\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nof category one crimes of genocide.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nAnd I would visit her in the prisons,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nsitting side-by-side, knees touching,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand I would have to admit to myself\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nthat monsters exist in all of us,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nbut that maybe it's not monsters so much,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nbut the broken parts of ourselves,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nsadnesses, secret shame,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nand that ultimately it's easy for demagogues\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nto prey on those parts,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nthose fragments, if you will,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nand to make us look at other beings, human beings,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nas lesser than ourselves --\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nand in the extreme, to do terrible things.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nAnd there is no group\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nmore vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nthan young men.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nI've heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nis the adolescent male.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nAnd so in a gathering\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nwhere we're focused on women,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nwhile it is so critical that we invest in our girls\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nand we even the playing field\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nand we find ways to honor them,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nwe have to remember that the girls and the women\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nare most isolated and violated\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nand victimized and made invisible\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nin those very societies\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nwhere our men and our boys\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nfeel disempowered,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nunable to provide.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nAnd that, when they sit on those street corners\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nand all they can think of in the future\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nis no job, no education,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nno possibility,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nwell then it's easy to understand\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nhow the greatest source of status\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\ncan come from a uniform\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nand a gun.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nSometimes very small investments\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\ncan release enormous, infinite potential\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nthat exists in all of us.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nOne of the Acumen Fund fellows at my organization,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nSuraj Sudhakar,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nhas what we call moral imagination --\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nthe ability to put yourself in another person's shoes\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nand lead from that perspective.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nAnd he's been working with this young group of men\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nwho come from the largest slum in the world, Kibera.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nAnd they're incredible guys.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nAnd together they started a book club\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nfor a hundred people in the slums,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nand they're reading many TED authors and liking it.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nAnd then they created a business plan competition.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nThen they decided that they would do TEDx's.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nAnd I have learned so much\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nfrom Chris and Kevin\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nand Alex and Herbert\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nand all of these young men.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nAlex, in some ways, said it best.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nHe said, \"We used to feel like nobodies,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nbut now we feel like somebodies.\"\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nAnd I think we have it all wrong\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nwhen we think that income is the link.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nWhat we really yearn for as human beings\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nis to be visible to each other.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nAnd the reason these young guys\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\ntold me that they're doing these TEDx's\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nis because they were sick and tired\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nof the only workshops coming to the slums\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nbeing those workshops focused on HIV,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nor at best, microfinance.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nAnd they wanted to celebrate\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nwhat's beautiful about Kibera and Mathare --\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nthe photojournalists and the creatives,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nthe graffiti artists, the teachers and the entrepreneurs.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nAnd they're doing it.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nAnd my hat's off to you in Kibera.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nMy own work focuses\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\non making philanthropy more effective\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nand capitalism more inclusive.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nAt Acumen Fund, we take philanthropic resources\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nand we invest what we call patient capital --\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nmoney that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nnot as passive recipients of charity,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nbut as full-bodied agents of change\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nwho want to solve their own problems\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nand make their own decisions.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nWe leave our money for 10 to 15 years,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nand when we get it back, we invest in other innovations\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nthat focus on change.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nI know it works.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nWe've invested more than 50 million dollars in 50 companies,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nand those companies have brought another 200 million dollars\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\ninto these forgotten markets.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nThis year alone, they've delivered 40 million services\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nlike maternal health care and housing,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nemergency services, solar energy,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nso that people can have more dignity\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nin solving their problems.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nPatient capital is uncomfortable\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nfor people searching for simple solutions,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\neasy categories,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nbecause we don't see profit as a blunt instrument.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nBut we find those entrepreneurs\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nwho put people and the planet\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nbefore profit.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nAnd ultimately, we want to be part of a movement\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nthat is about measuring impact,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nmeasuring what is most important to us.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nAnd my dream is we'll have a world one day\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nwhere we don't just honor those who take money\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nand make more money from it,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nbut we find those individuals who take our resources\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nand convert it into changing the world\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nin the most positive ways.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nAnd it's only when we honor them\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nand celebrate them and give them status\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nthat the world will really change.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nLast May I had this extraordinary 24-hour period\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nwhere I saw two visions of the world\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nliving side-by-side --\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\none based on violence\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nand the other on transcendence.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nI happened to be in Lahore, Pakistan\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\non the day that two mosques were attacked\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nby suicide bombers.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nAnd the reason these mosques were attacked\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nis because the people praying inside\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nwere from a particular sect of Islam\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nwho fundamentalists don't believe are fully Muslim.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nAnd not only did those suicide bombers\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\ntake a hundred lives,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nbut they did more,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nbecause they created more hatred, more rage, more fear\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nand certainly despair.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nBut less than 24 hours,\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nI was 13 miles away from those mosques,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nvisiting one of our Acumen investees,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nan incredible man, Jawad Aslam,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nwho dares to live a life of immersion.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nBorn and raised in Baltimore,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nhe studied real estate, worked in commercial real estate,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nand after 9/11 decided he was going to Pakistan to make a difference.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nFor two years, he hardly made any money, a tiny stipend,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nbut he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nnamed Tasneem Saddiqui.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nAnd he had a dream that he would build a housing community\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\non this barren piece of land\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nusing patient capital,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nbut he continued to pay a price.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nHe stood on moral ground\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nand refused to pay bribes.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nIt took almost two years just to register the land.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nBut I saw how the level of moral standard can rise\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nfrom one person's action.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nToday, 2,000 people live in 300 houses\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nin this beautiful community.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nAnd there's schools and clinics and shops.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nBut there's only one mosque.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nAnd so I asked Jawad,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\n\"How do you guys navigate? This is a really diverse community.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nWho gets to use the mosque on Fridays?\"\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nHe said, \"Long story.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nIt was hard, it was a difficult road,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nbut ultimately the leaders of the community came together,\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nrealizing we only have each other.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nAnd we decided that we would elect\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nthe three most respected imams,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nand those imams would take turns,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nthey would rotate who would say Friday prayer.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nBut the whole community,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nall the different sects, including Shi'a and Sunni,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nwould sit together and pray.\"\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nWe need that kind of moral leadership and courage\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nin our worlds.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nWe face huge issues as a world --\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nthe financial crisis,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nglobal warming\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nand this growing sense of fear and otherness.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nAnd every day we have a choice.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nWe can take the easier road,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nthe more cynical road,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nwhich is a road based on\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nsometimes dreams of a past that never really was,\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\na fear of each other,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\ndistancing and blame.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nOr we can take the much more difficult path\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nof transformation, transcendence,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\ncompassion and love,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nbut also accountability and justice.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nI had the great honor\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nof working with the child psychologist Dr. Robert Coles,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nwho stood up for change\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nduring the Civil Rights movement in the United States.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nAnd he tells this incredible story\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nabout working with a little six-year-old girl named Ruby Bridges,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nthe first child to desegregate schools in the South --\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nin this case, New Orleans.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nAnd he said that every day\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nthis six-year-old, dressed in her beautiful dress,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nwould walk with real grace\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nthrough a phalanx of white people\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nscreaming angrily, calling her a monster,\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nthreatening to poison her --\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\ndistorted faces.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nAnd every day he would watch her,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nand it looked like she was talking to the people.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nAnd he would say, \"Ruby, what are you saying?\"\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nAnd she'd say, \"I'm not talking.\"\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nAnd finally he said, \"Ruby, I see that you're talking.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nWhat are you saying?\"\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nAnd she said, \"Dr. Coles, I am not talking;\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nI'm praying.\"\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nAnd he said, \"Well, what are you praying?\"\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nAnd she said, \"I'm praying, 'Father, forgive them,\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nfor they know not what they are doing.'\"\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nAt age six,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nthis child was living a life of immersion,\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nand her family paid a price for it.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nBut she became part of history\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nand opened up this idea\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nthat all of us should have access to education.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nMy final story is about a young, beautiful man\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nnamed Josephat Byaruhanga,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nwho was another Acumen Fund fellow,\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nwho hails from Uganda, a farming community.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nAnd we placed him in a company in Western Kenya,\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\njust 200 miles away.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nAnd he said to me at the end of his year,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\n\"Jacqueline, it was so humbling,\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nbecause I thought as a farmer and as an African\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nI would understand how to transcend culture.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nBut especially when I was talking to the African women,\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nI sometimes made these mistakes --\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nit was so hard for me to learn how to listen.\"\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nAnd he said, \"So I conclude that, in many ways,\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nleadership is like a panicle of rice.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nBecause at the height of the season,\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nat the height of its powers,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nit's beautiful, it's green, it nourishes the world,\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nit reaches to the heavens.\"\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nAnd he said, \"But right before the harvest,\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nit bends over\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nwith great gratitude and humility\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nto touch the earth from where it came.\"\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nWe need leaders.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nWe ourselves need to lead\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nfrom a place that has the audacity\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nto believe we can, ourselves,\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nextend the fundamental assumption\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nthat all men are created equal\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nto every man, woman and child on this planet.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nAnd we need to have the humility to recognize\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nthat we cannot do it alone.\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nRobert Kennedy once said\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nthat \"few of us have the greatness to bend history itself,\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nbut each of us can work\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nto change a small portion of events.\"\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nAnd it is in the total of all those acts\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nthat the history of this generation will be written.\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nOur lives are so short,\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nand our time on this planet\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nis so precious,\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nand all we have is each other.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nSo may each of you\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nlive lives of immersion.\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nThey won't necessarily be easy lives,\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nbut in the end, it is all that will sustain us.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nThank you.\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:35.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The future of business is the \"mesh\"", "duration": "887", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/lisa_gansky_the_future_of_business_is_the_mesh", "transcript": "I'm speaking to you about what I call the \"mesh.\" It's essentially a fundamental shift in our relationship with stuff, with the things in our lives. And it's starting to look at \u2014 not always and not for everything \u2014 but in certain moments of time, access to certain kinds of goods and service will trump ownership of them. And so it's the pursuit of better things, easily shared. And we come from a long tradition of sharing. We've shared transportation. We've shared wine and food and other sorts of fabulous experiences in coffee bars in Amsterdam. We've also shared other sorts of entertainment \u2014 sports arenas, public parks, concert halls, libraries, universities. All these things are share-platforms, but sharing ultimately starts and ends with what I refer to as the \"mother of all share-platforms.\"And as I think about the mesh and I think about, well, what's driving it, how come it's happening now, I think there's a number of vectors that I want to give you as background. One is the recession \u2014 that the recession has caused us to rethink our relationship with the things in our lives relative to the value \u2014 so starting to align the value with the true cost. Secondly, population growth and density into cities. More people, smaller spaces, less stuff. Climate change: we're trying to reduce the stress in our personal lives and in our communities and on the planet. Also, there's been this recent distrust of big brands, global big brands, in a bunch of different industries, and that's created an opening. Research is showing here, in the States, and in Canada and Western Europe, that most of us are much more open to local companies, or brands that maybe we haven't heard of. Whereas before, we went with the big brands that we were sure we trusted. And last is that we're more connected now to more people on the planet than ever before \u2014 except for if you're sitting next to someone.(Laughter)The other thing that's worth considering is that we've made a huge investment over decades and decades, and tens of billions of dollars have gone into this investment that now is our inheritance. It's a physical infrastructure that allows us to get from point A to point B and move things that way. It's also \u2014 Web and mobile allow us to be connected and create all kinds of platforms and systems, and the investment of those technologies and that infrastructure is really our inheritance. It allows us to engage in really new and interesting ways.And so for me, a mesh company, the \"classic\" mesh company, brings together these three things: our ability to connect to each other \u2014 most of us are walking around with these mobile devices that are GPS-enabled and Web-enabled \u2014 allows us to find each other and find things in time and space. And third is that physical things are readable on a map \u2014 so restaurants, a variety of venues, but also with GPS and other technology like RFID and it continues to expand beyond that, we can also track things that are moving, like a car, a taxicab, a transit system, a box that's moving through time and space. And so that sets up for making access to get goods and services more convenient and less costly in many cases than owning them.For example, I want to use Zipcar. How many people here have experienced car-sharing or bike-sharing? Wow, that's great. Okay, thank you. Basically Zipcar is the largest car-sharing company in the world. They did not invent car-sharing. Car-sharing was actually invented in Europe. One of the founders went to Switzerland, saw it implemented someplace, said, \"Wow, that looks really cool. I think we can do that in Cambridge,\" brought it to Cambridge and they started \u2014 two women \u2014 Robin Chase being the other person who started it. Zipcar got some really important things right. First, they really understood that a brand is a voice and a product is a souvenir. And so they were very clever about the way that they packaged car-sharing. They made it sexy. They made it fresh. They made it aspirational. If you were a member of the club, when you're a member of a club, you're a Zipster. The cars they picked didn't look like ex-cop cars that were hollowed out or something. They picked these sexy cars. They targeted to universities. They made sure that the demographic for who they were targeting and the car was all matching. It was a very nice experience, and the cars were clean and reliable, and it all worked.And so from a branding perspective, they got a lot right. But they understood fundamentally that they are not a car company. They understand that they are an information company. Because when we buy a car we go to the dealer once, we have an interaction, and we're chow \u2014 usually as quickly as possible. But when you're sharing a car and you have a car-share service, you might use an E.V. to commute, you get a truck because you're doing a home project. When you pick your aunt up at the airport, you get a sedan. And you're going to the mountains to ski, you get different accessories put on the car for doing that sort of thing. Meanwhile, these guys are sitting back, collecting all sorts of data about our behavior and how we interact with the service. And so it's not only an option for them, but I believe it's an imperative for Zipcar and other mesh companies to actually just wow us, to be like a concierge service. Because we give them so much information, and they are entitled to really see how it is that we're moving. They're in really good shape to anticipate what we're going to want next.And so what percent of the day do you think the average person uses a car? What percentage of the time? Any guesses? Those are really very good. I was imagining it was like 20 percent when I first started. The number across the U.S. and Western Europe is eight percent. And so basically even if you think it's 10 percent, 90 percent of the time, something that costs us a lot of money \u2014 personally, and also we organize our cities around it and all sorts of things \u2014 90 percent of the time it's sitting around. So for this reason, I think one of the other themes with the mesh is essentially that, if we squeeze hard on things that we've thrown away, there's a lot of value in those things. What set up with Zipcar \u2014 Zipcar started in 2000.In the last year, 2010, two car companies started, one that's in the U.K. called WhipCar, and the other one, RelayRides, in the U.S. They're both peer-to-peer car-sharing services, because the two things that really work for car-sharing is, one, the car has to be available, and two, it's within one or two blocks of where you stand. Well the car that's one or two blocks from your home or your office is probably your neighbor's car, and it's probably also available. So people have created this business. Zipcar started a decade earlier, in 2000. It took them six years to get 1,000 cars in service. WhipCar, which started April of last year, it took them six months to get 1,000 cars in the service. So, really interesting. People are making anywhere between 200 and 700 dollars a month letting their neighbors use their car when they're not using it. So it's like vacation rentals for cars. Since I'm here \u2014 and I hope some people in the audience are in the car business \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 I'm thinking that, coming from the technology side of things \u2014 we saw cable-ready TVs and WiFi-ready Notebooks \u2014 it would be really great if, any minute now, you guys could start rolling share-ready cars off. Because it just creates more flexibility. It allows us as owners to have other options. And I think we're going there anyway.The opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses \u2014 and those are businesses like Zipcar or Netflix that are full mesh businesses, or other ones where you have a lot of the car companies, car manufacturers, who are beginning to offer their own car-share services as well as a second flanker brand, or as really a test, I think \u2014 is to make sharing irresistible. We have experiences in our lives, certainly, when sharing has been irresistible. It's just, how do we make that recurrent and scale it? We know also, because we're connected in social networks, that it's easy to create delight in one little place. It's contagious because we're all connected to each other. So if I have a terrific experience and I tweet it, or I tell five people standing next to me, news travels. The opposite, as we know, is also true, often more true.So here we have LudoTruck, which is in L.A., doing the things that gourmet food trucks do, and they've gathered quite a following. In general, and maybe, again, it's because I'm a tech entrepreneur, I look at things as platforms. Platforms are invitations. So creating Craigslist or iTunes and the iPhone developer network, there are all these networks \u2014 Facebook as well. These platforms invite all sorts of developers and all sorts of people to come with their ideas and their opportunity to create and target an application for a particular audience. And honestly, it's full of surprises. Because I don't think any of us in this room could have predicted the sorts of applications that have happened at Facebook, around Facebook, for example, two years ago, when Mark announced that they were going to go with a platform.So in this way, I think that cities are platforms, and certainly Detroit is a platform. The invitation of bringing makers and artists and entrepreneurs \u2014 it really helps stimulate this fiery creativity and helps a city to thrive. It's inviting participation, and cities have, historically, invited all sorts of participation. Now we're saying that there's other options as well. So, for example, city departments can open up transit data. Google has made available transit data API. And so there's about seven or eight cities already in the U.S. that have provided the transit data, and different developers are building applications. So I was having a coffee in Portland, and half-of-a-latte in and the little board in the cafe all of a sudden starts showing me that the next bus is coming in three minutes and the train is coming in 16 minutes. And so it's reliable, real data that's right in my face, where I am, so I can finish the latte.There's this fabulous opportunity we have across the U.S. now: about 21 percent of vacant commercial and industrial space. That space is not vital. The areas around it lack vitality and vibrancy and engagement. There's this thing \u2014 how many people here have heard of pop-up stores or pop-up shops? Oh, great. So I'm a big fan of this. And this is a very mesh-y thing. Essentially, there are all sorts of restaurants in Oakland, near where I live. There's a pop-up general store every three weeks, and they do a fantastic job of making a very social event happening for foodies. Super fun, and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood. Subsequent to that, after it's been going for about a year now, they actually started to lease and create and extend. An area that was edgy-artsy is now starting to become much cooler and engage a lot more people. So this is an example. The Crafty Fox is this woman who's into crafts, and she does these pop-up crafts fairs around London. But these sorts of things are happening in many different environments. From my perspective, one of the things pop-up stores do is create perishability and urgency. It creates two of the favorite words of any businessperson: sold out. And the opportunity to really focus trust and attention is a wonderful thing.So a lot of what we see in the mesh, and a lot of what we have in the platform that we built allows us to define, refine and scale. It allows us to test things as an entrepreneur, to go to market, to be in conversation with people, listen, refine something and go back. It's very cost-effective, and it's very mesh-y. The infrastructure enables that.In closing, and as we're moving towards the end, I just also want to encourage \u2014 and I'm willing to share my failures as well, though not from the stage. (Laughter) I would just like to say that one of the big things, when we look at waste and when we look at ways that we can really be generous and contribute to each other, but also move to create a better economic situation and a better environmental situation, is by sharing failures. And one quick example is Velib, in 2007, came forward in Paris with a very bold proposition, a very big bike-sharing service. They made a lot of mistakes. They had some number of big successes. But they were very transparent, or they had to be, in the way that they exposed what worked and didn't work. And so B.C. in Barcelona and B-cycle and Boris Bikes in London \u2014 no one has had to repeat the version 1.0 screw-ups and expensive learning exercises that happened in Paris. So the opportunity when we're connected is also to share failures and successes.We're at the very beginning of something that, what we're seeing and the way that mesh companies are coming forward, is inviting, it's engaging, but it's very early. I have a website \u2014 it's a directory \u2014 and it started with about 1,200 companies, and in the last two-and-a-half months it's up to about 3,300 companies. And it grows on a very regular daily basis. But it's very much at the beginning.So I just want to welcome all of you onto the ride. And thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1077, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nI'm speaking to you about what I call the

00:02:37.958\nthat allows us to get from point A to point B\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nand move things that way.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nIt's also -- Web and mobile\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nallow us to be connected\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nand create all kinds of platforms and systems,\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nand the investment of those technologies\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nand that infrastructure\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nis really our inheritance.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nIt allows us to engage\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nin really new and interesting ways.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nAnd so for me, a mesh company, the \"classic\" mesh company,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nbrings together these three things:\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nour ability to connect to each other --\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nmost of us are walking around with these mobile devices\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nthat are GPS-enabled and Web-enabled --\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nallows us to find each other\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nand find things in time and space.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nAnd third is that physical things\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nare readable on a map --\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nso restaurants, a variety of venues,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nbut also with GPS and other technology\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nlike RFID\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nand it continues to expand beyond that,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nwe can also track things that are moving,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nlike a car, a taxicab, a transit system,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\na box that's moving through time and space.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nAnd so that sets up\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nfor making access to get goods and services\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nmore convenient and less costly in many cases\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nthan owning them.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nFor example, I want to use Zipcar.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nHow many people here have experienced\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\ncar-sharing or bike-sharing?\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nWow, that's great. Okay, thank you.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nBasically Zipcar\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nis the largest car-sharing company in the world.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nThey did not invent car-sharing.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nCar-sharing was actually invented in Europe.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nOne of the founders went to Switzerland,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nsaw it implemented someplace,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nsaid, \"Wow, that looks really cool.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nI think we can do that in Cambridge,\"\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nbrought it to Cambridge\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nand they started -- two women --\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nRobin Chase being the other person who started it.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nZipcar got some really important things right.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nFirst, they really understood\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nthat a brand is a voice and a product is a souvenir.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nAnd so they were very clever\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nabout the way that they packaged car-sharing.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nThey made it sexy. They made it fresh.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nThey made it aspirational.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nIf you were a member of the club,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nwhen you're a member of a club, you're a Zipster.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nThe cars they picked didn't look like ex-cop cars\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nthat were hollowed out or something.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nThey picked these sexy cars.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nThey targeted to universities.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nThey made sure that the demographic\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nfor who they were targeting and the car was all matching.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nIt was a very nice experience,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nand the cars were clean and reliable, and it all worked.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nAnd so from a branding perspective, they got a lot right.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nBut they understood fundamentally\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nthat they are not a car company.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nThey understand that they are an information company.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nBecause when we buy a car\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nwe go to the dealer once, we have an interaction, and we're chow --\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nusually as quickly as possible.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nBut when you're sharing a car and you have a car-share service,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nyou might use an E.V. to commute,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nyou get a truck because you're doing a home project.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nWhen you pick your aunt up at the airport, you get a sedan.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nAnd you're going to the mountains to ski,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nyou get different accessories put on the car\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nfor doing that sort of thing.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nMeanwhile, these guys are sitting back,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\ncollecting all sorts of data\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nabout our behavior and how we interact with the service.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nAnd so it's not only an option for them,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nbut I believe it's an imperative\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nfor Zipcar and other mesh companies\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nto actually just wow us,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nto be like a concierge service.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nBecause we give them so much information,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand they are entitled to really see\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nhow it is that we're moving.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nThey're in really good shape to anticipate\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nwhat we're going to want next.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nAnd so what percent of the day\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\ndo you think the average person uses a car?\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nWhat percentage of the time?\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nAny guesses?\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nThose are really very good.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nI was imagining it was like\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\n20 percent when I first started.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nThe number across the U.S. and Western Europe\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nis eight percent.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nAnd so basically even if you think it's 10 percent,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\n90 percent of the time,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nsomething that costs us a lot of money --\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\npersonally, and also we organize our cities around it\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nand all sorts of things --\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\n90 percent of the time it's sitting around.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nSo for this reason,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nI think one of the other themes with the mesh\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nis essentially that, if we squeeze hard\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\non things that we've thrown away,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nthere's a lot of value in those things.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nWhat set up with Zipcar -- Zipcar started in 2000.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nIn the last year, 2010,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\ntwo car companies started,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\none that's in the U.K. called WhipCar,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nand the other one, RelayRides, in the U.S.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nThey're both peer-to-peer car-sharing services,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nbecause the two things that really work for car-sharing\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nis, one, the car has to be available,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nand two, it's within one or two blocks\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nof where you stand.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nWell the car that's one or two blocks from your home or your office\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nis probably your neighbor's car,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nand it's probably also available.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nSo people have created this business.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nZipcar started a decade earlier,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nin 2000.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nIt took them six years\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nto get 1,000 cars in service.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nWhipCar, which started April of last year,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nit took them six months\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nto get 1,000 cars in the service.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nSo, really interesting.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nPeople are making anywhere between\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\n200 and 700 dollars a month\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nletting their neighbors use their car when they're not using it.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nSo it's like vacation rentals for cars.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nSince I'm here --\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nand I hope some people in the audience\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nare in the car business --\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\n-- I'm thinking that, coming from the technology side of things --\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nwe saw cable-ready TVs\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nand WiFi-ready Notebooks --\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nit would be really great if, any minute now,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nyou guys could start rolling share-ready cars off.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nBecause it just creates more flexibility.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nIt allows us as owners to have other options.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nAnd I think we're going there anyway.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nThe opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses --\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nand those are businesses like Zipcar or Netflix\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nthat are full mesh businesses,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nor other ones where you have a lot of the car companies,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\ncar manufacturers,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nwho are beginning to offer\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\ntheir own car-share services\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nas well as a second flanker brand,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nor as really a test, I think --\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nis to make sharing irresistible.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nWe have experiences in our lives, certainly,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nwhen sharing has been irresistible.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nIt's just, how do we make that recurrent\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nand scale it?\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nWe know also, because we're connected in social networks,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nthat it's easy to create delight\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nin one little place.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nIt's contagious because we're all connected to each other.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nSo if I have a terrific experience\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nand I tweet it, or I tell five people standing next to me, news travels.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nThe opposite, as we know, is also true,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\noften more true.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nSo here we have LudoTruck, which is in L.A.,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\ndoing the things that gourmet food trucks do,\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nand they've gathered quite a following.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nIn general, and maybe, again, it's because I'm a tech entrepreneur,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nI look at things as platforms.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nPlatforms are invitations.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nSo creating Craigslist\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nor iTunes and the iPhone developer network,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nthere are all these networks -- Facebook as well.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nThese platforms invite all sorts of developers\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nand all sorts of people\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nto come with their ideas and their opportunity\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nto create and target an application\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nfor a particular audience.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nAnd honestly, it's full of surprises.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nBecause I don't think any of us in this room\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\ncould have predicted the sorts of applications\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nthat have happened at Facebook, around Facebook,\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nfor example, two years ago,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nwhen Mark announced\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nthat they were going to go with a platform.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nSo in this way, I think that cities are platforms,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nand certainly Detroit is a platform.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nThe invitation of bringing\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nmakers and artists and entrepreneurs --\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nit really helps stimulate this fiery creativity\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nand helps a city to thrive.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nIt's inviting participation,\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nand cities have, historically,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\ninvited all sorts of participation.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nNow we're saying that there's other options as well.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nSo, for example, city departments\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\ncan open up transit data.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nGoogle has made available transit data API.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nAnd so there's about seven or eight cities already in the U.S.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nthat have provided the transit data,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nand different developers are building applications.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nSo I was having a coffee in Portland,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nand half-of-a-latte in\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nand the little board in the cafe\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nall of a sudden starts showing me\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nthat the next bus is coming in three minutes\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nand the train is coming in 16 minutes.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nAnd so it's reliable, real data\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nthat's right in my face, where I am,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nso I can finish the latte.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nThere's this fabulous opportunity we have across the U.S. now:\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nabout 21 percent\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nof vacant commercial and industrial space.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nThat space is not vital.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nThe areas around it lack vitality\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nand vibrancy and engagement.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nThere's this thing -- how many people here\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nhave heard of pop-up stores or pop-up shops?\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nOh, great. So I'm a big fan of this.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAnd this is a very mesh-y thing.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nEssentially, there are all sorts\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nof restaurants in Oakland, near where I live.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nThere's a pop-up general store every three weeks,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nand they do a fantastic job\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nof making a very social event\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nhappening for foodies.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nSuper fun, and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nSubsequent to that,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nafter it's been going for about a year now,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nthey actually started to lease and create and extend.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nAn area that was edgy-artsy\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nis now starting to become much cooler\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nand engage a lot more people.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nSo this is an example.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nThe Crafty Fox is this woman who's into crafts,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand she does these pop-up crafts fairs around London.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nBut these sorts of things are happening\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nin many different environments.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nFrom my perspective, one of the things pop-up stores do\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nis create perishability and urgency.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nIt creates two of the favorite words of any businessperson:\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nsold out.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nAnd the opportunity to really focus trust and attention\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nis a wonderful thing.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nSo a lot of what we see in the mesh,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nand a lot of what we have in the platform that we built\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nallows us to define, refine and scale.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nIt allows us to test things as an entrepreneur,\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nto go to market,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nto be in conversation with people,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nlisten, refine something and go back.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nIt's very cost-effective,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nand it's very mesh-y.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nThe infrastructure enables that.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nIn closing, and as we're moving towards the end,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nI just also want to encourage --\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nand I'm willing to share my failures as well,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nthough not from the stage.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nI would just like to say that one of the big things,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nwhen we look at waste\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nand when we look at ways that we can really be generous\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nand contribute to each other,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nbut also move to create a better economic situation\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nand a better environmental situation,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nis by sharing failures.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nAnd one quick example\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nis Velib, in 2007,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\ncame forward in Paris\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nwith a very bold proposition,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\na very big bike-sharing service.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nThey made a lot of mistakes.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nThey had some number of big successes.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nBut they were very transparent, or they had to be,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nin the way that they exposed\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nwhat worked and didn't work.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nAnd so B.C. in Barcelona\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nand B-cycle\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nand Boris Bikes in London --\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nno one has had to repeat\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nthe version 1.0 screw-ups\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nand expensive learning exercises\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nthat happened in Paris.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nSo the opportunity when we're connected\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nis also to share failures and successes.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nWe're at the very beginning of something\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nthat, what we're seeing\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nand the way that mesh companies are coming forward,\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nis inviting, it's engaging, but it's very early.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nI have a website -- it's a directory --\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nand it started with about 1,200 companies,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nand in the last two-and-a-half months\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nit's up to about 3,300 companies.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd it grows on a very regular daily basis.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nBut it's very much at the beginning.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nSo I just want to welcome all of you onto the ride.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nAnd thank you very much.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "On being a woman and a diplomat", "duration": "779", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/madeleine_albright_on_being_a_woman_and_a_diplomat", "transcript": "Pat Mitchell: What is the story of this pin?Madeleine Albright: This is \"Breaking the Glass Ceiling.\"PM: Oh. That was well chosen, I would say, for TEDWomen.MA: Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning is trying to figure out what is going to happen. And none of this pin stuff would have happened if it hadn't been for Saddam Hussein. I'll tell you what happened. I went to the United Nations as an ambassador, and it was after the Gulf War, and I was an instructed ambassador. And the cease-fire had been translated into a series of sanctions resolutions, and my instructions were to say perfectly terrible things about Saddam Hussein constantly, which he deserved \u2014 he had invaded another country. And so all of a sudden, a poem appeared in the papers in Baghdad comparing me to many things, but among them an \"unparalleled serpent.\" And so I happened to have a snake pin. So I wore it when we talked about Iraq. (Laughter) And when I went out to meet the press, they zeroed in, said, \"Why are you wearing that snake pin?\" I said, \"Because Saddam Hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent.\" And then I thought, well this is fun. So I went out and I bought a lot of pins that would, in fact, reflect what I thought we were going to do on any given day. So that's how it all started.PM: So how large is the collection?MA: Pretty big. It's now traveling. At the moment it's in Indianapolis, but it was at the Smithsonian. And it goes with a book that says, \"Read My Pins.\"(Laughter)PM: So is this a good idea. I remember when you were the first woman as Secretary of State, and there was a lot of conversation always about what you were wearing, how you looked \u2014 the thing that happens to a lot of women, especially if they're the first in a position. So how do you feel about that \u2014 the whole \u2014MA: Well, it's pretty irritating actually because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing. But people did pay attention to what clothes I had. What was interesting was that, before I went up to New York as U.N. ambassador, I talked to Jeane Kirkpatrick, who'd been ambassador before me, and she said, \"You've got to get rid of your professor clothes. Go out and look like a diplomat.\" So that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping. But still, there were all kinds of questions about \u2014 \"did you wear a hat?\" \"How short was your skirt?\" And one of the things \u2014 if you remember Condoleezza Rice was at some event and she wore boots, and she got criticized over that. And no guy ever gets criticized. But that's the least of it.PM: It is, for all of us, men and women, finding our ways of defining our roles, and doing them in ways that make a difference in the world and shape the future. How did you handle that balance between being the tough diplomatic and strong voice of this country to the rest of the world and also how you felt about yourself as a mother, a grandmother, nurturing ... and so how did you handle that?MA: Well the interesting part was I was asked what it was like to be the first woman Secretary of State a few minutes after I'd been named. And I said, \"Well I've been a woman for 60 years, but I've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes.\" So it evolved. (Laughter) But basically I love being a woman. And so what happened \u2014 and I think there will probably be some people in the audience that will identify with this \u2014 I went to my first meeting, first at the U.N., and that's when this all started, because that is a very male organization. And I'm sitting there \u2014 there are 15 members of the Security Council \u2014 so 14 men sat there staring at me, and I thought \u2014 well you know how we all are. You want to get the feeling of the room, and \"do people like me?\" and \"will I really say something intelligent?\" And all of a sudden I thought, \"Well, wait a minute. I am sitting behind a sign that says 'The United States,' and if I don't speak today then the voice of the United States will not be heard,\" and it was the first time that I had that feeling that I had to step out of myself in my normal, reluctant female mode and decide that I had to speak on behalf of our country. And so that happened more at various times, but I really think that there was a great advantage in many ways to being a woman. I think we are a lot better at personal relationships, and then have the capability obviously of telling it like it is when it's necessary. But I have to tell you, I have my youngest granddaughter, when she turned seven last year, said to her mother, my daughter, \"So what's the big deal about Grandma Maddie being Secretary of State? Only girls are Secretary of State.\"(Laughter)(Applause)PM: Because in her lifetime \u2014 MA: That would be so.PM: What a change that is. As you travel now all over the world, which you do frequently, how do you assess this global narrative around the story of women and girls? Where are we?MA: I think we're slowly changing, but obviously there are whole pockets in countries where nothing is different. And therefore it means that we have to remember that, while many of us have had huge opportunities \u2014 and Pat, you have been a real leader in your field \u2014 is that there are a lot of women that are not capable of worrying and taking care of themselves and understanding that women have to help other women. And so what I have felt \u2014 and I have looked at this from a national security issue \u2014 when I was Secretary of State, I decided that women's issues had to be central to American foreign policy, not just because I'm a feminist, but because I believe that societies are better off when women are politically and economically empowered, that values are passed down, the health situation is better, education is better, there is greater economic prosperity. So I think that it behooves us \u2014 those of us that live in various countries where we do have economic and political voice \u2014 that we need to help other women. And I really dedicated myself to that, both at the U.N. and then as Secretary of State.PM: And did you get pushback from making that a central tenant of foreign policy?MA: From some people. I think that they thought that it was a soft issue. The bottom line that I decided was actually women's issues are the hardest issues, because they are the ones that have to do with life and death in so many aspects, and because, as I said, it is really central to the way that we think about things. Now for instance, some of the wars that took place when I was in office, a lot of them, the women were the main victims of it. For instance, when I started, there were wars in the Balkans. The women in Bosnia were being raped. We then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal to deal specifically with those kinds of issues. And by the way, one of the things that I did at that stage was, I had just arrived at the U.N., and when I was there, there were 183 countries in the U.N. Now there are 192. But it was one of the first times that I didn't have to cook lunch myself. So I said to my assistant, \"Invite the other women permanent representatives.\" And I thought when I'd get to my apartment that there'd be a lot of women there. I get there, and there are six other women, out of 183. So the countries that had women representatives were Canada, Kazakhstan, Philippines, Trinidad Tobago, Jamaica, Lichtenstein and me. So being an American, I decided to set up a caucus. (Laughter) And so we set it up, and we called ourselves the G7.(Laughter)PM: Is that \"Girl 7?\" MA: Girl 7.And we lobbied on behalf of women's issues. So we managed to get two women judges on this war crimes tribunal. And then what happened was that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war, that it was against humanity.(Applause)PM: So when you look around the world and you see that, in many cases \u2014 certainly in the Western world \u2014 women are evolving into more leadership positions, and even other places some barriers are being brought down, but there's still so much violence, still so many problems, and yet we hear there are more women at the negotiating tables. Now you were at those negotiating tables when they weren't, when there was maybe you \u2014 one voice, maybe one or two others. Do you believe, and can you tell us why, there is going to be a significant shift in things like violence and peace and conflict and resolution on a sustainable basis?MA: Well I do think, when there are more women, that the tone of the conversation changes, and also the goals of the conversation change. But it doesn't mean that the whole world would be a lot better if it were totally run by women. If you think that, you've forgotten high school. (Laughter) But the bottom line is that there is a way, when there are more women at the table, that there's an attempt to develop some understanding. So for instance, what I did when I went to Burundi, we'd got Tutsi and Hutu women together to talk about some of the problems that had taken place in Rwanda. And so I think the capability of women to put themselves \u2014 I think we're better about putting ourselves into the other guy's shoes and having more empathy. I think it helps in terms of the support if there are other women in the room.When I was Secretary of State, there were only 13 other women foreign ministers. And so it was nice when one of them would show up. For instance, she is now the president of Finland, but Tarja Halonen was the foreign minister of Finland and, at a certain stage, head of the European Union. And it was really terrific. Because one of the things I think you'll understand. We went to a meeting, and the men in my delegation, when I would say, \"Well I feel we should do something about this,\" and they'd say, \"What do you mean, you feel?\" And so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me. And all of a sudden we were talking about arms control, and she said, \"Well I feel we should do this.\" And my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden. But I think it really does help to have a critical mass of women in a series of foreign policy positions. The other thing that I think is really important: A lot of national security policy isn't just about foreign policy, but it's about budgets, military budgets, and how the debts of countries work out. So if you have women in a variety of foreign policy posts, they can support each other when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries.PM: So how do we get this balance we're looking for, then, in the world? More women's voices at the table? More men who believe that the balance is best?MA: Well I think one of the things \u2014 I'm chairman of the board of an organization called the National Democratic Institute that works to support women candidates. I think that we need to help in other countries to train women to be in political office, to figure out how they can in fact develop political voices. I think we also need to be supportive when businesses are being created and just make sure that women help each other. Now I have a saying that I feel very strongly about, because I am of a certain age where, when I started in my career, believe it or not, there were other women who criticized me: \"Why aren't you in the carpool line?\" or \"Aren't your children suffering because you're not there all the time?\" And I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty. In fact, I think \"guilt\" is every woman's middle name. And so I think what needs to happen is we need to help each other. And my motto is that there's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other.(Applause)PM: Well Secretary Albright, I guess you'll be going to heaven.

But that's the least of it.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nPM: It is, for all of us, men and women,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nfinding our ways of defining our roles,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nand doing them in ways that make a difference in the world\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nand shape the future.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nHow did you handle that balance\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nbetween being the tough diplomatic\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nand strong voice of this country\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nto the rest of the world\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nand also how you felt about yourself\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nas a mother, a grandmother, nurturing ...\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nand so how did you handle that?\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nMA: Well the interesting part was I was asked\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nwhat it was like to be the first woman Secretary of State\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\na few minutes after I'd been named.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nAnd I said, \"Well I've been a woman for 60 years,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nbut I've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes.\"\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nSo it evolved.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nBut basically I love being a woman.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nAnd so what happened --\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nand I think there will probably be some people in the audience\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nthat will identify with this --\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nI went to my first meeting, first at the U.N.,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nand that's when this all started,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nbecause that is a very male organization.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nAnd I'm sitting there -- there are 15 members of the Security Council --\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nso 14 men sat there staring at me,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nand I thought -- well you know how we all are.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nYou want to get the feeling of the room,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nand \"do people like me?\"\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nand \"will I really say something intelligent?\"\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nAnd all of a sudden I thought, \"Well, wait a minute.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nI am sitting behind a sign that says 'The United States,'\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nand if I don't speak today\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nthen the voice of the United States will not be heard,\"\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nand it was the first time that I had that feeling\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nthat I had to step out of myself\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nin my normal, reluctant female mode\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nand decide that I had to speak on behalf of our country.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nAnd so that happened more at various times,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nbut I really think that there was a great advantage in many ways\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nto being a woman.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nI think we are a lot better\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nat personal relationships,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nand then have the capability obviously\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nof telling it like it is when it's necessary.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nBut I have to tell you, I have my youngest granddaughter,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nwhen she turned seven last year,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nsaid to her mother, my daughter,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\n\"So what's the big deal about Grandma Maddie being Secretary of State?\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nOnly girls are Secretary of State.\"\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:55.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nPM: Because in her lifetime -- MA: That would be so.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nPM: What a change that is.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nAs you travel now all over the world,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nwhich you do frequently,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nhow do you assess\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nthis global narrative around the story of women and girls?\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nWhere are we?\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nMA: I think we're slowly changing,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nbut obviously there are whole pockets\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nin countries where nothing is different.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nAnd therefore it means that we have to remember\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nthat, while many of us have had huge opportunities --\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nand Pat, you have been a real leader in your field --\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nis that there are a lot of women\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nthat are not capable\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nof worrying and taking care of themselves\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nand understanding that women have to help other women.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nAnd so what I have felt --\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nand I have looked at this\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nfrom a national security issue --\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nwhen I was Secretary of State, I decided\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nthat women's issues had to be central to American foreign policy,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nnot just because I'm a feminist,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nbut because I believe that societies are better off\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nwhen women are politically and economically empowered,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nthat values are passed down,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nthe health situation is better,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\neducation is better,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nthere is greater economic prosperity.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nSo I think that it behooves us --\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nthose of us that live in various countries\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nwhere we do have economic and political voice --\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nthat we need to help other women.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nAnd I really dedicated myself to that,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nboth at the U.N. and then as Secretary of State.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nPM: And did you get pushback\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nfrom making that a central tenant of foreign policy?\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nMA: From some people.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nI think that they thought that it was a soft issue.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nThe bottom line that I decided\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nwas actually women's issues are the hardest issues,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nbecause they are the ones that have to do with life and death\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nin so many aspects,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand because, as I said,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nit is really central to the way that we think about things.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nNow for instance,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nsome of the wars that took place\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nwhen I was in office,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\na lot of them, the women were the main victims of it.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nFor instance, when I started,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nthere were wars in the Balkans.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nThe women in Bosnia were being raped.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nWe then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nto deal specifically with those kinds of issues.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nAnd by the way, one of the things that I did at that stage\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nwas, I had just arrived at the U.N.,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nand when I was there, there were 183 countries in the U.N.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nNow there are 192.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nBut it was one of the first times that I didn't have to cook lunch myself.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nSo I said to my assistant,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\n\"Invite the other women permanent representatives.\"\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nAnd I thought when I'd get to my apartment\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nthat there'd be a lot of women there.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nI get there, and there are six other women, out of 183.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nSo the countries that had women representatives\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nwere Canada, Kazakhstan, Philippines,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nTrinidad Tobago, Jamaica,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nLichtenstein and me.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nSo being an American, I decided to set up a caucus.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nAnd so we set it up,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nand we called ourselves the G7.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nPM: Is that \"Girl 7?\" MA: Girl 7.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nAnd we lobbied\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\non behalf of women's issues.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nSo we managed to get two women judges\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\non this war crimes tribunal.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nAnd then what happened\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nwas that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nthat it was against humanity.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:21.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nPM: So when you look around the world\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nand you see that, in many cases --\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\ncertainly in the Western world --\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nwomen are evolving into more leadership positions,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nand even other places\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nsome barriers are being brought down,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nbut there's still so much violence,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nstill so many problems,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nand yet we hear there are more women\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nat the negotiating tables.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nNow you were at those negotiating tables\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nwhen they weren't, when there was maybe you --\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\none voice, maybe one or two others.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nDo you believe, and can you tell us why,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nthere is going to be a significant shift\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nin things like violence\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nand peace and conflict and resolution\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\non a sustainable basis?\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nMA: Well I do think, when there are more women,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nthat the tone of the conversation changes,\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nand also the goals of the conversation change.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nBut it doesn't mean that the whole world\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nwould be a lot better\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nif it were totally run by women.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nIf you think that, you've forgotten high school.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nBut the bottom line\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nis that there is a way,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nwhen there are more women at the table,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nthat there's an attempt\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nto develop some understanding.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nSo for instance, what I did when I went to Burundi,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nwe'd got Tutsi and Hutu women together\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nto talk about some of the problems\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nthat had taken place in Rwanda.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nAnd so I think the capability of women\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nto put themselves --\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nI think we're better about putting ourselves into the other guy's shoes\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nand having more empathy.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nI think it helps in terms of the support\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nif there are other women in the room.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nWhen I was Secretary of State,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nthere were only 13 other women foreign ministers.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nAnd so it was nice when one of them would show up.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nFor instance, she is now the president of Finland,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nbut Tarja Halonen was the foreign minister of Finland\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nand, at a certain stage, head of the European Union.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nAnd it was really terrific.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nBecause one of the things I think you'll understand.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nWe went to a meeting,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nand the men in my delegation,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nwhen I would say, \"Well I feel we should do something about this,\"\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nand they'd say, \"What do you mean, you feel?\"\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nAnd so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nAnd all of a sudden we were talking about arms control,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nand she said, \"Well I feel we should do this.\"\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAnd my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nBut I think it really does help\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nto have a critical mass of women\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nin a series of foreign policy positions.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nThe other thing that I think is really important:\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nA lot of national security policy\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nisn't just about foreign policy,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nbut it's about budgets, military budgets,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nand how the debts of countries work out.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nSo if you have women\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nin a variety of foreign policy posts,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nthey can support each other\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nwhen there are budget decisions being made in their own countries.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nPM: So how do we get\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nthis balance we're looking for, then, in the world?\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nMore women's voices at the table?\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nMore men who believe\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nthat the balance is best?\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nMA: Well I think one of the things --\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nI'm chairman of the board of an organization\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\ncalled the National Democratic Institute\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nthat works to support women candidates.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nI think that we need\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nto help in other countries\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nto train women\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nto be in political office,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nto figure out how they can in fact\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\ndevelop political voices.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nI think we also need to be supportive\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nwhen businesses are being created\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nand just make sure that women help each other.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nNow I have a saying\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nthat I feel very strongly about,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nbecause I am of a certain age\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nwhere, when I started in my career,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nbelieve it or not, there were other women who criticized me:\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\n\"Why aren't you in the carpool line?\"\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nor \"Aren't your children suffering\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nbecause you're not there all the time?\"\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nAnd I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nIn fact, I think \"guilt\" is every woman's middle name.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAnd so I think what needs to happen\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nis we need to help each other.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nAnd my motto is that there's a special place in hell\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nfor women who don't help each other.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:38.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nPM: Well Secretary Albright, I guess you'll be going to heaven.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nThank you for joining us today.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nMA: Thank you all. Thanks Pat.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How to use experts -- and when not to", "duration": "1098", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/noreena_hertz_how_to_use_experts_and_when_not_to", "transcript": "It's Monday morning. In Washington, the president of the United States is sitting in the Oval Office, assessing whether or not to strike Al Qaeda in Yemen. At Number 10 Downing Street, David Cameron is trying to work out whether to cut more public sector jobs in order to stave off a double-dip recession. In Madrid, Maria Gonzalez is standing at the door, listening to her baby crying and crying, trying to work out whether she should let it cry until it falls asleep or pick it up and hold it. And I am sitting by my father's bedside in hospital, trying to work out whether I should let him drink the one-and-a-half-liter bottle of water that his doctors just came in and said, \"You must make him drink today,\" \u2014 my father's been nil by mouth for a week \u2014 or whether, by giving him this bottle, I might actually kill him.We face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives, and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions. We talk things over with our friends, we scour the Internet, we search through books. But still, even in this age of Google and TripAdvisor and Amazon Recommends, it's still experts that we rely upon most \u2014 especially when the stakes are high and the decision really matters. Because in a world of data deluge and extreme complexity, we believe that experts are more able to process information than we can \u2014 that they are able to come to better conclusions than we could come to on our own. And in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening or confusing, we feel reassured by the almost parental-like authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do.But I believe that this is a big problem, a problem with potentially dangerous consequences for us as a society, as a culture and as individuals. It's not that experts have not massively contributed to the world \u2014 of course they have. The problem lies with us: we've become addicted to experts. We've become addicted to their certainty, their assuredness, their definitiveness, and in the process, we have ceded our responsibility, substituting our intellect and our intelligence for their supposed words of wisdom. We've surrendered our power, trading off our discomfort with uncertainty for the illusion of certainty that they provide. This is no exaggeration. In a recent experiment, a group of adults had their brains scanned in an MRI machine as they were listening to experts speak. The results were quite extraordinary. As they listened to the experts' voices, the independent decision-making parts of their brains switched off. It literally flat-lined. And they listened to whatever the experts said and took their advice, however right or wrong.But experts do get things wrong. Did you know that studies show that doctors misdiagnose four times out of 10? Did you know that if you file your tax returns yourself, you're statistically more likely to be filing them correctly than if you get a tax adviser to do it for you? And then there's, of course, the example that we're all too aware of: financial experts getting it so wrong that we're living through the worst recession since the 1930s. For the sake of our health, our wealth and our collective security, it's imperative that we keep the independent decision-making parts of our brains switched on. And I'm saying this as an economist who, over the past few years, has focused my research on what it is we think and who it is we trust and why, but also \u2014 and I'm aware of the irony here \u2014 as an expert myself, as a professor, as somebody who advises prime ministers, heads of big companies, international organizations, but an expert who believes that the role of experts needs to change, that we need to become more open-minded, more democratic and be more open to people rebelling against our points of view. So in order to help you understand where I'm coming from, let me bring you into my world, the world of experts.Now there are, of course, exceptions, wonderful, civilization-enhancing exceptions. But what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps, that within these camps, a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition, that experts move with the prevailing winds, often hero-worshipping their own gurus. Alan Greenspan's proclamations that the years of economic growth would go on and on, not challenged by his peers, until after the crisis, of course. You see, we also learn that experts are located, are governed, by the social and cultural norms of their times \u2014 whether it be the doctors in Victorian England, say, who sent women to asylums for expressing sexual desire, or the psychiatrists in the United States who, up until 1973, were still categorizing homosexuality as a mental illness.And what all this means is that paradigms take far too long to shift, that complexity and nuance are ignored and also that money talks \u2014 because we've all seen the evidence of pharmaceutical companies funding studies of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects, or studies funded by food companies of their new products, massively exaggerating the health benefits of the products they're about to bring by market. The study showed that food companies exaggerated typically seven times more than an independent study.And we've also got to be aware that experts, of course, also make mistakes. They make mistakes every single day \u2014 mistakes born out of carelessness. A recent study in the Archives of Surgery reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries, operating on the wrong side of the brain, carrying out procedures on the wrong hand, elbow, eye, foot, and also mistakes born out of thinking errors. A common thinking error of radiologists, for example \u2014 when they look at CT scans \u2014 is that they're overly influenced by whatever it is that the referring physician has said that he suspects the patient's problem to be. So if a radiologist is looking at the scan of a patient with suspected pneumonia, say, what happens is that, if they see evidence of pneumonia on the scan, they literally stop looking at it \u2014 thereby missing the tumor sitting three inches below on the patient's lungs.I've shared with you so far some insights into the world of experts. These are, of course, not the only insights I could share, but I hope they give you a clear sense at least of why we need to stop kowtowing to them, why we need to rebel and why we need to switch our independent decision-making capabilities on. But how can we do this? Well for the sake of time, I want to focus on just three strategies. First, we've got to be ready and willing to take experts on and dispense with this notion of them as modern-day apostles. This doesn't mean having to get a Ph.D. in every single subject, you'll be relieved to hear. But it does mean persisting in the face of their inevitable annoyance when, for example, we want them to explain things to us in language that we can actually understand. Why was it that, when I had an operation, my doctor said to me, \"Beware, Ms. Hertz, of hyperpyrexia,\" when he could have just as easily said, \"Watch out for a high fever.\" You see, being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs, their equations, their forecasts, their prophecies, and being armed with the questions to do that \u2014 questions like: What are the assumptions that underpin this? What is the evidence upon which this is based? What has your investigation focused on? And what has it ignored?It recently came out that experts trialing drugs before they come to market typically trial drugs first, primarily on male animals and then, primarily on men. It seems that they've somehow overlooked the fact that over half the world's population are women. And women have drawn the short medical straw because it now turns out that many of these drugs don't work nearly as well on women as they do on men \u2014 and the drugs that do work well work so well that they're actively harmful for women to take. Being a rebel is about recognizing that experts' assumptions and their methodologies can easily be flawed.Second, we need to create the space for what I call \"managed dissent.\" If we are to shift paradigms, if we are to make breakthroughs, if we are to destroy myths, we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out, in which we're bringing in new, diverse, discordant, heretical views into the discussion, fearlessly, in the knowledge that progress comes about, not only from the creation of ideas, but also from their destruction \u2014 and also from the knowledge that, by surrounding ourselves by divergent, discordant, heretical views. All the research now shows us that this actually makes us smarter. Encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion because it goes against our very instincts, which are to surround ourselves with opinions and advice that we already believe or want to be true. And that's why I talk about the need to actively manage dissent.Google CEO Eric Schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy. In meetings, he looks out for the person in the room \u2014 arms crossed, looking a bit bemused \u2014 and draws them into the discussion, trying to see if they indeed are the person with a different opinion, so that they have dissent within the room. Managing dissent is about recognizing the value of disagreement, discord and difference. But we need to go even further. We need to fundamentally redefine who it is that experts are. The conventional notion is that experts are people with advanced degrees, fancy titles, diplomas, best-selling books \u2014 high-status individuals. But just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise as some sort of elite cadre and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise \u2014 whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and CEO's, but also shop-girls \u2014 yeah.Best Buy, the consumer electronics company, gets all its employees \u2014 the cleaners, the shop assistants, the people in the back office, not just its forecasting team \u2014 to place bets, yes bets, on things like whether or not a product is going to sell well before Christmas, on whether customers' new ideas are going to be or should be taken on by the company, on whether a project will come in on time. By leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company, Best Buy was able to discover, for example, that the store that it was going to open in China \u2014 its big, grand store \u2014 was not going to open on time. Because when it asked its staff, all its staff, to place their bets on whether they thought the store would open on time or not, a group from the finance department placed all their chips on that not happening. It turned out that they were aware, as no one else within the company was, of a technological blip that neither the forecasting experts, nor the experts on the ground in China, were even aware of.The strategies that I have discussed this evening \u2014 embracing dissent, taking experts on, democratizing expertise, rebellious strategies \u2014 are strategies that I think would serve us all well to embrace as we try to deal with the challenges of these very confusing, complex, difficult times. For if we keep our independent decision-making part of our brains switched on, if we challenge experts, if we're skeptical, if we devolve authority, if we are rebellious, but also if we become much more comfortable with nuance, uncertainty and doubt, and if we allow our experts to express themselves using those terms too, we will set ourselves up much better for the challenges of the 21st century. For now, more than ever, is not the time to be blindly following, blindly accepting, blindly trusting. Now is the time to face the world with eyes wide open \u2014 yes, using experts to help us figure things out, for sure \u2014 I don't want to completely do myself out of a job here \u2014 but being aware of their limitations and, of course, also our own.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1079, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nIt's

high\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nand the decision really matters.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nBecause in a world of data deluge\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nand extreme

00:02:36.958\nBut I believe\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nthat this is a big problem,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:42.958\na problem with potentially dangerous consequences\n\n00:02:42.958 -->

recent experiment,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\na group of adults\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nhad their brains scanned in an MRI machine\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nas they were listening to experts speak.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nThe results were quite extraordinary.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nAs they listened to the experts' voices,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthe independent decision-making parts of their brains\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nswitched off.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nIt literally flat-lined.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nAnd they listened to whatever the experts said\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nand took their advice, however right or wrong.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nBut experts do get things wrong.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nDid you know that studies show\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nthat doctors misdiagnose\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nfour times out of 10?\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nDid you know\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nthat if you file your tax returns yourself,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nyou're statistically more likely\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nto be filing them correctly\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nthan if you get a tax adviser\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nto do it for you?\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nAnd then there's, of course, the example\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nthat we're all too aware of:\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nfinancial experts\n\n00:04:40.958 -->

as an economist\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nwho, over the past few years,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nhas focused my research\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\non what it is we

00:05:35.958\nthat the role of experts needs to change,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nthat we need to become more open-minded,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nmore democratic\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nand be more open\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nto people rebelling against\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nour points of view.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nSo in order to help

what my research has shown me\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nis that experts tend on the whole\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nto form very rigid camps,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nthat within these camps,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\na dominant perspective emerges\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nthat often silences opposition,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nthat experts move with the prevailing winds,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\noften hero-worshipping\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\ntheir own gurus.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nAlan Greenspan's

1973,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nwere still categorizing homosexuality\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nas a mental illness.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nAnd what all this

willing\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nto take experts on\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nand dispense with this notion of them\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nas modern-day apostles.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nThis doesn't mean having to get a Ph.D.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nin every single subject,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nyou'll be relieved to hear.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nBut it does mean persisting\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nin the face of their inevitable annoyance\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nwhen, for example,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nwe want them to explain things to us\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nin language that we can actually understand.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nWhy was it that, when I had an operation,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nmy doctor said to me,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\n\"Beware, Ms. Hertz,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nof hyperpyrexia,\"\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nwhen he could have just as easily said,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\n\"Watch out for a high fever.\"\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nYou see, being ready to take experts on\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nis about also being willing\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nto dig behind their graphs,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\ntheir equations, their forecasts,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\ntheir prophecies,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nand being armed with the questions to do that --\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nquestions like:\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nWhat are the assumptions that underpin this?\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nWhat is the evidence upon which this is based?\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nWhat has your investigation focused on?\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nAnd what has it ignored?\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nIt recently came out\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nthat experts trialing drugs\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nbefore they come to market\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\ntypically trial drugs\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nfirst, primarily on male animals\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand then, primarily on men.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nIt seems that they've somehow overlooked the fact\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nthat over half the world's population are women.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nAnd women have drawn the short medical straw\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nbecause it now turns out that many of these drugs\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\ndon't work nearly as well on women\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nas they do on men --\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nand the drugs that do work well work so well\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nthat they're actively harmful for women to take.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nBeing a rebel is about recognizing\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nthat experts' assumptions\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nand their methodologies\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\ncan easily be flawed.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nSecond,\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nwe need to create the space\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nfor what I call \"managed dissent.\"\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nIf we are to shift paradigms,\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nif we are to make breakthroughs,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nif we are to destroy myths,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nwe need to create an environment\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nin which expert ideas are battling it out,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nin which we're bringing in\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nnew, diverse, discordant, heretical views\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\ninto the discussion,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nfearlessly,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nin the knowledge that progress comes about,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nnot only from the creation of ideas,\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nbut also from their destruction --\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nand also from the knowledge\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nthat, by surrounding ourselves\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nby divergent, discordant,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nheretical views.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nAll the research now shows us\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nthat this actually makes us smarter.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nEncouraging dissent is a rebellious notion\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nbecause it goes against our very instincts,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nwhich are to surround ourselves\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nwith opinions and advice\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nthat we already believe\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nor want to be true.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nAnd that's why I talk about the need\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nto actively manage dissent.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nGoogle CEO Eric Schmidt\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nis a practical practitioner\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nof this philosophy.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nIn meetings,

discussion,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\ntrying to see if they indeed are\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nthe person with a different opinion,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nso that they have dissent within the room.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nManaging dissent\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nis about recognizing the value\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nof disagreement,

redefine\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nwho it is that experts are.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nThe conventional notion\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nis that experts are people\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nwith advanced degrees,\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nfancy titles, diplomas,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nbest-selling books --\n\n00:14:28.958 -->

{"title": "Saving faces: A facial surgeon's craft", "duration": "954", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/iain_hutchison_saving_faces", "transcript": "Our face is hugely important because it's the external, visual part that everybody else sees. Let's not forget it's a functional entity. We have strong skull bones that protect the most important organ in our body: the brain. It's where our senses are located, our special senses \u2014 our vision, our speech, our hearing, our smell, our taste. And this bone is peppered, as you can see, with the light shining through the skull with cavities, the sinuses, which warm and moisten the air we breathe. But also imagine if they were filled with solid bone \u2014 our head would be dead weight, we wouldn't be able to hold it erect, we wouldn't be able to look at the world around us. This woman is slowly dying because the benign tumors in her facial bones have completely obliterated her mouth and her nose so she can't breathe and eat.Attached to the facial bones that define our face's structure are the muscles that deliver our facial expression, our universal language of expression, our social-signaling system. And overlying this is the skin drape, which is a hugely complex three-dimensional structure \u2014 taking right-angled bends here and there, having thin areas like the eyelids, thick areas like the cheek, different colors. And then we have the sensual factor of the face. Where do we like to kiss people? On the lips. Nibble the ears maybe. It's the face where we're attracted to with that.But let's not forget the hair. You're looking at the image on your left-hand side \u2014 that's my son with his eyebrows present. Look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing. There's a definite difference. And imagine if he had hair sprouting from the middle of his nose, he'd look even odder still.Dysmorphophobia is an extreme version of the fact that we don't see ourselves as others see us. It's a shocking truth that we only see mirror images of ourselves, and we only see ourselves in freeze-frame photographic images that capture a mere fraction of the time that we live. Dysmorphophobia is a perversion of this where people who may be very good looking regard themselves as hideously ugly and are constantly seeking surgery to correct their facial appearance. They don't need this. They need psychiatric help. Max has kindly donated his photograph to me. He doesn't have dysmorphophobia, but I'm using his photograph to illustrate the fact that he looks exactly like a dysmorphophobic. In other words, he looks entirely normal.Age is another thing when our attitude toward our appearance changes. So children judge themselves, learn to judge themselves, by the behavior of adults around them. Here's a classic example: Rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor that's growing out through her skull, has obliterated her nose, and she's having difficulty seeing. As you can see, it's blocking her vision. She's also in danger, when she damages this, of bleeding profusely. Our research has shown that the parents and close loved ones of these children adore them. They've grown used to their face; they think they're special. Actually, sometimes the parents argue about whether these children should have the lesion removed. And occasionally they suffer intense grief reactions because the child they've grown to love has changed so dramatically and they don't recognize them. But other adults say incredibly painful things. They say, \"How dare you take this child out of the house and terrify other people. Shouldn't you be doing something about this? Why haven't you had it removed?\" And other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion, because \u2014 a natural curiosity. And that obviously alerts the child to their unusual nature. After surgery, everything normalizes. The adults behave more naturally, and the children play more readily with other children.As teenagers \u2014 just think back to your teenage years \u2014 we're going through a dramatic and often disproportionate change in our facial appearance. We're trying to struggle to find our identity. We crave the approval of our peers. So our facial appearance is vital to us as we're trying to project ourselves to the world. Just remember that single acne spot that crippled you for several days. How long did you spend looking in the mirror every day, practicing your sardonic look, practicing your serious look, trying to look like Sean Connery, as I did, trying to raise one eyebrow? It's a crippling time.I've chosen to show this profile view of Sue because what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward and her lower lip jutting forward. I'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward. Turn to the person next to you, push your lower jaws forward. Turn to the person next to you and look at them \u2014 they look miserable. That's exactly what people used to say to Sue. She wasn't miserable at all. But people used to say to her, \"Why are you so miserable?\" People were making misjudgments all the time on her mood. Teachers and peers were underestimating her; she was teased at school. So she chose to have facial surgery. After the facial surgery, she said, \"My face now reflects my personality. People know now that I'm enthusiastic, that I'm a happy person.\" And that's the change that can be achieved for teenagers.Is this change, though, a real change, or is it a figment of the imagination of the patient themselves? Well we studied teenagers' attitudes to photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery. And what we found was \u2014 we jumbled up the photographs so they couldn't recognize the before and after \u2014 what we found was that the patients were regarded as being more attractive after the surgery. Well that's not surprising, but we also asked them to judge them on honesty, intelligence, friendliness, violence. They were all perceived as being less than normal in all those characteristics \u2014 more violent, etc. \u2014 before the surgery. After the surgery, they were perceived as being more intelligent, more friendly, more honest, less violent \u2014 and yet we hadn't operated on their intellect or their character.When people get older, they don't necessarily choose to follow this kind of surgery. Their presence in the consultation suite is a result of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. What happens to them is that they may have suffered cancer or trauma. So this is a photograph of Henry, two weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed from the left side of his face \u2014 his cheekbone, his upper jaw, his eye-socket. He looks pretty good at this stage. But over the course of the next 15 years he had 14 more operations, as the disease ravaged his face and destroyed my reconstruction regularly. I learned a huge amount from Henry. Henry taught me that you can carry on working. He worked as an advocate. He continued to play cricket. He enjoyed life to the full, and this was probably because he had a successful, fulfilling job and a caring family and was able to participate socially. He maintained a calm insouciance. I don't say he overcame this; he didn't overcome it. This was something more than that. He ignored it. He ignored the disfigurement that was happening in his life and carried on oblivious to it. And that's what these people can do.Henriapi illustrates this phenomenon as well. This is a man in his 20s whose first visit out of Nigeria was with this malignant cancer that he came to the United Kingdom to have operated on. It was my longest operation. It took 23 hours. I did it with my neurosurgeon. We removed all the bones at the right side of his face \u2014 his eye, his nose, the skull bones, the facial skin \u2014 and reconstructed him with tissue from the back. He continued to work as a psychiatric nurse. He got married. He had a son called Jeremiah. And again, he said, \"This painting of me with my son Jeremiah shows me as the successful man that I feel that I am.\" His facial disfigurement did not affect him because he had the support of a family; he had a successful, fulfilling job.So we've seen that we can change people's faces. But when we change people's faces, are we changing their identity \u2014 for better or for worse? For instance, there are two different types of facial surgery. We can categorize it like that. We can say there are patients who choose to have facial surgery \u2014 like Sue. When they have facial surgery, they feel their lives have changed because other people perceive them as better people. They don't feel different. They feel that they've actually gained what they never had, that their face now reflects their personality. And actually that's probably the difference between cosmetic surgery and this kind of surgery. Because you might say, \"Well, this type of surgery might be regarded as cosmetic.\" If you do cosmetic surgery, patients are often less happy. They're trying to achieve difference in their lives. Sue wasn't trying to achieve difference in her life. She was just trying to achieve the face that matched her personality.But then we have other people who don't choose to have facial surgery. They're people who have their face shot off. I'll move it off, and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you. They have it forced upon them. And again, as I told you, if they have a caring family and good work life, then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives. Their identity doesn't change.Is this business about appearance and preoccupation with it a Western phenomenon? Muzetta's family give the lie to this. This is a little Bangladeshi girl from the east end of London who's got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face, which has already made her blind and which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly. After she had surgery to remove the tumor, her parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress, a pink ribbon in her hair, and they wanted the painting to be shown around the world, despite the fact that they were orthodox Muslims and the mother wore a full burqa. So it's not simply a Western phenomenon.We make judgments on people's faces all the time. It's been going on since we can think of Lombroso and the way he would define criminal faces. He said you could see criminal faces, judging them just on the photographs that were showed. Good-looking people are always judged as being more friendly. We look at O.J. \u2014 he's a good-looking guy. We'd like to spend time with him. He looks friendly. Now we know that he's a convicted wife-batterer, and actually he's not the good guy. And beauty doesn't equate to goodness, and certainly doesn't equate to contentment.So we've talked about the static face and judging the static face, but actually, we're more comfortable with judging the moving face. We think we can judge people on their expressions. U.K. jurors in the U.K. justice system like to see a live witness to see whether they can pick up the telltale signs of mendacity \u2014 the blink, the hesitation. And so they want to see live witnesses. Todorov tells us that, in a tenth of a second, we can make a judgment on somebody's face. Are we uncomfortable with this image? Yes, we are. Would we be happy if our doctor's face, our lawyer's face, our financial adviser's face was covered? We'd be pretty uncomfortable. But are we good at making the judgments on facial appearance and movement? The truth is that there's a five-minute rule, not the tenth-of-a-second rule like Todorov, but a five-minute rule. If you spend five minutes with somebody, you start looking beyond their facial appearance, and the people who you're initially attracted to may seem boring and you lose interest in them, and the people who you didn't immediately seek out, because you didn't find them particularly attractive, become attractive people because of their personality.So we've talked a lot about facial appearance. I now want to share a little bit of the surgery that we do \u2014 where we're at and where we're going. This is an image of Ann who's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed. And you can see in the images afterward, we've managed to reconstruct her successfully. But that's not good enough. This is what Ann wants. She wants to be out kayaking, she wants to be out climbing mountains. And that's what she achieved, and that's what we have to get to.This is a horrific image, so I'm putting my hand up now. This is a photograph of Adi, a Nigerian bank manager who had his face shot off in an armed robbery. And he lost his lower jaw, his lip, his chin and his upper jaw and teeth. This is the bar that he set for us. \"I want to look like this. This is how I looked before.\" So with modern technology, we used computers to make models. We made a model of the jaw without bone in it. We then bent a plate up to it. We put it in place so we knew it was an accurate position. We then put bone and tissue from the back. Here you can see the plate holding it, and you can see the implants being put in \u2014 so that in one operation we achieve this and this. So the patient's life is restored. That's the good news. However, his chin skin doesn't look the same as it did before. It's skin from his back. It's thicker, it's darker, it's coarser, it doesn't have the contours. And that's where we're failing, and that's where we need the face transplant.The face transplant has a role probably in burns patients to replace the skin. We can replace the underlying skeletal structure, but we're still not good at replacing the facial skin. So it's very valuable to have that tool in our armamentarium. But the patients are going to have to take drugs that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives. What does that mean? They have an increased risk of infection, an increased risk of malignancy. This is not a life-saving transplant \u2014 like a heart, or liver, or lung transplant \u2014 it is a quality-of-life transplant, and as a result, are the patients going to say, if they get a malignant cancer 10 or 15 years on, \"I wish I'd had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this because I'm now dying of a malignant cancer\"? We don't know yet. We also don't know what they feel about recognition and identity. Bernard Devauchelle and Sylvie Testelin, who did the first operation, are studying that. Donors are going to be short on the ground, because how many people want to have their loved one's face removed at the point of death? So there are going to be problems with face transplantation.So the better news is the future's almost here \u2014 and the future is tissue engineering. Just imagine, I can make a biologically-degradable template. I can put it in place where it's meant to be. I can sprinkle a few cells, stem cells from the patient's own hip, a little bit of genetically engineered protein, and lo and behold, leave it for four months and the face is grown. This is a bit like a Julia Child recipe.But we've still got problems. We've got mouth cancer to solve. We're still not curing enough patients \u2014 it's the most disfiguring cancer. We're still not reconstructing them well enough. In the U.K. we have an epidemic of facial injuries among young people. We still can't get rid of scars. We need to do research. And the best news of all is that surgeons know that we need to do research. And we've set up charities that will help us fund the clinical research to determine the best treatment practice now and better treatment into the future, so we don't just sit on our laurels and say, \"Okay, we're doing okay. Let's leave it as it is.\"Thank you very much indeed.(Applause)", "id": 1080, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nOur face is hugely important\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nbecause it's the external, visual part\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nthat everybody else sees.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nLet's not forget it's a functional entity.\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nWe have strong skull bones\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nthat protect the most important organ in our body: the brain.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nIt's where our senses are located, our special senses --\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nour vision, our speech,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nour hearing, our smell, our taste.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nAnd this bone\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nis peppered, as you can see, with the light shining through the skull\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nwith cavities, the sinuses,\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nwhich warm and moisten the air we breathe.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nBut also imagine if they were filled with solid bone --\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nour head would be dead weight,\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nwe wouldn't be able to hold it erect,\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nwe wouldn't be able to look at the world around us.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nThis woman is slowly dying\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nbecause the benign tumors in her facial bones\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nhave completely obliterated her mouth and her nose\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nso she can't breathe and eat.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nAttached to the facial bones\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nthat define our face's structure\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nare the muscles that deliver our facial expression,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nour universal language of expression,\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nour social-signaling system.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nAnd overlying this is the skin drape,\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nwhich is a hugely complex\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nthree-dimensional structure --\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\ntaking right-angled bends here and there,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nhaving thin areas like the eyelids,\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nthick areas like the cheek, different colors.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nAnd then we have the sensual factor of the face.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nWhere do we like to kiss people?\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nOn the lips.

Why haven't you had it removed?\"\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAnd other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nbecause -- a natural curiosity.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nAnd that obviously alerts the child\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nto their unusual nature.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nAfter surgery, everything normalizes.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nThe adults behave more naturally,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nand the children play more readily with other children.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nAs teenagers --\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\njust think back to your teenage years --\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nwe're going through a dramatic\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nand often disproportionate change\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nin our facial appearance.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nWe're trying to struggle to find our identity.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nWe crave the approval of our peers.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nSo our facial appearance is vital to us\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nas we're trying to project ourselves to the world.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nJust remember that single acne spot\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nthat crippled you for several days.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nHow long did you spend looking in the mirror every day,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\npracticing your sardonic look, practicing your serious look,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\ntrying to look like Sean Connery, as I did,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\ntrying to raise one eyebrow?\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nIt's a crippling time.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nI've chosen to show this profile view of Sue\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nbecause what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nand her lower lip jutting forward.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nI'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nTurn to the person next to you,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\npush your lower jaws forward. Turn to the person next to you\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nand look at them -- they look miserable.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nThat's exactly what people used to say to Sue.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nShe wasn't miserable at all.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nBut people used to say to her, \"Why are you so miserable?\"\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nPeople were making misjudgments all the time\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\non her mood.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nTeachers and peers were underestimating her; she was teased at school.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nSo she chose to have facial surgery.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nAfter the facial surgery,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nshe said, \"My face now reflects my personality.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nPeople know now that I'm enthusiastic,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nthat I'm a happy person.\"\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nAnd that's the change that can be achieved for teenagers.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nIs this change, though, a real change,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nor is it a figment of the imagination\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nof the patient themselves?\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nWell we studied teenagers' attitudes\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nto photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nAnd what we found was --\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nwe jumbled up the photographs\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nso they couldn't recognize the before and after --\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nwhat we found was that the patients were regarded\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nas being more attractive after the surgery.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nWell that's not surprising, but we also asked them to judge them\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\non honesty, intelligence,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nfriendliness, violence.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nThey were all perceived as being\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nless than normal in all those characteristics --\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nmore violent, etc. -- before the surgery.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nAfter the surgery,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nthey were perceived as being more intelligent,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nmore friendly, more honest, less violent --\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nand yet we hadn't operated on their intellect\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nor their character.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nWhen people get older,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nthey don't necessarily choose to follow this kind of surgery.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nTheir presence in the consultation suite\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nis a result of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nWhat happens to them\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nis that they may have suffered cancer or trauma.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nSo this is a photograph of Henry,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\ntwo weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nfrom the left side of his face -- his cheekbone,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nhis upper jaw, his eye-socket.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nHe looks pretty good at this stage.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nBut over the course of the next 15 years he had 14 more operations,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nas the disease ravaged his face\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nand destroyed my reconstruction regularly.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nI learned a huge amount from Henry.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nHenry taught me\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nthat you can carry on working.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nHe worked as an advocate. He continued to play cricket.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nHe enjoyed life to the full,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nand this was probably because he had a successful, fulfilling job\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nand a caring family\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nand was able to participate socially.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nHe maintained a calm insouciance.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nI don't say he overcame this; he didn't overcome it.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nThis was something more than that. He ignored it.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nHe ignored the disfigurement that was happening in his life\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nand carried on oblivious to it.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAnd that's what these people can do.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nHenriapi illustrates this phenomenon as well.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nThis is a man in his 20s\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nwhose first visit out of Nigeria was with this malignant cancer\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nthat he came to the United Kingdom to have operated on.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nIt was my longest operation.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nIt took 23 hours. I did it with my neurosurgeon.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nWe removed all the bones at the right side of his face --\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nhis eye, his nose,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nthe skull bones, the facial skin --\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nand reconstructed him with tissue from the back.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nHe continued to work as a psychiatric nurse.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nHe got married. He had a son called Jeremiah.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nAnd again, he said,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\n\"This painting of me with my son Jeremiah\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nshows me as the successful man that I feel that I am.\"\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nHis facial disfigurement\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\ndid not affect him\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nbecause he had the support of a family;\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nhe had a successful, fulfilling job.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nSo we've seen that we can change people's faces.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nBut when we change people's faces,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nare we changing their identity --\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nfor better or for worse?\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nFor instance,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nthere are two different types of facial surgery.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nWe can categorize it like that.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nWe can say there are patients who choose to have facial surgery --\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nlike Sue.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nWhen they have facial surgery,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nthey feel their lives have changed\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nbecause other people perceive them\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nas better people.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nThey don't feel different.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nThey feel that they've actually gained\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nwhat they never had,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nthat their face now reflects their personality.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nAnd actually that's probably the difference between cosmetic surgery\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nand this kind of surgery.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nBecause you might say, \"Well, this type of surgery\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nmight be regarded as cosmetic.\"\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nIf you do cosmetic surgery, patients are often less happy.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nThey're trying to achieve difference in their lives.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nSue wasn't trying to achieve difference in her life.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nShe was just trying to achieve the face\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nthat matched her personality.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nBut then we have other people\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nwho don't choose to have facial surgery.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nThey're people who have their face shot off.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nI'll move it off, and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nThey have it forced upon them.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nAnd again, as I told you,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nif they have a caring family\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nand good work life,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nthen they can lead normal and fulfilled lives.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nTheir identity doesn't change.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nIs this business\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nabout appearance and preoccupation with it\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\na Western phenomenon?\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nMuzetta's family give the lie to this.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nThis is a little Bangladeshi girl from the east end of London\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nwho's got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nwhich has already made her blind\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nand which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nAfter she had surgery to remove the tumor,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nher parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\na pink ribbon in her hair,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nand they wanted the painting to be shown around the world,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\ndespite the fact that they were orthodox Muslims\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nand the mother wore a full burqa.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nSo it's not simply a Western phenomenon.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nWe make judgments on people's faces\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nall the time.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nIt's been going on since we can think of Lombroso\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nand the way he would define criminal faces.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nHe said you could see criminal faces,\n\n00:10:27.958 -->

She wants to be out kayaking,\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nshe wants to be out climbing mountains.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nAnd that's what she achieved, and that's what we have to get to.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nThis is a horrific image,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nso I'm putting my hand up now.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nThis is a photograph of Adi,\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\na Nigerian bank manager who had his face shot off\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nin an armed robbery.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nAnd he lost his lower jaw, his lip, his chin\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nand his upper jaw and teeth.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nThis is the bar that he set for us.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\n\"I want to look like this. This is how I looked before.\"\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nSo with modern technology,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nwe used computers to make models.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nWe made a model of the jaw without bone in it.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nWe then bent a plate up to it.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nWe put it in place\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nso we knew it was an accurate position.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nWe then put bone and tissue from the back.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nHere you can see the plate holding it,\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nand you can see the implants being put in --\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nso that in one operation\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nwe achieve this\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nand this.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nSo the patient's life is restored.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nThat's the good news.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nHowever, his chin skin\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\ndoesn't look the same as it did before.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nIt's skin from his back.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nIt's thicker, it's darker, it's coarser, it doesn't have the contours.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd that's where we're failing,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nand that's where we need the face transplant.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nThe face transplant has a role\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nprobably in burns patients to replace the skin.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nWe can replace the underlying skeletal structure,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nbut we're still not good at replacing the facial skin.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nSo it's very valuable\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nto have that tool in our armamentarium.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nBut the patients are going to have to take drugs\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nthat suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nWhat does that mean?\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nThey have an increased risk of infection, an increased risk of malignancy.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nThis is not a life-saving transplant --\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nlike a heart, or liver, or lung transplant --\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nit is a quality-of-life transplant,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nand as a result,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nare the patients going to say, if they get a malignant cancer 10 or 15 years on,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\n\"I wish I'd had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nbecause I'm now dying of a malignant cancer\"?

The year is 1963. We're at the ocean. It's twilight. We're watching the rising of the stars and the shifting of the tides. It's a stretch of beach we know so well. The smooth stones on the sand are familiar to us. If you saw these women on the street in their faded clothes, you might dismiss them as poor and simple. That would be a mistake. These women are descendants of Polynesian navigators, trained in the old ways by their elders, and now they're passing it on to me. They teach me the names of the winds and the rains, of astronomy according to a genealogy of stars. There's a new moon on the horizon. Hawaiians say it's a good night for fishing. They begin to chant.[Hawaiian chant]When they finish, they sit in a circle and ask me to come to join them. They want to teach me about my destiny. I thought every seven-year-old went through this. (Laughter) \"Baby girl, someday the world will be in trouble. People will forget their wisdom. It will take elders' voices from the far corners of the world to call the world into balance. You will go far away. It will sometimes be a lonely road. We will not be there. But you will look into the eyes of seeming strangers, and you will recognize your ohana, your family. And it will take all of you. It will take all of you.\" These words, I hold onto all my life. Because the idea of doing it alone terrifies me.The year is 2007. I'm on a remote island in Micronesia. Satawal is one half-mile long by one mile wide. It's the home of my mentor. His name is Pius Mau Piailug. Mau is a palu, a navigator priest. He's also considered the greatest wave finder in the world. There are fewer than a handful of palu left on this island. Their tradition is so extraordinary that these mariners sailed three million square miles across the Pacific without the use of instruments. They could synthesize patterns in nature using the rising and setting of stars, the sequence and direction of waves, the flight patterns of certain birds. Even the slightest hint of color on the underbelly of a cloud would inform them and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy.When Western scientists would join Mau on the canoe and watch him go into the hull, it appeared that an old man was going to rest. In fact, the hull of the canoe is the womb of the vessel. It is the most accurate place to feel the rhythm and sequence and direction of waves. Mau was, in fact, gathering explicit data using his entire body. It's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old. Now science may dismiss this methodology, but Polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel.The palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance. Sometimes I'd be with Mau on a cloud-covered night and we'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island, and he would look out, and then he would say, \"Okay, we go.\" He saw that first glint of light \u2014 he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now.Their achievements, intellectually and scientifically, are extraordinary, and they are so relevant for these times that we are in when we are riding out storms. We are in such a critical moment of our collective history. They have been compared to astronauts \u2014 these elder navigators who sail vast open oceans in double-hulled canoes thousands of miles from a small island. Their canoes, our rockets; their sea, our space. The wisdom of these elders is not a mere collection of stories about old people in some remote spot. This is part of our collective narrative. It's humanity's DNA. We cannot afford to lose it.The year is 2010. Just as the women in Hawaii that raised me predicted, the world is in trouble. We live in a society bloated with data, yet starved for wisdom. We're connected 24/7, yet anxiety, fear, depression and loneliness is at an all-time high. We must course-correct. An African shaman said, \"Your society worships the jester while the king stands in plain clothes.\" The link between the past and the future is fragile. This I know intimately, because even as I travel throughout the world to listen to these stories and record them, I struggle. I am haunted by the fact that I no longer remember the names of the winds and the rains.Mau passed away five months ago, but his legacy and lessons live on. And I am reminded that throughout the world there are cultures with vast sums of knowledge in them, as potent as the Micronesian navigators, that are going dismissed, that this is a testament to brilliant, brilliant technology and science and wisdom that is vanishing rapidly. Because when an elder dies a library is burned, and throughout the world, libraries are ablaze.I am grateful for the fact that I had a mentor like Mau who taught me how to navigate. And I realize through a lesson that he shared that we continue to find our way. And this is what he said: \"The island is the canoe; the canoe, the island.\" And what he meant was, if you are voyaging and far from home, your very survival depends on everyone aboard. You cannot make the voyage alone, you were never meant to. This whole notion of every man for himself is completely unsustainable. It always was.So in closing I would offer you this: The planet is our canoe, and we are the voyagers. True navigation begins in the human heart. It's the most important map of all. Together, may we journey well.(Applause)", "id": 1081, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nAs a child,\n\n00:00:14.958 -->

through proteomics", "duration": "1195", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/danny_hillis_two_frontiers_of_cancer_treatment", "transcript": "I admit that I'm a little bit nervous here because I'm going to say some radical things, about how we should think about cancer differently, to an audience that contains a lot of people who know a lot more about cancer than I do. But I will also contest that I'm not as nervous as I should be because I'm pretty sure I'm right about this. (Laughter) And that this, in fact, will be the way that we treat cancer in the future. In order to talk about cancer, I'm going to actually have to \u2014 let me get the big slide here. First, I'm going to try to give you a different perspective of genomics. I want to put it in perspective of the bigger picture of all the other things that are going on \u2014 and then talk about something you haven't heard so much about, which is proteomics. Having explained those, that will set up for what I think will be a different idea about how to go about treating cancer.So let me start with genomics. It is the hot topic. It is the place where we're learning the most. This is the great frontier. But it has its limitations. And in particular, you've probably all heard the analogy that the genome is like the blueprint of your body, and if that were only true, it would be great, but it's not. It's like the parts list of your body. It doesn't say how things are connected, what causes what and so on. So if I can make an analogy, let's say that you were trying to tell the difference between a good restaurant, a healthy restaurant and a sick restaurant, and all you had was the list of ingredients that they had in their larder. So it might be that, if you went to a French restaurant and you looked through it and you found they only had margarine and they didn't have butter, you could say, \"Ah, I see what's wrong with them. I can make them healthy.\" And there probably are special cases of that. You could certainly tell the difference between a Chinese restaurant and a French restaurant by what they had in a larder. So the list of ingredients does tell you something, and sometimes it tells you something that's wrong. If they have tons of salt, you might guess they're using too much salt, or something like that. But it's limited, because really to know if it's a healthy restaurant, you need to taste the food, you need to know what goes on in the kitchen, you need the product of all of those ingredients.So if I look at a person and I look at a person's genome, it's the same thing. The part of the genome that we can read is the list of ingredients. And so indeed, there are times when we can find ingredients that [are] bad. Cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease where you just have a bad ingredient and you have a disease, and we can actually make a direct correspondence between the ingredient and the disease. But most things, you really have to know what's going on in the kitchen, because, mostly, sick people used to be healthy people \u2014 they have the same genome. So the genome really tells you much more about predisposition. So what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an Asian person and a European person by looking at their ingredients list. But you really for the most part can't tell the difference between a healthy person and a sick person \u2014 except in some of these special cases.So why all the big deal about genetics? Well first of all, it's because we can read it, which is fantastic. It is very useful in certain circumstances. It's also the great theoretical triumph of biology. It's the one theory that the biologists ever really got right. It's fundamental to Darwin and Mendel and so on. And so it's the one thing where they predicted a theoretical construct. So Mendel had this idea of a gene as an abstract thing, and Darwin built a whole theory that depended on them existing, and then Watson and Crick actually looked and found one. So this happens in physics all the time. You predict a black hole, and you look out the telescope and there it is, just like you said. But it rarely happens in biology. So this great triumph \u2014 it's so good, there's almost a religious experience in biology. And Darwinian evolution is really the core theory.So the other reason it's been very popular is because we can measure it, it's digital. And in fact, thanks to Kary Mullis, you can basically measure your genome in your kitchen with a few extra ingredients. So for instance, by measuring the genome, we've learned a lot about how we're related to other kinds of animals by the closeness of our genome, or how we're related to each other \u2014 the family tree, or the tree of life. There's a huge amount of information about the genetics just by comparing the genetic similarity. Now of course, in medical application, that is very useful because it's the same kind of information that the doctor gets from your family medical history \u2014 except probably, your genome knows much more about your medical history than you do. And so by reading the genome, we can find out much more about your family than you probably know. And so we can discover things that probably you could have found by looking at enough of your relatives, but they may be surprising. I did the 23andMe thing and was very surprised to discover that I am fat and bald. (Laughter) But sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that.But mostly what you need to know, to find out if you're sick, is not your predispositions, but it's actually what's going on in your body right now. So to do that, what you really need to do, you need to look at the things that the genes are producing and what's happening after the genetics, and that's what proteomics is about. Just like genome mixes the study of all the genes, proteomics is the study of all the proteins. And the proteins are all of the little things in your body that are signaling between the cells \u2014 actually, the machines that are operating \u2014 that's where the action is. Basically, a human body is a conversation going on, both within the cells and between the cells, and they're telling each other to grow and to die, and when you're sick, something's gone wrong with that conversation. And so the trick is \u2014 unfortunately, we don't have an easy way to measure these like we can measure the genome.So the problem is that measuring \u2014 if you try to measure all the proteins, it's a very elaborate process. It requires hundreds of steps, and it takes a long, long time. And it matters how much of the protein it is. It could be very significant that a protein changed by 10 percent, so it's not a nice digital thing like DNA. And basically our problem is somebody's in the middle of this very long stage, they pause for just a moment, and they leave something in an enzyme for a second, and all of a sudden all the measurements from then on don't work. And so then people get very inconsistent results when they do it this way. People have tried very hard to do this. I tried this a couple of times and looked at this problem and gave up on it.I kept getting this call from this oncologist named David Agus. And Applied Minds gets a lot of calls from people who want help with their problems, and I didn't think this was a very likely one to call back, so I kept on giving him to the delay list. And then one day, I get a call from John Doerr, Bill Berkman and Al Gore on the same day saying return David Agus's phone call. (Laughter) So I was like, \"Okay. This guy's at least resourceful.\" (Laughter) So we started talking, and he said, \"I really need a better way to measure proteins.\" I'm like, \"Looked at that. Been there. Not going to be easy.\" He's like, \"No, no. I really need it. I mean, I see patients dying every day because we don't know what's going on inside of them. We have to have a window into this.\" And he took me through specific examples of when he really needed it. And I realized, wow, this would really make a big difference, if we could do it, and so I said, \"Well, let's look at it.\"Applied Minds has enough play money that we can go and just work on something without getting anybody's funding or permission or anything. So we started playing around with this. And as we did it, we realized this was the basic problem \u2014 that taking the sip of coffee \u2014 that there were humans doing this complicated process and that what really needed to be done was to automate this process like an assembly line and build robots that would measure proteomics. And so we did that, and working with David, we made a little company called Applied Proteomics eventually, which makes this robotic assembly line, which, in a very consistent way, measures the protein. And I'll show you what that protein measurement looks like.Basically, what we do is we take a drop of blood out of a patient, and we sort out the proteins in the drop of blood according to how much they weigh, how slippery they are, and we arrange them in an image. And so we can look at literally hundreds of thousands of features at once out of that drop of blood. And we can take a different one tomorrow, and you will see your proteins tomorrow will be different \u2014 they'll be different after you eat or after you sleep. They really tell us what's going on there. And so this picture, which looks like a big smudge to you, is actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this and made me feel like we were on the right track. So if I zoom into that picture, I can just show you what it means. We sort out the proteins \u2014 from left to right is the weight of the fragments that we're getting, and from top to bottom is how slippery they are. So we're zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it. And so each of these lines represents some signal that we're getting out of a piece of a protein. And you can see how the lines occur in these little groups of bump, bump, bump, bump, bump. And that's because we're measuring the weight so precisely that \u2014 carbon comes in different isotopes, so if it has an extra neutron on it, we actually measure it as a different chemical. So we're actually measuring each isotope as a different one.And so that gives you an idea of how exquisitely sensitive this is. So seeing this picture is sort of like getting to be Galileo and looking at the stars and looking through the telescope for the first time, and suddenly you say, \"Wow, it's way more complicated than we thought it was.\" But we can see that stuff out there and actually see features of it. So this is the signature out of which we're trying to get patterns. So what we do with this is, for example, we can look at two patients, one that responded to a drug and one that didn't respond to a drug, and ask, \"What's going on differently inside of them?\" And so we can make these measurements precisely enough that we can overlay two patients and look at the differences.So here we have Alice in green and Bob in red. We overlay them. This is actual data. And you can see, mostly it overlaps and it's yellow, but there's some things that just Alice has and some things that just Bob has. And if we find a pattern of things of the responders to the drug, we see that in the blood, they have the condition that allows them to respond to this drug. We might not even know what this protein is, but we can see it's a marker for the response to the disease. So this already, I think, is tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine. But I think this is actually just the beginning of how we're going to treat cancer. So let me move to cancer.The thing about cancer \u2014 when I got into this, I really knew nothing about it, but working with David Agus, I started watching how cancer was actually being treated and went to operations where it was being cut out. And as I looked at it, to me it didn't make sense how we were approaching cancer, and in order to make sense of it, I had to learn where did this come from. We're treating cancer almost like it's an infectious disease. We're treating it as something that got inside of you that we have to kill. So this is the great paradigm. This is another case where a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked \u2014 was the germ theory of disease. So what doctors are mostly trained to do is diagnose \u2014 that is, put you into a category and apply a scientifically proven treatment for that diagnosis \u2014 and that works great for infectious diseases. So if we put you in the category of you've got syphilis, we can give you penicillin. We know that that works. If you've got malaria, we give you quinine or some derivative of it. And so that's the basic thing doctors are trained to do, and it's miraculous in the case of infectious disease \u2014 how well it works. And many people in this audience probably wouldn't be alive if doctors didn't do this.But now let's apply that to systems diseases like cancer. The problem is that, in cancer, there isn't something else that's inside of you. It's you; you're broken. That conversation inside of you got mixed up in some way. So how do we diagnose that conversation? Well, right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body \u2014 you know, where did it appear? \u2014 and we put you in different categories according to the part of the body. And then we do a clinical trial for a drug for lung cancer and one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer, and we treat these as if they're separate diseases and that this way of dividing them had something to do with what actually went wrong. And of course, it really doesn't have that much to do with what went wrong because cancer is a failure of the system. And in fact, I think we're even wrong when we talk about cancer as a thing. I think this is the big mistake. I think cancer should not be a noun. We should talk about cancering as something we do, not something we have. And so those tumors, those are symptoms of cancer. And so your body is probably cancering all the time, but there are lots of systems in your body that keep it under control.And so to give you an idea of an analogy of what I mean by thinking of cancering as a verb, imagine we didn't know anything about plumbing, and the way that we talked about it, we'd come home and we'd find a leak in our kitchen and we'd say, \"Oh, my house has water.\" We might divide it \u2014 the plumber would say, \"Well, where's the water?\" \"Well, it's in the kitchen.\" \"Oh, you must have kitchen water.\" That's kind of the level at which it is. \"Kitchen water, well, first of all, we'll go in there and we'll mop out a lot of it. And then we know that if we sprinkle Drano around the kitchen, that helps. Whereas living room water, it's better to do tar on the roof.\" And it sounds silly, but that's basically what we do. And I'm not saying you shouldn't mop up your water if you have cancer, but I'm saying that's not really the problem; that's the symptom of the problem.What we really need to get at is the process that's going on, and that's happening at the level of the proteonomic actions, happening at the level of why is your body not healing itself in the way that it normally does? Because normally, your body is dealing with this problem all the time. So your house is dealing with leaks all the time, but it's fixing them. It's draining them out and so on. So what we need is to have a causative model of what's actually going on, and proteomics actually gives us the ability to build a model like that.David got me invited to give a talk at National Cancer Institute and Anna Barker was there. And so I gave this talk and said, \"Why don't you guys do this?\" And Anna said, \"Because nobody within cancer would look at it this way. But what we're going to do, is we're going to create a program for people outside the field of cancer to get together with doctors who really know about cancer and work out different programs of research.\" So David and I applied to this program and created a consortium at USC where we've got some of the best oncologists in the world and some of the best biologists in the world, from Cold Spring Harbor, Stanford, Austin \u2014 I won't even go through and name all the places \u2014 to have a research project that will last for five years where we're really going to try to build a model of cancer like this. We're doing it in mice first, and we will kill a lot of mice in the process of doing this, but they will die for a good cause. And we will actually try to get to the point where we have a predictive model where we can understand, when cancer happens, what's actually happening in there and which treatment will treat that cancer.So let me just end with giving you a little picture of what I think cancer treatment will be like in the future. So I think eventually, once we have one of these models for people, which we'll get eventually \u2014 I mean, our group won't get all the way there \u2014 but eventually we'll have a very good computer model \u2014 sort of like a global climate model for weather. It has lots of different information about what's the process going on in this proteomic conversation on many different scales. And so we will simulate in that model for your particular cancer \u2014 and this also will be for ALS, or any kind of system neurodegenerative diseases, things like that \u2014 we will simulate specifically you, not just a generic person, but what's actually going on inside you.And in that simulation, what we could do is design for you specifically a sequence of treatments, and it might be very gentle treatments, very small amounts of drugs. It might be things like, don't eat that day, or give them a little chemotherapy, maybe a little radiation. Of course, we'll do surgery sometimes and so on. But design a program of treatments specifically for you and help your body guide back to health \u2014 guide your body back to health. Because your body will do most of the work of fixing it if we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong. We put it in the equivalent of splints. And so your body basically has lots and lots of mechanisms for fixing cancer, and we just have to prop those up in the right way and get them to do the job.And so I believe that this will be the way that cancer will be treated in the future. It's going to require a lot of work, a lot of research. There will be many teams like our team that work on this. But I think eventually, we will design for everybody a custom treatment for cancer.So thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1082, "subtitle":

radical things,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nabout how we should think about cancer differently,\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nto an audience that contains a lot of people\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nwho know a lot more about cancer than I do.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nBut I will also contest that I'm not as nervous as I should be\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nbecause I'm pretty sure I'm right about this.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nAnd that this, in fact, will be\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nthe way that we treat cancer in the future.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nIn order to talk about cancer,\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nI'm going to actually have to --\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nlet me get the big slide here.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nFirst, I'm going to try to give you a different perspective of genomics.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nI want to put it in perspective of the bigger picture\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nof all the other things that are going on --\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nand then talk about something you haven't heard so much about, which is proteomics.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nHaving explained those,\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nthat will set up for what I think will be a different idea\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nabout how to go about treating cancer.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nSo let me start with genomics.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nIt is the hot topic.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nIt is the place where we're learning the most.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nThis is the great frontier.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nBut it has its limitations.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nAnd in particular, you've probably all heard the analogy\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nthat the genome is like the blueprint of your body,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nand if that were only true, it would be great,\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nbut it's not.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nIt's like the parts list of your body.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nIt doesn't say how things are connected,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nwhat causes what and so on.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nSo if I can make an analogy,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nlet's say that you were trying to tell the difference\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nbetween a good restaurant, a healthy restaurant\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nand a sick restaurant,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nand all you had was the list of ingredients\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nthat they had in their larder.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nSo it might be that, if you went to a French restaurant\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nand you looked through it and you found\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nthey only had margarine and they didn't have butter,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nyou could say, \"Ah, I see what's wrong with them.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nI can make them healthy.\"\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nAnd there probably are special cases of that.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nYou could certainly tell the difference\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nbetween a Chinese restaurant and a French restaurant\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nby what they had in a larder.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nSo the list of ingredients does tell you something,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nand sometimes it tells you something that's wrong.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nIf they have tons of salt,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nyou might guess they're using too much salt, or something like that.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nBut it's limited,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nbecause really to know if it's a healthy restaurant,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nyou need to taste the food, you need to know what goes on in the kitchen,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nyou need the product of all of those ingredients.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nSo if I look at a person\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nand I look at a person's genome, it's the same thing.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nThe part of the genome that we can read\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nis the list of ingredients.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nAnd so indeed,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nthere are times when we can find ingredients\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nthat [are] bad.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nCystic fibrosis is an example of a disease\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nwhere you just have a bad ingredient and you have a disease,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nand we can actually make a direct correspondence\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nbetween the ingredient and the disease.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nBut most things, you really have to know what's going on in the kitchen,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nbecause, mostly, sick people used to be healthy people --\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nthey have the same genome.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nSo the genome really tells you much more\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nabout predisposition.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nSo what you can tell\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nis you can tell the difference between an Asian person and a European person\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nby looking at their ingredients list.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nBut you really for the most part can't tell the difference\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nbetween a healthy person and a sick person --\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nexcept in some of these special cases.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nSo why all the big deal\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nabout genetics?\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nWell first of all,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nit's because we can read it, which is fantastic.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nIt is very useful in certain circumstances.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nIt's also the great theoretical triumph\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nof biology.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nIt's the one theory\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nthat the biologists ever really got right.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nIt's fundamental to Darwin\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nand Mendel and so on.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nAnd so it's the one thing where they predicted a theoretical construct.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nSo Mendel had this idea of a gene\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nas an abstract thing,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nand Darwin built a whole theory\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nthat depended on them existing,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nand then Watson and Crick\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nactually looked and found one.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nSo this happens in physics all the time.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nYou predict a black hole,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nand you look out the telescope and there it is, just like you said.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nBut it rarely happens in biology.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nSo this great triumph -- it's so good,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nthere's almost a religious experience\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nin biology.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nAnd Darwinian evolution\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nis really the core theory.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nSo the other reason it's been very popular\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nis because we can measure it, it's digital.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd in fact,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nthanks to Kary Mullis,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nyou can basically measure your genome in your kitchen\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nwith a few extra ingredients.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nSo for instance, by measuring the genome,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nwe've learned a lot about how we're related to other kinds of animals\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nby the closeness of our genome,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nor how we're related to each other -- the family tree,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nor the tree of life.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nThere's a huge amount of information about the genetics\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\njust by comparing the genetic similarity.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nNow of course, in medical application,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nthat is very useful\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nbecause it's the same kind of information\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nthat the doctor gets from your family medical history --\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nexcept probably,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nyour genome knows much more about your medical history than you do.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nAnd so by reading the genome,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nwe can find out much more about your family than you probably know.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nAnd so we can discover things\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nthat probably you could have found\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nby looking at enough of your relatives,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nbut they may be surprising.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nI did the 23andMe thing\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nand was very surprised to discover that I am fat and bald.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nBut sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nBut mostly\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nwhat you need to know, to find out if you're sick,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nis not your predispositions,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nbut it's actually what's going on in your body right now.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nSo to do that, what you really need to do,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nyou need to look at the things\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nthat the genes are producing\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nand what's happening after the genetics,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nand that's what proteomics is about.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nJust like genome mixes the study of all the genes,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nproteomics is the study of all the proteins.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd the proteins are all of the little things in your body\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nthat are signaling between the cells --\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nactually, the machines that are operating --\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nthat's where the action is.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nBasically, a human body\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nis a conversation going on,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nboth within the cells and between the cells,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nand they're telling each other to grow and to die,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nand when you're sick,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nsomething's gone wrong with that conversation.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nAnd so the trick is --\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nunfortunately, we don't have an easy way to measure these\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nlike we can measure the genome.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nSo the problem is that measuring --\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nif you try to measure all the proteins, it's a very elaborate process.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nIt requires hundreds of steps,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nand it takes a long, long time.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nAnd it matters how much of the protein it is.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nIt could be very significant that a protein changed by 10 percent,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nso it's not a nice digital thing like DNA.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nAnd basically our problem is somebody's in the middle\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nof this very long stage,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nthey pause for just a moment,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nand they leave something in an enzyme for a second,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nand all of a sudden all the measurements from then on\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\ndon't work.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAnd so then people get very inconsistent results\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nwhen they do it this way.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nPeople have tried very hard to do this.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nI tried this a couple of times\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nand looked at this problem and gave up on it.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nI kept getting this call from this oncologist\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nnamed David Agus.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nAnd Applied Minds gets a lot of calls\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nfrom people who want help with their problems,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nand I didn't think this was a very likely one to call back,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nso I kept on giving him to the delay list.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nAnd then one day,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nI get a call from John Doerr, Bill Berkman\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nand Al Gore on the same day\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nsaying return David Agus's phone call.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nSo I was like, \"Okay. This guy's at least resourceful.\"\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nSo we started talking,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nand he said, \"I really need a better way to measure proteins.\"\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nI'm like, \"Looked at that. Been there.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nNot going to be easy.\"\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nHe's like, \"No, no. I really need it.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nI mean, I see patients dying every day\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nbecause we don't know what's going on inside of them.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nWe have to have a window into this.\"\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nAnd he took me through\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nspecific examples of when he really needed it.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nAnd I realized, wow, this would really make a big difference,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nif we could do it,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nand so I said, \"Well, let's look at it.\"\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nApplied Minds has enough play money\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nthat we can go and just work on something\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nwithout getting anybody's funding or permission or anything.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nSo we started playing around with this.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nAnd as we did it, we realized this was the basic problem --\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nthat taking the sip of coffee --\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nthat there were humans doing this complicated process\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nand that what really needed to be done\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nwas to automate this process like an assembly line\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nand build robots\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nthat would measure proteomics.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nAnd so we did that,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nand working with David,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nwe made a little company called Applied Proteomics eventually,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nwhich makes this robotic assembly line,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nwhich, in a very consistent way, measures the protein.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nAnd I'll show you what that protein measurement looks like.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nBasically, what we do\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nis we take a drop of blood\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nout of a patient,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nand we sort out the proteins\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nin the drop of blood\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\naccording to how much they weigh,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nhow slippery they are,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nand we arrange them in an image.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nAnd so we can look at literally\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nhundreds of thousands of features at once\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nout of that drop of blood.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nAnd we can take a different one tomorrow,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nand you will see your proteins tomorrow will be different --\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nthey'll be different after you eat or after you sleep.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nThey really tell us what's going on there.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nAnd so this picture,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nwhich looks like a big smudge to you,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nis actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nand made me feel like we were on the right track.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nSo if I zoom into that picture,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nI can just show you what it means.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nWe sort out the proteins -- from left to right\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nis the weight of the fragments that we're getting,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nand from top to bottom is how slippery they are.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nSo we're zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nAnd so each of these lines\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nrepresents some signal that we're getting out of a piece of a protein.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nAnd you can see how the lines occur\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nin these little groups of bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nAnd that's because we're measuring the weight so precisely that --\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\ncarbon comes in different isotopes,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nso if it has an extra neutron on it,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nwe actually measure it as a different chemical.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nSo we're actually measuring each isotope as a different one.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nAnd so that gives you an idea\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nof how exquisitely sensitive this is.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nSo seeing this picture\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nis sort of like getting to be Galileo\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nand looking at the stars\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nand looking through the telescope for the first time,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nand suddenly you say, \"Wow, it's way more complicated than we thought it was.\"\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nBut we can see that stuff out there\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nand actually see features of it.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nSo this is the signature out of which we're trying to get patterns.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nSo what we do with this\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nis, for example, we can look at two patients,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\none that responded to a drug and one that didn't respond to a drug,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nand ask, \"What's going on differently\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\ninside of them?\"\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nAnd so we can make these measurements precisely enough\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nthat we can overlay two patients and look at the differences.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nSo here we have Alice in green\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nand Bob in red.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nWe overlay them. This is actual data.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nAnd you can see, mostly it overlaps and it's yellow,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nbut there's some things that just Alice has\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nand some things that just Bob has.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nAnd if we find a pattern of things\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nof the responders to the drug,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nwe see that in the blood,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nthey have the condition\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nthat allows them to respond to this drug.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nWe might not even know what this protein is,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nbut we can see it's a marker\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nfor the response to the disease.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nSo this already, I think,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nis tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nBut I think this is actually\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\njust the beginning\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nof how we're going to treat cancer.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nSo let me move to cancer.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nThe thing about cancer --\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nwhen I got into this,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nI really knew nothing about it,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nbut working with David Agus,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nI started watching how cancer was actually being treated\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nand went to operations where it was being cut out.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nAnd as I looked at it,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nto me it didn't make sense\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nhow we were approaching cancer,\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nand in order to make sense of it,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nI had to learn where did this come from.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nWe're treating cancer almost like it's an infectious disease.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nWe're treating it as something that got inside of you\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nthat we have to kill.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nSo this is the great paradigm.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nThis is another case\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nwhere a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked --\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nwas the germ theory of disease.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nSo what doctors are mostly trained to do\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nis diagnose --\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nthat is, put you into a category\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nand apply a scientifically proven treatment\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nfor that diagnosis --\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nand that works great for infectious diseases.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nSo if we put you in the category\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nof you've got syphilis, we can give you penicillin.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nWe know that that works.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nIf you've got malaria, we give you quinine\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nor some derivative of it.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nAnd so that's the basic thing doctors are trained to do,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nand it's miraculous\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nin the case of infectious disease --\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nhow well it works.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nAnd many people in this audience probably wouldn't be alive\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nif doctors didn't do this.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nBut now let's apply that\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nto systems diseases like cancer.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nThe problem is that, in cancer,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nthere isn't something else\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nthat's inside of you.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nIt's you; you're broken.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nThat conversation inside of you\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\ngot mixed up in some way.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nSo how do we diagnose that conversation?\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nWell, right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body --\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nyou know, where did it appear? --\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nand we put you in different categories\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\naccording to the part of the body.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nAnd then we do a clinical trial\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nfor a drug for lung cancer\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nand one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nand we treat these as if they're separate diseases\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nand that this way of dividing them\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nhad something to do with what actually went wrong.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nAnd of course, it really doesn't have that much to do\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nwith what went wrong\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nbecause cancer is a failure of the system.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nAnd in fact, I think we're even wrong\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nwhen we talk about cancer as a thing.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nI think this is the big mistake.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nI think cancer should not be a noun.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nWe should talk about cancering\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nas something we do, not something we have.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nAnd so those tumors,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nthose are symptoms of cancer.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nAnd so your body is probably cancering all the time,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nbut there are lots of systems in your body\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nthat keep it under control.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nAnd so to give you an idea\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nof an analogy of what I mean\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nby thinking of cancering as a verb,\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nimagine we didn't know anything about plumbing,\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nand the way that we talked about it,\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nwe'd come home and we'd find a leak in our kitchen\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nand we'd say, \"Oh, my house has water.\"\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nWe might divide it -- the plumber would say, \"Well, where's the water?\"\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\n\"Well, it's in the kitchen.\" \"Oh, you must have kitchen water.\"\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nThat's kind of the level at which it is.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\n\"Kitchen water,\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nwell, first of all, we'll go in there and we'll mop out a lot of it.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nAnd then we know that if we sprinkle Drano around the kitchen,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nthat helps.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nWhereas living room water,\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nit's better to do tar on the roof.\"\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nAnd it sounds silly,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nbut that's basically what we do.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nAnd I'm not saying you shouldn't mop up your water if you have cancer,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nbut I'm saying that's not really the problem;\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nthat's the symptom of the problem.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nWhat we really need to get at\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nis the process that's going on,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nand that's happening at the level\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nof the proteonomic actions,\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nhappening at the level of why is your body not healing itself\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nin the way that it normally does?\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nBecause normally, your body is dealing with this problem all the time.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nSo your house is dealing with leaks all the time,\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nbut it's fixing them. It's draining them out and so on.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nSo what we need\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nis to have a causative model\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nof what's actually going on,\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nand proteomics actually gives us\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nthe ability to build a model like that.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nDavid got me invited\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nto give a talk at National Cancer Institute\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nand Anna Barker was there.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nAnd so I gave this talk\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nand said, \"Why don't you guys do this?\"\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nAnd Anna said,\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\n\"Because nobody within cancer\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nwould look at it this way.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nBut what we're going to do, is we're going to create a program\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nfor people outside the field of cancer\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nto get together with doctors\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nwho really know about cancer\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nand work out different programs of research.\"\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nSo David and I applied to this program\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nand created a consortium\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nat USC\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nwhere we've got some of the best oncologists in the world\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nand some of the best biologists in the world,\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nfrom Cold Spring Harbor,\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nStanford, Austin --\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nI won't even go through and name all the places --\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nto have a research project\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nthat will last for five years\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nwhere we're really going to try to build a model of cancer like this.\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nWe're doing it in mice first,\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nand we will kill a lot of mice\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nin the process of doing this,\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nbut they will die for a good cause.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nAnd we will actually try to get to the point\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nwhere we have a predictive model\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nwhere we can understand,\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nwhen cancer happens,\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nwhat's actually happening in there\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nand which treatment will treat that cancer.\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nSo let me just end with giving you a little picture\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nof what I think cancer treatment will be like in the future.\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nSo I think eventually,\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:48.958\nonce we have one of these models for people,\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nwhich we'll get eventually --\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nI mean, our group won't get all the way there --\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nbut eventually we'll have a very good computer model --\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nsort of like a global climate model for weather.\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nIt has lots of different information\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nabout what's the process going on in this proteomic conversation\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:06.958\non many different scales.\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nAnd so we will simulate\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nin that model\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nfor your particular cancer --\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:15.958\nand this also will be for ALS,\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nor any kind of system neurodegenerative diseases,\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nthings like that --\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nwe will simulate\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nspecifically you,\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nnot just a generic person,\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nbut what's actually going on inside you.\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nAnd in that simulation, what we could do\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nis design for you specifically\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:34.958\na sequence of treatments,\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nand it might be very gentle treatments, very small amounts of drugs.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nIt might be things like, don't eat that day,\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nor give them a little chemotherapy,\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:44.958\nmaybe a little radiation.\n\n00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nOf course, we'll do surgery sometimes and so on.\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nBut design a program of treatments specifically for you\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nand help your body\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nguide back to health --\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nguide your body back to health.\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nBecause your body will do most of the work of fixing it\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nif we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong.\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nWe put it in the equivalent of splints.\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nAnd so your body basically has lots and lots of mechanisms\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nfor fixing cancer,\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nand we just have to prop those up in the right way\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:16.958\nand get them to do the job.\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nAnd so I believe that this will be

I was covering the war in Afghanistan, and I witnessed, as a reporter for Al Jazeera, the amount of suffering and destruction that emerged out of a war like that. Then, two years later, I covered another war \u2014 the war in Iraq. I was placed at the center of that war because I was covering the war from the northern part of Iraq. And the war ended with a regime change, like the one in Afghanistan. And that regime that we got rid of was actually a dictatorship, an authoritarian regime, that for decades created a great sense of paralysis within the nation, within the people themselves. However, the change that came through foreign intervention created even worse circumstances for the people and deepened the sense of paralysis and inferiority in that part of the world.For decades, we have lived under authoritarian regimes \u2014 in the Arab world, in the Middle East. These regimes created something within us during this period. I'm 43 years old right now. For the last 40 years, I have seen almost the same faces for kings and presidents ruling us \u2014 old, aged, authoritarian, corrupt situations \u2014 regimes that we have seen around us. And for a moment I was wondering, are we going to live in order to see real change happening on the ground, a change that does not come through foreign intervention, through the misery of occupation, through nations invading our land and deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes? The Iraqis: yes, they got rid of Saddam Hussein, but when they saw their land occupied by foreign forces they felt very sad, they felt that their dignity had suffered. And this is why they revolted. This is why they did not accept. And actually other regimes, they told their citizens, \"Would you like to see the situation of Iraq? Would you like to see civil war, sectarian killing? Would you like to see destruction? Would you like to see foreign troops on your land?\" And the people thought for themselves, \"Maybe we should live with this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in, instead of having the second scenario.\" That was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen.For 10 years, unfortunately we have found ourselves reporting images of destruction, images of killing, of sectarian conflicts, images of violence, emerging from a magnificent piece of land, a region that one day was the source of civilizations and art and culture for thousands of years. Now I am here to tell you that the future that we were dreaming for has eventually arrived. A new generation, well-educated, connected, inspired by universal values and a global understanding, has created a new reality for us. We have found a new way to express our feelings and to express our dreams: these young people who have restored self-confidence in our nations in that part of the world, who have given us new meaning for freedom and empowered us to go down to the streets. Nothing happened. No violence. Nothing. Just step out of your house, raise your voice and say, \"We would like to see the end of the regime.\"This is what happened in Tunisia. Over a few days, the Tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars in the security agencies, billions of dollars in maintaining, trying to maintain, its prisons, collapsed, disappeared, because of the voices of the public. People who were inspired to go down to the streets and to raise their voices, they tried to kill. The intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people. They found something called Facebook. They found something called Twitter. They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues. And they said, \"These kids are misled.\" Therefore, they asked their parents to go down to the streets and collect them, bring them back home. This is what they were telling. This is their propaganda. \"Bring these kids home because they are misled.\" But yes, these youth who have been inspired by universal values, who are idealistic enough to imagine a magnificent future and, at the same time, realistic enough to balance this kind of imagination and the process leading to it \u2014 not using violence, not trying to create chaos \u2014 these young people, they did not go home. Parents actually went to the streets and they supported them. And this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia.We in Al Jazeera were banned from Tunisia for years, and the government did not allow any Al Jazeera reporter to be there. But we found that these people in the street, all of them are our reporters, feeding our newsroom with pictures, with videos and with news. And suddenly that newsroom in Doha became a center that received all this kind of input from ordinary people \u2014 people who are connected and people who have ambition and who have liberated themselves from the feeling of inferiority. And then we took that decision: We are unrolling the news. We are going to be the voice for these voiceless people. We are going to spread the message. Yes, some of these young people are connected to the Internet, but the connectivity in the Arab world is very little, is very small, because of many problems that we are suffering from. But Al Jazeera took the voice from these people and we amplified [it]. We put it in every sitting room in the Arab world \u2014 and internationally, globally, through our English channel.And then people started to feel that there's something new happening. And then Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali decided to leave. And then Egypt started, and Hosni Mubarak decided to leave. And now Libya as you see it. And then you have Yemen. And you have many other countries trying to see and to rediscover that feeling of, \"How do we imagine a future which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant?\" I want to tell you something, that the Internet and connectivity has created [a] new mindset. But this mindset has continued to be faithful to the soil and to the land that it emerged from. And while this was the major difference between many initiatives before to create change, before we thought, and governments told us \u2014 and even sometimes it was true \u2014 that change was imposed on us, and people rejected that, because they thought that it is alien to their culture. Always, we believed that change will spring from within, that change should be a reconciliation with culture, cultural diversity, with our faith in our tradition and in our history, but at the same time, open to universal values, connected with the world, tolerant to the outside. And this is the moment that is happening right now in the Arab world. This is the right moment, and this is the actual moment that we see all of these meanings meet together and then create the beginning of this magnificent era that will emerge from the region.How did the elite deal with that \u2014 the so-called political elite? In front of Facebook, they brought the camels in Tahrir Square. In front of Al Jazeera, they started creating tribalism. And then when they failed, they started speaking about conspiracies that emerged from Tel Aviv and Washington in order to divide the Arab world. They started telling the West, \"Be aware of Al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda is taking over our territories. These are Islamists trying to create new Imaras. Be aware of these people who [are] coming to you in order to ruin your great civilization.\" Fortunately, people right now cannot be deceived. Because this corrupt elite in that region has lost even the power of deception. They could not, and they cannot, imagine how they could really deal with this reality. They have lost. They have been detached from their people, from the masses, and now we are seeing them collapsing one after the other.Al Jazeera is not a tool of revolution. We do not create revolutions. However, when something of that magnitude happens, we are at the center of the coverage. We were banned from Egypt, and our correspondents, some of them were arrested. But most of our camera people and our journalists, they went underground in Egypt \u2014 voluntarily \u2014 to report what happened in Tahrir Square. For 18 days, our cameras were broadcasting, live, the voices of the people in Tahrir Square. I remember one night when someone phoned me on my cellphone \u2014 ordinary person who I don't know \u2014 from Tahrir Square. He told me, \"We appeal to you not to switch off the cameras. If you switch off the cameras tonight, there will be a genocide. You are protecting us by showing what is happening at Tahrir Square.\" I felt the responsibility to phone our correspondents there and to phone our newsroom and to tell them, \"Make your best not to switch off the cameras at night, because the guys there really feel confident when someone is reporting their story \u2014 and they feel protected as well.\"So we have a chance to create a new future in that part of the world. We have a chance to go and to think of the future as something which is open to the world. Let us not repeat the mistake of Iran, of [the] Mosaddeq revolution. Let us free ourselves \u2014 especially in the West \u2014 from thinking about that part of the world based on oil interest, or based on interests of the illusion of stability and security. The stability and security of authoritarian regimes cannot create but terrorism and violence and destruction. Let us accept the choice of the people. Let us not pick and choose who we would like to rule their future. The future should be ruled by people themselves, even sometimes if they are voices that might now scare us. But the values of democracy and the freedom of choice that is sweeping the Middle East at this moment in time is the best opportunity for the world, for the West and the East, to see stability and to see security and to see friendship and to see tolerance emerging from the Arab world, rather than the images of violence and terrorism. Let us support these people. Let us stand for them. And let us give up our narrow selfishness in order to embrace change, and in order to celebrate with the people of that region a great future and hope and tolerance. The future has arrived, and the future is now. I thank you very much.(Applause)Thank you very much.(Applause)Chris Anderson: I just have a couple of questions for you. Thank you for coming here. How would you characterize the historical significance of what's happened? Is this a story-of-the-year, a story-of-the-decade or something more?Wadah Khanfar: Actually, this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered. We have covered many wars. We have covered a lot of tragedies, a lot of problems, a lot of conflict zones, a lot of hot spots in the region, because we were centered at the middle of it. But this is a story \u2014 it is a great story; it is beautiful. It is not something that you only cover because you have to cover a great incident. You are witnessing change in history. You are witnessing the birth of a new era. And this is what the story's all about.CA: There are a lot of people in the West who are still skeptical, or think this may just be an intermediate stage before much more alarming chaos. You really believe that if there are democratic elections in Egypt now, that a government could emerge that espouses some of the values you've spoken about so inspiringly?WK: And people actually, after the collapse of the Hosni Mubarak regime, the youth who have organized themselves in certain groups and councils, they are guarding the transformation and they are trying to put it on a track in order to satisfy the values of democracy, but at the same time also to make it reasonable and to make it rational, not to go out of order. In my opinion, these people are much more wiser than, not only the political elite, even the intellectual elite, even opposition leaders including political parties. At this moment in time, the youth in the Arab world are much more wiser and capable of creating the change than the old \u2014 including the political and cultural and ideological old regimes.(Applause)CA: We are not to get involved politically and interfere in that way. What should people here at TED, here in the West, do if they want to connect or make a difference and they believe in what's happening here?WK: I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world \u2014 that people care, people care about this great transformation. Mohamed Nanabhay who's sitting with us, the head of Aljazeera.net, he told me that a 2,500 percent increase of accessing our website from various parts of the world. Fifty percent of it is coming from America. Because we discovered that people care, and people would like to know \u2014 they are receiving the stream through our Internet. Unfortunately in the United States, we are not covering but Washington D.C. at this moment in time for Al Jazeera English. But I can tell you, this is the moment to celebrate through connecting ourselves with those people in the street and expressing our support to them and expressing this kind of feeling, universal feeling, of supporting the weak and the oppressed to create a much better future for all of us.CA: Well Wadah, a group of members of the TED community, TEDxCairo, are meeting as we speak. They've had some speakers there. I believe they've heard your talk. Thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us. Thank you so much.(Applause)", "id": 1084, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nTen years ago exactly,\n\n00:00:13.958 -->

given us\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nnew meaning for freedom\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nand empowered us to go down to the streets.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nNothing happened. No violence. Nothing.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nJust step out of your house,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nraise your voice\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nand say, \"We would like to see the end of the regime.\"\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nThis is what happened in Tunisia.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nOver a few days,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nthe Tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nin the security agencies,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nbillions of dollars\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nin maintaining, trying to maintain,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nits prisons,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\ncollapsed, disappeared,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nbecause of the voices of the public.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nPeople who were inspired to go down to the streets\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nand to raise their voices,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nthey tried to kill.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nThe intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nThey found something called Facebook.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nThey found something called Twitter.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nThey were surprised by all of these kinds of issues.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAnd they said,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\n\"These kids are misled.\"\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nTherefore, they asked their parents\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nto go down to the streets\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nand collect them, bring them back home.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nThis is what they were telling. This is their propaganda.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\n\"Bring these kids home\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nbecause they are misled.\"\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nBut yes,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nthese youth\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nwho have been inspired\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nby universal values,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nwho are idealistic enough\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nto imagine a magnificent future\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nand, at the same time, realistic enough\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nto balance this kind of imagination\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nand the process leading to it --\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nnot using violence,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nnot trying to create chaos --\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nthese young people,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nthey did not go home.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nParents actually went to the streets\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nand they supported them.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nAnd this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nWe in Al Jazeera\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nwere banned from Tunisia for years,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nand the government did not allow\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nany Al Jazeera reporter to be there.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nBut we found that these people in the street,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nall of them are our reporters,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nfeeding our newsroom\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nwith pictures, with videos\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nand with news.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd suddenly that newsroom in Doha\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nbecame a center\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nthat received all this kind of input from ordinary people --\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\npeople who are connected and people who have ambition\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nand who have liberated themselves\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nfrom the feeling of inferiority.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nAnd then we took that decision:\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nWe are unrolling the news.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nWe are going to be the voice for these voiceless people.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nWe are going to spread the message.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nYes, some of these young people\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nare connected to the Internet,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nbut the connectivity in the Arab world\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nis very little, is very small,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nbecause of many problems that we are suffering from.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nBut Al Jazeera took the voice from these people\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nand we amplified [it].\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nWe put it in every sitting room in the Arab world --\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nand internationally, globally,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nthrough our English channel.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nAnd then people started to feel\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nthat there's something new happening.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nAnd then Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\ndecided to leave.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nAnd then Egypt started,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nand Hosni Mubarak decided to leave.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAnd now Libya as you see it.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nAnd then you have Yemen.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nAnd you have many other countries trying to see\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nand to rediscover that feeling\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nof, \"How do we imagine a future\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nwhich is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant?\"\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nI want to tell you something,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nthat the Internet and connectivity\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nhas created [a] new mindset.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nBut this mindset\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nhas continued to be faithful\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nto the soil and to the land\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nthat it emerged from.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nAnd while this was the major difference\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nbetween many initiatives before\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nto create change,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nbefore we thought, and governments told us --\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nand even sometimes it was true --\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nthat change was imposed on us,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nand people rejected that,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nbecause they thought that it is alien to their culture.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nAlways, we believed\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nthat change will spring from within,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nthat change should be a reconciliation\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nwith culture, cultural diversity,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nwith our faith in our tradition\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nand in our history,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nbut at the same time,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nopen to universal values, connected with the world,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\ntolerant to the outside.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nAnd this is the moment\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nthat is happening right now in the Arab world.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nThis is the right moment, and this is the actual moment\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nthat we see all of these meanings meet together\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nand then create the beginning\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nof this magnificent era\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nthat will emerge from the region.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nHow did the elite deal with that --\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nthe so-called political elite?\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nIn front of Facebook,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nthey brought the camels in Tahrir Square.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nIn front of Al Jazeera,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nthey started creating tribalism.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nAnd then when they failed,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nthey started speaking about conspiracies\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nthat emerged from Tel Aviv and Washington\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nin order to divide the Arab world.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nThey started telling the West,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\n\"Be aware of Al-Qaeda.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nAl-Qaeda is taking over our territories.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nThese are Islamists\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\ntrying to create new Imaras.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nBe aware of these people\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nwho [are] coming to you\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nin order to ruin your great civilization.\"\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nFortunately,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\npeople right now cannot be deceived.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nBecause this corrupt elite\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nin that region\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nhas lost even the power of deception.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nThey could not, and they cannot, imagine\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nhow they could really deal with this reality.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nThey have lost.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nThey have been detached\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nfrom their people, from the masses,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nand now we are seeing them collapsing\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\none after the other.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nAl Jazeera is not\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\na tool of revolution.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nWe do not create revolutions.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nHowever,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nwhen something of that magnitude happens,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nwe are at the center of the coverage.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nWe were banned from Egypt,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nand our correspondents,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nsome of them were arrested.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nBut most of our camera people\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nand our journalists,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nthey went underground in Egypt -- voluntarily --\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nto report what happened in Tahrir Square.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nFor 18 days,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nour cameras were broadcasting, live,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nthe voices of the people in Tahrir Square.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nI remember one night\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nwhen someone phoned me on my cellphone --\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nordinary person who I don't know -- from Tahrir Square.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nHe told me, \"We appeal to you\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nnot to switch off the

correspondents there\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nand to phone our newsroom\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nand to tell them, \"Make your best\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nnot to switch off the cameras at night,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nbecause the guys there really feel confident\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nwhen someone is reporting their story --\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nand they feel protected as well.\"\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nSo we have a chance\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nto create a new future\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nin

open to the world.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nLet us not repeat the mistake of Iran,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nof [the] Mosaddeq revolution.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nLet us free ourselves -- especially in the West --\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nfrom thinking about that part of the world\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nbased on oil interest,\n\n00:11:55.958 -->

be an intermediate stage\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nbefore much more alarming chaos.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nYou really believe\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nthat if there are democratic elections in Egypt now,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nthat a government could emerge\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nthat espouses some of the values you've spoken about so

"transcript": "Two weeks ago I was in my studio in Paris, and the phone rang and I heard, \"Hey, JR, you won the TED Prize 2011. You have to make a wish to save the world.\" I was lost. I mean, I can't save the world. Nobody can. The world is fucked up. Come on, you have dictators ruling the world, population is growing by millions, there's no more fish in the sea, the North Pole is melting and as the last TED Prize winner said, we're all becoming fat. (Laughter) Except maybe French people. Whatever. So I called back and I told her, \"Look, Amy, tell the TED guys I just won't show up. I can't do anything to save the world.\" She said, \"Hey, JR, your wish is not to save the world, but to change the world.\" \"Oh, all right.\" (Laughter) \"That's cool.\" I mean, technology, politics, business do change the world \u2014 not always in a good way, but they do. What about art? Could art change the world?I started when I was 15 years old. And at that time, I was not thinking about changing the world. I was doing graffiti \u2014 writing my name everywhere, using the city as a canvas. I was going in the tunnels of Paris, on the rooftops with my friends. Each trip was an excursion, was an adventure. It was like leaving our mark on society, to say, \"I was here,\" on the top of a building.So when I found a cheap camera on the subway, I started documenting those adventures with my friends and gave them back as photocopies \u2014 really small photos just that size. That's how, at 17 years old, I started pasting them. And I did my first \"expo de rue,\" which means sidewalk gallery. And I framed it with color so you would not confuse it with advertising. I mean, the city's the best gallery I could imagine. I would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery and let them decide if my work was nice enough to show it to people. I would control it directly with the public in the streets.So that's Paris. I would change \u2014 depending on the places I would go \u2014 the title of the exhibition. That's on the Champs-Elysees. I was quite proud of that one. Because I was just 18 and I was just up there on the top of the Champs-Elysees. Then when the photo left, the frame was still there.(Laughter)November 2005: the streets are burning. A large wave of riots had broken into the first projects of Paris. Everyone was glued to the TV, watching disturbing, frightening images taken from the edge of the neighborhood. I mean, these kids, without control, throwing Molotov cocktails, attacking the cops and the firemen, looting everything they could in the shops. These were criminals, thugs, dangerous, destroying their own environment.And then I saw it \u2014 could it be possible? \u2014 my photo on a wall revealed by a burning car \u2014 a pasting I'd done a year earlier \u2014 an illegal one \u2014 still there. I mean, these were the faces of my friends. I know those guys. All of them are not angels, but they're not monsters either. So it was kind of weird to see those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television.So I went back there with a 28 mm lens. It was the only one I had at that time. But with that lens, you have to be as close as 10 inches from the person. So you can do it only with their trust. So I took full portraits of people from Le Bosquet. They were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves. And then I pasted huge posters everywhere in the bourgeois area of Paris with the name, age, even building number of these guys. A year later, the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of Paris. And we go from thug images, who've been stolen and distorted by the media, who's now proudly taking over his own image. That's where I realized the power of paper and glue. So could art change the world?A year later, I was listening to all the noise about the Middle East conflict. I mean, at that time, trust me, they were only referring to the Israeli and Palestinian conflict. So with my friend Marco, we decided to go there and see who are the real Palestinians and who are the real Israelis. Are they so different? When we got there, we just went in the street, started talking with people everywhere, and we realized that things were a bit different from the rhetoric we heard in the media. So we decided to take portraits of Palestinians and Israelis doing the same jobs \u2014 taxi-driver, lawyer, cooks. Asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment. Not a smile \u2014 that really doesn't tell about who you are and what you feel. They all accepted to be pasted next to the other. I decided to paste in eight Israeli and Palestinian cities and on both sides of the wall. We launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever. We called the project Face 2 Face.The experts said, \"No way. The people will not accept. The army will shoot you, and Hamas will kidnap you.\" We said, \"Okay, let's try and push as far as we can.\" I love the way that people will ask me, \"How big will my photo be?\" \"It will be as big as your house.\" When we did the wall, we did the Palestinian side. So we arrived with just our ladders and we realized that they were not high enough. And so Palestinians guys say, \"Calm down. No wait. I'm going to find you a solution.\" So he went to the Church of Nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen Jesus being born. (Laughter) We did Face 2 Face with only six friends, two ladders, two brushes, a rented car, a camera and 20,000 square feet of paper. We had all sorts of help from all walks of life.Okay, for example, that's Palestine. We're in Ramallah right now. We're pasting portraits \u2014 so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market. People come around us and start asking, \"What are you doing here?\" \"Oh, we're actually doing an art project and we are pasting an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job. And those ones are actually two taxi-drivers.\" And then there was always a silence. \"You mean you're pasting an Israeli face \u2014 doing a face \u2014 right here?\" \"Well, yeah, yeah, that's part of the project.\" And I would always leave that moment, and we would ask them, \"So can you tell me who is who?\" And most of them couldn't say.(Applause)We even pasted on Israeli military towers, and nothing happened. When you paste an image, it's just paper and glue. People can tear it, tag on it, or even pee on it \u2014 some are a bit high for that, I agree \u2014 but the people in the street, they are the curator. The rain and the wind will take them off anyway. They are not meant to stay. But exactly four years after, the photos, most of them are still there. Face 2 Face demonstrated that what we thought impossible was possible \u2014 and, you know what, even easy. We didn't push the limit; we just showed that they were further than anyone thought.In the Middle East, I experienced my work in places without [many] museums. So the reactions in the street were kind of interesting. So I decided to go further in this direction and go in places where there were zero museums. When you go in these developing societies, women are the pillars of their community, but the men are still the ones holding the streets. So we were inspired to create a project where men will pay tribute to women by posting their photos. I called that project Women Are Heroes. When I listened to all the stories everywhere I went on the continents, I couldn't always understand the complicated circumstances of their conflict. I just observed. Sometimes there was no words, no sentence, just tears. I just took their pictures and pasted them.Women Are Heroes took me around the world. Most of the places I went to, I decided to go there because I've heard about it through the media. So for example, in June 2008, I was watching TV in Paris, and then I heard about this terrible thing that happened in Rio de Janeiro \u2014 the first favela of Brazil named Providencia. Three kids \u2014 that was three students \u2014 were [detained] by the army because they were not carrying their papers. And the army took them, and instead of bringing them to the police station, they brought them to an enemy favela where they get chopped into pieces. I was shocked. All Brazil was shocked. I heard it was one of the most violent favelas, because the largest drug cartel controls it. So I decided to go there.When I arrived \u2014 I mean, I didn't have any contact with any NGO. There was none in place \u2014 no association, no NGOs, nothing \u2014 no eyewitnesses. So we just walked around, and we met a woman, and I showed her my book. And she said, \"You know what? We're hungry for culture. We need culture out there.\" So I went out and I started with the kids. I just took a few photos of the kids, and the next day I came with the posters and we pasted them. The day after, I came back and they were already scratched. But that's okay. I wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them.Then the next day, I held a meeting on the main square and some women came. They were all linked to the three kids that got killed. There was the mother, the grandmother, the best friend \u2014 they all wanted to shout the story. After that day, everyone in the favela gave me the green light. I took more photos, and we started the project. The drug lords were kind of worried about us filming in the place, so I told them, \"You know what? I'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons. You see that enough in the media. What I want to show is the incredible life and energy. I've been seeing it around me the last few days.\" So that's a really symbolic pasting, because that's the first one we did that you couldn't see from the city. And that's where the three kids got arrested, and that's the grandmother of one of them. And on that stairs, that's where the traffickers always stand and there's a lot of exchange of fire. Everyone there understood the project. And then we pasted everywhere \u2014 the whole hill.(Applause)What was interesting is that the media couldn't get in. I mean, you should see that. They would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter and then have a really long lens, and we would see ourselves, on TV, pasting. And they would put a number: \"Please call this number if you know what's going on in Providencia.\" We just did a project and then left so the media wouldn't know. So how can we know about the project? So they had to go and find the women and get an explanation from them. So you create a bridge between the media and the anonymous women.We kept traveling. We went to Africa, Sudan, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Kenya. In war-torn places like Monrovia, people come straight to you. I mean, they want to know what you're up to. They kept asking me, \"What is the purpose of your project? Are you an NGO? Are you the media?\" Art. Just doing art. Some people question, \"Why is it in black and white? Don't you have color in France?\" (Laughter) Or they tell you, \"Are these people all dead?\" Some who understood the project would explain it to others. And to a man who did not understand, I heard someone say, \"You know, you've been here for a few hours trying to understand, discussing with your fellows. During that time, you haven't thought about what you're going to eat tomorrow. This is art.\" I think it's people's curiosity that motivates them to come into the projects. And then it becomes more. It becomes a desire, a need, an armor. On this bridge that's in Monrovia, ex-rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait of a woman that might have been raped during the war. Women are always the first ones targeted during conflict.This is Kibera, Kenya, one of the largest slums of Africa. You might have seen images about the post-election violence that happened there in 2008. This time we covered the roofs of the houses, but we didn't use paper, because paper doesn't prevent the rain from leaking inside the house \u2014 vinyl does. Then art becomes useful. So the people kept it. You know what I love is, for example, when you see the biggest eye there, there are so [many] houses inside. And I went there a few months ago \u2014 photos are still there \u2014 and it was missing a piece of the eye. So I asked the people what happened. \"Oh, that guy just moved.\" (Laughter) When the roofs were covered, a woman said as a joke, \"Now God can see me.\" When you look at Kibera now, they look back.Okay, India. Before I start that, just so you know, each time we go to a place, we don't have authorization, so we set up like commandos \u2014 we're a group of friends who arrive there, and we try to paste on the walls. But there are places where you just can't paste on a wall. In India it was just impossible to paste. I heard culturally and because of the law, they would just arrest us at the first pasting. So we decided to paste white, white on the walls. So imagine white guys pasting white papers. So people would come to us and ask us, \"Hey, what are you up to?\" \"Oh, you know, we're just doing art.\" \"Art?\" Of course, they were confused. But you know how India has a lot of dust in the streets, and the more dust you would have going up in the air, on the white paper you can almost see, but there is this sticky part like when you reverse a sticker. So the more dust you have, the more it will reveal the photo. So we could just walk in the street during the next days and the photos would get revealed by themselves. (Applause) Thank you. So we didn't get caught this time.Each project \u2014 that's a film from Women Are Heroes. (Music) Okay. For each project we do a film. And most of what you see \u2014 that's a trailer from \"Women Are Heroes\" \u2014 its images, photography, taken one after the other. And the photos kept traveling even without us. (Laughter) (Applause) Hopefully, you'll see the film, and you'll understand the scope of the project and what the people felt when they saw those photos. Because that's a big part of it. There's layers behind each photo. Behind each image is a story.Women Are Heroes created a new dynamic in each of the communities, and the women kept that dynamic after we left. For example, we did books \u2014 not for sale \u2014 that all the community would get. But to get it, they would have to [get] it signed by one of the women. We did that in most of the places. We go back regularly. And so in Providencia, for example, in the favela, we have a cultural center running there. In Kibera, each year we cover more roofs. Because of course, when we left, the people who were just at the edge of the project said, \"Hey, what about my roof?\" So we decided to come the year after and keep doing the project.A really important point for me is that I don't use any brand or corporate sponsors. So I have no responsibility to anyone but myself and the subjects. (Applause) And that is for me one of the more important things in the work. I think, today, as important as the result is the way you do things. And that has always been a central part of the work. And what's interesting is that fine line that I have with images and advertising. We just did some pasting in Los Angeles on another project in the last weeks. And I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum. But yesterday the city called them and said, \"Look, you're going to have to tear it down. Because this can be taken for advertising, and because of the law, it has to be taken down.\" But tell me, advertising for what?The people I photograph were proud to participate in the project and to have their photo in the community. But they asked me for a promise basically. They asked me, \"Please, make our story travel with you.\" So I did. That's Paris. That's Rio. In each place, we built exhibitions with a story, and the story traveled. You understand the full scope of the project. That's London. New York. And today, they are with you in Long Beach.All right, recently I started a public art project where I don't use my artwork anymore. I use Man Ray, Helen Levitt, Giacomelli, other people's artwork. It doesn't matter today if it's your photo or not. The importance is what you do with the images, the statement it makes where it's pasted. So for example, I pasted the photo of the minaret in Switzerland a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country. (Applause) This image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in Chernobyl originally, and I pasted it in Southern Italy, where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground.In some ways, art can change the world. Art is not supposed to change the world, to change practical things, but to change perceptions. Art can change the way we see the world. Art can create an analogy. Actually the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neutral place for exchanges and discussions, and then enables you to change the world. When I do my work, I have two kinds of reactions. People say, \"Oh, why don't you go in Iraq or Afghanistan. They would be really useful.\" Or, \"How can we help?\" I presume that you belong to the second category, and that's good, because for that project, I'm going to ask you to take the photos and paste them.So now my wish is: (mock drum roll) (Laughter) I wish for you to stand up for what you care about by participating in a global art project, and together we'll turn the world inside out. And this starts right now. Yes, everyone in the room. Everyone watching. I wanted that wish to actually start now. So a subject you're passionate about, a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos \u2014 tell me what you stand for. Take the photos, the portraits, upload it \u2014 I'll give you all the details \u2014 and I'll send you back your poster. Join by groups and reveal things to the world. The full data is on the website \u2014 insideoutproject.net \u2014 that is launching today.What we see changes who we are. When we act together, the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts. So I hope that, together, we'll create something that the world will remember. And this starts right now and depends on you.Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1085, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nTwo weeks ago I was in my studio in Paris,\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nand the phone rang and I heard,\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.958\n\"Hey, JR,\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nyou won the TED Prize 2011.\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nYou have to make a wish to save the world.\"\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nI was lost.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nI mean, I can't save the world. Nobody can.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nThe world is fucked up.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nCome on, you have dictators ruling the world,\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\npopulation is growing by millions,\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nthere's no more fish in the sea,\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nthe North Pole is melting\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nand as the last TED Prize winner said,\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nwe're all becoming fat.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nExcept maybe French people.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nWhatever.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nSo I called back\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nand I told her,\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\n\"Look, Amy,\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\ntell the TED guys I just won't show up.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nI can't do anything to save the world.\"\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nShe said, \"Hey, JR,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nyour wish is not to save the world, but to change the world.\"\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\n\"Oh, all right.\"\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\n\"That's cool.\"\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nI mean, technology, politics, business\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\ndo change the world --\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nnot always in a good way, but they do.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nWhat about art?\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nCould art change the world?\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nI started when I was 15 years old.\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nAnd at that time, I was not thinking about changing the world.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nI was doing graffiti --\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nwriting my name everywhere,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nusing the city as a canvas.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nI was going in the tunnels of Paris,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\non the rooftops with my friends.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nEach trip was an excursion,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nwas an adventure.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nIt was like leaving our mark on society,\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nto say, \"I was here,\" on the top of a building.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nSo when I found a cheap camera on the subway,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nI started documenting those adventures with my friends\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nand gave them back as photocopies --\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nreally small photos just that size.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nThat's how, at 17 years old,\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nI started pasting them.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nAnd I did my first \"expo de rue,\"\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nwhich means sidewalk gallery.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nAnd I framed it with color\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nso you would not confuse it with advertising.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nI mean, the city's the best gallery I could imagine.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nI would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nand let them decide\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nif my work was nice enough to show it to people.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nI would control it directly with the public\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nin the streets.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nSo that's Paris.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nI would change --\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\ndepending on the places I would go --\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nthe title of the exhibition.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nThat's on the Champs-Elysees.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nI was quite proud of that one.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nBecause I was just 18\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nand I was just up there on the top of the Champs-Elysees.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nThen when the photo left,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nthe frame was still there.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nNovember 2005:\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nthe streets are burning.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nA large wave of riots\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nhad broken into the first projects of Paris.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nEveryone was glued to the TV,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nwatching disturbing, frightening images\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\ntaken from the edge of the neighborhood.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nI mean, these kids, without control,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nthrowing Molotov cocktails,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nattacking the cops and the firemen,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nlooting everything they could in the shops.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nThese were criminals, thugs, dangerous,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\ndestroying their own environment.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nAnd then I saw it -- could it be possible? --\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nmy photo on a wall\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nrevealed by a burning car --\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\na pasting I'd done a year earlier --\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nan illegal one -- still there.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nI mean, these were the faces of my friends.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nI know those guys.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nAll of them are not angels,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nbut they're not monsters either.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nSo it was kind of weird to see\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nthose images and those eyes stare back at me through a television.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nSo I went back there\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nwith a 28 mm lens.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nIt was the only one I had at that time.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nBut with that lens,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nyou have to be as close as 10 inches from the person.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nSo you can do it only with their trust.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nSo I took full portraits of people from Le Bosquet.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nThey were making scary faces\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nto play the caricature of themselves.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nAnd then I pasted huge posters everywhere\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nin the bourgeois area of Paris\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nwith the name, age, even building number\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nof these guys.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nA year later,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nthe exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of Paris.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nAnd we go from thug images,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nwho've been stolen and distorted by the media,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nwho's now proudly taking over his own image.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nThat's where I realized\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nthe power of paper and glue.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nSo could art change the world?\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nA year later,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nI was listening to all the noise\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nabout the Middle East conflict.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nI mean, at that time, trust me,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nthey were only referring to the Israeli and Palestinian conflict.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nSo with my friend Marco,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nwe decided to go there\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nand see who are the real Palestinians and who are the real Israelis.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nAre they so different?\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nWhen we got there, we just went in the street,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nstarted talking with people everywhere,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nand we realized that things were a bit different\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nfrom the rhetoric we heard in the media.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nSo we decided to take portraits\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nof Palestinians and Israelis\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\ndoing the same jobs --\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\ntaxi-driver, lawyer, cooks.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nAsked them to make a face as a sign of commitment.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nNot a smile -- that really doesn't tell\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nabout who you are and what you feel.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nThey all accepted\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nto be pasted next to the other.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nI decided to paste\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nin eight Israeli and Palestinian cities\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nand on both sides of the wall.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nWe launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nWe called the project Face 2 Face.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nThe experts said, \"No way.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nThe people will not accept.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nThe army will shoot you, and Hamas will kidnap you.\"\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nWe said, \"Okay, let's try and push as far as we can.\"\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nI love the way that people will ask me,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\n\"How big will my photo be?\"\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\n\"It will be as big as your house.\"\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nWhen we did the wall, we did the Palestinian side.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nSo we arrived with just our ladders\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nand we realized that they were not high enough.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nAnd so Palestinians guys say,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\n\"Calm down. No wait. I'm going to find you a solution.\"\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nSo he went to the Church of Nativity\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nand brought back an old ladder\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nthat was so old that it could have seen Jesus being born.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nWe did Face 2 Face with only six friends,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\ntwo ladders, two brushes,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\na rented car, a camera\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nand 20,000 square feet of paper.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nWe had all sorts of help\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nfrom all walks of life.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nOkay, for example, that's Palestine.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nWe're in Ramallah right now.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nWe're pasting portraits --\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nso both portraits in the streets in a crowded market.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nPeople come around us and start asking,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\n\"What are you doing here?\"\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\n\"Oh, we're actually doing an art project\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nand we are pasting an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAnd those ones are actually two taxi-drivers.\"\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nAnd then there was always a silence.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\n\"You mean you're pasting an Israeli face --\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\ndoing a face -- right here?\"\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\n\"Well, yeah, yeah, that's part of the project.\"\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nAnd I would always leave that moment,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nand we would ask them,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\n\"So can you tell me who is who?\"\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd most of them couldn't say.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:22.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nWe even pasted on Israeli military towers,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nand nothing happened.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nWhen you paste an image, it's just paper and glue.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nPeople can tear it, tag on it, or even pee on it --\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nsome are a bit high for that, I agree --\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nbut the people in the street,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nthey are the curator.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nThe rain and the wind will take them off anyway.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nThey are not meant to stay.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nBut exactly four years after,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nthe photos, most of them are still there.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nFace 2 Face demonstrated\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nthat what we thought impossible was possible --\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nand, you know what, even easy.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nWe didn't push the limit;\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nwe just showed that they were further than anyone thought.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nIn the Middle East, I experienced my work\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nin places without [many] museums.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nSo the reactions in the street\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nwere kind of interesting.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nSo I decided to go further in this direction\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nand go in places where there were zero museums.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nWhen you go in these developing societies,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nwomen are the pillars of their community,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nbut the men are still the ones holding the streets.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nSo we were inspired to create a project\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nwhere men will pay tribute to women\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nby posting their photos.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nI called that project Women Are Heroes.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nWhen I listened to all the stories\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\neverywhere I went on the continents,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nI couldn't always understand\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nthe complicated circumstances of their conflict.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nI just observed.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nSometimes there was no words,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nno sentence, just tears.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nI just took their pictures\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nand pasted them.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nWomen Are Heroes took me around the world.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nMost of the places I went to,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nI decided to go there\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nbecause I've heard about it through the media.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nSo for example, in June 2008,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nI was watching TV in Paris,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nand then I heard about this terrible thing\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nthat happened in Rio de Janeiro --\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nthe first favela of Brazil named Providencia.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nThree kids -- that was three students --\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nwere [detained] by the army\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nbecause they were not carrying their papers.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nAnd the army took them,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nand instead of bringing them to the police station,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nthey brought them to an enemy favela\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nwhere they get chopped into pieces.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nI was shocked.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nAll Brazil was shocked.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nI heard it was one of the most violent favelas,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nbecause the largest drug cartel controls it.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nSo I decided to go there.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nWhen I arrived --\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nI mean, I didn't have any contact with any NGO.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nThere was none in place -- no association, no NGOs, nothing --\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nno eyewitnesses.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nSo we just walked around,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nand we met a woman,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nand I showed her my book.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nAnd she said, \"You know what?\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nWe're hungry for culture.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nWe need culture out there.\"\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nSo I went out and I started with the kids.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nI just took a few photos of the kids,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nand the next day I came with the posters and we pasted them.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nThe day after, I came back and they were already scratched.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nBut that's okay.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nI wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nThen the next day, I held a meeting on the main square\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nand some women came.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nThey were all linked to the three kids that got killed.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nThere was the mother, the grandmother, the best friend --\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nthey all wanted to shout the story.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nAfter that day,\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\neveryone in the favela gave me the green light.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nI took more photos, and we started the project.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nThe drug lords were kind of worried\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nabout us filming in the place,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nso I told them, \"You know what?\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nI'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nYou see that enough in the media.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nWhat I want to show is the incredible life and energy.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nI've been seeing it around me the last few days.\"\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nSo that's a really symbolic pasting,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nbecause that's the first one we did that you couldn't see from the city.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nAnd that's where the three kids got arrested,\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nand that's the grandmother of one of them.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nAnd on that stairs,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nthat's where the traffickers always stand\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nand there's a lot of exchange of fire.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nEveryone there understood the project.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nAnd then we pasted everywhere -- the whole hill.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:52.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nWhat was interesting is that the media couldn't get in.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nI mean, you should see that.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nThey would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nand then have a really long lens,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nand we would see ourselves, on TV, pasting.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nAnd they would put a number: \"Please call this number\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nif you know what's going on in Providencia.\"\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nWe just did a project and then left\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nso the media wouldn't know.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nSo how can we know about the project?\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nSo they had to go and find the women\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nand get an explanation from them.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nSo you create a bridge between the media\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nand the anonymous women.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nWe kept traveling.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nWe went to Africa, Sudan, Sierra Leone,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nLiberia, Kenya.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nIn war-torn places like Monrovia,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\npeople come straight to you.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nI mean, they want to know what you're up to.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nThey kept asking me, \"What is the purpose of your project?\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nAre you an NGO? Are you the media?\"\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nArt. Just doing art.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nSome people question, \"Why is it in black and white?\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nDon't you have color in France?\"\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nOr they tell you, \"Are these people all dead?\"\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nSome who understood the project would explain it to others.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nAnd to a man who did not understand, I heard someone say,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\n\"You know, you've been here for a few hours\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\ntrying to understand, discussing with your fellows.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nDuring that time, you haven't thought about\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nwhat you're going to eat tomorrow.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nThis is art.\"\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nI think it's people's curiosity\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nthat motivates them\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nto come into the projects.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nAnd then it becomes more.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nIt becomes a desire, a need, an armor.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nOn this bridge that's in Monrovia,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nex-rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nof a woman that might have been raped during the war.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nWomen are always the first ones targeted\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nduring conflict.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nThis is Kibera, Kenya,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\none of the largest slums of Africa.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nYou might have seen images about the post-election violence\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nthat happened there in 2008.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nThis time we covered the roofs of the houses,\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nbut we didn't use paper,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nbecause paper doesn't prevent the rain\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nfrom leaking inside the house --\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nvinyl does.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nThen art becomes useful.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nSo the people kept it.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nYou know what I love is, for example, when you see the biggest eye there,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nthere are so [many] houses inside.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nAnd I went there a few months ago --\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nphotos are still there -- and it was missing a piece of the eye.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nSo I asked the people what happened.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\n\"Oh, that guy just moved.\"\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:27.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nWhen the roofs were covered, a woman said as a joke,\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\n\"Now God can see me.\"\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nWhen you look at Kibera now,\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nthey look back.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nOkay, India.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nBefore I start that, just so you know,\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\neach time we go to a place, we don't have authorization,\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nso we set up like commandos --\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nwe're a group of friends who arrive there,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nand we try to paste on the walls.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nBut there are places where you just can't paste on a wall.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nIn India it was just impossible to paste.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nI heard culturally and because of the law,\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nthey would just arrest us at the first pasting.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nSo we decided to paste white,\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nwhite on the walls.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nSo imagine white guys pasting white papers.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nSo people would come to us and ask us,\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\n\"Hey, what are you up to?\"\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.958\n\"Oh, you know, we're just doing art.\" \"Art?\"\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nOf course, they were confused.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nBut you know how India has a lot of dust in the streets,\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nand the more dust you would have\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\ngoing up in the air,\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\non the white paper you can almost see,\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nbut there is this sticky part\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nlike when you reverse a sticker.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nSo the more dust you have, the more it will reveal the photo.\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nSo we could just walk in the street during the next days\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nand the photos would get revealed by themselves.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:49.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nThank you.\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nSo we didn't get caught this time.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nEach project -- that's a film\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nfrom Women Are Heroes.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:05.958\n(Music)\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nOkay.\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nFor each project we do\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.958\na film.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nAnd most of what you see -- that's a trailer from \"Women Are Heroes\" --\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nits images, photography,\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:20.958\ntaken one after the other.\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nAnd the photos kept traveling even without us.\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:29.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:31.958\nHopefully, you'll see the film,\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nand you'll understand the scope of the project\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nand what the people felt when they saw those photos.\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:38.958\nBecause that's a big part of it. There's layers behind each photo.\n\n00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nBehind each image is a story.\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nWomen Are Heroes created a new dynamic\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nin each of the communities,\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.958\nand the women kept that dynamic after we left.\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nFor example, we did books -- not for sale --\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nthat all the community would get.\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nBut to get it, they would have to [get] it signed by one of the women.\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:18:59.958\nWe did that in most of the places.\n\n00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nWe go back regularly.\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:04.958\nAnd so in Providencia, for example, in the favela,\n\n00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nwe have a cultural center running there.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nIn Kibera, each year we cover more roofs.\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nBecause of course, when we left, the people who were just at the edge of the project\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nsaid, \"Hey, what about my roof?\"\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:16.958\nSo we decided to come the year after\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:19.958\nand keep doing the project.\n\n00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nA really important point for me\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nis that I don't use any brand or corporate sponsors.\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nSo I have no responsibility\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nto anyone but myself\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:30.958\nand the subjects.\n\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:34.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:36.958\nAnd that is for me\n\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:38.958\none of the more important things in the work.\n\n00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:40.958\nI think, today,\n\n00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:43.958\nas important as the result is the way you do things.\n\n00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:46.958\nAnd that has always been a central part of the work.\n\n00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:49.958\nAnd what's interesting is that fine line that I have\n\n00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:51.958\nwith images and advertising.\n\n00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:53.958\nWe just did some pasting in Los Angeles\n\n00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:56.958\non another project in the last weeks.\n\n00:19:56.958 --> 00:20:00.958\nAnd I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum.\n\n00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:02.958\nBut yesterday the city called them and said,\n\n00:20:02.958 --> 00:20:04.958\n\"Look, you're going to have to tear it down.\n\n00:20:04.958 --> 00:20:06.958\nBecause this can be taken for advertising,\n\n00:20:06.958 --> 00:20:08.958\nand because of the law,\n\n00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:10.958\nit has to be taken down.\"\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:13.958\nBut tell me, advertising for what?\n\n00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:15.958\nThe people I photograph\n\n00:20:15.958 --> 00:20:17.958\nwere proud to participate in the project\n\n00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:19.958\nand to have their photo in the community.\n\n00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:21.958\nBut they asked me for a promise basically.\n\n00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:25.958\nThey asked me, \"Please, make our story travel with you.\"\n\n00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:28.958\nSo I did. That's Paris.\n\n00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:30.958\nThat's Rio.\n\n00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:34.958\nIn each place, we built exhibitions with a story, and the story traveled.\n\n00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:36.958\nYou understand the full scope of the project.\n\n00:20:36.958 --> 00:20:39.958\nThat's London.\n\n00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:41.958\nNew York.\n\n00:20:41.958 --> 00:20:44.958\nAnd today, they are with you in Long Beach.\n\n00:20:45.958 --> 00:20:48.958\nAll right, recently I started a public art project\n\n00:20:48.958 --> 00:20:51.958\nwhere I don't use my artwork anymore.\n\n00:20:51.958 --> 00:20:54.958\nI use Man Ray, Helen Levitt,\n\n00:20:54.958 --> 00:20:56.958\nGiacomelli, other people's artwork.\n\n00:20:56.958 --> 00:20:59.958\nIt doesn't matter today if it's your photo or not.\n\n00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:01.958\nThe importance is what you do\n\n00:21:01.958 --> 00:21:03.958\nwith the images,\n\n00:21:03.958 --> 00:21:06.958\nthe statement it makes where it's pasted.\n\n00:21:06.958 --> 00:21:09.958\nSo for example, I pasted the photo of the minaret\n\n00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:11.958\nin Switzerland\n\n00:21:11.958 --> 00:21:15.958\na few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country.\n\n00:21:15.958 --> 00:21:21.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:21:21.958 --> 00:21:24.958\nThis image of three men wearing gas masks\n\n00:21:24.958 --> 00:21:26.958\nwas taken in Chernobyl originally,\n\n00:21:26.958 --> 00:21:29.958\nand I pasted it in Southern Italy,\n\n00:21:29.958 --> 00:21:33.958\nwhere the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground.\n\n00:21:35.958 --> 00:21:37.958\nIn some ways, art can change the world.\n\n00:21:37.958 --> 00:21:39.958\nArt is not supposed to change the world,\n\n00:21:39.958 --> 00:21:41.958\nto change practical things,\n\n00:21:41.958 --> 00:21:43.958\nbut to change perceptions.\n\n00:21:43.958 --> 00:21:45.958\nArt can change\n\n00:21:45.958 --> 00:21:47.958\nthe way we see the world.\n\n00:21:47.958 --> 00:21:50.958\nArt can create an analogy.\n\n00:21:50.958 --> 00:21:53.958\nActually the fact that art cannot change things\n\n00:21:53.958 --> 00:21:55.958\nmakes it a neutral place\n\n00:21:55.958 --> 00:21:58.958\nfor exchanges and discussions,\n\n00:21:58.958 --> 00:22:01.958\nand then enables you to change the world.\n\n00:22:01.958 --> 00:22:03.958\nWhen I do my work,\n\n00:22:03.958 --> 00:22:05.958\nI have two kinds of reactions.\n\n00:22:05.958 --> 00:22:08.958\nPeople say, \"Oh, why don't you go in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\n00:22:08.958 --> 00:22:10.958\nThey would be really useful.\"\n\n00:22:10.958 --> 00:22:13.958\nOr, \"How can we help?\"\n\n00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:16.958\nI presume that you belong to the second category,\n\n00:22:16.958 --> 00:22:18.958\nand that's good,\n\n00:22:18.958 --> 00:22:20.958\nbecause for that project,\n\n00:22:20.958 --> 00:22:22.958\nI'm going to ask you to take the photos\n\n00:22:22.958 --> 00:22:25.958\nand paste them.\n\n00:22:25.958 --> 00:22:27.958\nSo now my wish is:\n\n00:22:27.958 --> 00:22:29.958\n(mock drum roll)\n\n00:22:29.958 --> 00:22:31.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:22:32.958 --> 00:22:35.958\nI wish for you to stand up\n\n00:22:35.958 --> 00:22:38.958\nfor what you care about\n\n00:22:38.958 --> 00:22:41.958\nby participating in a global art project,\n\n00:22:41.958 --> 00:22:46.958\nand together we'll turn the world inside out.\n\n00:22:47.958 --> 00:22:49.958\nAnd this starts right now.\n\n00:22:49.958 --> 00:22:51.958\nYes, everyone in the room.\n\n00:22:51.958 --> 00:22:54.958\nEveryone watching.\n\n00:22:54.958 --> 00:22:56.958\nI wanted that wish\n\n00:22:56.958 --> 00:22:58.958\nto actually start now.\n\n00:22:58.958 --> 00:23:01.958\nSo a subject you're passionate about, a person who you want to tell their story\n\n00:23:01.958 --> 00:23:03.958\nor even your own photos --\n\n00:23:03.958 --> 00:23:05.958\ntell me what you stand for.\n\n00:23:05.958 --> 00:23:07.958\nTake the photos, the portraits,\n\n00:23:07.958 --> 00:23:10.958\nupload it -- I'll give you all the details --\n\n00:23:10.958 --> 00:23:13.958\nand I'll send you back your poster.

No one was a hero. No one was a hero. Because everyone was a hero. Everyone has done something. We all use Wikipedia. If you think of the concept of Wikipedia where everyone is collaborating on content, and at the end of the day you've built the largest encyclopedia in the world. From just an idea that sounded crazy, you have the largest encyclopedia in the world.And in the Egyptian revolution, the Revolution 2.0, everyone has contributed something, small or big. They contributed something \u2014 to bring us one of the most inspiring stories in the history of mankind when it comes to revolutions. It was actually really inspiring to see all these Egyptians completely changing. If you look at the scene, Egypt, for 30 years, had been in a downhill \u2014 going into a downhill. Everything was going bad. Everything was going wrong. We only ranked high when it comes to poverty, corruption, lack of freedom of speech, lack of political activism. Those were the achievements of our great regime. Yet, nothing was happening. And it's not because people were happy or people were not frustrated. In fact, people were extremely frustrated. But the reason why everyone was silent is what I call the psychological barrier of fear. Everyone was scared. Not everyone. There were actually a few brave Egyptians that I have to thank for being so brave \u2014 going into protests as a couple of hundred, getting beaten up and arrested. But in fact, the majority were scared. Everyone did not want really to get in trouble.A dictator cannot live without the force. They want to make people live in fear. And that psychological barrier of fear had worked for so many years, and here comes the Internet, technology, BlackBerry, SMS. It's helping all of us to connect. Platforms like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the impression that, \"Wow, I'm not alone. There are a lot of people who are frustrated.\" There are lots of people who are frustrated. There are lots of people who actually share the same dream. There are lots of people who care about their freedom. They probably have the best life in the world. They are living in happiness. They are living in their villas. They are happy. They don't have problems. But they are still feeling the pain of the Egyptian.A lot of us, we're not really happy when we see a video of an Egyptian man who's eating the trash while others are stealing billions of Egyptian pounds from the wealth of the country. The Internet has played a great role, helping these people to speak up their minds, to collaborate together, to start thinking together. It was an educational campaign.Khaled Saeed was killed in June 2010. I still remember the photo. I still remember every single detail of that photo. The photo was horrible. He was tortured, brutally tortured to death. But then what was the answer of the regime? \"He choked on a pile of hash\" \u2014 that was their answer: \"He's a criminal. He's someone who escaped from all these bad things.\" But people did not relate to this. People did not believe this. Because of the Internet, the truth prevailed and everyone knew the truth. And everyone started to think that \"this guy could be my brother.\" He was a middle-class guy. His photo was remembered by all of us.A page was created. An anonymous administrator was basically inviting people to join the page, and there was no plan. \"What are we going to do?\" \"I don't know.\" In a few days, tens of thousands of people there \u2014 angry Egyptians who were asking the ministry of interior affairs, \"Enough. Get those who killed this guy. To just bring them to justice.\" But of course, they don't listen. It was an amazing story \u2014 how everyone started feeling the ownership. Everyone was an owner in this page. People started contributing ideas. In fact, one of the most ridiculous ideas was, \"Hey, let's have a silent stand. Let's get people to go in the street, face the sea, their back to the street, dressed in black, standing up silently for one hour, doing nothing and then just leaving, going back home.\" For some people, that was like, \"Wow, silent stand. And next time it's going to be vibration.\" People were making fun of the idea. But actually when people went to the street \u2014 the first time it was thousands of people in Alexandria \u2014 it felt like \u2014 it was amazing. It was great because it connected people from the virtual world, bringing them to the real world, sharing the same dream, the same frustration, the same anger, the same desire for freedom. And they were doing this thing. But did the regime learn anything? Not really. They were actually attacking them. They were actually abusing them, despite the fact of how peaceful these guys were \u2014 they were not even protesting. And things had developed until the Tunisian revolution.This whole page was, again, managed by the people. In fact, the anonymous admin job was to collect ideas, help people to vote on them and actually tell them what they are doing. People were taking shots and photos; people were reporting violations of human rights in Egypt; people were suggesting ideas, they were actually voting on ideas, and then they were executing the ideas; people were creating videos. Everything was done by the people to the people, and that's the power of the Internet. There was no leader. The leader was everyone on that page. The Tunisian experiment, as Amir was saying, inspired all of us, showed us that there is a way. Yes we can. We can do it. We have the same problems; we can just go in the streets.And when I saw the street on the 25th, I went back and said, \"Egypt before the 25th is never going to be Egypt after the 25th. The revolution is happening. This is not the end, this is the beginning of the end.\" I was detained on the 27th night. Thank God I announced the locations and everything. But they detained me. And I'm not going to talk about my experience, because this is not about me. I was detained for 12 days, blindfolded, handcuffed. And I did not really hear anything. I did not know anything. I was not allowed to speak with anyone. And I went out. The next day I was in Tahrir. Seriously, with the amount of change I had noticed in this square, I thought it was 12 years. I never had in my mind to see this Egyptian, the amazing Egyptian. The fear is no longer fear. It's actually strength \u2014 it's power. People were so empowered. It was amazing how everyone was so empowered and now asking for their rights. Completely opposite. Extremism became tolerance.Who would [have] imagined before the 25th, if I tell you that hundreds of thousands of Christians are going to pray and tens of thousands of Muslims are going to protect them, and then hundreds of thousands of Muslims are going to pray and tens of thousands of Christians are going to protect them \u2014 this is amazing. All the stereotypes that the regime was trying to put on us through their so-called propaganda, or mainstream media, are proven wrong. This whole revolution showed us how ugly such a regime was and how great and amazing the Egyptian man, the Egyptian woman, how simple and amazing these people are whenever they have a dream.When I saw that, I went back and I wrote on Facebook. And that was a personal belief, regardless of what's going on, regardless of the details. I said that, \"We are going to win. We are going to win because we don't understand politics. We're going to win because we don't play their dirty games. We're going to win because we don't have an agenda. We're going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts. We're going to win because we have dreams. We're going to win because we are willing to stand up for our dreams.\" And that's actually what happened. We won. And that's not because of anything, but because we believed in our dream. The winning here is not the whole details of what's going to happen in the political scene. The winning is the winning of the dignity of every single Egyptian.Actually, I had this taxi driver telling me, \"Listen, I am breathing freedom. I feel that I have dignity that I have lost for so many years.\" For me that's winning, regardless of all the details.My last word to you is a statement I believe in, which Egyptians have proven to be true, that the power of the people is much stronger than the people in power.Thanks a lot.(Applause)", "id": 1086, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nThis is Revolution 2.0.\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nNo one was a hero.

This is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning. But I want to tell you, I think it's an important topic that we need to care about. State budgets are big, big money \u2014 I'll show you the numbers \u2014 and they get very little scrutiny. The understanding is very low. Many of the people involved have special interests or short-term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are. And these budgets are the key for our future; they're the key for our kids. Most education funding \u2014 whether it's K through 12, or the great universities or community colleges \u2014 most of the money for those things is coming out of these state budgets.But we have a problem. Here's the overall picture. U.S. economy is big \u2014 14.7 trillion. Now out of that pie, the government spends 36 percent. So this is combining the federal level, which is the largest, the state level and the local level. And it's really in this combined way that you get an overall sense of what's going on, because there's a lot of complex things like Medicaid and research money that flow across those boundaries. But we're spending 36 percent. Well what are we taking in? Simple business question. Answer is 26 percent. Now this leaves 10 percent deficit, sort of a mind-blowing number. And some of that, in fact, is due to the fact that we've had an economic recession. Receipts go down, some spending programs go up, but most of it is not because of that. Most of it is because of ways that the liabilities are building up and the trends, and that creates a huge challenge. In fact, this is the forecast picture. There are various things in here: I could say we might raise more revenue, or medical innovation will make the spending even higher. It is an increasingly difficult picture, even assuming the economy does quite well \u2014 probably better than it will do. This is what you see at this overall level.Now how did we get here? How could you have a problem like this? After all, at least on paper, there's this notion that these state budgets are balanced. Only one state says they don't have to balance the budget. But what this means actually is that there's a pretense. There's no real, true balancing going on, and in a sense, the games they play to hide that actually obscure the topic so much that people don't see things that are actually pretty straight-forward challenges. When Jerry Brown was elected, this was the challenge that was put to him. That is, through various gimmicks and things, a so-called balanced budget had led him to have 25 billion missing out of the 76 billion in proposed spending. Now he's put together some thoughts: About half of that he'll cut, another half, perhaps in a very complex set of steps, taxes will be approved. But even so, as you go out into those future years, various pension costs, health costs go up enough, and the revenue does not go up enough. So you get a big squeeze.What were those things that allowed us to hide this? Well, some really nice little tricks. And these were somewhat noticed. The paper said, \"It's not really balanced. It's got holes. It perpetuates deficit spending. It's riddled with gimmicks.\" And really when you get down to it, the guys at Enron never would have done this. This is so blatant, so extreme. Is anyone paying attention to some of the things these guys do? They borrow money. They're not supposed to, but they figure out a way. They make you pay more in withholding just to help their cash flow out. They sell off the assets. They defer the payments. They sell off the revenues from tobacco. And California's not unique. In fact, there's about five states that are worse and only really four states that don't face this big challenge. So it's systemic across the entire country. It really comes from the fact that certain long-term obligations \u2014 health care, where innovation makes it more expensive, early retirement and pension, where the age structure gets worse for you, and just generosity \u2014 that these mis-accounting things allow to develop over time, that you've got a problem. This is the retiree health care benefits. Three million set aside, 62 billion dollar liability \u2014 much worse than the car companies. And everybody looked at that and knew that that was headed toward a huge problem. The forecast for the medical piece alone is to go from 26 percent of the budget to 42 percent.Well what's going to give? Well in order to accommodate that, you would have to cut education spending in half. It really is this young versus the old to some degree. If you don't change that revenue picture, if you don't solve what you're doing in health care, you're going to be deinvesting in the young. The great University of California university system, the great things that have gone on, won't happen. So far it's meant layoffs, increased class sizes. Within the education community there's this discussion of, \"Should it just be the young teachers who get laid off, or the less good teachers who get laid off?\" And there's a discussion: if you're going to increase class sizes, where do you do that? How much effect does that have? And unfortunately, as you get into that, people get confused and think, well maybe you think that's okay. In fact, no, education spending should not be cut. There's ways, if it's temporary, to minimize the impact, but it's a problem. It's also really a problem for where we need to go. Technology has a role to play. Well we need money to experiment with that, to get those tools in there. There's the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness, measuring them, giving them feedback, taking videos in the classroom. That's something I think is very, very important. Well you have to allocate dollars for that system and for that incentive pay. In a situation where you have growth, you put the new money into this. Or even if you're flat, you might shift money into it. But with the type of cuts we're talking about, it will be far, far harder to get these incentives for excellence, or to move over to use technology in the new way.So what's going on? Where's the brain trust that's in error here? Well there really is no brain trust. (Laughter) It's sort of the voters. It's sort of us showing up. Just look at this spending. California will spend over 100 billion, Microsoft, 38, Google, about 19. The amount of IQ in good numeric analysis, both inside Google and Microsoft and outside, with analysts and people of various opinions \u2014 should they have spent on that? No, they wasted their money on this. What about this thing? \u2014 it really is quite phenomenal. Everybody has an opinion. There's great feedback. And the numbers are used to make decisions. If you go over the education spending and the health care spending \u2014 particularly these long-term trends \u2014 you don't have that type of involvement on a number that's more important in terms of equity, in terms of learning.So what do we need to do? We need better tools. We can get some things out on the Internet. I'm going to use my website to put up some things that will give the basic picture. We need lots more. There's a few good books, one about school spending and where the money comes from \u2014 how that's changed over time, and the challenge. We need better accounting. We need to take the fact that the current employees, the future liabilities they create, that should come out of the current budget. We need to understand why they've done the pension accounting the way they have. It should be more like private accounting. It's the gold standard. And finally, we need to really reward politicians. Whenever they say there's these long-term problems, we can't say, \"Oh, you're the messenger with bad news? We just shot you.\" In fact, there are some like these: Erskine Bowles, Alan Simpson and others, who have gone through and given proposals for this overall federal health-spending state-level problem. But in fact, their work was sort of pushed off. In fact, the week afterwards, some tax cuts were done that made the situation even worse than their assumptions. So we need these pieces.Now I think this is a solvable problem. It's a great country with lots of people. But we have to draw those people in, because this is about education. And just look at what happened with the tuitions with the University of California and project that out for another three, four, five years \u2014 it's unaffordable. And that's the kind of thing \u2014 the investment in the young \u2014 that makes us great, allows us to contribute. It allows us to do the art, the biotechnology, the software and all those magic things. And so the bottom line is we need to care about state budgets because they're critical for our kids and our future.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1087, "subtitle":

had an economic recession.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nReceipts go down,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nsome spending programs go up,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nbut most of it is not because of that.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nMost of it is because of ways\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nthat the liabilities are building up\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nand the trends,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nand that creates a huge challenge.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nIn fact, this is the forecast picture.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nThere are various things in here:\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nI could say we might raise more revenue,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nor medical innovation will make the spending even higher.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nIt is an increasingly difficult picture,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\neven assuming the economy does quite well --\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nprobably better than it will do.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nThis is what you see\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nat this overall level.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nNow how did we get here?\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nHow could you have a problem like this?\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nAfter all, at least on paper,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nthere's this notion that these state budgets are balanced.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nOnly one state says\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nthey don't have to balance the budget.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nBut what this means actually\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nis that there's a pretense.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nThere's no real, true balancing going on,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nand in a sense, the games they play to hide that\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nactually obscure the topic so much\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nthat people don't see things\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nthat are actually pretty straight-forward challenges.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nWhen Jerry Brown was elected,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nthis was the challenge that was put to him.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nThat is, through various gimmicks and things,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\na so-called balanced budget\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nhad led him to have 25 billion missing\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nout of the 76 billion in proposed spending.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nNow he's put together some thoughts:\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nAbout half of that he'll cut,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nanother half,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nperhaps in a very complex set of steps,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\ntaxes will be approved.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nBut even so,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nas you go out into those future years,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nvarious pension costs, health costs go up enough,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nand the revenue does not go up enough.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nSo you get a big squeeze.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nWhat were those things that allowed us to hide this?\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nWell, some really nice little tricks.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nAnd these were somewhat noticed.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nThe paper said, \"It's not really balanced.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nIt's got holes.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nIt perpetuates deficit spending.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nIt's riddled with gimmicks.\"\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nAnd really when you get down to it,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nthe guys at Enron never would have done this.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nThis is so blatant,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nso extreme.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nIs anyone paying attention\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nto some of the things these guys do?\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nThey borrow money.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nThey're not supposed to, but they figure out a way.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nThey make you pay more in withholding\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\njust to help their cash flow out.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nThey sell off the assets.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nThey defer the payments.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nThey sell off the revenues from tobacco.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nAnd California's not unique.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nIn fact, there's about five states that are worse\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nand only really four states\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nthat don't face this big challenge.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nSo it's systemic across the entire country.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nIt really comes from the fact\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nthat certain long-term obligations --\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nhealth care, where innovation makes it more expensive,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nearly retirement and pension, where the age structure gets worse for you,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nand just generosity --\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nthat these mis-accounting things\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nallow to develop over time,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nthat you've got a problem.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nThis is the retiree health care benefits.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nThree million set aside, 62 billion dollar liability --\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nmuch worse than the car companies.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nAnd everybody looked at that\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nand knew that that was headed toward a huge problem.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nThe forecast for the medical piece alone\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nis to go from 26 percent of the budget\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nto 42 percent.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nWell what's going to give?\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nWell in order to accommodate that,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nyou would have to cut education spending in half.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nIt really is this young versus the old\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nto some degree.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nIf you don't change that revenue picture,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nif you don't solve what you're doing in health care,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nyou're going to be deinvesting in the young.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nThe great University of California university system,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nthe great things that have gone on,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nwon't happen.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nSo far it's meant layoffs,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nincreased class sizes.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nWithin the education community there's this discussion of,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\n\"Should it just be the young teachers who get laid off,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nor the less good teachers who get laid off?\"\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nAnd there's a discussion: if you're going to increase class sizes,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nwhere do you do that? How much effect does that have?\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nAnd unfortunately, as you get into that, people get confused and think,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nwell maybe you think that's okay.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nIn fact, no, education spending should not be cut.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nThere's ways, if it's temporary,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nto minimize the impact,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nbut it's a problem.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nIt's also really a problem for where we need to go.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nTechnology has a role to play.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nWell we need money to experiment with that,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nto get those tools in there.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nThere's the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nmeasuring them, giving them feedback,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\ntaking videos in the classroom.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nThat's something I think is very, very important.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nWell you have to allocate dollars\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nfor that system\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nand for that incentive pay.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nIn a situation where you have growth,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nyou put the new money into this.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nOr even if you're flat, you might shift money into it.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nBut with the type of cuts we're talking about,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nit will be far, far harder\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nto get these incentives for excellence,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nor to move over\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nto use technology in the new way.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nSo what's going on?\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nWhere's the brain trust\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nthat's in error here?\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nWell there really is no brain trust.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nIt's sort of the voters. It's sort of us showing up.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nJust look at this spending.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nCalifornia will spend over 100 billion,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nMicrosoft, 38,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nGoogle, about 19.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nThe amount of IQ in good numeric analysis,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nboth inside Google and Microsoft\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nand outside, with analysts and people of various opinions --\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nshould they have spent on that?\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nNo, they wasted their money on this. What about this thing? --\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nit really is quite phenomenal.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nEverybody has an opinion.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nThere's great feedback.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nAnd the numbers are used to make decisions.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nIf you go over the education spending and the health care spending --\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nparticularly these long-term trends --\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nyou don't have that type of involvement\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\non a number that's more important\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nin terms of equity, in terms of learning.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nSo what do we need to do?\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nWe need better tools.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nWe can get some things out on the Internet.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nI'm going to use my website\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nto put up some things that will give the basic picture.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nWe need lots more.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nThere's a few good books,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\none about school spending and where the money comes from --\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nhow that's changed over time, and the challenge.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nWe need better accounting.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nWe need to take the fact\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nthat the current employees, the future liabilities they create,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nthat should come out of the current budget.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nWe need to understand why they've done the pension accounting\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nthe way they have.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nIt should be more like private accounting.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nIt's the gold standard.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nAnd finally, we need to really reward politicians.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nWhenever they say there's these long-term problems,\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nwe can't say, \"Oh, you're the messenger with bad news?\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nWe just shot you.\"\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nIn fact, there are some like these:\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nErskine Bowles, Alan Simpson and others,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nwho have gone through and given proposals\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nfor this overall federal health-spending state-level problem.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nBut in fact, their work was sort of pushed off.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nIn fact, the week afterwards,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nsome tax cuts were done\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nthat made the situation even worse\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nthan their assumptions.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nSo we need these pieces.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nNow I think this is a solvable problem.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nIt's a great country with lots of people.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nBut we have to draw those people in,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nbecause this is about education.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nAnd just look at what happened with the tuitions\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nwith the University of California\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nand project that out for another three, four, five years --\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nit's unaffordable.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nAnd that's the kind of thing --\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nthe investment in the young --\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nthat makes us great, allows us to contribute.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nIt allows us to do the art,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nthe biotechnology, the software\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nand all those magic things.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nAnd so the bottom line is\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nwe need to care about state budgets\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nbecause they're critical for our kids and our future.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nThank you.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Printing a human kidney", "duration": "1044", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/anthony_atala_printing_a_human_kidney", "transcript": "There's actually a major health crisis today in terms of the shortage of organs. The fact is that we're living longer. Medicine has done a much better job of making us live longer, and the problem is, as we age, our organs tend to fail more, and so currently there are not enough organs to go around. In fact, in the last 10 years, the number of patients requiring an organ has doubled, while in the same time, the actual number of transplants has barely gone up. So this is now a public health crisis.So that's where this field comes in that we call the field of regenerative medicine. It really involves many different areas. You can use, actually, scaffolds, biomaterials \u2014 they're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt \u2014 but specific materials you can actually implant in patients and they will do well and help you regenerate. Or we can use cells alone, either your very own cells or different stem cell populations. Or we can use both. We can use, actually, biomaterials and the cells together. And that's where the field is today.But it's actually not a new field. Interestingly, this is a book that was published back in 1938. It's titled \"The Culture of Organs.\" The first author, Alexis Carrel, a Nobel Prize winner. He actually devised some of the same technologies used today for suturing blood vessels, and some of the blood vessel grafts we use today were actually designed by Alexis. But I want you to note his co-author: Charles Lindbergh. That's the same Charles Lindbergh who actually spent the rest of his life working with Alexis at the Rockefeller Institute in New York in the area of the culture of organs.So if the field's been around for so long, why so few clinical advances? And that really has to do to many different challenges. But if I were to point to three challenges, the first one is actually the design of materials that could go in your body and do well over time. And many advances now, we can do that fairly readily. The second challenge was cells. We could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body. Over the last 20 years, we've basically tackled that. Many scientists can now grow many different types of cells. Plus we have stem cells. But even now, 2011, there's still certain cells that we just can't grow from the patient. Liver cells, nerve cells, pancreatic cells \u2014 we still can't grow them even today. And the third challenge is vascularity, the actual supply of blood to allow those organs or tissues to survive once we regenerate them.So we can actually use biomaterials now. This is actually a biomaterial. We can weave them, knit them, or we can make them like you see here. This is actually like a cotton candy machine. You saw the spray going in. That was like the fibers of the cotton candy creating this structure, this tubularized structure, which is a biomaterial that we can then use to help your body regenerate using your very own cells to do so. And that's exactly what we did here.This is actually a patient who [was] presented with a deceased organ, and we then created one of these smart biomaterials, and then we then used that smart biomaterial to replace and repair that patient's structure. What we did was we actually used the biomaterial as a bridge so that the cells in the organ could walk on that bridge, if you will, and help to bridge the gap to regenerate that tissue. And you see that patient now six months after with an X-ray showing you the regenerated tissue, which is fully regenerated when you analyze it under the microscope. We can also use cells alone. These are actually cells that we obtained. These are stem cells that we create from specific sources, and we can drive them to become heart cells, and they start beating in culture. So they know what to do. The cells genetically know what to do, and they start beating together. Now today, many clinical trials are using different kinds of stem cells for heart disease. So that's actually now in patients.Or if we're going to use larger structures to replace larger structures, we can then use the patient's own cells, or some cell population, and the biomaterials, the scaffolds, together. So the concept here: so if you do have a deceased or injured organ, we take a very small piece of that tissue, less than half the size of a postage stamp. We then tease the cells apart, we grow the cells outside the body. We then take a scaffold, a biomaterial \u2014 again, looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt \u2014 we then shape that material, and we then use those cells to coat that material one layer at a time \u2014 very much like baking a layer cake, if you will. We then place it in an oven-like device, and we're able to create that structure and bring it out. This is actually a heart valve that we've engineered, and you can see here, we have the structure of the heart valve and we've seeded that with cells, and then we exercise it. So you see the leaflets opening and closing \u2014 of this heart valve that's currently being used experimentally to try to get it to further studies.Another technology that we have used in patients actually involves bladders. We actually take a very small piece of the bladder from the patient \u2014 less than half the size of a postage stamp. We then grow the cells outside the body, take the scaffold, coat the scaffold with the cells \u2014 the patient's own cells, two different cell types. We then put it in this oven-like device. It has the same conditions as the human body \u2014 37 degrees centigrade, 95 percent oxygen. A few weeks later, you have your engineered organ that we're able to implant back into the patient. For these specific patients, we actually just suture these materials. We use three-dimensional imagining analysis, but we actually created these biomaterials by hand.But we now have better ways to create these structures with the cells. We use now some type of technologies, where for solid organs, for example, like the liver, what we do is we take discard livers. As you know, a lot of organs are actually discarded, not used. So we can take these liver structures, which are not going to be used, and we then put them in a washing machine-like structure that will allow the cells to be washed away. Two weeks later, you have something that looks like a liver. You can hold it like a liver, but it has no cells; it's just a skeleton of the liver. And we then can re-perfuse the liver with cells, preserving the blood vessel tree. So we actually perfuse first the blood vessel tree with the patient's own blood vessel cells, and we then infiltrate the parenchyma with the liver cells. And we now have been able just to show the creation of human liver tissue just this past month using this technology.Another technology that we've used is actually that of printing. This is actually a desktop inkjet printer, but instead of using ink, we're using cells. And you can actually see here the printhead going through and printing this structure, and it takes about 40 minutes to print this structure. And there's a 3D elevator that then actually goes down one layer at a time each time the printhead goes through. And then finally you're able to get that structure out. You can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it. And this is actually a piece of bone that I'm going to show you in this slide that was actually created with this desktop printer and implanted as you see here. That was all new bone that was implanted using these techniques.Another more advanced technology we're looking at right now, our next generation of technologies, are more sophisticated printers. This particular printer we're designing now is actually one where we print right on the patient. So what you see here \u2014 I know it sounds funny, but that's the way it works. Because in reality, what you want to do is you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound, and you have a scanner, basically like a flatbed scanner. That's what you see here on the right side. You see a scanner technology that first scans the wound on the patient and then it comes back with the printheads actually printing the layers that you require on the patients themselves.This is how it actually works. Here's the scanner going through, scanning the wound. Once it's scanned, it sends information in the correct layers of cells where they need to be. And now you're going to see here a demo of this actually being done in a representative wound. And we actually do this with a gel so that you can lift the gel material. So once those cells are on the patient they will stick where they need to be. And this is actually new technology still under development.We're also working on more sophisticated printers. Because in reality, our biggest challenge are the solid organs. I don't know if you realize this, but 90 percent of the patients on the transplant list are actually waiting for a kidney. Patients are dying every day because we don't have enough of those organs to go around. So this is more challenging \u2014 large organ, vascular, a lot of blood vessel supply, a lot of cells present. So the strategy here is \u2014 this is actually a CT scan, an X-ray \u2014 and we go layer by layer, using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and 3D reconstruction to get right down to those patient's own kidneys. We then are able to actually image those, do 360 degree rotation to analyze the kidney in its full volumetric characteristics, and we then are able to actually take this information and then scan this in a printing computerized form. So we go layer by layer through the organ, analyzing each layer as we go through the organ, and we then are able to send that information, as you see here, through the computer and actually design the organ for the patient. This actually shows the actual printer. And this actually shows that printing.In fact, we actually have the printer right here. So while we've been talking today, you can actually see the printer back here in the back stage. That's actually the actual printer right now, and that's been printing this kidney structure that you see here. It takes about seven hours to print a kidney, so this is about three hours into it now. And Dr. Kang's going to walk onstage right now, and we're actually going to show you one of these kidneys that we printed a little bit earlier today. Put a pair of gloves here. Thank you. Go backwards. So, these gloves are a little bit small on me, but here it is. You can actually see that kidney as it was printed earlier today.(Applause)Has a little bit of consistency to it. This is Dr. Kang who's been working with us on this project, and part of our team. Thank you, Dr. Kang. I appreciate it.(Applause)So this is actually a new generation. This is actually the printer that you see here onstage. And this is actually a new technology we're working on now. In reality, we now have a long history of doing this. I'm going to share with you a clip in terms of technology we have had in patients now for a while.And this is actually a very brief clip \u2014 only about 30 seconds \u2014 of a patient who actually received an organ.(Video) Luke Massella: I was really sick. I could barely get out of bed. I was missing school. It was pretty much miserable. I couldn't go out and play basketball at recess without feeling like I was going to pass out when I got back inside. I felt so sick. I was facing basically a lifetime of dialysis, and I don't even like to think about what my life would be like if I was on that. So after the surgery, life got a lot better for me. I was able to do more things. I was able to wrestle in high school. I became the captain of the team, and that was great. I was able to be a normal kid with my friends. And because they used my own cells to build this bladder, it's going to be with me. I've got it for life, so I'm all set.(Applause)Juan Enriquez: These experiments sometimes work, and it's very cool when they do. Luke, come up please.(Applause)So Luke, before last night, when's the last time you saw Tony?LM: Ten years ago, when I had my surgery \u2014 and it's really great to see him.(Laughter)(Applause)JE: And tell us a little bit about what you're doing.LM: Well right now I'm in college at the University of Connecticut. I'm a sophomore and studying communications, TV and mass media, and basically trying to live life like a normal kid, which I always wanted growing up. But it was hard to do that when I was born with spina bifida and my kidneys and bladder weren't working. I went through about 16 surgeries, and it seemed impossible to do that when I was in kidney failure when I was 10. And this surgery came along and basically made me who I am today and saved my life.(Applause)JE: And Tony's done hundreds of these?LM: What I know from, he's working really hard in his lab and coming up with crazy stuff. I know I was one of the first 10 people to have this surgery. And when I was 10, I didn't realize how amazing it was. I was a little kid, and I was like, \"Yeah. I'll have that. I'll have that surgery.\" (Laughter) All I wanted to do was to get better, and I didn't realize how amazing it really was until now that I'm older and I see the amazing things that he's doing.JE: When you got this call out of the blue \u2014 Tony's really shy, and it took a lot of convincing to get somebody as modest as Tony to allow us to bring Luke. So Luke, you go to your communications professors \u2014 you're majoring in communications \u2014 and you ask them for permission to come to TED, which might have a little bit to do with communications, and what was their reaction?LM: Most of my professors were all for it, and they said, \"Bring pictures and show me the clips online,\" and \"I'm happy for you.\" There were a couple that were a little stubborn, but I had to talk to them. I pulled them aside.JE: Well, it's an honor and a privilege to meet you. Thank you so much. (LM: Thank you so much.)JE: Thank you, Tony.(Applause)", "id": 1088, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nThere's actually a major

areas.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nYou can use, actually, scaffolds,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nbiomaterials --\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nthey're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt --\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nbut specific materials you can actually implant in patients\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nand they will do well and help you regenerate.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nOr we can use cells alone,\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\neither your very own cells\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nor different stem cell populations.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nOr we can use both.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nWe can use, actually, biomaterials\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nand the cells together.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nAnd that's where the field is today.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nBut it's actually not a new field.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nInterestingly, this is a book\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nthat was published back in 1938.\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nIt's titled \"The Culture of Organs.\"\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nThe first author, Alexis Carrel, a Nobel Prize winner.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nHe actually devised some of the same technologies\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nused today for suturing blood vessels,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nand some of the blood vessel grafts we use today\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nwere actually designed by Alexis.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nBut I want you to note his co-author:\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nCharles Lindbergh.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nThat's the same Charles Lindbergh\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nwho actually spent the rest of his life\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nworking with Alexis\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nat the Rockefeller Institute in New York\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nin the area of the culture of organs.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nSo if the field's been around for so long,\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nwhy so few clinical advances?\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nAnd that really has to do to many different challenges.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nBut if I were to point to three challenges,\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nthe first one is actually the design of materials\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nthat could go in your body\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nand do well over time.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nAnd many advances now,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nwe can do that fairly readily.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nThe second challenge was cells.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nWe could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nOver the last 20 years, we've basically tackled that.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nMany scientists can now grow many different types of cells.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nPlus we have stem cells.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nBut even now, 2011,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nthere's still certain cells that we just can't grow from the patient.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nLiver cells, nerve cells, pancreatic cells --\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nwe still can't grow them even today.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nAnd the third challenge is vascularity,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nthe actual supply of blood\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nto allow those organs or tissues to survive\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nonce we regenerate them.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nSo we can actually use biomaterials now.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nThis is actually a biomaterial.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nWe can weave them, knit them, or we can make them like you see here.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nThis is actually like a cotton candy machine.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nYou saw the spray going in.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nThat was like the fibers of the cotton candy\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\ncreating this structure, this tubularized structure,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nwhich is a biomaterial\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nthat we can then use\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nto help your body regenerate\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nusing your very own cells to do so.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nAnd that's exactly what we did here.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nThis is actually a patient\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nwho [was] presented with a deceased organ,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nand we then created one of these smart biomaterials,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nand then we then used that smart biomaterial\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nto replace and repair\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nthat patient's structure.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nWhat we did was we actually\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nused the biomaterial as a bridge\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nso that the cells in the organ\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\ncould walk on that bridge, if you will,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nand help to bridge the gap\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nto regenerate that tissue.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nAnd you see that patient now six months after\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nwith an X-ray showing you the regenerated tissue,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nwhich is fully regenerated\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nwhen you analyze it under the microscope.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nWe can also use cells alone.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nThese are actually cells that we obtained.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nThese are stem cells that we create from specific sources,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nand we can drive them to become heart cells,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nand they start beating in culture.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nSo they know what to do.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nThe cells genetically know what to do,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nand they start beating together.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nNow today, many clinical trials\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nare using different kinds of stem cells\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nfor heart disease.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nSo that's actually now in patients.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nOr if we're going to use larger structures\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nto replace larger structures,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nwe can then use the patient's own cells,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nor some cell population,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nand the biomaterials,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nthe scaffolds, together.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nSo the concept here:\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nso if you do have a deceased or injured organ,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nwe take a very small piece of that tissue,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nless than half the size of a postage stamp.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nWe then tease the cells apart,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nwe grow the cells outside the body.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nWe then take a scaffold, a biomaterial --\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nagain, looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt --\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nwe then shape that material,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nand we then use those cells to coat that material\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\none layer at a time --\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nvery much like baking a layer cake, if you will.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nWe then place it in an oven-like device,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nand we're able to create that structure\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nand bring it out.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nThis is actually a heart valve\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nthat we've engineered,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nand you can see here, we have the structure of the heart valve\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nand we've seeded that with cells,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nand then we exercise it.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nSo you see the leaflets opening and closing --\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nof this heart valve\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nthat's currently being used experimentally\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nto try to get it to further studies.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nAnother technology\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nthat we have used in patients\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nactually involves bladders.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nWe actually take a very small piece of the bladder from the patient --\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nless than half the size of a postage stamp.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nWe then grow the cells outside the body,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\ntake the scaffold, coat the scaffold with the cells --\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nthe patient's own cells, two different cell types.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nWe then put it in this oven-like device.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nIt has the same conditions as the human body --\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\n37 degrees centigrade, 95 percent oxygen.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nA few weeks later, you have your engineered organ\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nthat we're able to implant back into the patient.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nFor these specific patients, we actually just suture these materials.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nWe use three-dimensional imagining analysis,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nbut we actually created these biomaterials by hand.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nBut we now have better ways\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nto create these structures with the cells.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nWe use now some type of technologies,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nwhere for solid organs, for example,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nlike the liver,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nwhat we do is we take discard livers.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nAs you know, a lot of organs are actually discarded, not used.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nSo we can take these liver structures,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nwhich are not going to be used,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nand we then put them in a washing machine-like structure\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nthat will allow the cells to be washed away.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nTwo weeks later,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nyou have something that looks like a liver.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nYou can hold it like a liver,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nbut it has no cells; it's just a skeleton of the liver.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nAnd we then can re-perfuse the liver with cells,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\npreserving the blood vessel tree.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nSo we actually perfuse first the blood vessel tree\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nwith the patient's own blood vessel cells,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nand we then infiltrate the parenchyma with the liver cells.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nAnd we now have been able just to show\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nthe creation of human liver tissue\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\njust this past month\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nusing this technology.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAnother technology that we've used\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nis actually that of printing.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nThis is actually a desktop inkjet printer,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nbut instead of using ink,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nwe're using cells.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAnd you can actually see here the printhead\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\ngoing through and printing this structure,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nand it takes about 40 minutes to print this structure.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nAnd there's a 3D elevator\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nthat then actually goes down one layer at a time\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\neach time the printhead goes through.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nAnd then finally you're able to get that structure out.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nYou can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd this is actually a piece of bone\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nthat I'm going to show you in this slide\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nthat was actually created with this desktop printer\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nand implanted as you see here.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nThat was all new bone that was implanted\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nusing these techniques.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nAnother more advanced technology we're looking at right now,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nour next generation of technologies,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nare more sophisticated printers.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nThis particular printer we're designing now\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nis actually one where we print right on the patient.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nSo what you see here --\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nI know it sounds funny,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nbut that's the way it works.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nBecause in reality, what you want to do\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nis you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nand you have a scanner,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nbasically like a flatbed scanner.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nThat's what you see here on the right side.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nYou see a scanner technology\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nthat first scans the wound on the patient\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand then it comes back with the printheads\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nactually printing the layers that you require\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\non the patients themselves.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nThis is how it actually works.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nHere's the scanner going through,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nscanning the wound.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nOnce it's scanned,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nit sends information in the correct layers of cells\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nwhere they need to be.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nAnd now you're going to see here\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\na demo of this actually being done\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nin a representative wound.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nAnd we actually do this with a gel so that you can lift the gel material.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nSo once those cells are on the patient\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nthey will stick where they need to be.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nAnd this is actually new technology\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nstill under development.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nWe're also working on more sophisticated printers.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nBecause in reality, our biggest challenge\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nare the solid organs.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nI don't know if you realize this,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nbut 90 percent of the patients on the transplant list\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nare actually waiting for a kidney.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nPatients are dying every day\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nbecause we don't have enough of those organs to go around.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nSo this is more challenging --\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nlarge organ, vascular,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\na lot of blood vessel supply,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\na lot of cells present.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nSo the strategy here is --\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nthis is actually a CT scan, an X-ray --\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nand we go layer by layer,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nusing computerized morphometric imaging analysis\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nand 3D reconstruction\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nto get right down to those patient's own kidneys.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nWe then are able to actually image those,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\ndo 360 degree rotation\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nto analyze the kidney\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nin its full volumetric characteristics,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nand we then are able\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nto actually take this information\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nand then scan this\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nin a printing computerized form.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nSo we go layer by layer through the organ,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nanalyzing each layer as we go through the organ,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nand we then are able to send that information, as you see here,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nthrough the computer\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nand actually design the organ\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nfor the patient.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nThis actually shows the actual printer.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nAnd this actually shows that printing.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nIn fact, we actually have the printer right here.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nSo while we've been talking today,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nyou can actually see the printer\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nback here in the back stage.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nThat's actually the actual printer right now,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nand that's been printing this kidney structure\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nthat you see here.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nIt takes about seven hours to print a kidney,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nso this is about three hours into it now.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nAnd Dr. Kang's going to walk onstage right now,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nand we're actually going to show you one of these kidneys\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nthat we printed a little bit earlier today.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nPut a pair of gloves here.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nThank you.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nGo backwards.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nSo, these gloves are a little bit small on me, but here it is.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nYou can actually see that kidney\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nas it was printed earlier today.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:55.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nHas a little bit of consistency to it.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nThis is Dr. Kang who's been working with us on this project,\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nand part of our team.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nThank you, Dr. Kang. I appreciate it.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:12.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nSo this is actually a new generation.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nThis is actually the printer that you see here onstage.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nAnd this is actually a new technology we're working on now.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nIn reality, we now have a long history of doing this.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nI'm going to share with you a clip\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nin terms of technology we have had in patients now for a while.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nAnd this is actually a very brief clip --\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nonly about 30 seconds --\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nof a patient who actually received an organ.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\n(Video) Luke Massella: I was really sick. I could barely get out of bed.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nI was missing school. It was pretty much miserable.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nI couldn't go out\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nand play basketball at recess\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nwithout feeling like I was going to pass out\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nwhen I got back inside.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nI felt so sick.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nI was facing basically a lifetime of dialysis,\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nand I don't even like to think about what my life would be like\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nif I was on that.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nSo after the surgery,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nlife got a lot better for me.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nI was able to do more things.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nI was able to wrestle in high school.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nI became the captain of the team, and that was great.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nI was able to be a normal kid with my friends.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nAnd because they used my own cells to build this bladder,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nit's going to be with me.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nI've got it for life, so I'm all set.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:59.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nJuan Enriquez: These experiments sometimes work,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nand it's very cool when they do.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nLuke, come up please.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:25.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nSo Luke, before last night,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nwhen's the last time you saw Tony?\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nLM: Ten years ago, when I had my surgery --\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nand it's really great to see him.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:42.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nJE: And tell us a little bit about what you're doing.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nLM: Well right now I'm in college at the University of Connecticut.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nI'm a sophomore and studying communications, TV and mass media,\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nand basically trying to live life like a normal kid,\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nwhich I always wanted growing up.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nBut it was hard to do that when I was born with spina bifida\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nand my kidneys and bladder weren't working.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nI went through about 16 surgeries,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nand it seemed impossible to do that\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nwhen I was in kidney failure when I was 10.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nAnd this surgery came along\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nand basically made me who I am today\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nand saved my life.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:25.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nJE: And Tony's done hundreds of these?\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nLM: What I know from, he's working really hard in his lab\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nand coming up with crazy stuff.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nI know I was one of the first 10 people to have this surgery.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nAnd when I was 10, I didn't realize how amazing it was.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nI was a little kid, and I was like,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\n\"Yeah.

I was raised on \"Free to be you and me\" \u2014 (cheering) hip-hop \u2014 not as many woohoos for hip-hop in the house. Thank you. Thank you for hip-hop \u2014 and Anita Hill. (Cheering) My parents were radicals \u2014 (Laughter) who became, well, grown-ups. My dad facetiously says, \"We wanted to save the world, and instead we just got rich.\" We actually just got \"middle class\" in Colorado Springs, Colorado, but you get the picture. I was raised with a very heavy sense of unfinished legacy.At this ripe old age of 30, I've been thinking a lot about what it means to grow up in this horrible, beautiful time, and I've decided, for me, it's been a real journey and paradox. The first paradox is that growing up is about rejecting the past and then promptly reclaiming it. Feminism was the water I grew up in. When I was just a little girl, my mom started what is now the longest-running women's film festival in the world. So while other kids were watching sitcoms and cartoons, I was watching very esoteric documentaries made by and about women. You can see how this had an influence. But she was not the only feminist in the house.My dad actually resigned from the male-only business club in my hometown because he said he would never be part of an organization that would one day welcome his son, but not his daughter. (Applause) He's actually here today. (Applause) The trick here is my brother would become an experimental poet, not a businessman, but the intention was really good.(Laughter)In any case, I didn't readily claim the feminist label, even though it was all around me, because I associated it with my mom's women's groups, her swishy skirts and her shoulder pads \u2014 none of which had much cachet in the hallways of Palmer High School where I was trying to be cool at the time. But I suspected there was something really important about this whole feminism thing, so I started covertly tiptoeing into my mom's bookshelves and picking books off and reading them \u2014 never, of course, admitting that I was doing so. I didn't actually claim the feminist label until I went to Barnard College and I heard Amy Richards and Jennifer Baumgardner speak for the first time. They were the co-authors of a book called \"Manifesta.\" So what very profound epiphany, you might ask, was responsible for my feminist click moment? Fishnet stockings. Jennifer Baumgardner was wearing them. I thought they were really hot. I decided, okay, I can claim the feminist label. Now I tell you this \u2014 I tell you this at the risk of embarrassing myself, because I think part of the work of feminism is to admit that aesthetics, that beauty, that fun do matter. There are lots of very modern political movements that have caught fire in no small part because of cultural hipness. Anyone heard of these two guys as an example?So my feminism is very indebted to my mom's, but it looks very different. My mom says, \"patriarchy.\" I say, \"intersectionality.\" So race, class, gender, ability, all of these things go into our experiences of what it means to be a woman. Pay equity? Yes. Absolutely a feminist issue. But for me, so is immigration. (Applause) Thank you. My mom says, \"Protest march.\" I say, \"Online organizing.\" I co-edit, along with a collective of other super-smart, amazing women, a site called Feministing.com. We are the most widely read feminist publication ever, and I tell you this because I think it's really important to see that there's a continuum.Feminist blogging is basically the 21st century version of consciousness raising. But we also have a straightforward political impact. Feministing has been able to get merchandise pulled off the shelves of Walmart. We got a misogynist administrator sending us hate-mail fired from a Big Ten school. And one of our biggest successes is we get mail from teenage girls in the middle of Iowa who say, \"I Googled Jessica Simpson and stumbled on your site. I realized feminism wasn't about man-hating and Birkenstocks.\" So we're able to pull in the next generation in a totally new way.My mom says, \"Gloria Steinem.\" I say, \"Samhita Mukhopadhyay, Miriam Perez, Ann Friedman, Jessica Valenti, Vanessa Valenti, and on and on and on and on.\" We don't want one hero. We don't want one icon. We don't want one face. We are thousands of women and men across this country doing online writing, community organizing, changing institutions from the inside out \u2014 all continuing the incredible work that our mothers and grandmothers started. Thank you.(Applause)Which brings me to the second paradox: sobering up about our smallness and maintaining faith in our greatness all at once. Many in my generation \u2014 because of well-intentioned parenting and self-esteem education \u2014 were socialized to believe that we were special little snowflakes \u2014 (Laughter) who were going to go out and save the world. These are three words many of us were raised with. We walk across graduation stages, high on our overblown expectations, and when we float back down to earth, we realize we don't know what the heck it means to actually save the world anyway. The mainstream media often paints my generation as apathetic, and I think it's much more accurate to say we are deeply overwhelmed. And there's a lot to be overwhelmed about, to be fair \u2014 an environmental crisis, wealth disparity in this country unlike we've seen since 1928, and globally, a totally immoral and ongoing wealth disparity. Xenophobia's on the rise. The trafficking of women and girls. It's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed.I experienced this firsthand myself when I graduated from Barnard College in 2002. I was fired up; I was ready to make a difference. I went out and I worked at a non-profit, I went to grad school, I phone-banked, I protested, I volunteered, and none of it seemed to matter. And on a particularly dark night of December of 2004, I sat down with my family, and I said that I had become very disillusioned. I admitted that I'd actually had a fantasy \u2014 kind of a dark fantasy \u2014 of writing a letter about everything that was wrong with the world and then lighting myself on fire on the White House steps. My mom took a drink of her signature Sea Breeze, her eyes really welled with tears, and she looked right at me and she said, \"I will not stand for your desperation.\" She said, \"You are smarter, more creative and more resilient than that.\"Which brings me to my third paradox. Growing up is about aiming to succeed wildly and being fulfilled by failing really well. (Laughter) (Applause) There's a writer I've been deeply influenced by, Parker Palmer, and he writes that many of us are often whiplashed \"between arrogant overestimation of ourselves and a servile underestimation of ourselves.\" You may have guessed by now, I did not light myself on fire. I did what I know to do in desperation, which is write. I wrote the book I needed to read. I wrote a book about eight incredible people all over this country doing social justice work. I wrote about Nia Martin-Robinson, the daughter of Detroit and two civil rights activists, who's dedicating her life to environmental justice. I wrote about Emily Apt who initially became a caseworker in the welfare system because she decided that was the most noble thing she could do, but quickly learned, not only did she not like it, but she wasn't really good at it. Instead, what she really wanted to do was make films. So she made a film about the welfare system and had a huge impact. I wrote about Maricela Guzman, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, who joined the military so she could afford college. She was actually sexually assaulted in boot camp and went on to co-organize a group called the Service Women's Action Network.What I learned from these people and others was that I couldn't judge them based on their failure to meet their very lofty goals. Many of them are working in deeply intractable systems \u2014 the military, congress, the education system, etc. But what they managed to do within those systems was be a humanizing force. And at the end of the day, what could possibly be more important than that? Cornel West says, \"Of course it's a failure. But how good a failure is it?\" This isn't to say we give up our wildest, biggest dreams. It's to say we operate on two levels. On one, we really go after changing these broken systems of which we find ourselves a part. But on the other, we root our self-esteem in the daily acts of trying to make one person's day more kind, more just, etc.So when I was a little girl, I had a couple of very strange habits. One of them was I used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home, and I would suck the thumb of my left hand and hold my mom's cold toes with my right hand. (Laughter) I was listening to her talk on the phone, which she did a lot. She was talking about board meetings, she was founding peace organizations, she was coordinating carpools, she was consoling friends \u2014 all these daily acts of care and creativity. And surely, at three and four years old, I was listening to the soothing sound of her voice, but I think I was also getting my first lesson in activist work.The activists I interviewed had nothing in common, literally, except for one thing, which was that they all cited their mothers as their most looming and important activist influences. So often, particularly at a young age, we look far afield for our models of the meaningful life, and sometimes they're in our own kitchens, talking on the phone, making us dinner, doing all that keeps the world going around and around. My mom and so many women like her have taught me that life is not about glory, or certainty, or security even. It's about embracing the paradox. It's about acting in the face of overwhelm. And it's about loving people really well. And at the end of the day, these things make for a lifetime of challenge and reward.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1089, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nSo I was born\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:15.958\non the last day\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nof the last year of the '70s.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nI was raised on \"Free to be you and me\" --\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\n(cheering)\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nhip-hop --\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nnot as many woohoos for hip-hop in the house.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nThank you.

--> 00:02:24.958\neven though it was all around me,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nbecause I associated it with my mom's women's groups,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nher swishy skirts and her shoulder pads --\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nnone of which had much cachet\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nin the hallways of Palmer High School\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nwhere I was trying to be cool at the time.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nBut I suspected there was something really important\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nabout this whole feminism thing,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nso I started covertly tiptoeing into my mom's bookshelves\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nand picking books off and reading them --\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nnever, of course, admitting that I was doing so.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nI didn't actually claim the feminist label\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nuntil I went to Barnard College\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nand I heard Amy Richards and Jennifer Baumgardner speak for the first time.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nThey were the co-authors of a book called \"Manifesta.\"\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nSo what very profound epiphany, you might ask,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nwas responsible for my feminist click moment?\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nFishnet

I can claim the feminist label.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nNow I tell you this --\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nI tell you this at the risk of embarrassing myself,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nbecause I think part of the work of feminism\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nis to admit that aesthetics, that beauty,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nthat fun do matter.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nThere are lots of very modern political movements\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nthat have caught fire in no small part\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nbecause of cultural hipness.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnyone heard of these two guys as an example?\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nSo my feminism is very indebted to my mom's,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nbut it looks very different.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nMy mom says, \"patriarchy.\"\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nI say, \"intersectionality.\"\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nSo race, class, gender, ability,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nall of these things go into our experiences\n\n00:03:50.958 -->

creative\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nand more resilient than that.\"\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nWhich brings me to my third paradox.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nGrowing up is about aiming to succeed wildly\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nand being fulfilled by failing really well.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nThere's a writer I've been deeply influenced by, Parker Palmer,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nand he writes that many of us are often whiplashed\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\n\"between arrogant overestimation of ourselves\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nand a servile underestimation of ourselves.\"\n\n00:08:03.958 -->

write.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nI wrote the book I needed to read.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nI wrote a book about eight incredible people\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nall over this country\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\ndoing social justice work.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nI wrote about Nia Martin-Robinson,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nthe daughter of Detroit and two civil rights activists,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nwho's dedicating her life\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nto environmental justice.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nI wrote about Emily Apt\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nwho initially became a caseworker in the welfare system\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nbecause she decided that was the most noble thing she could do,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nbut quickly learned, not only did she not like it,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nbut she wasn't really good at it.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nInstead, what she really wanted to do was make films.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nSo she made a film about the welfare system\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nand had a huge impact.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nI wrote about Maricela Guzman, the daughter of Mexican immigrants,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nwho joined the military so she could afford college.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nShe was actually sexually assaulted in boot camp\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nand went on to co-organize a group\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\ncalled the Service Women's Action Network.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nWhat I learned from these people and others\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nwas that I couldn't judge them\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nbased on their failure to meet their very lofty goals.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nMany of them are working in deeply intractable systems --\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nthe military, congress,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nthe education system, etc.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nBut what they managed to do within those systems\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nwas be a humanizing force.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nAnd at the end of the day,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nwhat could possibly be more important than that?\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nCornel West says, \"Of course it's a failure.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nBut how good a failure is it?\"\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nThis isn't to say we give up our wildest, biggest dreams.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nIt's to say we operate on two levels.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nOn one,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nwe really go after changing these broken systems\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nof which we find ourselves a part.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nBut on the other, we root our self-esteem\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nin the daily acts of trying to make one person's day\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nmore kind, more just, etc.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nSo when I was a little girl,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nI had a couple of very strange habits.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nOne of them was\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nI used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home,\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nand I would suck the thumb of my left hand\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nand hold my mom's cold toes with my right hand.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nI was listening to her talk on the phone, which she did a lot.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nShe was talking about board meetings,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nshe was founding peace organizations,\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nshe was coordinating carpools, she was consoling friends --\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nall these daily acts of care and creativity.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nAnd surely, at three and four years old,\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nI was listening to the soothing sound of her voice,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nbut I think I was also getting my first lesson in activist work.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nThe activists I interviewed\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nhad nothing in common, literally, except for one thing,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nwhich was that they all cited their mothers\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nas their most looming and important\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nactivist influences.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nSo often, particularly at a young age,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nwe look far afield\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nfor our models of the meaningful life,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nand sometimes they're in our own kitchens,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\ntalking on the phone, making us dinner,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:49.958\ndoing all that keeps the world going around and around.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nMy mom and so many women like her\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nhave taught me that life is not about glory,\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nor certainty, or security even.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nIt's about embracing the paradox.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nIt's about acting in the face of overwhelm.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nAnd it's about loving people really well.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nAnd at the end of the day,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nthese things make for a lifetime\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nof challenge and reward.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nThank you.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Let's use video to reinvent education", "duration": "1227", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/salman_khan_let_s_use_video_to_reinvent_education", "transcript": "Khan Academy is most known for its collection of videos, so before I go any further, let me show you a little bit of a montage.(Video) Salman Khan: So the hypotenuse is now going to be five. This animal's fossils are only found in this area of South America \u2014 a nice clean band here \u2014 and this part of Africa. We can integrate over the surface, and the notation usually is a capital sigma. National Assembly: They create the Committee of Public Safety, which sounds like a very nice committee. Notice, this is an aldehyde, and it's an alcohol. Start differentiating into effector and memory cells. A galaxy. Hey! There's another galaxy. Oh, look! There's another galaxy. And for dollars, is their 30 million, plus the 20 million dollars from the American manufacturer. If this does not blow your mind, then you have no emotion.(Laughter)(Applause)(Live) SK: We now have on the order of 2,200 videos, covering everything from basic arithmetic, all the way to vector calculus, and some of the stuff that you saw up there. We have a million students a month using the site, watching on the order of 100 to 200,000 videos a day. But what we're going to talk about in this is how we're going to the next level. But before I do that, I want to talk a little bit about really just how I got started. And some of you all might know, about five years ago, I was an analyst at a hedge fund, and I was in Boston, and I was tutoring my cousins in New Orleans, remotely. And I started putting the first YouTube videos up, really just as a kind of nice-to-have, just kind of a supplement for my cousins, something that might give them a refresher or something.And as soon as I put those first YouTube videos up, something interesting happened. Actually, a bunch of interesting things happened. The first was the feedback from my cousins. They told me that they preferred me on YouTube than in person.(Laughter)And once you get over the backhanded nature of that, there was actually something very profound there. They were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cousin to their cousin. At first it's very unintuitive, but when you think about it from their point of view, it makes a ton of sense. You have this situation where now they can pause and repeat their cousin, without feeling like they're wasting my time. If they have to review something that they should have learned a couple of weeks ago, or maybe a couple of years ago, they don't have to be embarrassed and ask their cousin. They can just watch those videos; if they're bored, they can go ahead. They can watch at their own time and pace. Probably the least-appreciated aspect of this is the notion that the very first time that you're trying to get your brain around a new concept, the very last thing you need is another human being saying, \"Do you understand this?\" And that's what was happening with the interaction with my cousins before, and now they can just do it in the intimacy of their own room.The other thing that happened is \u2014 I put them on YouTube just \u2014 I saw no reason to make it private, so I let other people watch it, and then people started stumbling on it, and I started getting some comments and some letters and all sorts of feedback from random people around the world. These are just a few. This is actually from one of the original calculus videos. Someone wrote it on YouTube, it was a YouTube comment: \"First time I smiled doing a derivative.\"(Laughter)Let's pause here. This person did a derivative, and then they smiled.(Laughter)In response to that same comment \u2014 this is on the thread, you can go on YouTube and look at the comments \u2014 someone else wrote: \"Same thing here. I actually got a natural high and a good mood for the entire day, since I remember seeing all of this matrix text in class, and here I'm all like, 'I know kung fu.'\"(Laughter)We get a lot of feedback along those lines. This clearly was helping people. But then, as the viewership kept growing and kept growing, I started getting letters from people, and it was starting to become clear that it was more than just a nice-to-have. This is just an excerpt from one of those letters: \"My 12 year-old son has autism, and has had a terrible time with math. We have tried everything, viewed everything, bought everything. We stumbled on your video on decimals, and it got through. Then we went on to the dreaded fractions. Again, he got it. We could not believe it. He is so excited.\" And so you can imagine, here I was, an analyst at a hedge fund \u2014 it was very strange for me to do something of social value.(Laughter)(Applause)But I was excited, so I kept going. And then a few other things started to dawn on me; that not only would it help my cousins right now, or these people who were sending letters, but that this content will never grow old, that it could help their kids or their grandkids. If Isaac Newton had done YouTube videos on calculus, I wouldn't have to.(Laughter)Assuming he was good. We don't know.(Laughter)The other thing that happened \u2014 and even at this point, I said, \"OK, maybe it's a good supplement. It's good for motivated students. It's good for maybe home-schoolers.\" But I didn't think it would somehow penetrate the classroom. Then I started getting letters from teachers, and the teachers would write, saying, \"We've used your videos to flip the classroom. You've given the lectures, so now what we do \u2014\" And this could happen in every classroom in America tomorrow \u2014 \"what I do is I assign the lectures for homework, and what used to be homework, I now have the students doing in the classroom.\"And I want to pause here \u2014(Applause)I want to pause here, because there's a couple of interesting things. One, when those teachers are doing that, there's the obvious benefit \u2014 the benefit that now their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did, they can pause, repeat at their own pace, at their own time. But the more interesting thing \u2014 and this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom \u2014 by removing the one-size-fits-all lecture from the classroom, and letting students have a self-paced lecture at home, then when you go to the classroom, letting them do work, having the teacher walk around, having the peers actually be able to interact with each other, these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom. They took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience \u2014 30 kids with their fingers on their lips, not allowed to interact with each other. A teacher, no matter how good, has to give this one-size-fits-all lecture to 30 students \u2014 blank faces, slightly antagonistic \u2014 and now it's a human experience, now they're actually interacting with each other.So once the Khan Academy \u2014 I quit my job, and we turned into a real organization \u2014 we're a not-for-profit \u2014 the question is, how do we take this to the next level? How do we take what those teachers were doing to its natural conclusion? And so, what I'm showing over here, these are actual exercises that I started writing for my cousins. The ones I started were much more primitive. This is a more competent version of it. But the paradigm here is, we'll generate as many questions as you need, until you get that concept, until you get 10 in a row. And the Khan Academy videos are there. You get hints, the actual steps for that problem, if you don't know how to do it. The paradigm here seems like a very simple thing: 10 in a row, you move on. But it's fundamentally different than what's happening in classrooms right now.In a traditional classroom, you have homework, lecture, homework, lecture, and then you have a snapshot exam. And that exam, whether you get a 70 percent, an 80 percent, a 90 percent or a 95 percent, the class moves on to the next topic. And even that 95 percent student \u2014 what was the five percent they didn't know? Maybe they didn't know what happens when you raise something to the zeroth power. Then you build on that in the next concept. That's analogous to \u2014 imagine learning to ride a bicycle. Maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time, and I give you a bicycle for two weeks, then I come back after two weeks, and say, \"Well, let's see. You're having trouble taking left turns. You can't quite stop. You're an 80 percent bicyclist.\" So I put a big \"C\" stamp on your forehead \u2014(Laughter)and then I say, \"Here's a unicycle.\"(Laughter)But as ridiculous as that sounds, that's exactly what's happening in our classrooms right now. And the idea is you fast forward and good students start failing algebra all of the sudden, and start failing calculus all of the sudden, despite being smart, despite having good teachers, and it's usually because they have these Swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation. So our model is: learn math the way you'd learn anything, like riding a bicycle. Stay on that bicycle. Fall off that bicycle. Do it as long as necessary, until you have mastery. The traditional model, it penalizes you for experimentation and failure, but it does not expect mastery. We encourage you to experiment. We encourage you to fail. But we do expect mastery.This is just another one of the modules. This is trigonometry. This is shifting and reflecting functions. And they all fit together. We have about 90 of these right now. You can go to the site right now, it's all free, not trying to sell anything. But the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map. That top node right there, that's literally single-digit addition, it's like one plus one is equal to two. The paradigm is, once you get 10 in a row on that, it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules.Further down the knowledge map, we're getting into more advanced arithmetic. Further down, you start getting into pre-algebra and early algebra. Further down, you start getting into algebra one, algebra two, a little bit of precalculus. And the idea is, from this we can actually teach everything \u2014 well, everything that can be taught in this type of a framework. So you can imagine \u2014 and this is what we are working on \u2014 from this knowledge map, you have logic, you have computer programming, you have grammar, you have genetics, all based off of that core of, if you know this and that, now you're ready for this next concept. Now that can work well for an individual learner, and I encourage you to do it with your kids, but I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself. It'll change what happens at the dinner table.But what we want to do is use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about. And so what I'm showing you here, this is data from a pilot in the Los Altos school district, where they took two fifth-grade classes and two seventh-grade classes, and completely gutted their old math curriculum. These kids aren't using textbooks, or getting one-size-fits-all lectures. They're doing Khan Academy, that software, for roughly half of their math class. I want to be clear: we don't view this as a complete math education. What it does is \u2014 this is what's happening in Los Altos \u2014 it frees up time \u2014 it's the blocking and tackling, making sure you know how to move through a system of equations, and it frees up time for the simulations, for the games, for the mechanics, for the robot-building, for the estimating how high that hill is based on its shadow.And so the paradigm is the teacher walks in every day, every kid works at their own pace \u2014 this is actually a live dashboard from the Los Altos school district \u2014 and they look at this dashboard. Every row is a student. Every column is one of those concepts. Green means the student's already proficient. Blue means they're working on it \u2014 no need to worry. Red means they're stuck. And what the teacher does is literally just say, \"Let me intervene on the red kids.\" Or even better, \"Let me get one of the green kids, who are already proficient in that concept, to be the first line of attack, and actually tutor their peer.\"(Applause)Now, I come from a very data-centric reality, so we don't want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions: \"What don't you understand? What do you understand?\" and all the rest. So our paradigm is to arm teachers with as much data as possible \u2014 data that, in any other field, is expected, in finance, marketing, manufacturing \u2014 so the teachers can diagnose what's wrong with the students so they can make their interaction as productive as possible. Now teachers know exactly what the students have been up to, how long they've spent each day, what videos they've watched, when did they pause the videos, what did they stop watching, what exercises are they using, what have they focused on? The outer circle shows what exercises they were focused on. The inner circle shows the videos they're focused on. The data gets pretty granular, so you can see the exact problems the student got right or wrong. Red is wrong, blue is right. The leftmost question is the first one the student attempted. They watched the video over there. And you can see, eventually they were able to get 10 in a row. It's almost like you can see them learning over those last 10 problems. They also got faster \u2014 the height is how long it took them.When you talk about self-paced learning, it makes sense for everyone \u2014 in education-speak, \"differentiated learning\" \u2014 but it's kind of crazy, what happens when you see it in a classroom. Because every time we've done this, in every classroom we've done, over and over again, if you go five days into it, there's a group of kids who've raced ahead and a group who are a little bit slower. In a traditional model, in a snapshot assessment, you say, \"These are the gifted kids, these are the slow kids. Maybe they should be tracked differently. Maybe we should put them in different classes.\" But when you let students work at their own pace \u2014 we see it over and over again \u2014 you see students who took a little bit extra time on one concept or the other, but once they get through that concept, they just race ahead. And so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago, you now would think are gifted. And we're seeing it over and over again. It makes you really wonder how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from were really just due to a coincidence of time.Now as valuable as something like this is in a district like Los Altos, our goal is to use technology to humanize, not just in Los Altos, but on a global scale, what's happening in education. And that brings up an interesting point. A lot of the effort in humanizing the classroom is focused on student-to-teacher ratios. In our mind, the relevant metric is: student-to-valuable-human-time- with-the-teacher ratio. So in a traditional model, most of the teacher's time is spent doing lectures and grading and whatnot. Maybe five percent of their time is sitting next to students and working with them. Now, 100 percent of their time is. So once again, using technology, not just flipping the classroom, you're humanizing the classroom, I'd argue, by a factor of five or 10.As valuable as that is in Los Altos, imagine what it does to the adult learner, who's embarrassed to go back and learn stuff they should have known before going back to college. Imagine what it does to a street kid in Calcutta, who has to help his family during the day, and that's the reason he or she can't go to school. Now they can spend two hours a day and remediate, or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed about what they do or don't know. Now imagine what happens where \u2014 we talked about the peers teaching each other inside of a classroom. But this is all one system. There's no reason why you can't have that peer-to-peer tutoring beyond that one classroom. Imagine what happens if that student in Calcutta all of the sudden can tutor your son, or your son can tutor that kid in Calcutta. And I think what you'll see emerging is this notion of a global one-world classroom. And that's essentially what we're trying to build.Thank you.(Applause)Bill Gates: I'll ask about two or three questions.Salman Khan: Oh, OK.(Applause continues)(Applause ends)BG: I've seen some things you're doing in the system, that have to do with motivation and feedback \u2014 energy points, merit badges. Tell me what you're thinking there.SK: Oh yeah. No, we have an awesome team working on it. I have to be clear, it's not just me anymore. I'm still doing all the videos, but we have a rock-star team doing the software. We've put a bunch of game mechanics in there, where you get badges, we're going to start having leader boards by area, you get points. It's actually been pretty interesting. Just the wording of the badging, or how many points you get for doing something, we see on a system-wide basis, like tens of thousands of fifth-graders or sixth-graders going one direction or another, depending what badge you give them.(Laughter)BG: And the collaboration you're doing with Los Altos, how did that come about?SK: Los Altos, it was kind of crazy. Once again, I didn't expect it to be used in classrooms. Someone from their board came and said, \"What would you do if you had carte Blanche in a classroom?\" I said, \"Well, every student would work at their own pace, on something like this, we'd give a dashboard.\" They said, \"This is kind of radical. We have to think about it.\" Me and the rest of the team were like, \"They're never going to want to do this.\" But literally the next day they were like, \"Can you start in two weeks?\"(Laughter)BG: So fifth-grade math is where that's going on right now?SK: It's two fifth-grade classes and two seventh-grade classes. They're doing it at the district level. I think what they're excited about is they can follow these kids, not only in school; on Christmas, we saw some of the kids were doing it. We can track everything, track them as they go through the entire district. Through the summers, as they go from one teacher to the next, you have this continuity of data that even at the district level, they can see.BG: So some of those views we saw were for the teacher to go in and track actually what's going on with those kids. So you're getting feedback on those teacher views to see what they think they need?SK: Oh yeah. Most of those were specs by the teachers. We made some of those for students so they could see their data, but we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves. And they're saying, \"Hey, this is nice, but \u2014\" Like that focus graph, a lot of the teachers said, \"I have a feeling a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic.\" So we made that focus diagram. So it's all been teacher-driven. It's been pretty crazy.BG: Is this ready for prime time? Do you think a lot of classes next school year should try this thing out?SK: Yeah, it's ready. We've got a million people on the site already, so we can handle a few more.(Laughter)No, no reason why it really can't happen in every classroom in America tomorrow.BG: And the vision of the tutoring thing. The idea there is, if I'm confused about a topic, somehow right in the user interface, I'd find people who are volunteering, maybe see their reputation, and I could schedule and connect up with those people?SK: Absolutely. And this is something I recommend everyone in this audience do. Those dashboards the teachers have, you can go log in right now and you can essentially become a coach for your kids, your nephews, your cousins, or maybe some kids at the Boys and Girls Club. And yeah, you can start becoming a mentor, a tutor, really immediately. But yeah, it's all there.BG: Well, it's amazing. I think you just got a glimpse of the future of education.BG: Thank you.

started.\n\n00:01:37.878 --> 00:01:40.179\nAnd some of you all might know,\n\n00:01:40.203 --> 00:01:43.224\nabout five years ago,\nI was an analyst at a hedge fund,\n\n00:01:43.248 --> 00:01:45.716\nand I was in Boston,\n\n00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.828\nand I was tutoring my cousins\nin New Orleans, remotely.\n\n00:01:48.852 --> 00:01:51.193\nAnd I started putting\nthe first YouTube videos up,\n\n00:01:51.217 --> 00:01:53.051\nreally just as a kind of nice-to-have,\n\n00:01:53.075 --> 00:01:55.200\njust kind of a supplement for my cousins,\n\n00:01:55.224 --> 00:01:58.232\nsomething that might give them\na refresher or something.\n\n00:01:58.256 --> 00:02:00.896\nAnd as soon as I put those\nfirst YouTube videos up,\n\n00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.424\nsomething interesting happened.\n\n00:02:02.448 --> 00:02:04.792\nActually, a bunch of interesting\nthings happened.\n\n00:02:04.816 --> 00:02:07.054\nThe first was the feedback\nfrom my cousins.\n\n00:02:07.665 --> 00:02:12.406\nThey told me that they preferred\nme on YouTube than in person.\n\n00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:23.721\nAnd once you get over\nthe backhanded nature of that,\n\n00:02:23.745 --> 00:02:26.053\nthere was actually something\nvery profound there.\n\n00:02:26.077 --> 00:02:29.903\nThey were saying that they preferred\nthe automated version of their cousin\n\n00:02:29.927 --> 00:02:31.077\nto their cousin.\n\n00:02:31.538 --> 00:02:33.027\nAt first it's very unintuitive,\n\n00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:36.809\nbut when you think about it from their\npoint of view, it makes a ton of sense.\n\n00:02:36.833 --> 00:02:40.653\nYou have this situation where now\nthey can pause and repeat their cousin,\n\n00:02:40.677 --> 00:02:43.701\nwithout feeling\nlike they're wasting my time.\n\n00:02:43.725 --> 00:02:46.097\nIf they have to review something\n\n00:02:46.121 --> 00:02:48.676\nthat they should have learned\na couple of weeks ago,\n\n00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.922\nor maybe a couple of years ago,\n\n00:02:50.946 --> 00:02:53.604\nthey don't have to be embarrassed\nand ask their cousin.\n\n00:02:53.628 --> 00:02:56.970\nThey can just watch those videos;\nif they're bored, they can go ahead.\n\n00:02:56.994 --> 00:02:59.018\nThey can watch at their own time and pace.\n\n00:02:59.042 --> 00:03:03.843\nProbably the least-appreciated aspect\nof this\n\n00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:06.438\nis the notion that the very first time\n\n00:03:06.462 --> 00:03:10.310\nthat you're trying to get\nyour brain around a new concept,\n\n00:03:10.334 --> 00:03:11.934\nthe very last thing you need\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.700\nis another human being saying,\n\"Do you understand this?\"\n\n00:03:15.152 --> 00:03:16.546\nAnd that's what was happening\n\n00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.665\nwith the interaction\nwith my cousins before,\n\n00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:24.195\nand now they can just do it\nin the intimacy of their own room.\n\n00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:26.968\nThe other thing that happened is --\n\n00:03:26.992 --> 00:03:29.806\nI put them on YouTube just --\n\n00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:32.308\nI saw no reason to make it private,\n\n00:03:32.332 --> 00:03:33.934\nso I let other people watch it,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.934\nand then people started stumbling on it,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:39.456\nand I started getting\nsome comments and some letters\n\n00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.686\nand all sorts of feedback\n\n00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.646\nfrom random people around the world.\n\n00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.344\nThese are just a few.\n\n00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.646\nThis is actually from one\nof the original calculus videos.\n\n00:03:50.138 --> 00:03:53.219\nSomeone wrote it on YouTube,\nit was a YouTube comment:\n\n00:03:53.243 --> 00:03:55.934\n\"First time I smiled doing a derivative.\"\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.854\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:58.878 --> 00:04:00.680\nLet's pause here.\n\n00:04:00.704 --> 00:04:02.656\nThis person did a derivative,\n\n00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.857\nand then they smiled.\n\n00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:05.662\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:05.686 --> 00:04:07.369\nIn response to that same comment --\n\n00:04:07.393 --> 00:04:10.844\nthis is on the thread, you can go\non YouTube and look at the comments --\n\n00:04:10.868 --> 00:04:12.646\nsomeone else wrote: \"Same thing here.\n\n00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.743\nI actually got a natural high\nand a good mood for the entire day,\n\n00:04:15.767 --> 00:04:20.195\nsince I remember seeing\nall of this matrix text in class,\n\n00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:22.934\nand here I'm all like, 'I know kung fu.'\"\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:27.219\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:27.243 --> 00:04:29.594\nWe get a lot of feedback\nalong those lines.\n\n00:04:29.618 --> 00:04:31.299\nThis clearly was helping people.\n\n00:04:31.323 --> 00:04:35.025\nBut then, as the viewership\nkept growing and kept growing,\n\n00:04:35.049 --> 00:04:37.620\nI started getting letters from people,\n\n00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:39.381\nand it was starting to become clear\n\n00:04:39.405 --> 00:04:41.487\nthat it was more than just a nice-to-have.\n\n00:04:41.511 --> 00:04:44.934\nThis is just an excerpt\nfrom one of those letters:\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.429\n\"My 12 year-old son has autism,\n\n00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:49.675\nand has had a terrible time with math.\n\n00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:50.934\nWe have tried everything,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.934\nviewed everything, bought everything.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:56.643\nWe stumbled on your video\non decimals, and it got through.\n\n00:04:56.667 --> 00:04:58.651\nThen we went on to the dreaded fractions.\n\n00:04:58.675 --> 00:04:59.826\nAgain, he got it.\n\n00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.016\nWe could not believe it.\n\n00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.257\nHe is so excited.\"\n\n00:05:03.142 --> 00:05:04.508\nAnd so you can imagine,\n\n00:05:04.532 --> 00:05:08.666\nhere I was, an analyst at a hedge fund --\n\n00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.959\nit was very strange for me to do\nsomething of social value.\n\n00:05:11.983 --> 00:05:13.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:20.638\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:20.662 --> 00:05:23.934\nBut I was excited, so I kept going.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.656\nAnd then a few other things\nstarted to dawn on me;\n\n00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.148\nthat not only would it\nhelp my cousins right now,\n\n00:05:29.172 --> 00:05:31.227\nor these people who were sending letters,\n\n00:05:31.251 --> 00:05:34.123\nbut that this content will never grow old,\n\n00:05:34.147 --> 00:05:37.441\nthat it could help their kids\nor their grandkids.\n\n00:05:37.465 --> 00:05:42.227\nIf Isaac Newton had done\nYouTube videos on calculus,\n\n00:05:42.251 --> 00:05:43.489\nI wouldn't have to.\n\n00:05:43.513 --> 00:05:45.298\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:45.322 --> 00:05:47.934\nAssuming he was good. We don't know.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.560\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:50.584 --> 00:05:53.624\nThe other thing that happened --\nand even at this point, I said,\n\n00:05:53.648 --> 00:05:56.862\n\"OK, maybe it's a good supplement.\nIt's good for motivated students.\n\n00:05:56.886 --> 00:05:58.712\nIt's good for maybe home-schoolers.\"\n\n00:05:58.736 --> 00:06:02.011\nBut I didn't think it would somehow\npenetrate the classroom.\n\n00:06:02.035 --> 00:06:04.161\nThen I started getting\nletters from teachers,\n\n00:06:04.185 --> 00:06:06.010\nand the teachers would write, saying,\n\n00:06:06.034 --> 00:06:08.255\n\"We've used your videos\nto flip the classroom.\n\n00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:10.856\nYou've given the lectures,\nso now what we do --\"\n\n00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.418\nAnd this could happen in every classroom\nin America tomorrow --\n\n00:06:14.442 --> 00:06:17.696\n\"what I do is I assign\nthe lectures for homework,\n\n00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.743\nand what used to be homework,\n\n00:06:19.767 --> 00:06:22.719\nI now have the students\ndoing in the classroom.\"\n\n00:06:22.743 --> 00:06:25.211\nAnd I want to pause here --\n\n00:06:25.235 --> 00:06:29.828\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:29.852 --> 00:06:33.149\nI want to pause here, because there's\na couple of interesting things.\n\n00:06:33.173 --> 00:06:35.374\nOne, when those teachers are doing that,\n\n00:06:35.398 --> 00:06:36.934\nthere's the obvious benefit --\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.458\nthe benefit that now their students\n\n00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:42.004\ncan enjoy the videos in the way\nthat my cousins did,\n\n00:06:42.028 --> 00:06:45.434\nthey can pause, repeat at their\nown pace, at their own time.\n\n00:06:45.458 --> 00:06:48.639\nBut the more interesting thing --\nand this is the unintuitive thing\n\n00:06:48.663 --> 00:06:51.041\nwhen you talk about technology\nin the classroom --\n\n00:06:51.065 --> 00:06:53.951\nby removing the one-size-fits-all\nlecture from the classroom,\n\n00:06:53.975 --> 00:06:56.975\nand letting students have\na self-paced lecture at home,\n\n00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:58.650\nthen when you go to the classroom,\n\n00:06:58.674 --> 00:07:01.174\nletting them do work,\nhaving the teacher walk around,\n\n00:07:01.198 --> 00:07:04.284\nhaving the peers actually be able\nto interact with each other,\n\n00:07:04.308 --> 00:07:09.942\nthese teachers have used technology\nto humanize the classroom.\n\n00:07:09.966 --> 00:07:12.428\nThey took a fundamentally\ndehumanizing experience --\n\n00:07:12.452 --> 00:07:14.943\n30 kids with their fingers on their lips,\n\n00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:16.921\nnot allowed to interact with each other.\n\n00:07:16.945 --> 00:07:18.437\nA teacher, no matter how good,\n\n00:07:18.461 --> 00:07:21.770\nhas to give this one-size-fits-all\nlecture to 30 students --\n\n00:07:21.794 --> 00:07:24.157\nblank faces, slightly antagonistic --\n\n00:07:24.181 --> 00:07:25.752\nand now it's a human experience,\n\n00:07:25.776 --> 00:07:28.085\nnow they're actually\ninteracting with each other.\n\n00:07:28.109 --> 00:07:30.894\nSo once the Khan Academy --\n\n00:07:30.918 --> 00:07:32.070\nI quit my job,\n\n00:07:32.094 --> 00:07:34.538\nand we turned into a real organization --\n\n00:07:34.562 --> 00:07:36.355\nwe're a not-for-profit --\n\n00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:39.473\nthe question is, how do we take this\nto the next level?\n\n00:07:39.497 --> 00:07:43.005\nHow do we take what those teachers\nwere doing to its natural conclusion?\n\n00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:44.934\nAnd so, what I'm showing over here,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.592\nthese are actual exercises\n\n00:07:47.616 --> 00:07:49.934\nthat I started writing for my cousins.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.054\nThe ones I started\nwere much more primitive.\n\n00:07:52.078 --> 00:07:55.448\nThis is a more competent version of it.\n\n00:07:55.472 --> 00:07:58.861\nBut the paradigm here is, we'll generate\nas many questions as you need,\n\n00:07:58.885 --> 00:08:01.934\nuntil you get that concept,\nuntil you get 10 in a row.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.934\nAnd the Khan Academy videos are there.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.291\nYou get hints, the actual\nsteps for that problem,\n\n00:08:06.315 --> 00:08:08.272\nif you don't know how to do it.\n\n00:08:08.296 --> 00:08:10.606\nThe paradigm here seems\nlike a very simple thing:\n\n00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:11.828\n10 in a row, you move on.\n\n00:08:11.852 --> 00:08:13.432\nBut it's fundamentally different\n\n00:08:13.456 --> 00:08:15.743\nthan what's happening\nin classrooms right now.\n\n00:08:15.767 --> 00:08:17.669\nIn a traditional classroom,\n\n00:08:17.693 --> 00:08:20.934\nyou have homework, lecture,\nhomework, lecture,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.797\nand then you have a snapshot exam.\n\n00:08:22.821 --> 00:08:26.478\nAnd that exam, whether you get\na 70 percent, an 80 percent,\n\n00:08:26.502 --> 00:08:27.947\na 90 percent or a 95 percent,\n\n00:08:27.971 --> 00:08:30.414\nthe class moves on to the next topic.\n\n00:08:30.438 --> 00:08:32.183\nAnd even that 95 percent student --\n\n00:08:32.207 --> 00:08:34.216\nwhat was the five percent\nthey didn't know?\n\n00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.061\nMaybe they didn't know what happens when\nyou raise something to the zeroth power.\n\n00:08:38.085 --> 00:08:40.334\nThen you build on that\nin the next concept.\n\n00:08:40.358 --> 00:08:43.698\nThat's analogous to --\nimagine learning to ride a bicycle.\n\n00:08:43.722 --> 00:08:46.591\nMaybe I give you a lecture ahead of time,\n\n00:08:46.615 --> 00:08:50.528\nand I give you a bicycle for two weeks,\nthen I come back after two weeks,\n\n00:08:50.552 --> 00:08:53.702\nand say, \"Well, let's see.\nYou're having trouble taking left turns.\n\n00:08:53.726 --> 00:08:56.963\nYou can't quite stop.\nYou're an 80 percent bicyclist.\"\n\n00:08:56.987 --> 00:08:59.409\nSo I put a big \"C\" stamp\non your forehead --\n\n00:08:59.433 --> 00:09:00.495\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:02.281\nand then I say, \"Here's a unicycle.\"\n\n00:09:02.305 --> 00:09:03.399\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:03.423 --> 00:09:05.258\nBut as ridiculous as that sounds,\n\n00:09:05.282 --> 00:09:08.934\nthat's exactly what's happening\nin our classrooms right now.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.567\nAnd the idea is you fast forward\n\n00:09:11.591 --> 00:09:14.577\nand good students start failing\nalgebra all of the sudden,\n\n00:09:14.601 --> 00:09:16.905\nand start failing\ncalculus all of the sudden,\n\n00:09:16.929 --> 00:09:19.287\ndespite being smart,\ndespite having good teachers,\n\n00:09:19.311 --> 00:09:22.055\nand it's usually because they have\nthese Swiss cheese gaps\n\n00:09:22.079 --> 00:09:24.288\nthat kept building\nthroughout their foundation.\n\n00:09:24.312 --> 00:09:27.890\nSo our model is: learn math\nthe way you'd learn anything,\n\n00:09:27.914 --> 00:09:29.260\nlike riding a bicycle.\n\n00:09:29.284 --> 00:09:32.355\nStay on that bicycle.\nFall off that bicycle.\n\n00:09:32.379 --> 00:09:35.410\nDo it as long as necessary,\nuntil you have mastery.\n\n00:09:35.434 --> 00:09:36.934\nThe traditional model,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.530\nit penalizes you\nfor experimentation and failure,\n\n00:09:39.554 --> 00:09:41.577\nbut it does not expect mastery.\n\n00:09:41.601 --> 00:09:44.665\nWe encourage you to experiment.\nWe encourage you to fail.\n\n00:09:44.689 --> 00:09:46.339\nBut we do expect mastery.\n\n00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:49.799\nThis is just another one of the modules.\n\n00:09:49.823 --> 00:09:51.243\nThis is trigonometry.\n\n00:09:51.267 --> 00:09:53.782\nThis is shifting and reflecting functions.\n\n00:09:54.529 --> 00:09:55.933\nAnd they all fit together.\n\n00:09:55.957 --> 00:09:57.915\nWe have about 90 of these right now.\n\n00:09:57.939 --> 00:09:59.548\nYou can go to the site right now,\n\n00:09:59.572 --> 00:10:01.644\nit's all free,\nnot trying to sell anything.\n\n00:10:01.668 --> 00:10:04.808\nBut the general idea is that they all\nfit into this knowledge map.\n\n00:10:04.832 --> 00:10:07.951\nThat top node right there,\nthat's literally single-digit addition,\n\n00:10:07.975 --> 00:10:10.250\nit's like one plus one is equal to two.\n\n00:10:10.274 --> 00:10:12.626\nThe paradigm is, once you get\n10 in a row on that,\n\n00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.833\nit keeps forwarding you\nto more and more advanced modules.\n\n00:10:15.857 --> 00:10:18.936\nFurther down the knowledge map,\n\n00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.207\nwe're getting into more\nadvanced arithmetic.\n\n00:10:21.231 --> 00:10:24.404\nFurther down, you start getting\ninto pre-algebra and early algebra.\n\n00:10:24.428 --> 00:10:28.171\nFurther down, you start getting\ninto algebra one, algebra two,\n\n00:10:28.195 --> 00:10:29.727\na little bit of precalculus.\n\n00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.297\nAnd the idea is, from this we can\nactually teach everything --\n\n00:10:33.321 --> 00:10:37.163\nwell, everything that can be taught\nin this type of a framework.\n\n00:10:37.187 --> 00:10:39.996\nSo you can imagine -- and this\nis what we are working on --\n\n00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.583\nfrom this knowledge map, you have\nlogic, you have computer programming,\n\n00:10:43.607 --> 00:10:46.107\nyou have grammar, you have genetics,\n\n00:10:46.131 --> 00:10:49.290\nall based off of that core of,\nif you know this and that,\n\n00:10:49.314 --> 00:10:51.654\nnow you're ready for this next concept.\n\n00:10:52.567 --> 00:10:54.869\nNow that can work well\nfor an individual learner,\n\n00:10:54.893 --> 00:10:57.025\nand I encourage you\nto do it with your kids,\n\n00:10:57.049 --> 00:11:00.088\nbut I also encourage everyone\nin the audience to do it yourself.\n\n00:11:00.112 --> 00:11:02.314\nIt'll change what happens\nat the dinner table.\n\n00:11:02.338 --> 00:11:03.494\nBut what we want to do\n\n00:11:03.518 --> 00:11:06.596\nis use the natural conclusion\nof the flipping of the classroom\n\n00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.993\nthat those early teachers\nhad emailed me about.\n\n00:11:09.017 --> 00:11:10.610\nAnd so what I'm showing you here,\n\n00:11:10.634 --> 00:11:13.522\nthis is data from a pilot\nin the Los Altos school district,\n\n00:11:13.546 --> 00:11:16.862\nwhere they took two fifth-grade classes\nand two seventh-grade classes,\n\n00:11:16.886 --> 00:11:19.137\nand completely gutted\ntheir old math curriculum.\n\n00:11:19.161 --> 00:11:22.596\nThese kids aren't using textbooks,\nor getting one-size-fits-all lectures.\n\n00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.613\nThey're doing Khan Academy, that software,\nfor roughly half of their math class.\n\n00:11:26.637 --> 00:11:29.844\nI want to be clear: we don't view this\nas a complete math education.\n\n00:11:29.868 --> 00:11:32.766\nWhat it does is -- this is\nwhat's happening in Los Altos --\n\n00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.191\nit frees up time --\nit's the blocking and tackling,\n\n00:11:35.215 --> 00:11:38.191\nmaking sure you know how to move\nthrough a system of equations,\n\n00:11:38.215 --> 00:11:40.850\nand it frees up time\nfor the simulations, for the games,\n\n00:11:40.874 --> 00:11:42.890\nfor the mechanics, for the robot-building,\n\n00:11:42.914 --> 00:11:45.796\nfor the estimating how high\nthat hill is based on its shadow.\n\n00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.376\nAnd so the paradigm is\nthe teacher walks in every day,\n\n00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.178\nevery kid works at their own pace --\n\n00:11:50.202 --> 00:11:53.733\nthis is actually a live dashboard\nfrom the Los Altos school district --\n\n00:11:53.757 --> 00:11:55.328\nand they look at this dashboard.\n\n00:11:55.352 --> 00:11:57.042\nEvery row is a student.\n\n00:11:57.066 --> 00:11:58.934\nEvery column is one of those concepts.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.101\nGreen means the student's\nalready proficient.\n\n00:12:01.125 --> 00:12:03.649\nBlue means they're working\non it -- no need to worry.\n\n00:12:03.673 --> 00:12:04.934\nRed means they're stuck.\n\n00:12:05.386 --> 00:12:08.631\nAnd what the teacher does\nis literally just say,\n\n00:12:08.655 --> 00:12:10.330\n\"Let me intervene on the red kids.\"\n\n00:12:10.354 --> 00:12:12.719\nOr even better, \"Let me get\none of the green kids,\n\n00:12:12.743 --> 00:12:14.789\nwho are already proficient\nin that concept,\n\n00:12:14.813 --> 00:12:18.326\nto be the first line of attack,\nand actually tutor their peer.\"\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:25.559\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:25.583 --> 00:12:28.934\nNow, I come from a very\ndata-centric reality,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.697\nso we don't want that teacher\nto even go and intervene\n\n00:12:31.721 --> 00:12:33.767\nand have to ask the kid awkward questions:\n\n00:12:33.791 --> 00:12:37.101\n\"What don't you understand? What do\nyou understand?\" and all the rest.\n\n00:12:37.125 --> 00:12:40.360\nSo our paradigm is to arm teachers\nwith as much data as possible --\n\n00:12:40.384 --> 00:12:42.434\ndata that, in any other\nfield, is expected,\n\n00:12:42.458 --> 00:12:44.497\nin finance, marketing, manufacturing --\n\n00:12:44.521 --> 00:12:47.318\nso the teachers can diagnose\nwhat's wrong with the students\n\n00:12:47.342 --> 00:12:50.230\nso they can make their interaction\nas productive as possible.\n\n00:12:50.254 --> 00:12:53.088\nNow teachers know exactly\nwhat the students have been up to,\n\n00:12:53.112 --> 00:12:55.997\nhow long they've spent each day,\nwhat videos they've watched,\n\n00:12:56.021 --> 00:12:58.855\nwhen did they pause the videos,\nwhat did they stop watching,\n\n00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:01.602\nwhat exercises are they using,\nwhat have they focused on?\n\n00:13:01.626 --> 00:13:04.499\nThe outer circle shows\nwhat exercises they were focused on.\n\n00:13:04.523 --> 00:13:07.228\nThe inner circle shows\nthe videos they're focused on.\n\n00:13:07.839 --> 00:13:09.276\nThe data gets pretty granular,\n\n00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.387\nso you can see the exact problems\nthe student got right or wrong.\n\n00:13:12.411 --> 00:13:14.140\nRed is wrong, blue is right.\n\n00:13:14.164 --> 00:13:17.138\nThe leftmost question is the first one\nthe student attempted.\n\n00:13:17.162 --> 00:13:18.804\nThey watched the video over there.\n\n00:13:18.828 --> 00:13:21.772\nAnd you can see, eventually\nthey were able to get 10 in a row.\n\n00:13:21.796 --> 00:13:25.151\nIt's almost like you can see them\nlearning over those last 10 problems.\n\n00:13:25.175 --> 00:13:28.262\nThey also got faster -- the height\nis how long it took them.\n\n00:13:30.179 --> 00:13:34.678\nWhen you talk about self-paced learning,\nit makes sense for everyone --\n\n00:13:34.702 --> 00:13:37.123\nin education-speak,\n\"differentiated learning\" --\n\n00:13:37.147 --> 00:13:40.829\nbut it's kind of crazy, what happens\nwhen you see it in a classroom.\n\n00:13:40.853 --> 00:13:45.297\nBecause every time we've done this,\nin every classroom we've done,\n\n00:13:45.321 --> 00:13:47.645\nover and over again,\nif you go five days into it,\n\n00:13:47.669 --> 00:13:49.682\nthere's a group of kids who've raced ahead\n\n00:13:49.706 --> 00:13:51.619\nand a group who are a little bit slower.\n\n00:13:51.643 --> 00:13:54.046\nIn a traditional model,\nin a snapshot assessment,\n\n00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.982\nyou say, \"These are the gifted kids,\nthese are the slow kids.\n\n00:13:57.006 --> 00:13:58.974\nMaybe they should be tracked differently.\n\n00:13:58.998 --> 00:14:01.228\nMaybe we should put them\nin different classes.\"\n\n00:14:01.252 --> 00:14:03.656\nBut when you let students\nwork at their own pace --\n\n00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.281\nwe see it over and over again --\n\n00:14:05.305 --> 00:14:07.730\nyou see students who took\na little bit extra time\n\n00:14:07.754 --> 00:14:09.605\non one concept or the other,\n\n00:14:09.629 --> 00:14:11.825\nbut once they get through that concept,\n\n00:14:11.849 --> 00:14:13.197\nthey just race ahead.\n\n00:14:13.221 --> 00:14:16.593\nAnd so the same kids that you\nthought were slow six weeks ago,\n\n00:14:16.617 --> 00:14:18.276\nyou now would think are gifted.\n\n00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.292\nAnd we're seeing it over and over again.\n\n00:14:20.316 --> 00:14:22.101\nIt makes you really wonder\n\n00:14:22.125 --> 00:14:25.424\nhow much all of the labels maybe\na lot of us have benefited from\n\n00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:28.030\nwere really just due\nto a coincidence of time.\n\n00:14:31.185 --> 00:14:36.217\nNow as valuable as something like this is\nin a district like Los Altos,\n\n00:14:36.241 --> 00:14:37.934\nour goal is to use technology\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.934\nto humanize, not just in Los Altos,\nbut on a global scale,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.461\nwhat's happening in education.\n\n00:14:43.485 --> 00:14:45.786\nAnd that brings up an interesting point.\n\n00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:48.540\nA lot of the effort\nin humanizing the classroom\n\n00:14:48.564 --> 00:14:51.484\nis focused on student-to-teacher ratios.\n\n00:14:51.508 --> 00:14:54.007\nIn our mind, the relevant metric is:\n\n00:14:54.031 --> 00:14:57.933\nstudent-to-valuable-human-time-\nwith-the-teacher ratio.\n\n00:14:57.957 --> 00:15:00.482\nSo in a traditional model,\nmost of the teacher's time\n\n00:15:00.506 --> 00:15:02.878\nis spent doing lectures\nand grading and whatnot.\n\n00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:05.798\nMaybe five percent of their time\nis sitting next to students\n\n00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:06.982\nand working with them.\n\n00:15:07.006 --> 00:15:09.013\nNow, 100 percent of their time is.\n\n00:15:09.037 --> 00:15:12.307\nSo once again, using technology,\nnot just flipping the classroom,\n\n00:15:12.331 --> 00:15:14.689\nyou're humanizing\nthe classroom, I'd argue,\n\n00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:16.727\nby a factor of five or 10.\n\n00:15:17.354 --> 00:15:19.084\nAs valuable as that is in Los Altos,\n\n00:15:19.108 --> 00:15:21.149\nimagine what it does to the adult learner,\n\n00:15:21.173 --> 00:15:23.236\nwho's embarrassed to go back\nand learn stuff\n\n00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.712\nthey should have known\nbefore going back to college.\n\n00:15:25.736 --> 00:15:31.669\nImagine what it does\nto a street kid in Calcutta,\n\n00:15:31.693 --> 00:15:34.435\nwho has to help his family during the day,\n\n00:15:34.459 --> 00:15:36.865\nand that's the reason\nhe or she can't go to school.\n\n00:15:36.889 --> 00:15:39.372\nNow they can spend two hours\na day and remediate,\n\n00:15:39.396 --> 00:15:41.721\nor get up to speed\nand not feel embarrassed\n\n00:15:41.745 --> 00:15:43.934\nabout what they do or don't know.\n\n00:15:44.364 --> 00:15:45.992\nNow imagine what happens where --\n\n00:15:46.016 --> 00:15:48.927\nwe talked about the peers\nteaching each other\n\n00:15:48.951 --> 00:15:50.760\ninside of a classroom.\n\n00:15:50.784 -->

Well that's exactly the journey that my family began five and a half years ago. This is my wife and collaborator, Rupal. And on this day, at this moment, we walked into the house with our first child, our beautiful baby boy. And we walked into a house with a very special home video recording system.(Video) Man: Okay.Deb Roy: This moment and thousands of other moments special for us were captured in our home because in every room in the house, if you looked up, you'd see a camera and a microphone, and if you looked down, you'd get this bird's-eye view of the room. Here's our living room, the baby bedroom, kitchen, dining room and the rest of the house. And all of these fed into a disc array that was designed for a continuous capture. So here we are flying through a day in our home as we move from sunlit morning through incandescent evening and, finally, lights out for the day. Over the course of three years, we recorded eight to 10 hours a day, amassing roughly a quarter-million hours of multi-track audio and video.So you're looking at a piece of what is by far the largest home video collection ever made. (Laughter) And what this data represents for our family at a personal level, the impact has already been immense, and we're still learning its value. Countless moments of unsolicited natural moments, not posed moments, are captured there, and we're starting to learn how to discover them and find them.But there's also a scientific reason that drove this project, which was to use this natural longitudinal data to understand the process of how a child learns language \u2014 that child being my son. And so with many privacy provisions put in place to protect everyone who was recorded in the data, we made elements of the data available to my trusted research team at MIT so we could start teasing apart patterns in this massive data set, trying to understand the influence of social environments on language acquisition. So we're looking here at one of the first things we started to do. This is my wife and I cooking breakfast in the kitchen, and as we move through space and through time, a very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen.In order to convert this opaque, 90,000 hours of video into something that we could start to see, we use motion analysis to pull out, as we move through space and through time, what we call space-time worms. And this has become part of our toolkit for being able to look and see where the activities are in the data, and with it, trace the pattern of, in particular, where my son moved throughout the home, so that we could focus our transcription efforts, all of the speech environment around my son \u2014 all of the words that he heard from myself, my wife, our nanny, and over time, the words he began to produce. So with that technology and that data and the ability to, with machine assistance, transcribe speech, we've now transcribed well over seven million words of our home transcripts. And with that, let me take you now for a first tour into the data.So you've all, I'm sure, seen time-lapse videos where a flower will blossom as you accelerate time. I'd like you to now experience the blossoming of a speech form. My son, soon after his first birthday, would say \"gaga\" to mean water. And over the course of the next half-year, he slowly learned to approximate the proper adult form, \"water.\" So we're going to cruise through half a year in about 40 seconds. No video here, so you can focus on the sound, the acoustics, of a new kind of trajectory: gaga to water.(Audio) Baby: Gagagagagaga Gaga gaga gaga guga guga guga wada gaga gaga guga gaga wader guga guga water water water water water water water water water.DR: He sure nailed it, didn't he.(Applause)So he didn't just learn water. Over the course of the 24 months, the first two years that we really focused on, this is a map of every word he learned in chronological order. And because we have full transcripts, we've identified each of the 503 words that he learned to produce by his second birthday. He was an early talker. And so we started to analyze why. Why were certain words born before others? This is one of the first results that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really surprised us. The way to interpret this apparently simple graph is, on the vertical is an indication of how complex caregiver utterances are based on the length of utterances. And the [horizontal] axis is time.And all of the data, we aligned based on the following idea: Every time my son would learn a word, we would trace back and look at all of the language he heard that contained that word. And we would plot the relative length of the utterances. And what we found was this curious phenomena, that caregiver speech would systematically dip to a minimum, making language as simple as possible, and then slowly ascend back up in complexity. And the amazing thing was that bounce, that dip, lined up almost precisely with when each word was born \u2014 word after word, systematically. So it appears that all three primary caregivers \u2014 myself, my wife and our nanny \u2014 were systematically and, I would think, subconsciously restructuring our language to meet him at the birth of a word and bring him gently into more complex language. And the implications of this \u2014 there are many, but one I just want to point out, is that there must be amazing feedback loops. Of course, my son is learning from his linguistic environment, but the environment is learning from him. That environment, people, are in these tight feedback loops and creating a kind of scaffolding that has not been noticed until now.But that's looking at the speech context. What about the visual context? We're not looking at \u2014 think of this as a dollhouse cutaway of our house. We've taken those circular fish-eye lens cameras, and we've done some optical correction, and then we can bring it into three-dimensional life. So welcome to my home. This is a moment, one moment captured across multiple cameras. The reason we did this is to create the ultimate memory machine, where you can go back and interactively fly around and then breathe video-life into this system. What I'm going to do is give you an accelerated view of 30 minutes, again, of just life in the living room. That's me and my son on the floor. And there's video analytics that are tracking our movements. My son is leaving red ink. I am leaving green ink. We're now on the couch, looking out through the window at cars passing by. And finally, my son playing in a walking toy by himself.Now we freeze the action, 30 minutes, we turn time into the vertical axis, and we open up for a view of these interaction traces we've just left behind. And we see these amazing structures \u2014 these little knots of two colors of thread we call \"social hot spots.\" The spiral thread we call a \"solo hot spot.\" And we think that these affect the way language is learned. What we'd like to do is start understanding the interaction between these patterns and the language that my son is exposed to to see if we can predict how the structure of when words are heard affects when they're learned \u2014 so in other words, the relationship between words and what they're about in the world.So here's how we're approaching this. In this video, again, my son is being traced out. He's leaving red ink behind. And there's our nanny by the door.(Video) Nanny: You want water? (Baby: Aaaa.) Nanny: All right. (Baby: Aaaa.)DR: She offers water, and off go the two worms over to the kitchen to get water. And what we've done is use the word \"water\" to tag that moment, that bit of activity. And now we take the power of data and take every time my son ever heard the word water and the context he saw it in, and we use it to penetrate through the video and find every activity trace that co-occurred with an instance of water. And what this data leaves in its wake is a landscape. We call these wordscapes. This is the wordscape for the word water, and you can see most of the action is in the kitchen. That's where those big peaks are over to the left. And just for contrast, we can do this with any word. We can take the word \"bye\" as in \"good bye.\" And we're now zoomed in over the entrance to the house. And we look, and we find, as you would expect, a contrast in the landscape where the word \"bye\" occurs much more in a structured way. So we're using these structures to start predicting the order of language acquisition, and that's ongoing work now.In my lab, which we're peering into now, at MIT \u2014 this is at the media lab. This has become my favorite way of videographing just about any space. Three of the key people in this project, Philip DeCamp, Rony Kubat and Brandon Roy are pictured here. Philip has been a close collaborator on all the visualizations you're seeing. And Michael Fleischman was another Ph.D. student in my lab who worked with me on this home video analysis, and he made the following observation: that \"just the way that we're analyzing how language connects to events which provide common ground for language, that same idea we can take out of your home, Deb, and we can apply it to the world of public media.\" And so our effort took an unexpected turn.Think of mass media as providing common ground and you have the recipe for taking this idea to a whole new place. We've started analyzing television content using the same principles \u2014 analyzing event structure of a TV signal \u2014 episodes of shows, commercials, all of the components that make up the event structure. And we're now, with satellite dishes, pulling and analyzing a good part of all the TV being watched in the United States. And you don't have to now go and instrument living rooms with microphones to get people's conversations, you just tune into publicly available social media feeds.So we're pulling in about three billion comments a month, and then the magic happens. You have the event structure, the common ground that the words are about, coming out of the television feeds; you've got the conversations that are about those topics; and through semantic analysis \u2014 and this is actually real data you're looking at from our data processing \u2014 each yellow line is showing a link being made between a comment in the wild and a piece of event structure coming out of the television signal. And the same idea now can be built up. And we get this wordscape, except now words are not assembled in my living room. Instead, the context, the common ground activities, are the content on television that's driving the conversations. And what we're seeing here, these skyscrapers now, are commentary that are linked to content on television. Same concept, but looking at communication dynamics in a very different sphere.And so fundamentally, rather than, for example, measuring content based on how many people are watching, this gives us the basic data for looking at engagement properties of content. And just like we can look at feedback cycles and dynamics in a family, we can now open up the same concepts and look at much larger groups of people. This is a subset of data from our database \u2014 just 50,000 out of several million \u2014 and the social graph that connects them through publicly available sources. And if you put them on one plain, a second plain is where the content lives. So we have the programs and the sporting events and the commercials, and all of the link structures that tie them together make a content graph. And then the important third dimension. Each of the links that you're seeing rendered here is an actual connection made between something someone said and a piece of content. And there are, again, now tens of millions of these links that give us the connective tissue of social graphs and how they relate to content. And we can now start to probe the structure in interesting ways.So if we, for example, trace the path of one piece of content that drives someone to comment on it, and then we follow where that comment goes, and then look at the entire social graph that becomes activated and then trace back to see the relationship between that social graph and content, a very interesting structure becomes visible. We call this a co-viewing clique, a virtual living room if you will. And there are fascinating dynamics at play. It's not one way. A piece of content, an event, causes someone to talk. They talk to other people. That drives tune-in behavior back into mass media, and you have these cycles that drive the overall behavior.Another example \u2014 very different \u2014 another actual person in our database \u2014 and we're finding at least hundreds, if not thousands, of these. We've given this person a name. This is a pro-amateur, or pro-am media critic who has this high fan-out rate. So a lot of people are following this person \u2014 very influential \u2014 and they have a propensity to talk about what's on TV. So this person is a key link in connecting mass media and social media together.One last example from this data: Sometimes it's actually a piece of content that is special. So if we go and look at this piece of content, President Obama's State of the Union address from just a few weeks ago, and look at what we find in this same data set, at the same scale, the engagement properties of this piece of content are truly remarkable. A nation exploding in conversation in real time in response to what's on the broadcast. And of course, through all of these lines are flowing unstructured language. We can X-ray and get a real-time pulse of a nation, real-time sense of the social reactions in the different circuits in the social graph being activated by content.So, to summarize, the idea is this: As our world becomes increasingly instrumented and we have the capabilities to collect and connect the dots between what people are saying and the context they're saying it in, what's emerging is an ability to see new social structures and dynamics that have previously not been seen. It's like building a microscope or telescope and revealing new structures about our own behavior around communication. And I think the implications here are profound, whether it's for science, for commerce, for government, or perhaps most of all, for us as individuals.And so just to return to my son, when I was preparing this talk, he was looking over my shoulder, and I showed him the clips I was going to show to you today, and I asked him for permission \u2014 granted. And then I went on to reflect, \"Isn't it amazing, this entire database, all these recordings, I'm going to hand off to you and to your sister\" \u2014 who arrived two years later \u2014 \"and you guys are going to be able to go back and re-experience moments that you could never, with your biological memory, possibly remember the way you can now?\" And he was quiet for a moment. And I thought, \"What am I thinking? He's five years old. He's not going to understand this.\" And just as I was having that thought, he looked up at me and said, \"So that when I grow up, I can show this to my kids?\" And I thought, \"Wow, this is powerful stuff.\"So I want to leave you with one last memorable moment from our family. This is the first time our son took more than two steps at once \u2014 captured on film. And I really want you to focus on something as I take you through. It's a cluttered environment; it's natural life. My mother's in the kitchen, cooking, and, of all places, in the hallway, I realize he's about to do it, about to take more than two steps. And so you hear me encouraging him, realizing what's happening, and then the magic happens. Listen very carefully. About three steps in, he realizes something magic is happening, and the most amazing feedback loop of all kicks in, and he takes a breath in, and he whispers \"wow\" and instinctively I echo back the same. And so let's fly back in time to that memorable moment.(Video) DR: Hey. Come here. Can you do it? Oh, boy. Can you do it? Baby: Yeah.

traces of time\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nand discover patterns in your own life\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nthat previously had gone undiscovered.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nWell that's exactly the journey\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nthat my family began\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nfive and a half years ago.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nThis is my wife and collaborator, Rupal.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nAnd on this day, at this moment,\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nwe walked into the house with our first child,\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nour beautiful baby boy.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nAnd we walked into a house\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nwith a very special home video recording system.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\n(Video) Man: Okay.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nDeb Roy: This moment\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nand thousands of other moments special for us\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nwere captured in our home\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nbecause in every room in the house,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nif you looked up, you'd see a camera and a microphone,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nand if you looked down,\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nyou'd get this bird's-eye view of the room.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nHere's our living room,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nthe baby bedroom,\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nkitchen, dining room\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nand the rest of the house.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nAnd all of these fed into a disc array\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nthat was designed for a continuous capture.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nSo here we are flying through a day in our home\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nas we move from sunlit morning\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nthrough incandescent evening\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nand, finally, lights out for the day.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nOver the course of three years,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nwe recorded eight to 10 hours a day,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\namassing roughly a quarter-million hours\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nof multi-track audio and video.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nSo you're looking at a piece of what is by far\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nthe largest home video collection ever made.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nAnd what this data represents\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nfor our family at a personal level,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nthe impact has already been immense,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nand we're still learning its value.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nCountless moments\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nof unsolicited natural moments, not posed moments,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nare captured there,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nand we're starting to learn how to discover them and find them.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nBut there's also a scientific reason that drove this project,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nwhich was to use this natural longitudinal data\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nto understand the process\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nof how a child learns language --\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nthat child being my son.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nAnd so with many privacy provisions put in place\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nto protect everyone who was recorded in the data,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nwe made elements of the data available\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nto my trusted research team at MIT\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nso we could start teasing apart patterns\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nin this massive data set,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\ntrying to understand the influence of social environments\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\non language acquisition.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nSo we're looking here\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nat one of the first things we started to do.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nThis is my wife and I cooking breakfast in the kitchen,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nand as we move through space and through time,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\na very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nIn order to convert\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nthis opaque, 90,000 hours of video\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\ninto something that we could start to see,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nwe use motion analysis to pull out,\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nas we move through space and through time,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nwhat we call space-time worms.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd this has become part of our toolkit\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nfor being able to look and see\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nwhere the activities are in the data,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nand with it, trace the pattern of, in particular,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nwhere my son moved throughout the home,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nso that we could focus our transcription efforts,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nall of the speech environment around my son --\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nall of the words that he heard from myself, my wife, our nanny,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nand over time, the words he began to produce.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nSo with that technology and that data\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nand the ability to, with machine assistance,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\ntranscribe speech,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nwe've now transcribed\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nwell over seven million words of our home transcripts.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nAnd with that, let me take you now\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nfor a first tour into the data.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nSo you've all, I'm sure,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nseen time-lapse videos\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nwhere a flower will blossom as you accelerate time.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nI'd like you to now experience\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nthe blossoming of a speech form.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nMy son, soon after his first birthday,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nwould say \"gaga\" to mean water.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nAnd over the course of the next half-year,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nhe slowly learned to approximate\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nthe proper adult form, \"water.\"\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nSo we're going to cruise through half a year\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nin about 40 seconds.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nNo video here,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nso you can focus on the sound, the acoustics,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nof a new kind of trajectory:\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\ngaga to water.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:05:04.958\n(Audio) Baby: Gagagagagaga\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nGaga gaga gaga\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nguga guga guga\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nwada gaga gaga guga gaga\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nwader guga guga\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nwater water water\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nwater water water\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nwater water\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nwater.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nDR: He sure nailed it, didn't he.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:46.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nSo he didn't just learn water.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nOver the course of the 24 months,\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nthe first two years that we really focused on,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nthis is a map of every word he learned in chronological order.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nAnd because we have full transcripts,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nwe've identified each of the 503 words\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nthat he learned to produce by his second birthday.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nHe was an early talker.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nAnd so we started to analyze why.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nWhy were certain words born before others?\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nThis is one of the first results\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nthat came out of our study a little over a year ago\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nthat really surprised us.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nThe way to interpret this apparently simple graph\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nis, on the vertical is an indication\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nof how complex caregiver utterances are\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nbased on the length of utterances.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nAnd the [horizontal] axis is time.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nAnd all of the data,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nwe aligned based on the following idea:\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nEvery time my son would learn a word,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nwe would trace back and look at all of the language he heard\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nthat contained that word.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd we would plot the relative length of the utterances.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nAnd what we found was this curious phenomena,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nthat caregiver speech would systematically dip to a minimum,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nmaking language as simple as possible,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nand then slowly ascend back up in complexity.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd the amazing thing was\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nthat bounce, that dip,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nlined up almost precisely\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nwith when each word was born --\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nword after word, systematically.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nSo it appears that all three primary caregivers --\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nmyself, my wife and our nanny --\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nwere systematically and, I would think, subconsciously\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nrestructuring our language\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nto meet him at the birth of a word\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nand bring him gently into more complex language.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nAnd the implications of this -- there are many,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nbut one I just want to point out,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nis that there must be amazing feedback loops.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nOf course, my son is learning\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nfrom his linguistic environment,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nbut the environment is learning from him.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nThat environment, people, are in these tight feedback loops\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nand creating a kind of scaffolding\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nthat has not been noticed until now.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nBut that's looking at the speech context.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nWhat about the visual context?\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nWe're not looking at --\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nthink of this as a dollhouse cutaway of our house.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nWe've taken those circular fish-eye lens cameras,\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nand we've done some optical correction,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nand then we can bring it into three-dimensional life.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nSo welcome to my home.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nThis is a moment,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\none moment captured across multiple cameras.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nThe reason we did this is to create the ultimate memory machine,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nwhere you can go back and interactively fly around\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nand then breathe video-life into this system.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nWhat I'm going to do\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nis give you an accelerated view of 30 minutes,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nagain, of just life in the living room.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nThat's me and my son on the floor.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nAnd there's video analytics\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nthat are tracking our movements.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nMy son is leaving red ink. I am leaving green ink.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nWe're now on the couch,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nlooking out through the window at cars passing by.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nAnd finally, my son playing in a walking toy by himself.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nNow we freeze the action, 30 minutes,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nwe turn time into the vertical axis,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nand we open up for a view\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nof these interaction traces we've just left behind.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nAnd we see these amazing structures --\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nthese little knots of two colors of thread\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nwe call \"social hot spots.\"\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nThe spiral thread\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nwe call a \"solo hot spot.\"\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nAnd we think that these affect the way language is learned.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nWhat we'd like to do\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nis start understanding\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nthe interaction between these patterns\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nand the language that my son is exposed to\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nto see if we can predict\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nhow the structure of when words are heard\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\naffects when they're learned --\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nso in other words, the relationship\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nbetween words and what they're about in the world.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nSo here's how we're approaching this.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nIn this video,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nagain, my son is being traced out.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nHe's leaving red ink behind.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nAnd there's our nanny by the door.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\n(Video) Nanny: You want water? (Baby: Aaaa.)\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nNanny: All right. (Baby: Aaaa.)\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nDR: She offers water,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nand off go the two worms\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nover to the kitchen to get water.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nAnd what we've done is use the word \"water\"\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nto tag that moment, that bit of activity.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nAnd now we take the power of data\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nand take every time my son\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\never heard the word water\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nand the context he saw it in,\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nand we use it to penetrate through the video\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nand find every activity trace\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nthat co-occurred with an instance of water.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nAnd what this data leaves in its wake\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nis a landscape.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nWe call these wordscapes.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nThis is the wordscape for the word water,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nand you can see most of the action is in the kitchen.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nThat's where those big peaks are over to the left.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nAnd just for contrast, we can do this with any word.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nWe can take the word \"bye\"\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nas in \"good bye.\"\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nAnd we're now zoomed in over the entrance to the house.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nAnd we look, and we find, as you would expect,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\na contrast in the landscape\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nwhere the word \"bye\" occurs much more in a structured way.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nSo we're using these structures\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nto start predicting\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nthe order of language acquisition,\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nand that's ongoing work now.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nIn my lab, which we're peering into now, at MIT --\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nthis is at the media lab.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nThis has become my favorite way\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nof videographing just about any space.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nThree of the key people in this project,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nPhilip DeCamp, Rony Kubat and Brandon Roy are pictured here.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nPhilip has been a close collaborator\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\non all the visualizations you're seeing.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nAnd Michael Fleischman\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nwas another Ph.D. student in my lab\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nwho worked with me on this home video analysis,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nand he made the following observation:\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nthat \"just the way that we're analyzing\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nhow language connects to events\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nwhich provide common ground for language,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nthat same idea we can take out of your home, Deb,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nand we can apply it to the world of public media.\"\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nAnd so our effort took an unexpected turn.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nThink of mass media\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nas providing common ground\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nand you have the recipe\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nfor taking this idea to a whole new place.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nWe've started analyzing television content\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nusing the same principles --\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nanalyzing event structure of a TV signal --\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nepisodes of shows,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\ncommercials,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nall of the components that make up the event structure.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nAnd we're now, with satellite dishes, pulling and analyzing\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\na good part of all the TV being watched in the United States.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nAnd you don't have to now go and instrument living rooms with microphones\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nto get people's conversations,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nyou just tune into publicly available social media feeds.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nSo we're pulling in\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nabout three billion comments a month,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nand then the magic happens.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nYou have the event structure,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nthe common ground that the words are about,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\ncoming out of the television feeds;\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nyou've got the conversations\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nthat are about those topics;\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nand through semantic analysis --\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nand this is actually real data you're looking at\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nfrom our data processing --\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\neach yellow line is showing a link being made\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nbetween a comment in the wild\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nand a piece of event structure coming out of the television signal.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nAnd the same idea now\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\ncan be built up.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nAnd we get this wordscape,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nexcept now words are not assembled in my living room.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nInstead, the context, the common ground activities,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nare the content on television that's driving the conversations.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nAnd what we're seeing here, these skyscrapers now,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nare commentary\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nthat are linked to content on television.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nSame concept,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nbut looking at communication dynamics\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nin a very different sphere.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nAnd so fundamentally, rather than, for example,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nmeasuring content based on how many people are watching,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nthis gives us the basic data\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nfor looking at engagement properties of content.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nAnd just like we can look at feedback cycles\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nand dynamics in a family,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nwe can now open up the same concepts\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nand look at much larger groups of people.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nThis is a subset of data from our database --\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\njust 50,000 out of several million --\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nand the social graph that connects them\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nthrough publicly available sources.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nAnd if you put them on one plain,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\na second plain is where the content lives.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nSo we have the programs\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nand the sporting events\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nand the commercials,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nand all of the link structures that tie them together\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nmake a content graph.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nAnd then the important third dimension.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nEach of the links that you're seeing rendered here\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nis an actual connection made\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nbetween something someone said\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nand a piece of content.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd there are, again, now tens of millions of these links\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nthat give us the connective tissue of social graphs\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nand how they relate to content.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nAnd we can now start to probe the structure\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nin interesting ways.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nSo if we, for example, trace the path\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nof one piece of content\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nthat drives someone to comment on it,\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nand then we follow where that comment goes,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nand then look at the entire social graph that becomes activated\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nand then trace back to see the relationship\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nbetween that social graph and content,\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\na very interesting structure becomes visible.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nWe call this a co-viewing clique,\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\na virtual living room if you will.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nAnd there are fascinating dynamics at play.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nIt's not one way.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nA piece of content, an event, causes someone to talk.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nThey talk to other people.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nThat drives tune-in behavior back into mass media,\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nand you have these cycles\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nthat drive the overall behavior.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nAnother example -- very different --\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nanother actual person in our database --\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nand we're finding at least hundreds, if not thousands, of these.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nWe've given this person a name.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nThis is a pro-amateur, or pro-am media critic\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nwho has this high fan-out rate.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nSo a lot of people are following this person -- very influential --\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nand they have a propensity to talk about what's on TV.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nSo this person is a key link\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nin connecting mass media and social media together.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nOne last example from this data:\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nSometimes it's actually a piece of content that is special.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nSo if we go and look at this piece of content,\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nPresident Obama's State of the Union address\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nfrom just a few weeks ago,\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nand look at what we find in this same data set,\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nat the same scale,\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nthe engagement properties of this piece of content\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nare truly remarkable.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nA nation exploding in conversation\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nin real time\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nin response to what's on the broadcast.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nAnd of course, through all of these lines\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nare flowing unstructured language.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nWe can X-ray\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nand get a real-time pulse of a nation,\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nreal-time sense\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nof the social reactions in the different circuits in the social graph\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nbeing activated by content.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nSo, to summarize, the idea is this:\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nAs our world becomes increasingly instrumented\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nand we have the capabilities\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nto collect and connect the dots\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nbetween what people are saying\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nand the context they're saying it in,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nwhat's emerging is an ability\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nto see new social structures and dynamics\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nthat have previously not been seen.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nIt's like building a microscope or telescope\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nand revealing new structures\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nabout our own behavior around communication.\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nAnd I think the implications here are profound,\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nwhether it's for science,\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nfor commerce, for government,\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nor perhaps most of all,\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nfor us as individuals.\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nAnd so just to return to my son,\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nwhen I was preparing this talk, he was looking over my shoulder,\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nand I showed him the clips I was going to show to you today,\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nand I asked him for permission -- granted.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nAnd then I went on to reflect,\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.958\n\"Isn't it amazing,\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nthis entire database, all these recordings,\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nI'm going to hand off to you and to your sister\" --\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nwho arrived two years later --\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:40.958\n\"and you guys are going to be able to go back and re-experience moments\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nthat you could

00:17:49.958\nAnd I thought, \"What am I thinking?\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nHe's five years old. He's not going to understand this.\"\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nAnd just as I was having that thought, he looked up at me and said,\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:56.958\n\"So that when I grow up,\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nI can show this to my kids?\"\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nAnd I thought, \"Wow, this is powerful stuff.\"\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nSo I want to leave you\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nwith one last memorable moment\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nfrom our family.\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nThis is the first time our son\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:12.958\ntook more than two steps at once --\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.958\ncaptured on film.\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nAnd I really want you to focus on something\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nas I take you through.\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nIt's a cluttered environment; it's natural life.\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:23.958\nMy mother's in the kitchen, cooking,\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:25.958\nand, of all places, in the hallway,\n\n00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nI realize he's about to do it, about to take more than two steps.\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nAnd so you hear me encouraging him,\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nrealizing what's happening,\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nand then the magic happens.\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nListen very carefully.\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:38.958\nAbout three steps in,\n\n00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nhe realizes something magic is happening,\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nand the most amazing feedback loop of all kicks in,\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nand he takes a breath in,\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nand he whispers \"wow\"\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nand instinctively I echo back the same.\n\n00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nAnd so let's fly back in time\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nto that memorable moment.\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:03.958\n(Video) DR: Hey.\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nCome here.\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nCan you do it?\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nOh, boy.\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nCan you do it?\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:16.958\nBaby: Yeah.\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:19.958\nDR: Ma, he's walking.\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:24.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nDR: Thank you.\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:41.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How to keep rivers and streams flowing", "duration": "526", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/rob_harmon_how_the_market_can_keep_streams_flowing", "transcript": "This is a river. This is a stream. This is a river. This is happening all over the country. There are tens of thousands of miles of dewatered streams in the United States. On this map, the colored areas represent water conflicts. Similar problems are emerging in the East as well. The reasons vary state to state, but mostly in the details. There are 4,000 miles of dewatered streams in Montana alone. They would ordinarily support fish and other wildlife. They're the veins of the ecosystem, and they're often empty veins.I want to tell you the story of just one of these streams, because it's an archetype for the larger story. This is Prickly Pear Creek. It runs through a populated area from East Helena to Lake Helena. It supports wild fish including cutthroat, brown and rainbow trout. Nearly every year for more than a hundred years ... it looked like this in the summer. How did we get here? Well, it started back in the late 1800s when people started settling in places like Montana. In short, there was a lot of water and there weren't very many people. But as more people showed up wanting water, the folks who were there first got a little concerned, and in 1865, Montana passed its first water law. It basically said, everybody near the stream can share in the stream. Oddly, a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream, and the folks who were there first got concerned enough to bring out their lawyers. There were precedent-setting suits in 1870 and 1872, both involving Prickly Pear Creek. And in 1921, the Montana Supreme Court ruled in a case involving Prickly Pear that the folks who were there first had the first, or \"senior water rights.\" These senior water rights are key.The problem is that all over the West now it looks like this. Some of these creeks have claims for 50 to 100 times more water than is actually in the stream. And the senior water rights holders, if they don't use their water right, they risk losing their water right \u2014 along with the economic value that goes with it. So they have no incentive to conserve. So it's not just about the number of people; the system itself creates a disincentive to conserve because you can lose your water right if you don't use it. So after decades of lawsuits and 140 years, now, of experience, we still have this. It's a broken system. There's a disincentive to conserve, because if you don't use your water right, you can lose your water right. And I'm sure you all know, this has created significant conflicts between the agricultural and environmental communities.OK, now I'm going to change gears here. Most of you will be happy to know that the rest of the presentation's free ...(Laughter)and some of you'll be happy to know that it involves beer.(Laughter)There's another thing happening around the country, which is that companies are starting to get concerned about their water footprint. They're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water, they're trying to be really efficient with their water use, and they're concerned about how their water use affects the image of their brand. Well, it's a national problem, but I'm going to tell you another story from Montana ... and it involves beer. I bet you didn't know, it takes about 5 pints of water to make a pint of beer. If you include all the drain, it takes more than a hundred pints of water to make a pint of beer.Now the brewers in Montana have already done a lot to reduce their water consumption, but they still use millions of gallons of water. I mean, there's water in beer. So what can they do about this remaining water footprint that can have serious effects on the ecosystem? These ecosystems are really important to the Montana brewers and their customers. After all, there's a strong correlation between water and fishing, and for some, there's a strong correlation between fishing and beer.(Laughter)So the Montana brewers and their customers are concerned and they're looking for some way to address the problem.So how can they address this remaining water footprint? Remember Prickly Pear. Up until now, business water stewardship has been limited to measuring and reducing, and we're suggesting that the next step is to restore. Remember Prickly Pear. It's a broken system. You've got a disincentive to conserve, because if you don't use your water right, you risk losing your water right. Well, we decided to connect these two worlds \u2014 the world of the companies with their water footprints and the world of the farmers with their senior water rights on these creeks. In some states, senior water rights holders can leave their water in the stream while legally protecting it from others, and maintaining their water right. After all, it is their water right, and if they want to use that water right to help the fish grow in the stream, it's their right to do so. But they have no incentive to do so.So, working with local water trusts, we created an incentive to do so. We pay them to leave their water in stream. That's what's happening here. This individual has made the choice and is closing this water diversion, leaving the water in the stream. He doesn't lose the water right, he just chooses to apply that right, or some portion of it, to the stream, instead of to the land. Because he's the senior water-rights holder, he can protect the water from other users in the stream. OK? He gets paid to leave the water in the stream.This guy's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream. We then take the measured water, we divide it into thousand-gallon increments. Each increment gets a serial number and a certificate, and then the brewers and others buy those certificates as a way to return water to these degraded ecosystems. The brewers pay to restore water to the stream. It provides a simple, inexpensive and measurable way to return water to these degraded ecosystems, while giving farmers an economic choice and giving businesses concerned about their water footprints an easy way to deal with them.After 140 years of conflict and 100 years of dry streams, a circumstance that litigation and regulation has not solved, we put together a market-based, willing buyer, willing seller solution \u2014 a solution that does not require litigation. It's about giving folks concerned about their water footprints a real opportunity to put water where it's critically needed, into these degraded ecosystems, while at the same time providing farmers a meaningful economic choice about how their water is used.These transactions create allies, not enemies. They connect people rather than dividing them. And they provide needed economic support for rural communities. And most importantly, it's working. We've returned more than four billion gallons of water to degraded ecosystems. We've connected senior water-rights holders with brewers in Montana, with hotels and tea companies in Oregon, and with high-tech companies that use a lot of water in the Southwest. And when we make these connections, we can and we do turn this ... into this.(Applause)Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1093, "subtitle":

00:04:52.260\nand they're looking for some way\nto address the problem.\n\n00:04:52.284 --> 00:04:55.903\nSo how can they address\nthis remaining water footprint?\n\n00:04:55.927 --> 00:04:57.432\nRemember Prickly Pear.\n\n00:04:57.456 --> 00:05:01.635\nUp until now, business water stewardship\n\n00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:04.934\nhas been limited\nto measuring and reducing,\n\n00:05:05.933 --> 00:05:09.054\nand we're suggesting\nthat the next step is to restore.\n\n00:05:10.081 --> 00:05:11.253\nRemember Prickly Pear.\n\n00:05:11.277 --> 00:05:12.501\nIt's a broken system.\n\n00:05:12.525 --> 00:05:14.568\nYou've got a disincentive to conserve,\n\n00:05:14.592 --> 00:05:18.337\nbecause if you don't use your water right,\nyou risk losing your water right.\n\n00:05:18.361 --> 00:05:20.748\nWell, we decided to connect\nthese two worlds --\n\n00:05:20.772 --> 00:05:24.093\nthe world of the companies\nwith their water footprints\n\n00:05:24.117 --> 00:05:25.724\nand the world of the farmers\n\n00:05:25.748 --> 00:05:28.197\nwith their senior water rights\non these creeks.\n\n00:05:28.221 --> 00:05:29.527\nIn some states,\n\n00:05:30.282 --> 00:05:34.934\nsenior water rights holders\ncan leave their water in the stream\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:38.112\nwhile legally protecting it from others,\n\n00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:41.667\nand maintaining their water right.\n\n00:05:42.698 --> 00:05:45.112\nAfter all, it is their water right,\n\n00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:49.235\nand if they want to use that water right\nto help the fish grow in the stream,\n\n00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:51.266\nit's their right to do so.\n\n00:05:52.093 --> 00:05:55.934\nBut they have no incentive to do so.\n\n00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.034\nSo, working with local water trusts,\nwe created an incentive to do so.\n\n00:06:02.058 --> 00:06:06.210\nWe pay them to leave\ntheir water in stream.\n\n00:06:06.234 --> 00:06:07.628\nThat's what's happening here.\n\n00:06:07.652 --> 00:06:12.455\nThis individual has made the choice\nand is closing this water diversion,\n\n00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.654\nleaving the water in the stream.\n\n00:06:14.678 --> 00:06:16.319\nHe doesn't lose the water right,\n\n00:06:16.343 --> 00:06:21.112\nhe just chooses to apply that right,\nor some portion of it,\n\n00:06:21.136 --> 00:06:23.639\nto the stream, instead of to the land.\n\n00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.771\nBecause he's the senior\nwater-rights holder,\n\n00:06:26.795 --> 00:06:29.934\nhe can protect the water\nfrom other users in the stream.\n\n00:06:30.908 --> 00:06:32.208\nOK?\n\n00:06:32.232 --> 00:06:34.934\nHe gets paid to leave\nthe water in the stream.\n\n00:06:36.166 --> 00:06:39.269\nThis guy's measuring the water\nthat this leaves in the stream.\n\n00:06:40.523 --> 00:06:43.009\nWe then take the measured water,\n\n00:06:43.033 --> 00:06:45.688\nwe divide it into\nthousand-gallon increments.\n\n00:06:46.198 --> 00:06:49.832\nEach increment gets a serial number\nand a certificate,\n\n00:06:49.856 --> 00:06:53.244\nand then the brewers and others\nbuy those certificates\n\n00:06:53.268 --> 00:06:57.333\nas a way to return water\nto these degraded ecosystems.\n\n00:06:57.357 --> 00:07:00.510\nThe brewers pay\nto restore water to the stream.\n\n00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.871\nIt provides a simple,\ninexpensive and measurable way\n\n00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:09.541\nto return water\nto these degraded ecosystems,\n\n00:07:09.565 --> 00:07:12.458\nwhile giving farmers an economic choice\n\n00:07:12.482 --> 00:07:15.366\nand giving businesses\nconcerned about their water footprints\n\n00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.934\nan easy way to deal with them.\n\n00:07:17.435 --> 00:07:23.505\nAfter 140 years of conflict\nand 100 years of dry streams,\n\n00:07:24.274 --> 00:07:28.260\na circumstance that litigation\nand regulation has not solved,\n\n00:07:29.745 --> 00:07:33.927\nwe put together a market-based,\nwilling buyer, willing seller solution --\n\n00:07:33.951 --> 00:07:36.633\na solution that\ndoes not require litigation.\n\n00:07:38.433 --> 00:07:43.315\nIt's about giving folks\nconcerned about their water footprints\n\n00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:47.166\na real opportunity to put water\nwhere it's critically needed,\n\n00:07:47.944 --> 00:07:50.442\ninto these degraded ecosystems,\n\n00:07:50.466 --> 00:07:56.064\nwhile at the same time providing farmers\na meaningful economic choice\n\n00:07:56.221 --> 00:07:58.130\nabout how their water is used.\n\n00:07:58.154 --> 00:08:00.837\nThese transactions\ncreate allies, not enemies.\n\n00:08:00.861 --> 00:08:03.316\nThey connect people\nrather than dividing them.\n\n00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.054\nAnd they provide needed economic\nsupport for rural communities.\n\n00:08:07.078 --> 00:08:09.062\nAnd most importantly, it's working.\n\n00:08:09.086 --> 00:08:13.755\nWe've returned more than four billion\ngallons of water to degraded ecosystems.\n\n00:08:13.779 --> 00:08:15.808\nWe've connected senior\nwater-rights holders\n\n00:08:15.832 --> 00:08:17.280\nwith brewers in Montana,\n\n00:08:17.304 --> 00:08:20.016\nwith hotels and tea companies in Oregon,\n\n00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.645\nand with high-tech companies\nthat use a lot of water in the Southwest.\n\n00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:26.057\nAnd when we make these connections,\n\n00:08:26.081 --> 00:08:29.286\nwe can and we do turn this ...\n\n00:08:29.921 --> 00:08:31.071\ninto this.\n\n00:08:31.521 --> 00:08:32.891\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:32.915 --> 00:08:34.368\nThank you very much.\n\n00:08:34.392 --> 00:08:38.092\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The social animal", "duration": "1124", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_brooks_the_social_animal", "transcript": "When I got my current job, I was given a good piece of advice, which was to interview three politicians every day. And from that much contact with politicians, I can tell you they're all emotional freaks of one sort or another. They have what I called \"logorrhea dementia,\" which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane. (Laughter) But what they do have is incredible social skills. When you meet them, they lock into you, they look you in the eye, they invade your personal space, they massage the back of your head.I had dinner with a Republican senator several months ago who kept his hand on my inner thigh throughout the whole meal \u2014 squeezing it. I once \u2014 this was years ago \u2014 I saw Ted Kennedy and Dan Quayle meet in the well of the Senate. And they were friends, and they hugged each other and they were laughing, and their faces were like this far apart. And they were moving and grinding and moving their arms up and down each other. And I was like, \"Get a room. I don't want to see this.\" But they have those social skills.Another case: Last election cycle, I was following Mitt Romney around New Hampshire, and he was campaigning with his five perfect sons: Bip, Chip, Rip, Zip, Lip and Dip. (Laughter) And he's going into a diner. And he goes into the diner, introduces himself to a family and says, \"What village are you from in New Hampshire?\" And then he describes the home he owned in their village. And so he goes around the room, and then as he's leaving the diner, he first-names almost everybody he's just met. I was like, \"Okay, that's social skill.\"But the paradox is, when a lot of these people slip into the policy-making mode, that social awareness vanishes and they start talking like accountants. So in the course of my career, I have covered a series of failures. We sent economists in the Soviet Union with privatization plans when it broke up, and what they really lacked was social trust. We invaded Iraq with a military oblivious to the cultural and psychological realities. We had a financial regulatory regime based on the assumptions that traders were rational creatures who wouldn't do anything stupid. For 30 years, I've been covering school reform and we've basically reorganized the bureaucratic boxes \u2014 charters, private schools, vouchers \u2014 but we've had disappointing results year after year. And the fact is, people learn from people they love. And if you're not talking about the individual relationship between a teacher and a student, you're not talking about that reality. But that reality is expunged from our policy-making process.And so that's led to a question for me: Why are the most socially-attuned people on earth completely dehumanized when they think about policy? And I came to the conclusion, this is a symptom of a larger problem. That, for centuries, we've inherited a view of human nature based on the notion that we're divided selves, that reason is separated from the emotions and that society progresses to the extent that reason can suppress the passions. And it's led to a view of human nature that we're rational individuals who respond in straightforward ways to incentives, and it's led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the assumptions of physics to measure how human behavior is. And it's produced a great amputation, a shallow view of human nature.We're really good at talking about material things, but we're really bad at talking about emotions. We're really good at talking about skills and safety and health; we're really bad at talking about character. Alasdair MacIntyre, the famous philosopher, said that, \"We have the concepts of the ancient morality of virtue, honor, goodness, but we no longer have a system by which to connect them.\" And so this has led to a shallow path in politics, but also in a whole range of human endeavors.You can see it in the way we raise our young kids. You go to an elementary school at three in the afternoon and you watch the kids come out, and they're wearing these 80-pound backpacks. If the wind blows them over, they're like beetles stuck there on the ground. You see these cars that drive up \u2014 usually it's Saabs and Audis and Volvos, because in certain neighborhoods it's socially acceptable to have a luxury car, so long as it comes from a country hostile to U.S. foreign policy \u2014 that's fine. They get picked up by these creatures I've called uber-moms, who are highly successful career women who have taken time off to make sure all their kids get into Harvard. And you can usually tell the uber-moms because they actually weigh less than their own children. (Laughter) So at the moment of conception, they're doing little butt exercises. Babies flop out, they're flashing Mandarin flashcards at the things.Driving them home, and they want them to be enlightened, so they take them to Ben & Jerry's ice cream company with its own foreign policy. In one of my books, I joke that Ben & Jerry's should make a pacifist toothpaste \u2014 doesn't kill germs, just asks them to leave. It would be a big seller. (Laughter) And they go to Whole Foods to get their baby formula, and Whole Foods is one of those progressive grocery stores where all the cashiers look like they're on loan from Amnesty International. (Laughter) They buy these seaweed-based snacks there called Veggie Booty with Kale, which is for kids who come home and say, \"Mom, mom, I want a snack that'll help prevent colon-rectal cancer.\"(Laughter)And so the kids are raised in a certain way, jumping through achievement hoops of the things we can measure \u2014 SAT prep, oboe, soccer practice. They get into competitive colleges, they get good jobs, and sometimes they make a success of themselves in a superficial manner, and they make a ton of money. And sometimes you can see them at vacation places like Jackson Hole or Aspen. And they've become elegant and slender \u2014 they don't really have thighs; they just have one elegant calve on top of another. (Laughter) They have kids of their own, and they've achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people, so their grandmoms look like Gertrude Stein, their daughters looks like Halle Berry \u2014 I don't know how they've done that. They get there and they realize it's fashionable now to have dogs a third as tall as your ceiling heights. So they've got these furry 160-pound dogs \u2014 all look like velociraptors, all named after Jane Austen characters.And then when they get old, they haven't really developed a philosophy of life, but they've decided, \"I've been successful at everything; I'm just not going to die.\" And so they hire personal trainers; they're popping Cialis like breath mints. You see them on the mountains up there. They're cross-country skiing up the mountain with these grim expressions that make Dick Cheney look like Jerry Lewis. (Laughter) And as they whiz by you, it's like being passed by a little iron Raisinet going up the hill.(Laughter)And so this is part of what life is, but it's not all of what life is. And over the past few years, I think we've been given a deeper view of human nature and a deeper view of who we are. And it's not based on theology or philosophy, it's in the study of the mind, across all these spheres of research, from neuroscience to the cognitive scientists, behavioral economists, psychologists, sociology, we're developing a revolution in consciousness. And when you synthesize it all, it's giving us a new view of human nature. And far from being a coldly materialistic view of nature, it's a new humanism, it's a new enchantment. And I think when you synthesize this research, you start with three key insights.The first insight is that while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species, the unconscious mind does most of the work. And so one way to formulate that is the human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute, of which it can be consciously aware of about 40. And this leads to oddities. One of my favorite is that people named Dennis are disproportionately likely to become dentists, people named Lawrence become lawyers, because unconsciously we gravitate toward things that sound familiar, which is why I named my daughter President of the United States Brooks. (Laughter) Another finding is that the unconscious, far from being dumb and sexualized, is actually quite smart. So one of the most cognitively demanding things we do is buy furniture. It's really hard to imagine a sofa, how it's going to look in your house. And the way you should do that is study the furniture, let it marinate in your mind, distract yourself, and then a few days later, go with your gut, because unconsciously you've figured it out.The second insight is that emotions are at the center of our thinking. People with strokes and lesions in the emotion-processing parts of the brain are not super smart, they're actually sometimes quite helpless. And the \"giant\" in the field is in the room tonight and is speaking tomorrow morning \u2014 Antonio Damasio. And one of the things he's really shown us is that emotions are not separate from reason, but they are the foundation of reason because they tell us what to value. And so reading and educating your emotions is one of the central activities of wisdom.Now I'm a middle-aged guy. I'm not exactly comfortable with emotions. One of my favorite brain stories described these middle-aged guys. They put them into a brain scan machine \u2014 this is apocryphal by the way, but I don't care \u2014 and they had them watch a horror movie, and then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives. And the brain scans were identical in both activities. It was just sheer terror. So me talking about emotion is like Gandhi talking about gluttony, but it is the central organizing process of the way we think. It tells us what to imprint. The brain is the record of the feelings of a life.And the third insight is that we're not primarily self-contained individuals. We're social animals, not rational animals. We emerge out of relationships, and we are deeply interpenetrated, one with another. And so when we see another person, we reenact in our own minds what we see in their minds. When we watch a car chase in a movie, it's almost as if we are subtly having a car chase. When we watch pornography, it's a little like having sex, though probably not as good. And we see this when lovers walk down the street, when a crowd in Egypt or Tunisia gets caught up in an emotional contagion, the deep interpenetration. And this revolution in who we are gives us a different way of seeing, I think, politics, a different way, most importantly, of seeing human capital.We are now children of the French Enlightenment. We believe that reason is the highest of the faculties. But I think this research shows that the British Enlightenment, or the Scottish Enlightenment, with David Hume, Adam Smith, actually had a better handle on who we are \u2014 that reason is often weak, our sentiments are strong, and our sentiments are often trustworthy. And this work corrects that bias in our culture, that dehumanizing bias. It gives us a deeper sense of what it actually takes for us to thrive in this life. When we think about human capital we think about the things we can measure easily \u2014 things like grades, SAT's, degrees, the number of years in schooling. What it really takes to do well, to lead a meaningful life, are things that are deeper, things we don't really even have words for. And so let me list just a couple of the things I think this research points us toward trying to understand.The first gift, or talent, is mindsight \u2014 the ability to enter into other people's minds and learn what they have to offer. Babies come with this ability. Meltzoff, who's at the University of Washington, leaned over a baby who was 43 minutes old. He wagged his tongue at the baby. The baby wagged her tongue back. Babies are born to interpenetrate into Mom's mind and to download what they find \u2014 their models of how to understand reality. In the United States, 55 percent of babies have a deep two-way conversation with Mom and they learn models to how to relate to other people. And those people who have models of how to relate have a huge head start in life. Scientists at the University of Minnesota did a study in which they could predict with 77 percent accuracy, at age 18 months, who was going to graduate from high school, based on who had good attachment with mom. Twenty percent of kids do not have those relationships. They are what we call avoidantly attached. They have trouble relating to other people. They go through life like sailboats tacking into the wind \u2014 wanting to get close to people, but not really having the models of how to do that. And so this is one skill of how to hoover up knowledge, one from another.A second skill is equipoise, the ability to have the serenity to read the biases and failures in your own mind. So for example, we are overconfidence machines. Ninety-five percent of our professors report that they are above-average teachers. Ninety-six percent of college students say they have above-average social skills. Time magazine asked Americans, \"Are you in the top one percent of earners?\" Nineteen percent of Americans are in the top one percent of earners. (Laughter) This is a gender-linked trait, by the way. Men drown at twice the rate of women, because men think they can swim across that lake. But some people have the ability and awareness of their own biases, their own overconfidence. They have epistemological modesty. They are open-minded in the face of ambiguity. They are able to adjust strength of the conclusions to the strength of their evidence. They are curious. And these traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with IQ.The third trait is metis, what we might call street smarts \u2014 it's a Greek word. It's a sensitivity to the physical environment, the ability to pick out patterns in an environment \u2014 derive a gist. One of my colleagues at the Times did a great story about soldiers in Iraq who could look down a street and detect somehow whether there was an IED, a landmine, in the street. They couldn't tell you how they did it, but they could feel cold, they felt a coldness, and they were more often right than wrong. The third is what you might call sympathy, the ability to work within groups. And that comes in tremendously handy, because groups are smarter than individuals. And face-to-face groups are much smarter than groups that communicate electronically, because 90 percent of our communication is non-verbal. And the effectiveness of a group is not determined by the IQ of the group; it's determined by how well they communicate, how often they take turns in conversation.Then you could talk about a trait like blending. Any child can say, \"I'm a tiger,\" pretend to be a tiger. It seems so elementary. But in fact, it's phenomenally complicated to take a concept \"I\" and a concept \"tiger\" and blend them together. But this is the source of innovation. What Picasso did, for example, was take the concept \"Western art\" and the concept \"African masks\" and blend them together \u2014 not only the geometry, but the moral systems entailed in them. And these are skills, again, we can't count and measure.And then the final thing I'll mention is something you might call limerence. And this is not an ability; it's a drive and a motivation. The conscious mind hungers for success and prestige. The unconscious mind hungers for those moments of transcendence, when the skull line disappears and we are lost in a challenge or a task \u2014 when a craftsman feels lost in his craft, when a naturalist feels at one with nature, when a believer feels at one with God's love. That is what the unconscious mind hungers for. And many of us feel it in love when lovers feel fused.And one of the most beautiful descriptions I've come across in this research of how minds interpenetrate was written by a great theorist and scientist named Douglas Hofstadter at the University of Indiana. He was married to a woman named Carol, and they had a wonderful relationship. When their kids were five and two, Carol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly. And Hofstadter wrote a book called \"I Am a Strange Loop.\" In the course of that book, he describes a moment \u2014 just months after Carol has died \u2014 he comes across her picture on the mantel, or on a bureau in his bedroom.And here's what he wrote: \"I looked at her face, and I looked so deeply that I felt I was behind her eyes. And all at once I found myself saying as tears flowed, 'That's me. That's me.' And those simple words brought back many thoughts that I had had before, about the fusion of our souls into one higher-level entity, about the fact that at the core of both our souls lay our identical hopes and dreams for our children, about the notion that those hopes were not separate or distinct hopes, but were just one hope, one clear thing that defined us both, that welded us into a unit \u2014 the kind of unit I had but dimly imagined before being married and having children. I realized that, though Carol had died, that core piece of her had not died at all, but had lived on very determinedly in my brain.\"The Greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom. Through his suffering, Hofstadter understood how deeply interpenetrated we are. Through the policy failures of the last 30 years, we have come to acknowledge, I think, how shallow our view of human nature has been. And now as we confront that shallowness and the failures that derive from our inability to get the depths of who we are, comes this revolution in consciousness \u2014 these people in so many fields exploring the depth of our nature and coming away with this enchanted, this new humanism. And when Freud discovered his sense of the unconscious, it had a vast effect on the climate of the times. Now we are discovering a more accurate vision of the unconscious, of who we are deep inside, and it's going to have a wonderful and profound and humanizing effect on our culture.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1094, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nWhen I got my current job, I was given a good piece of advice,\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nwhich was to interview three politicians every day.\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nAnd from that much contact with politicians,\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nI can tell you they're all emotional freaks of one sort or another.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nThey have what I called \"logorrhea dementia,\"\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nwhich is they talk so much they drive themselves insane.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nBut what they do have is incredible social skills.\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nWhen you meet them, they lock into you,\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nthey look you in the eye,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nthey invade your personal space,\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nthey massage the back of your head.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nI had dinner with a Republican senator several months ago\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nwho kept his hand on my inner thigh\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nthroughout the whole meal -- squeezing it.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nI once -- this was years ago --\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nI saw Ted Kennedy and Dan Quayle meet in the well of the Senate.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nAnd they were friends, and they hugged each other\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nand they were laughing, and their faces were like this far apart.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nAnd they were moving and grinding\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nand moving their arms up and down each other.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nAnd I was like, \"Get a room. I don't want to see this.\"\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nBut they have those social skills.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nAnother case:\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nLast election cycle,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nI was following Mitt Romney around New Hampshire,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nand he was campaigning with his five perfect sons:\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nBip, Chip, Rip, Zip, Lip and Dip.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nAnd he's going into a diner.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nAnd he goes into the diner, introduces himself to a family\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nand says, \"What village are you from in New Hampshire?\"\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nAnd then he describes the home he owned in their village.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nAnd so he goes around the room,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nand then as he's leaving the diner,\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nhe first-names almost everybody he's just met.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nI was like, \"Okay, that's social skill.\"\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nBut the paradox is,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nwhen a lot of these people slip into the policy-making mode,\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nthat social awareness vanishes\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nand they start talking like accountants.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nSo in the course of my career,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nI have covered a series of failures.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nWe sent economists in the Soviet Union\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nwith privatization plans when it broke up,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nand what they really lacked was social trust.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nWe invaded Iraq with a military\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\noblivious to the cultural and psychological realities.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nWe had a financial regulatory regime\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nbased on the assumptions\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nthat traders were rational creatures\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nwho wouldn't do anything stupid.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nFor 30 years, I've been covering school reform\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nand we've basically reorganized the bureaucratic boxes --\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\ncharters, private schools, vouchers --\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nbut we've had disappointing results year after year.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nAnd the fact is, people learn from people they love.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nAnd if you're not talking about the individual relationship\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nbetween a teacher and a student,\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nyou're not talking about that reality.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nBut that reality is expunged\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nfrom our policy-making process.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nAnd so that's led to a question for me:\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nWhy are the most socially-attuned people on earth\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\ncompletely dehumanized\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nwhen they think about policy?\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nAnd I came to the conclusion,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nthis is a symptom of a larger problem.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nThat, for centuries, we've inherited a view of human nature\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nbased on the notion\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nthat we're divided selves,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nthat reason is separated from the emotions\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nand that society progresses\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nto the extent that reason can suppress the passions.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nAnd it's led to a view of human nature\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nthat we're rational individuals\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nwho respond in straightforward ways to incentives,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nand it's led to ways of seeing the world\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nwhere people try to use the assumptions of physics\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nto measure how human behavior is.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nAnd it's produced a great amputation,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\na shallow view of human nature.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nWe're really good at talking about material things,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nbut we're really bad at talking about emotions.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nWe're really good at talking about skills\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nand safety and health;\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nwe're really bad at talking about character.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAlasdair MacIntyre, the famous philosopher,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nsaid that, \"We have the concepts of the ancient morality\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nof virtue, honor, goodness,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nbut we no longer have a system\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nby which to connect them.\"\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nAnd so this has led to a shallow path in politics,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nbut also in a whole range of human endeavors.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nYou can see it in the way we raise our young kids.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nYou go to an elementary school at three in the afternoon\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nand you watch the kids come out,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nand they're wearing these 80-pound backpacks.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nIf the wind blows them over, they're like beetles stuck there on the ground.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nYou see these cars that drive up --\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nusually it's Saabs and Audis and Volvos,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nbecause in certain neighborhoods it's socially acceptable to have a luxury car,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nso long as it comes from a country hostile to U.S. foreign policy --\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nthat's fine.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nThey get picked up by these creatures I've called uber-moms,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nwho are highly successful career women\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nwho have taken time off to make sure all their kids get into Harvard.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nAnd you can usually tell the uber-moms\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nbecause they actually weigh less than their own children.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nSo at the moment of conception,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nthey're doing little butt exercises.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nBabies flop out,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nthey're flashing Mandarin flashcards at the things.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nDriving them home, and they want them to be enlightened,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nso they take them to Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream company\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nwith its own foreign policy.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nIn one of my books,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nI joke that Ben &amp; Jerry's should make a pacifist toothpaste --\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\ndoesn't kill germs, just asks them to leave.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nIt would be a big seller.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAnd they go to Whole Foods to get their baby formula,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nand Whole Foods is one of those progressive grocery stores\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nwhere all the cashiers look like they're on loan from Amnesty International.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nThey buy these seaweed-based snacks there\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\ncalled Veggie Booty with Kale,\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nwhich is for kids who come home and say,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\n\"Mom, mom, I want a snack that'll help prevent colon-rectal cancer.\"\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nAnd so the kids are raised in a certain way,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\njumping through achievement hoops of the things we can measure --\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nSAT prep, oboe, soccer practice.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nThey get into competitive colleges, they get good jobs,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nand sometimes they make a success of themselves\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nin a superficial manner, and they make a ton of money.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nAnd sometimes you can see them at vacation places\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nlike Jackson Hole or Aspen.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nAnd they've become elegant and slender --\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nthey don't really have thighs;\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nthey just have one elegant calve on top of another.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nThey have kids of their own,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nand they've achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nso their grandmoms look like Gertrude Stein,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\ntheir daughters looks like Halle Berry -- I don't know how they've done that.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nThey get there and they realize\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nit's fashionable now to have dogs a third as tall as your ceiling heights.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nSo they've got these furry 160-pound dogs --\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nall look like velociraptors,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nall named after Jane Austen characters.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nAnd then when they get old, they haven't really developed a philosophy of life,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nbut they've decided, \"I've been successful at everything;\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nI'm just not going to die.\"\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nAnd so they hire personal trainers;\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nthey're popping Cialis like breath mints.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nYou see them on the mountains up there.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nThey're cross-country skiing up the mountain\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nwith these grim expressions\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nthat make Dick Cheney look like Jerry Lewis.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nAnd as they whiz by you,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nit's like being passed by a little iron Raisinet\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\ngoing up the hill.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nAnd so this is part of what life is,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nbut it's not all of what life is.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nAnd over the past few years,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nI think we've been given a deeper view of human nature\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nand a deeper view of who we are.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAnd it's not based on theology or philosophy,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nit's in the study of the mind,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nacross all these spheres of research,\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nfrom neuroscience to the cognitive scientists,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nbehavioral economists, psychologists,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nsociology,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nwe're developing a revolution in consciousness.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nAnd when you synthesize it all,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nit's giving us a new view of human nature.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nAnd far from being a coldly materialistic view of nature,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nit's a new humanism, it's a new enchantment.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nAnd I think when you synthesize this research,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nyou start with three key insights.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nThe first insight is\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nthat while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nthe unconscious mind does most of the work.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nAnd so one way to formulate that is\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nthe human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nof which it can be consciously aware of about 40.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nAnd this leads to oddities.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nOne of my favorite is that people named Dennis\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nare disproportionately likely to become dentists,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\npeople named Lawrence become lawyers,\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nbecause unconsciously we gravitate toward things\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nthat sound familiar,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nwhich is why I named my daughter President of the United States Brooks.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nAnother finding is that the unconscious,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nfar from being dumb and sexualized,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nis actually quite smart.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nSo one of the most cognitively demanding things we do is buy furniture.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nIt's really hard to imagine a sofa, how it's going to look in your house.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nAnd the way you should do that\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nis study the furniture,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nlet it marinate in your mind, distract yourself,\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nand then a few days later, go with your gut,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nbecause unconsciously you've figured it out.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nThe second insight\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nis that emotions are at the center of our thinking.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nPeople with strokes and lesions\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nin the emotion-processing parts of the brain\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nare not super smart,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nthey're actually sometimes quite helpless.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nAnd the \"giant\" in the field is in the room tonight\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nand is speaking tomorrow morning -- Antonio Damasio.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nAnd one of the things he's really shown us\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nis that emotions are not separate from reason,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nbut they are the foundation of reason\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nbecause they tell us what to value.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nAnd so reading and educating your emotions\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nis one of the central activities of wisdom.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nNow I'm a middle-aged guy.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nI'm not exactly comfortable with emotions.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nOne of my favorite brain stories described these middle-aged guys.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nThey put them into a brain scan machine --\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nthis is apocryphal by the way, but I don't care --\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nand they had them watch a horror movie,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nand then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nAnd the brain scans were identical in both activities.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nIt was just sheer terror.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nSo me talking about emotion\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nis like Gandhi talking about gluttony,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nbut it is the central organizing process\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nof the way we think.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nIt tells us what to imprint.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nThe brain is the record of the feelings of a life.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nAnd the third insight\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nis that we're not primarily self-contained individuals.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nWe're social animals, not rational animals.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nWe emerge out of relationships,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nand we are deeply interpenetrated, one with another.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nAnd so when we see another person,\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nwe reenact in our own minds\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nwhat we see in their minds.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nWhen we watch a car chase in a movie,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nit's almost as if we are subtly having a car chase.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nWhen we watch pornography,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nit's a little like having sex,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nthough probably not as good.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nAnd we see this when lovers walk down the street,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nwhen a crowd in Egypt or Tunisia\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\ngets caught up in an emotional contagion,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nthe deep interpenetration.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nAnd this revolution in who we are\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\ngives us a different way of seeing, I think, politics,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\na different way, most importantly,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nof seeing human capital.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nWe are now children of the French Enlightenment.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nWe believe that reason is the highest of the faculties.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nBut I think this research shows\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nthat the British Enlightenment, or the Scottish Enlightenment,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nwith David Hume, Adam Smith,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nactually had a better handle on who we are --\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nthat reason is often weak, our sentiments are strong,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nand our sentiments are often trustworthy.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nAnd this work corrects that bias in our culture,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nthat dehumanizing bias.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nIt gives us a deeper sense\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nof what it actually takes\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nfor us to thrive in this life.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nWhen we think about human capital\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nwe think about the things we can measure easily --\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nthings like grades, SAT's, degrees,\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nthe number of years in schooling.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nWhat it really takes to do well, to lead a meaningful life,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nare things that are deeper,\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nthings we don't really even have words for.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nAnd so let me list just a couple of the things\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nI think this research points us toward trying to understand.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nThe first gift, or talent, is mindsight --\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nthe ability to enter into other people's minds\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nand learn what they have to offer.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nBabies come with this ability.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nMeltzoff, who's at the University of Washington,\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nleaned over a baby who was 43 minutes old.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nHe wagged his tongue at the baby.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nThe baby wagged her tongue back.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nBabies are born to interpenetrate into Mom's mind\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nand to download what they find --\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\ntheir models of how to understand reality.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nIn the United States, 55 percent of babies\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nhave a deep two-way conversation with Mom\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nand they learn models to how to relate to other people.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nAnd those people who have models of how to relate\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nhave a huge head start in life.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nScientists at the University of Minnesota did a study\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nin which they could predict\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nwith 77 percent accuracy, at age 18 months,\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nwho was going to graduate from high school,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nbased on who had good attachment with mom.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nTwenty percent of kids do not have those relationships.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nThey are what we call avoidantly attached.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nThey have trouble relating to other people.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nThey go through life\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nlike sailboats tacking into the wind --\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nwanting to get close to people,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nbut not really having the models of how to do that.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nAnd so this is one skill\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nof how to hoover up knowledge, one from another.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nA second skill is equipoise,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nthe ability to have the serenity\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nto read the biases and failures in your own mind.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nSo for example, we are overconfidence machines.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nNinety-five percent of our professors report\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nthat they are above-average teachers.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nNinety-six percent of college students\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nsay they have above-average social skills.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nTime magazine asked Americans, \"Are you in the top one percent of earners?\"\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nNineteen percent of Americans are in the top one percent of earners.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nThis is a gender-linked trait, by the way.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nMen drown at twice the rate of women,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nbecause men think they can swim across that lake.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nBut some people have the ability and awareness\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nof their own biases, their own overconfidence.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nThey have epistemological modesty.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nThey are open-minded in the face of ambiguity.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nThey are able to adjust strength of the conclusions\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nto the strength of their evidence.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nThey are curious.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nAnd these traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with IQ.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nThe third trait is metis,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nwhat we might call street smarts -- it's a Greek word.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nIt's a sensitivity to the physical environment,\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nthe ability to pick out patterns in an environment --\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nderive a gist.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nOne of my colleagues at the Times\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\ndid a great story about soldiers in Iraq\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nwho could look down a street and detect somehow\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nwhether there was an IED, a landmine, in the street.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nThey couldn't tell you how they did it,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nbut they could feel cold, they felt a coldness,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nand they were more often right than wrong.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nThe third is what you might call sympathy,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nthe ability to work within groups.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nAnd that comes in tremendously handy,\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nbecause groups are smarter than individuals.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd face-to-face groups are much smarter\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nthan groups that communicate electronically,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nbecause 90 percent of our communication is non-verbal.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nAnd the effectiveness of a group\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nis not determined by the IQ of the group;\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nit's determined by how well they communicate,\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nhow often they take turns in conversation.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nThen you could talk about a trait like blending.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nAny child can say, \"I'm a tiger,\" pretend to be a tiger.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nIt seems so elementary.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nBut in fact, it's phenomenally complicated\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nto take a concept \"I\" and a concept \"tiger\"\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nand blend them together.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nBut this is the source of innovation.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nWhat Picasso did, for example,\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nwas take the concept \"Western art\"\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nand the concept \"African masks\"\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nand blend them together --\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nnot only the geometry,\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nbut the moral systems entailed in them.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nAnd these are skills, again, we can't count and measure.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nAnd then the final thing I'll mention\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nis something you might call limerence.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nAnd this is not an ability;\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nit's a drive and a motivation.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nThe conscious mind hungers for success and prestige.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nThe unconscious mind hungers\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nfor those moments of transcendence,\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nwhen the skull line disappears\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nand we are lost in a challenge or a task --\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nwhen a craftsman feels lost in his craft,\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nwhen a naturalist feels at one with nature,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nwhen a believer feels at one with God's love.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nThat is what the unconscious mind hungers for.\n\n00:15:47.958 -->

00:15:56.958\nI've come across in this research\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nof how minds interpenetrate\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nwas written by a great theorist and scientist\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nnamed Douglas Hofstadter at the University of Indiana.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nHe was married to a woman named Carol,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nand they had a wonderful relationship.\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nWhen their kids were five and two,\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nCarol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nAnd Hofstadter wrote a book\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\ncalled \"I Am a Strange Loop.\"\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nIn the course of that book, he describes a moment --\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\njust months after Carol has died --\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nhe comes across her picture on the mantel,\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nor on a bureau in his bedroom.\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nAnd here's what he wrote:\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\n\"I looked at her face,\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nand I looked so deeply\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nthat I felt I was behind her eyes.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nAnd all at once I found myself saying\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nas tears flowed,\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.958\n'That's me. That's me.'\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nAnd those simple words\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nbrought back many thoughts that I had had before,\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nabout the fusion of our souls\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.958\ninto one higher-level entity,\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nabout the fact that at the core of both our souls\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nlay our identical hopes and dreams for our children,\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nabout the notion that those hopes\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nwere not separate or distinct hopes,\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nbut were just one hope,\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.958\none clear thing that defined us both,\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nthat welded us into a unit --\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nthe kind of unit I had but dimly imagined\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nbefore being married and having children.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nI realized that, though Carol had died,\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nthat core piece of her had not died at all,\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nbut had lived on very determinedly in my brain.\"\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nThe Greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nThrough his suffering, Hofstadter understood\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nhow deeply interpenetrated we are.\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nThrough the policy failures of the last 30 years,\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nwe have come to acknowledge, I think,\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nhow shallow our view of human nature has been.\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nAnd now as we confront that shallowness\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nand the failures that derive from our inability\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nto get the depths of who we are,\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:46.958\ncomes this revolution in consciousness --\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nthese people in so many fields\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nexploring the depth of our nature\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nand coming away with this enchanted,\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nthis new humanism.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nAnd when Freud discovered his sense of the unconscious,\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nit had a vast effect on the climate of the times.\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nNow we are discovering a more accurate vision\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nof the unconscious, of who we are deep inside,\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nand it's going to have a wonderful and profound\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nand humanizing effect on our culture.\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:12.958\nThank you.\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:32.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The sound the universe makes", "duration": "1063", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/janna_levin_the_sound_the_universe_makes", "transcript": "I want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that, by far, most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light. We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes. The Sun burns our peripheral vision. We see light reflected off the Moon. And in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies, the known universe has come to us through light, across vast eras in cosmic history. And with all of our modern telescopes, we've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe \u2014 these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the Big Bang.And yet, the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn't silent. I'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself, because space can wobble like a drum. It can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold. Now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe \u2014 a sonic composition. And while we've never heard the sounds from space, we really should, in the next few years, start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there.So in this ambition to capture songs from the universe, we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have, because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song, which I'd like to play for you \u2014 some of our predictions for what that song will be like. Now black holes are dark against a dark sky. We can't see them directly. They're not brought to us with light, at least not directly. We can see them indirectly, because black holes wreak havoc on their environment. They destroy stars around them. They churn up debris in their surroundings. But they won't come to us directly through light. We might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background, but we haven't yet. And yet black holes may be heard even if they're not seen, and that's because they bang on space-time like a drum.Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein \u2014 to whom we owe so much. Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would be like this picture, except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it. But if we were freely falling through the space, even without this helpful grid, we might be able to paint it ourselves, because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines, undeflected straight paths through the universe. Einstein also realized \u2014 and this is the real meat of the matter \u2014 that if you put energy or mass in the universe, it would curve space, and a freely falling object would pass by, let's say, the Sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space. It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity. Now even light will be bent by those paths. And you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the Sun, as the Earth is, or the Moon around the Earth. These are the natural curves in space.What Einstein did not realize was that, if you took our Sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers \u2014 so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across, you would make a black hole, an object so dense that if light veered too close, it would never escape \u2014 a dark shadow against the universe. It wasn't Einstein who realized this, it was Karl Schwarzschild who was a German Jew in World War I \u2014 joined the German army already an accomplished scientist, working on the Russian front. I like to imagine Schwarzschild in the war in the trenches calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire, and then, in between, calculating Einstein's equations \u2014 as you do in the trenches. And he was reading Einstein's recently published general theory of relativity, and he was thrilled by this theory. And he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary: curves so strong that space would rain down into them, space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole. And even light could not escape this current. Light would be dragged down the hole as everything else would be, and all that would be left would be a shadow.Now he wrote to Einstein, and he said, \"As you will see, the war has been kind to me enough. Despite the heavy gunfire, I've been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas.\" And Einstein was very impressed with his exact solution, and I should hope also the dedication of the scientist. This is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions. And he took Schwarzschild's idea to the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week. But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity. He did not believe they existed in nature. He thought nature would protect us from their formation. It was decades before the term \"black hole\" was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects \u2014 in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime.Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole. It's actually not massive enough. But if we did a little thought experiment \u2014 as Einstein was very fond of doing \u2014 we could imagine putting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers, and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit, maybe 30 kilometers outside of the black-hole sun. And it would be self-illuminated, because now the Sun's gone, we have no other source of light \u2014 so let's make our little Earth self-illuminated. And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this crushed black hole. This crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan, more or less. It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth. But basically that's what we're talking about. We're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan.So we move this Earth very close \u2014 30 kilometers outside \u2014 and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole. There's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but you actually have to get very close to fall in. But what's very impressive is that, from our vantage point, we can always see the Earth. It cannot hide behind the black hole. The light from the Earth, some of it falls in, but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us. So you can't hide anything behind a black hole. If this were Battlestar Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole. They can see you.Now, our Sun will not collapse to a black hole \u2014 it's not massive enough \u2014 but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy. And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way, this is what it would look like. We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes. And if we were to fall towards this black hole, we would see all of that light lensed around it, and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened. It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't, anymore than light can escape.But even though the black hole is dark from the outside, it's not dark on the inside, because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us. And even though, due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation, our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time, it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us, right before we were crushed to death by the black hole. It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a total death experience. (Laughter) And there's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel.Now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they're not seen. Imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation \u2014 imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together. Maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes \u2014 each one 10 times the mass of the Sun. So now we're going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across. They can be spinning hundreds of times a second. At the end of their lives, they're going around each other very near the speed of light. So they're crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second, and as they do so, they not only curve space, but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space, an actual wave on space-time. Space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe. And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.This computer simulation is due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard. It took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem. This was one of the groups. It shows two black holes in orbit around each other, again, with these helpfully painted curves. And if you can see \u2014 it's kind of faint \u2014 but if you can see the red waves emanating out, those are the gravitational waves. They're literally the sounds of space ringing, and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one spinning, quiet black hole at the end of the day. If you were standing near enough, your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space. You would literally hear the sound. Now of course, your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully, so you might have trouble understanding what's going on. But I'd like to play for you the sound that we predict.This is from my group \u2014 a slightly less glamorous computer modeling. Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole. The sound you're hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close. If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet. But it comes in like a mallet, and it literally cracks space, wobbling it like a drum. And we can predict what the sound will be. We know that, as it falls in, it gets faster and it gets louder. And eventually, we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy. (Thumping) Then it's gone. Now I've never heard it that loud \u2014 it's actually more dramatic. At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic. It's sort of like ding, ding, ding.This is another sound from my group. No, I'm not showing you any images, because black holes don't leave behind helpful trails of ink, and space is not painted, showing you the curves. But if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this, you want to get moving. (Laughter) Want to get away from the sound. Both black holes are moving. Both black holes are getting closer together. In this case, they're both wobbling quite a lot. And then they're going to merge. (Thumping) Now it's gone. Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging \u2014 that it chirps up at the end. Now that's our prediction for what we'll see.Luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach, California. And surely, somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged. And surely, the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years, or a million years, at the speed of light to get to us. But the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear. There are very industrious experiments being built on Earth \u2014 one called LIGO \u2014 which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers. It's a remarkably ambitious experiment, and it's going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years \u2014 to pick this up. There's also a mission proposed for space, which hopefully will launch in the next ten years, called LISA. And LISA will be able to see super-massive black holes \u2014 black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun.In this Hubble image, we see two galaxies. They look like they're frozen in some embrace. And each one probably harbors a super-massive black hole at its core. But they're not frozen; they're actually merging. These two black holes are colliding, and they will merge over a billion-year time scale. It's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration. But LISA could see the final stages of two super-massive black holes earlier in the universe's history, the last 15 minutes before they fall together. And it's not just black holes, but it's also any big disturbance in the universe \u2014 and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang. When that expression was coined, it was derisive \u2014 like, \"Oh, who would believe in a Big Bang?\" But now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang. It might make a sound.This animation from my friends at Proton Studios shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside. We don't ever want to do that actually. We want to be inside the universe because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe. So imagine you're inside the Big Bang. It's everywhere, it's all around you, and the space is wobbling chaotically. Fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us. Galaxies form, and generations of stars form in those galaxies, and around one star, at least one star, is a habitable planet. And here we are frantically building these experiments, doing these calculations, writing these computer codes.Imagine a billion years ago, two black holes collided. That song has been ringing through space for all that time. We weren't even here. It gets closer and closer \u2014 40,000 years ago, we're still doing cave paintings. It's like hurry, build your instruments. It's getting closer and closer, and in 20 ... whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity \u2014 we'll build them, we'll turn on the machines and, bang, we'll catch it \u2014 the first song from space. If it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up, it would sound like this. (Static) It's a terrible sound. It's literally the definition of noise. It's white noise; it's such a chaotic ringing. But it's around us everywhere, presumably, if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe. And if we pick it up, it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation, of our observable universe.So within the next few years, we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit, render the universe in audio. But if we detect those earliest moments, it'll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang, which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest, most elusive, questions. If we run the movie of our universe backwards, we know that there was a Big Bang in our past, and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it, but was our Big Bang the only Big Bang? I mean we have to ask, has it happened before? Will it happen again? I mean, in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge to reignite wonder, we can ask questions, at least for this last minute, that honestly might evade us forever.But we have to ask: Is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history? Or, is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse \u2014 each branch with its own Big Bang in its past \u2014 maybe some of them with black holes playing drums, maybe some without \u2014 maybe some with sentient life, and maybe some without \u2014 not in our past, not in our future, but somehow fundamentally connected to us? So we have to wonder, if there is a multiverse, in some other patch of that multiverse, are there creatures? Here's my multiverse creatures. Are there other creatures in the multiverse, wondering about us and wondering about their own origins? And if they are, I can imagine them as we are, calculating, writing computer code, building instruments, trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there.Thank you.

drum\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nand have a very characteristic song,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nwhich I'd like to play for you -- some of our predictions\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nfor what that song will be like.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nNow black holes are dark against a dark sky.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nWe can't see them directly.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nThey're not brought to us with light, at least not directly.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nWe can see them indirectly,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nbecause black holes wreak havoc on their environment.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nThey destroy stars around them.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nThey churn up debris in their surroundings.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nBut they won't come to us directly through light.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nWe might one day see a shadow\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\na black hole can cast on a very bright background,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nbut we haven't yet.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nAnd yet black holes may be heard\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\neven if they're not seen,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nand that's because they bang on space-time like a drum.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nNow we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nto Albert Einstein -- to whom we owe so much.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nEinstein realized that if space were empty,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nif the universe were empty,\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nit would be like this picture,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nexcept for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nBut if we were freely falling through the space,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\neven without this helpful grid,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nwe might be able to paint it ourselves,\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nbecause we would notice that we traveled along straight lines,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nundeflected straight paths\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nthrough the universe.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nEinstein also realized --\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nand this is the real meat of the matter --\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nthat if you put energy or mass in the universe,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nit would curve space,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nand a freely falling object\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nwould pass by, let's say, the Sun\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nand it would be deflected\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nalong the natural curves in the space.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nIt was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nNow even light will be bent by those paths.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nAnd you can be bent so much\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nthat you're caught in orbit around the Sun,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nas the Earth is, or the Moon around the Earth.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nThese are the natural curves in space.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nWhat Einstein did not realize\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nwas that, if you took our Sun\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nand you crushed it down to six kilometers --\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nso you took a million times the mass of the Earth\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nand you crushed it to six kilometers across,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nyou would make a black hole,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nan object so dense\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nthat if light veered too close, it would never escape --\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\na dark shadow against the universe.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nIt wasn't Einstein who realized this,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nit was Karl Schwarzschild\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nwho was a German Jew in World War I --\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\njoined the German army already an accomplished scientist,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nworking on the Russian front.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nI like to imagine Schwarzschild in the war in the trenches\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:24.958\ncalculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nand then, in between,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\ncalculating Einstein's equations --\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nas you do in the trenches.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nAnd he was reading Einstein's recently published\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\ngeneral theory of relativity,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nand he was thrilled by this theory.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nAnd he quickly surmised\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nan exact mathematical solution\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nthat described something very extraordinary:\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\ncurves so strong\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nthat space would rain down into them,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nspace itself would curve like a waterfall\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nflowing down the throat of a hole.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nAnd even light could not escape this current.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nLight would be dragged down the hole\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nas everything else would be,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nand all that would be left would be a shadow.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nNow he wrote to Einstein,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nand he said, \"As you will see,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nthe war has been kind to me enough.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nDespite the heavy gunfire,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nI've been able to get away from it all\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nand walk through the land of your ideas.\"\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nAnd Einstein was very impressed with his exact solution,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nand I should hope also the dedication of the scientist.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nThis is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd he took Schwarzschild's idea\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nto the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nBut Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nHe did not believe they existed in nature.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nHe thought nature would protect us from their formation.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nIt was decades\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nbefore the term \"black hole\" was coined\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nand people realized\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nthat black holes are real astrophysical objects --\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nin fact they're the death state\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nof very massive stars\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nthat collapse catastrophically\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nat the end of their lifetime.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nNow our Sun will not collapse to a black hole.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nIt's actually not massive enough.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nBut if we did a little thought experiment --\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nas Einstein was very fond of doing --\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nwe could imagine\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nputting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nand putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nmaybe 30 kilometers\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\noutside of the black-hole sun.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nAnd it would be self-illuminated,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nbecause now the Sun's gone, we have no other source of light --\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nso let's make our little Earth self-illuminated.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nAnd you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\neven 30 km\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\noutside of this crushed black hole.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nThis crushed black hole\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nactually would fit inside Manhattan, more or less.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nIt might spill off into the Hudson a little bit\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nbefore it destroyed the Earth.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nBut basically that's what we're talking about.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nWe're talking about an object that you could crush down\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nto half the square area of Manhattan.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nSo we move this Earth very close --\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\n30 kilometers outside --\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nand we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nThere's a sort of myth\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nthat black holes devour everything in the universe,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nbut you actually have to get very close to fall in.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nBut what's very impressive is that, from our vantage point,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nwe can always see the Earth.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nIt cannot hide behind the black hole.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nThe light from the Earth, some of it falls in,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nbut some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nSo you can't hide anything behind a black hole.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nIf this were Battlestar Galactica\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nand you're fighting the Cylons,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\ndon't hide behind the black hole.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nThey can see you.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nNow, our Sun will not collapse to a black hole --\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nit's not massive enough --\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nbut there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nAnd if one were to eclipse the Milky Way,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nthis is what it would look like.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nWe would see a shadow of that black hole\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nagainst the hundred billion stars\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nin the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nAnd if we were to fall towards this black hole,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nwe would see all of that light lensed around it,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nand we could even start to cross into that shadow\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nand really not notice that anything dramatic had happened.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nIt would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nbecause we couldn't,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nanymore than light can escape.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nBut even though the black hole is dark from the outside,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nit's not dark on the inside,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nbecause all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nAnd even though, due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nour clocks would seem to slow down\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nrelative to galactic time,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nit would look as though the evolution of the galaxy\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nhad been sped up and shot at us,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nright before we were crushed to death by the black hole.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nIt would be like a near-death experience\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nwhere you see the light at the end of the tunnel,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nbut it's a total death experience.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nAnd there's no way of telling anybody\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nabout the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nNow we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nbut black holes can be heard,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\neven if they're not seen.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nImagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation --\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nimagine two black holes that have lived a long life together.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nMaybe they started as stars\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nand collapsed to two black holes --\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\neach one 10 times the mass of the Sun.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nSo now we're going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nThey can be spinning\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nhundreds of times a second.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nAt the end of their lives,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nthey're going around each other very near the speed of light.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nSo they're crossing thousands of kilometers\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nin a fraction of a second,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nand as they do so, they not only curve space,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nbut they leave behind in their wake\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\na ringing of space,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nan actual wave on space-time.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nSpace squeezes and stretches\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nas it emanates out from these black holes\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nbanging on the universe.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nAnd they travel out into the cosmos\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nat the speed of light.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nThis computer simulation\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nis due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nIt took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nThis was one of the groups.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nIt shows two black holes in orbit around each other,\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nagain, with these helpfully painted curves.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nAnd if you can see -- it's kind of faint --\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nbut if you can see the red waves emanating out,\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nthose are the gravitational waves.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nThey're literally the sounds of space ringing,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nand they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nas they ring down and coalesce\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nto one spinning, quiet black hole\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nat the end of the day.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nIf you were standing near enough,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nyour ear would resonate\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nwith the squeezing and stretching of space.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nYou would literally hear the sound.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nNow of course, your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nso you might have trouble understanding what's going on.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nBut I'd like to play for you\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nthe sound that we predict.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nThis is from my group --\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\na slightly less glamorous computer modeling.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nImagine a lighter black hole\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nfalling into a very heavy black hole.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nThe sound you're hearing\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nis the light black hole banging on space\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\neach time it gets close.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nIf it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nBut it comes in like a mallet,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nand it literally cracks space,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nwobbling it like a drum.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nAnd we can predict what the sound will be.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nWe know that, as it falls in,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nit gets faster and it gets louder.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nAnd eventually,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nwe're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:20.958\n(Thumping)\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nThen it's gone.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nNow I've never heard it that loud -- it's actually more dramatic.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nAt home it sounds kind of anticlimactic.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nIt's sort of like ding, ding, ding.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nThis is another sound from my group.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nNo, I'm not showing you any images,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nbecause black holes don't leave behind\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nhelpful trails of ink,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nand space is not painted,\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nshowing you the curves.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nBut if you were to float by in space on a space holiday\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nand you heard this,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nyou want to get moving.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nWant to get away from the sound.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nBoth black holes are moving.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nBoth black holes are getting closer together.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nIn this case, they're both wobbling quite a lot.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAnd then they're going to merge.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:10.958\n(Thumping)\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nNow it's gone.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nNow that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging --\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nthat it chirps up at the end.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nNow that's our prediction\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nfor what we'll see.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nLuckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach, California.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nAnd surely, somewhere in the universe\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\ntwo black holes have merged.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nAnd surely, the space around us\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nis ringing\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nafter traveling maybe a million light years, or a million years,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nat the speed of light to get to us.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nBut the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nThere are very industrious experiments being built on Earth --\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\none called LIGO --\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nwhich will detect deviations\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nin the squeezing and stretching of space\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nat less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nover four kilometers.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nIt's a remarkably ambitious experiment,\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nand it's going to be at advanced sensitivity\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nwithin the next few years -- to pick this up.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nThere's also a mission proposed for space,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nwhich hopefully will launch in the next ten years,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\ncalled LISA.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nAnd LISA will be able to see super-massive black holes --\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nblack holes millions or billions of times\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nthe mass of the Sun.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nIn this Hubble image, we see two galaxies.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nThey look like they're frozen in some embrace.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nAnd each one probably harbors\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\na super-massive black hole at its core.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nBut they're not frozen;\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nthey're actually merging.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nThese two black holes are colliding,\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nand they will merge over a billion-year time scale.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nIt's beyond our human perception\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nto pick up a song of that duration.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nBut LISA could see the final stages\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nof two super-massive black holes\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nearlier in the universe's history,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nthe last 15 minutes before they fall together.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nAnd it's not just black holes,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nbut it's also any big disturbance in the universe --\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nand the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nWhen that expression was coined, it was derisive --\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nlike, \"Oh, who would believe in a Big Bang?\"\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nBut now it actually might be more technically accurate\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nbecause it might bang.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nIt might make a sound.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nThis animation from my friends at Proton Studios\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nshows looking at the Big Bang from the outside.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nWe don't ever want to do that actually. We want to be inside the universe\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nbecause there's no such thing as standing outside the universe.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nSo imagine you're inside the Big Bang.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nIt's everywhere, it's all around you,\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nand the space is wobbling chaotically.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nFourteen billion years pass\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nand this song is still ringing all around us.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nGalaxies form,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nand generations of stars form in those galaxies,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nand around one star,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nat least one star,\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nis a habitable planet.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nAnd here we are frantically building these experiments,\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\ndoing these calculations, writing these computer codes.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nImagine a billion years ago,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\ntwo black holes collided.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nThat song has been ringing through space\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nfor all that time.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nWe weren't even here.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nIt gets closer and closer --\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\n40,000 years ago, we're still doing cave paintings.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nIt's like hurry, build your instruments.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nIt's getting closer and closer, and in 20 ...\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nwhatever year it will be\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nwhen our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity --\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nwe'll build them, we'll turn on the machines\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nand, bang, we'll catch it -- the first song from space.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nIf it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up,\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nit would sound like this.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\n(Static) It's a terrible sound.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nIt's literally the definition of noise.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nIt's white noise; it's such a chaotic ringing.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nBut it's around us everywhere, presumably,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nif it hasn't been wiped out\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nby some other process in the universe.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nAnd if we pick it up, it will be music to our ears\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nbecause it will be the quiet echo\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nof that moment of our creation,\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nof our observable universe.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nSo within the next few years,\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nwe'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit,\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nrender the universe in audio.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nBut if we detect those earliest moments,\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nit'll bring us that much closer\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nto an understanding of the Big Bang,\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nwhich brings us that much closer\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nto asking some of the hardest, most elusive, questions.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nIf we run the movie of our universe backwards,\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nwe know that there was a Big Bang in our past,\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nand we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it,\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nbut was our Big Bang the only Big Bang?\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nI mean we have to ask, has it happened before?\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nWill it happen again?\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nI mean, in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nto reignite wonder,\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nwe can ask questions, at least for this last minute,\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nthat honestly might evade us forever.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nBut we have to ask:\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nIs it possible that our universe\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nis just a plume off of some greater history?\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nOr, is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse --\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:45.958\neach branch with its own Big Bang in its past --\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nmaybe some of them with black holes playing drums,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nmaybe some without --\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nmaybe some with sentient life, and maybe some without --\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nnot in our past, not in our future,\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nbut somehow fundamentally connected to us?\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nSo we have to wonder, if there is a multiverse,\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nin some other patch of that multiverse,\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nare there creatures?\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nHere's my multiverse creatures.\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nAre there other creatures in the multiverse,\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nwondering about us\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nand wondering about their own origins?\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nAnd if they are,\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nI can imagine them as we are,\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:19.958\ncalculating, writing computer code,\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nbuilding instruments,\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.958\ntrying to detect that faintest sound\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nof their origins\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nand wondering who else is out there.\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nThank you.

When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company. Now in our town, where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff, you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action.I remember my first fire. I was the second volunteer on the scene, so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in. But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be. When I found the captain, he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner, who was surely having one of the worst days of her life. Here it was, the middle of the night, she was standing outside in the pouring rain, under an umbrella, in her pajamas, barefoot, while her house was in flames.The other volunteer who had arrived just before me \u2014 let's call him Lex Luther \u2014 (Laughter) got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog. The dog! I was stunned with jealousy. Here was some lawyer or money manager who, for the rest of his life, gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature, just because he beat me by five seconds. Well, I was next. The captain waved me over. He said, \"Bezos, I need you to go into the house. I need you to go upstairs, past the fire, and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes.\" (Laughter) I swear. So, not exactly what I was hoping for, but off I went \u2014 up the stairs, down the hall, past the 'real' firefighters, who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point, into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes.Now I know what you're thinking, but I'm no hero. (Laughter) I carried my payload back downstairs where I met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door. We took our treasures outside to the homeowner, where, not surprisingly, his received much more attention than did mine. A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home. The act of kindness she noted above all others: someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes.(Laughter)In both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter, I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale, but I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis. And you know what I've learned? They all matter. So as I look around this room at people who either have achieved, or are on their way to achieving, remarkable levels of success, I would offer this reminder: don't wait. Don't wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody's life. If you have something to give, give it now. Serve food at a soup kitchen. Clean up a neighborhood park. Be a mentor.Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody's life, but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one. So get in the game. Save the shoes.Thank you.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, come back.(Applause)Mark Bezos: Thank you.", "id": 1096, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nBack in New York, I am the head of development\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nfor a non-profit called Robin Hood.\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nWhen I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nas the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nNow in our town,\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nwhere the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff,\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nyou have to get to the fire scene pretty early\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nto get in on any action.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nI remember my first fire.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nI was the second volunteer on the scene,\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nso there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nBut still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nto get to the captain in charge\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nto find out what our assignments would be.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nWhen I found the captain,\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nhe was having a very engaging conversation\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nwith the homeowner,\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nwho was surely having one of the worst days of her life.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nHere it was, the middle of the night,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nshe was standing outside in the pouring rain,\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nunder an umbrella, in her pajamas, barefoot,\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nwhile her house was in flames.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nThe other volunteer who had arrived just before me --\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nlet's call him Lex Luther --\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\ngot to the captain first\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nand was asked to go inside\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nand save the homeowner's dog.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nThe dog!

That was, of course, by Le Corbusier, the famous architect. And here you can see what he meant in one of his beautiful buildings \u2014 the chapel Notre Dame Du Haut De Ronchamp \u2014 where he creates this light that he could only make because there's also dark. And I think that is the quintessence of this 18-minute talk \u2014 that there is no good lighting that is healthy and for our well-being without proper darkness.So this is how we normally would light our offices. We have codes and standards that tell us that the lights should be so much Lux and of great uniformity. This is how we create uniform lighting from one wall to the other in a regular grid of lamps. And that is quite different from what I just showed you from Le Corbusier. If we would apply these codes and standards to the Pantheon in Rome, it would never have looked like this, because this beautiful light feature that goes around there all by itself can only appear because there is also darkness in that same building. And the same is more or less what Santiago Calatrava said when he said, \"Light: I make it in my buildings for comfort.\" And he didn't mean the comfort of a five-course dinner as opposed to a one-course meal, but he really meant the comfort of the quality of the building for the people. He meant that you can see the sky and that you can experience the sun. And he created these gorgeous buildings where you can see the sky, and where you can experience the sun, that give us a better life in the built environment, just because of the relevance of light in its brightness and also in its shadows.And what it all boils down to is, of course, the sun. And this image of the Sun may suggest that the Sun is something evil and aggressive, but we should not forget that all energy on this planet actually comes from the Sun, and light is only a manifestation of that energy.The sun is for dynamics, for color changes. The sun is for beauty in our environment, like in this building \u2014 the High Museum in Atlanta, which has been created by Renzo Piano from Italy, together with Arup Lighting, a brilliant team of lighting designers, who created a very subtle modulation of light across the space, responding to what the sun does outside, just because of all these beautiful openings in the roof. So in an indirect way, you can see the sun. And what they did is they created an integral building element to improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum. They created this shade that you can see here, which actually covers the sun, but opens up to the good light from the sky. And here you can see how they really crafted a beautiful design process with physical models, with quantitative as well as qualitative methods, to come to a final solution that is truly integrated and completely holistic with the architecture. They allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way. As you can see here, there's some direct light on the floor, but they could easily figure out where that comes from. And they allow people in that building to really enjoy the sun, the good part of the sun.And enjoying the sun can be in many different ways, of course. It can be just like this, or maybe like this, which is rather peculiar, but this is in 1963 \u2014 the viewing of a sun eclipse in the United States. And it's just a bit bright up there, so these people have found a very intriguing solution. This is, I think, a very illustrative image of what I try to say \u2014 that the beautiful dynamics of sun, bringing these into the building, creates a quality of our built environment that truly enhances our lives. And this is all about darkness as much as it is about lightness, of course, because otherwise you don't see these dynamics.As opposed to the first office that I showed you in the beginning of the talk, this is a well-known office, which is the Weidt Group. They are in green energy consulting, or something like that. And they really practice what they preach because this office doesn't have any electric lighting at all. It has only, on one side, this big, big glass window that helps to let the sunlight enter deep into the space and create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range. So it can be very dim over there, and you do your work, and it can be very bright over there, and you do your work. But actually, the human eye turns out to be remarkably adaptable to all these different light conditions that together create an environment that is never boring and that is never dull, and therefore helps us to enhance our lives.I really owe a short introduction of this man to you. This is Richard Kelly who was born 100 years ago, which is the reason I bring him up now, because it's kind of an anniversary year. In the 1930s, Richard Kelly was the first person to really describe a methodology of modern lighting design. And he coined three terms, which are \"focal glow,\" \"ambient luminescence\" and \"play of the brilliants\" \u2014 three very distinctly different ideas about light in architecture that all together make up this beautiful experience.So to begin with, focal glow. He meant something like this \u2014 where the light gives direction to the space and helps you to get around. Or something like this, which is the lighting design he did for General Motors, for the car showroom. And you enter that space, and you feel like, \"Wow! This is so impressive,\" just because of this focal point, this huge light source in the middle. To me, it is something from theater, and I will get back to that a little bit later. It's the spotlight on the artist that helps you to focus. It could also be the sunlight that breaks through the clouds and lights up a patch of the land, highlighting it compared to the dim environment. Or it can be in today's retail, in the shopping environment \u2014 lighting the merchandise and creating accents that help you to get around.Ambient luminescence is something very different. Richard Kelly saw it as something infinite, something without any focus, something where all details actually dissolve in infinity. And I see it as a very comfortable kind of light that really helps us to relax and to contemplate. It could also be something like this: the National Museum of Science in London, where this blue is embracing all the exhibitions and galleries in one large gesture.And then finally, Kelly's play of brilliants added to that really some play, I think, of the skyline of Hong Kong, or perhaps the chandelier in the opera house, or in the theater here, which is the decoration, the icing on the cake, something playful, something that is just an addition to the architectural environment, I would say. These three distinct elements, together, make a lighting environment that helps us to feel better. And we can only create these out of darkness. And I will explain that further. And I guess that is something that Richard Kelly, here on the left, was explaining to Ludwig Mies van Der Rohe. And behind them, you see that Seagram Building that later turned into an icon of modern lighting design.Those times, there were some early attempts also for light therapy already. You can see here a photo from the United States Library of Medicine, where people are put in the sun to get better. It's a little bit of a different story, this health aspect of light, than what I'm telling you today. In today's modern medicine, there is a real understanding of light in an almost biochemical way. And there is the idea that, when we look at things, it is the yellow light that helps us the most, that we are the most sensitive for. But our circadian rhythms, which are the rhythms that help us to wake and sleep and be alert and relaxed and so forth and so on, they are much more triggered by blue light. And by modulating the amount of blue in our environment, we can help people to relax, or to be alert, to fall asleep, or to stay awake.And that is how, maybe in the near future, light can help hospitals to make people better sooner, recover them quicker. Maybe in the airplane, we can overcome jet lag like that. Perhaps in school, we can help children to learn better because they concentrate more on their work. And you can imagine a lot more applications. But I would like to talk further about the combination of light and darkness as a quality in our life.So light is, of course, for social interaction also \u2014 to create relationships with all the features around us. It is the place where we gather around when we have to say something to each other. And it is all about this planet. But when you look at this planet at night, it looks like this. And I think this is the most shocking image in my talk today. Because all this light here goes up to the sky. It never reaches the ground where it was meant for. It never is to the benefit of people. It only spoils the darkness. So at a global scale, it looks like this. And, I mean, that is quite amazing, what you see here \u2014 how much light goes up into the sky and never reaches the ground. Because if we look at the Earth the way it should be, it would be something like this very inspiring image where darkness is for our imagination and for contemplation and to help us to relate to everything.The world is changing though, and urbanization is a big driver of everything. I took this photo two weeks ago in Guangzhou, and I realized that 10 years ago, there was nothing like this, of these buildings. It was just a much smaller city, and the pace of urbanization is incredible and enormous. And we have to understand these main questions: How do people move through these new urban spaces? How do they share their culture? How do we tackle things like mobility? And how can light help there? Because the new technologies, they seem to be in a really interesting position to contribute to the solutions of urbanization and to provide us with better environments.It's not that long ago that our lighting was just done with these kinds of lamps. And of course, we had the metal-halide lamps and fluorescent lamps and things like that. Now we have LED, but here you see the latest one, and you see how incredibly small it is. And this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity, because this tiny, tiny size allows us to put the light wherever we really need it. And we can actually leave it out where it's not needed at all and where we can preserve darkness. So that is a really interesting proposition, I think, and a new way of lighting the architectural environment with our well-being in mind. The problem is, though, that I wanted to explain to you how this really works \u2014 but I can have four of these on my finger, so you would not be able to really see them. So I asked our laboratory to do something about it, and they said, \"Well, we can do something.\" They created for me the biggest LED in the world especially for TEDx in Amsterdam.So here it is. It's the same thing as you can see over there \u2014 just 200 times bigger. And I will very quickly show you how it works. So just to explain. Now, every LED that is made these days gives blue light. Now, this is not very pleasant and comfortable. And for that reason, we cover the LED with a phosphor cap. And the phosphor is excited by the blue and makes the light white and warm and pleasant. And then when you add the lens to that, you can bundle the light and send it wherever you need it without any need to spill any light to the sky or anywhere else. So you can preserve the darkness and make the light. I just wanted to show that to you so you understand how this works.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)We can go further. So we have to rethink the way we light our cities. We have to think again about light as a default solution. Why are all these motorways permanently lit? Is it really needed? Can we maybe be much more selective and create better environments that also benefit from darkness? Can we be much more gentle with light? Like here \u2014 this is a very low light level actually. Can we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create, so they really want to connect with it, like here? Or can we create simply sculptures that are very inspiring to be in and to be around? And can we preserve the darkness? Because to find a place like this today on Earth is really very, very challenging. And to find a starry sky like this is even more difficult.Even in the oceans, we are creating a lot of light that we could actually ban also for animal life to have a much greater well-being. And it's known that migrating birds, for example, get very disoriented because of these offshore platforms. And we discovered that when we make those lights green, the birds, they actually go the right way. They are not disturbed anymore. And it turns out once again that spectral sensitivity is very important here.In all of these examples, I think, we should start making the light out of darkness, and use the darkness as a canvas \u2014 like the visual artists do, like Edward Hopper in this painting. I think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting. I think, when I see it, I start to think, who are those people? Where have they come from? Where are they going? What just happened? What will be happening in the next five minutes? And it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense because of the darkness and the light.Edward Hopper was a real master in creating the narration by working with light and dark. And we can learn from that and create more interesting and inspiring architectural environments. We can do that in commercial spaces like this. And you can still also go outside and enjoy the greatest show in the universe, which is, of course, the universe itself. So I give you this wonderful, informative image of the sky, ranging from the inner city, where you may see one or two stars and nothing else, all the way to the rural environments, where you can enjoy this great and gorgeous and beautiful performance of the constellations and the stars.In architecture, it works just the same. By appreciating the darkness when you design the light, you create much more interesting environments that truly enhance our lives. This is the most well-known example, Tadao Ando's Church of the Light. But I also think of Peter Zumthor's spa in Vals, where light and dark, in very gentle combinations, alter each other to define the space. Or Richard MacCormac's Southwark tube station in London, where you can really see the sky, even though you are under the ground.And finally, I want to point out that a lot of this inspiration comes from theater. And I think it's fantastic that we are today experiencing TEDx in a theater for the first time because I think we really owe to the theater a big thanks. It wouldn't be such an inspiring scenography without this theater. And I think the theater is a place where we truly enhance life with light.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1098, "subtitle":

well-being\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.118\nwithout proper darkness.\n\n00:01:01.198 --> 00:01:04.574\nSo this is how we normally\nwould light our offices.\n\n00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:09.494\nWe have codes and standards that tell us\nthat the lights should be so much Lux\n\n00:01:09.518 --> 00:01:11.774\nand of great uniformity.\n\n00:01:11.798 --> 00:01:16.813\nThis is how we create uniform lighting\nfrom one wall to the other\n\n00:01:16.837 --> 00:01:19.614\nin a regular grid of lamps.\n\n00:01:19.638 --> 00:01:22.894\nAnd that is quite different\nfrom what I just showed you\n\n00:01:22.918 --> 00:01:24.598\nfrom Le Corbusier.\n\n00:01:25.638 --> 00:01:27.694\nIf we would apply\nthese codes and standards\n\n00:01:27.718 --> 00:01:29.254\nto the Pantheon in Rome,\n\n00:01:29.278 --> 00:01:31.134\nit would never have looked like this,\n\n00:01:31.158 --> 00:01:36.854\nbecause this beautiful light feature\nthat goes around there all by itself\n\n00:01:36.878 --> 00:01:40.774\ncan only appear because there is\nalso darkness in that same building.\n\n00:01:40.798 --> 00:01:45.494\nAnd the same is more or less\nwhat Santiago Calatrava said\n\n00:01:45.518 --> 00:01:50.294\nwhen he said, \"Light: I make it\nin my buildings for comfort.\"\n\n00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:53.494\nAnd he didn't mean the comfort\nof a five-course dinner\n\n00:01:53.518 --> 00:01:55.454\nas opposed to a one-course meal,\n\n00:01:55.478 --> 00:01:57.174\nbut he really meant the comfort\n\n00:01:57.198 --> 00:01:59.934\nof the quality of the building\nfor the people.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:04.962\nHe meant that you can see the sky\nand that you can experience the sun.\n\n00:02:05.438 --> 00:02:09.934\nAnd he created these gorgeous buildings\nwhere you can see the sky,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.054\nand where you can experience the sun,\n\n00:02:12.078 --> 00:02:14.958\nthat give us a better life\nin the built environment,\n\n00:02:15.998 --> 00:02:22.014\njust because of the relevance of light\nin its brightness and also in its shadows.\n\n00:02:22.038 --> 00:02:25.974\nAnd what it all boils down to is,\nof course, the sun.\n\n00:02:25.998 --> 00:02:28.934\nAnd this image of the Sun may suggest\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.134\nthat the Sun is something\nevil and aggressive,\n\n00:02:31.158 --> 00:02:32.334\nbut we should not forget\n\n00:02:32.358 --> 00:02:35.934\nthat all energy on this planet\nactually comes from the Sun,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:40.758\nand light is only\na manifestation of that energy.\n\n00:02:41.678 --> 00:02:45.094\nThe sun is for dynamics,\nfor color changes.\n\n00:02:45.118 --> 00:02:47.694\nThe sun is for beauty in our environment,\n\n00:02:47.718 --> 00:02:50.934\nlike in this building --\nthe High Museum in Atlanta,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.894\nwhich has been created\nby Renzo Piano from Italy,\n\n00:02:53.918 --> 00:02:58.494\ntogether with Arup Lighting,\na brilliant team of lighting designers,\n\n00:02:58.518 --> 00:03:04.974\nwho created a very subtle\nmodulation of light across the space,\n\n00:03:04.998 --> 00:03:07.316\nresponding to what the sun does outside,\n\n00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.334\njust because of all these\nbeautiful openings in the roof.\n\n00:03:10.358 --> 00:03:14.534\nSo in an indirect way,\nyou can see the sun.\n\n00:03:14.558 --> 00:03:18.014\nAnd what they did is they created\nan integral building element\n\n00:03:18.038 --> 00:03:23.814\nto improve the quality of the space\nthat surrounds the visitors of the museum.\n\n00:03:23.838 --> 00:03:27.094\nThey created this shade\nthat you can see here,\n\n00:03:27.118 --> 00:03:30.774\nwhich actually covers the sun,\n\n00:03:30.798 --> 00:03:33.313\nbut opens up to the good\nlight from the sky.\n\n00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:37.774\nAnd here you can see how they really\ncrafted a beautiful design process\n\n00:03:37.798 --> 00:03:39.014\nwith physical models,\n\n00:03:39.038 --> 00:03:42.294\nwith quantitative\nas well as qualitative methods,\n\n00:03:42.318 --> 00:03:46.534\nto come to a final solution\nthat is truly integrated\n\n00:03:46.558 --> 00:03:49.094\nand completely holistic\nwith the architecture.\n\n00:03:49.118 --> 00:03:51.614\nThey allowed themselves\na few mistakes along the way.\n\n00:03:51.638 --> 00:03:54.494\nAs you can see here,\nthere's some direct light on the floor,\n\n00:03:54.518 --> 00:03:57.134\nbut they could easily figure out\nwhere that comes from.\n\n00:03:57.158 --> 00:04:02.734\nAnd they allow people in that building\nto really enjoy the sun,\n\n00:04:02.758 --> 00:04:04.854\nthe good part of the sun.\n\n00:04:04.878 --> 00:04:09.294\nAnd enjoying the sun\ncan be in many different ways, of course.\n\n00:04:09.318 --> 00:04:11.134\nIt can be just like this,\n\n00:04:11.158 --> 00:04:14.578\nor maybe like this,\nwhich is rather peculiar,\n\n00:04:14.602 --> 00:04:16.694\nbut this is in 1963 --\n\n00:04:16.718 --> 00:04:20.734\nthe viewing of a sun eclipse\nin the United States.\n\n00:04:20.758 --> 00:04:23.014\nAnd it's just a bit bright up there,\n\n00:04:23.038 --> 00:04:26.198\nso these people have found\na very intriguing solution.\n\n00:04:26.878 --> 00:04:30.054\nThis is, I think, a very illustrative\nimage of what I try to say --\n\n00:04:30.078 --> 00:04:34.974\nthat the beautiful dynamics of sun,\nbringing these into the building,\n\n00:04:34.998 --> 00:04:39.534\ncreates a quality of our built environment\nthat truly enhances our lives.\n\n00:04:39.558 --> 00:04:41.854\nAnd this is all about darkness\n\n00:04:41.878 --> 00:04:43.974\nas much as it is\nabout lightness, of course,\n\n00:04:43.998 --> 00:04:46.614\nbecause otherwise\nyou don't see these dynamics.\n\n00:04:46.638 --> 00:04:48.094\nAs opposed to the first office\n\n00:04:48.118 --> 00:04:51.174\nthat I showed you\nin the beginning of the talk,\n\n00:04:51.198 --> 00:04:54.254\nthis is a well-known office,\nwhich is the Weidt Group.\n\n00:04:54.278 --> 00:04:57.334\nThey are in green energy consulting,\nor something like that.\n\n00:04:57.358 --> 00:04:59.311\nAnd they really practice what they preach\n\n00:04:59.335 --> 00:05:02.254\nbecause this office doesn't have\nany electric lighting at all.\n\n00:05:02.278 --> 00:05:06.534\nIt has only, on one side,\nthis big, big glass window\n\n00:05:06.558 --> 00:05:10.134\nthat helps to let the sunlight\nenter deep into the space\n\n00:05:10.158 --> 00:05:13.574\nand create a beautiful quality there\nand a great dynamic range.\n\n00:05:13.598 --> 00:05:16.214\nSo it can be very dim over there,\nand you do your work,\n\n00:05:16.238 --> 00:05:19.014\nand it can be very bright over there,\nand you do your work.\n\n00:05:19.038 --> 00:05:22.934\nBut actually, the human eye\nturns out to be remarkably adaptable\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:26.854\nto all these different light conditions\nthat together create an environment\n\n00:05:26.878 --> 00:05:29.294\nthat is never boring\nand that is never dull,\n\n00:05:29.318 --> 00:05:31.958\nand therefore helps us\nto enhance our lives.\n\n00:05:33.358 --> 00:05:36.654\nI really owe a short introduction\nof this man to you.\n\n00:05:36.678 --> 00:05:40.614\nThis is Richard Kelly\nwho was born 100 years ago,\n\n00:05:40.638 --> 00:05:44.454\nwhich is the reason I bring him up now,\nbecause it's kind of an anniversary year.\n\n00:05:44.478 --> 00:05:49.574\nIn the 1930s, Richard Kelly\nwas the first person to really describe\n\n00:05:49.598 --> 00:05:51.534\na methodology of modern lighting design.\n\n00:05:51.558 --> 00:05:53.374\nAnd he coined three terms,\n\n00:05:53.398 --> 00:05:57.294\nwhich are \"focal glow,\"\n\"ambient luminescence\"\n\n00:05:57.318 --> 00:05:58.974\nand \"play of the brilliants\" --\n\n00:05:58.998 --> 00:06:03.494\nthree very distinctly different\nideas about light in architecture\n\n00:06:03.518 --> 00:06:07.494\nthat all together\nmake up this beautiful experience.\n\n00:06:07.518 --> 00:06:08.934\nSo to begin with, focal glow.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.534\nHe meant something like this --\n\n00:06:10.558 --> 00:06:12.934\nwhere the light\ngives direction to the space\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.934\nand helps you to get around.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.174\nOr something like this,\n\n00:06:16.198 --> 00:06:18.814\nwhich is the lighting design\nhe did for General Motors,\n\n00:06:18.838 --> 00:06:20.054\nfor the car showroom.\n\n00:06:20.078 --> 00:06:21.294\nAnd you enter that space,\n\n00:06:21.318 --> 00:06:24.614\nand you feel like,\n\"Wow! This is so impressive,\"\n\n00:06:24.638 --> 00:06:28.694\njust because of this focal point,\nthis huge light source in the middle.\n\n00:06:28.718 --> 00:06:30.433\nTo me, it is something from theater,\n\n00:06:30.457 --> 00:06:32.654\nand I will get back to that\na little bit later.\n\n00:06:32.678 --> 00:06:36.334\nIt's the spotlight on the artist\nthat helps you to focus.\n\n00:06:36.358 --> 00:06:39.174\nIt could also be the sunlight\nthat breaks through the clouds\n\n00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:42.614\nand lights up a patch of the land,\n\n00:06:42.638 --> 00:06:46.198\nhighlighting it\ncompared to the dim environment.\n\n00:06:47.078 --> 00:06:50.854\nOr it can be in today's retail,\nin the shopping environment --\n\n00:06:50.878 --> 00:06:54.894\nlighting the merchandise and creating\naccents that help you to get around.\n\n00:06:54.918 --> 00:06:57.934\nAmbient luminescence\nis something very different.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:01.054\nRichard Kelly saw it\nas something infinite,\n\n00:07:01.078 --> 00:07:03.374\nsomething without any focus,\n\n00:07:03.398 --> 00:07:08.214\nsomething where all details\nactually dissolve in infinity.\n\n00:07:08.238 --> 00:07:14.134\nAnd I see it as a very comfortable kind\nof light that really helps us to relax\n\n00:07:14.158 --> 00:07:15.574\nand to contemplate.\n\n00:07:15.598 --> 00:07:17.414\nIt could also be something like this:\n\n00:07:17.438 --> 00:07:19.534\nthe National Museum of Science in London,\n\n00:07:19.558 --> 00:07:24.654\nwhere this blue is embracing\nall the exhibitions and galleries\n\n00:07:24.678 --> 00:07:27.174\nin one large gesture.\n\n00:07:27.198 --> 00:07:28.414\nAnd then finally,\n\n00:07:28.438 --> 00:07:30.894\nKelly's play of brilliants added to that\n\n00:07:30.918 --> 00:07:34.254\nreally some play, I think,\nof the skyline of Hong Kong,\n\n00:07:34.278 --> 00:07:36.614\nor perhaps the chandelier\nin the opera house,\n\n00:07:36.638 --> 00:07:38.254\nor in the theater here,\n\n00:07:38.278 --> 00:07:42.454\nwhich is the decoration,\nthe icing on the cake, something playful,\n\n00:07:42.478 --> 00:07:46.014\nsomething that is just an addition\nto the architectural environment,\n\n00:07:46.038 --> 00:07:47.254\nI would say.\n\n00:07:47.278 --> 00:07:49.854\nThese three distinct elements, together,\n\n00:07:49.878 --> 00:07:53.038\nmake a lighting environment\nthat helps us to feel better.\n\n00:07:53.638 --> 00:07:55.774\nAnd we can only\ncreate these out of darkness.\n\n00:07:55.798 --> 00:07:57.374\nAnd I will explain that further.\n\n00:07:57.398 --> 00:08:00.574\nAnd I guess that is something\nthat Richard Kelly, here on the left,\n\n00:08:00.598 --> 00:08:02.934\nwas explaining\nto Ludwig Mies van Der Rohe.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.694\nAnd behind them,\nyou see that Seagram Building\n\n00:08:05.718 --> 00:08:10.158\nthat later turned into an icon\nof modern lighting design.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.743\nThose times, there were\nsome early attempts\n\n00:08:13.767 --> 00:08:15.254\nalso for light therapy already.\n\n00:08:15.278 --> 00:08:16.454\nYou can see here a photo\n\n00:08:16.478 --> 00:08:18.614\nfrom the United States\nLibrary of Medicine,\n\n00:08:18.638 --> 00:08:21.734\nwhere people are put\nin the sun to get better.\n\n00:08:21.758 --> 00:08:24.949\nIt's a little bit of a different story,\nthis health aspect of light,\n\n00:08:24.973 --> 00:08:26.533\nthan what I'm telling you today.\n\n00:08:27.318 --> 00:08:29.694\nIn today's modern medicine,\n\n00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:35.214\nthere is a real understanding of light\nin an almost biochemical way.\n\n00:08:35.238 --> 00:08:39.934\nAnd there is the idea\nthat, when we look at things,\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.134\nit is the yellow light\nthat helps us the most,\n\n00:08:42.158 --> 00:08:44.134\nthat we are the most sensitive for.\n\n00:08:44.158 --> 00:08:46.774\nBut our circadian rhythms,\n\n00:08:46.798 --> 00:08:49.254\nwhich are the rhythms\nthat help us to wake and sleep\n\n00:08:49.278 --> 00:08:51.654\nand be alert and relaxed\nand so forth and so on,\n\n00:08:51.678 --> 00:08:54.414\nthey are much more triggered\nby blue light.\n\n00:08:54.438 --> 00:08:58.334\nAnd by modulating the amount\nof blue in our environment,\n\n00:08:58.358 --> 00:09:01.734\nwe can help people\nto relax, or to be alert,\n\n00:09:01.758 --> 00:09:04.054\nto fall asleep, or to stay awake.\n\n00:09:04.078 --> 00:09:10.094\nAnd that is how, maybe in the near future,\nlight can help hospitals\n\n00:09:10.118 --> 00:09:15.534\nto make people better sooner,\nrecover them quicker.\n\n00:09:15.558 --> 00:09:18.934\nMaybe in the airplane,\nwe can overcome jet lag like that.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:22.740\nPerhaps in school,\nwe can help children to learn better\n\n00:09:22.764 --> 00:09:24.812\nbecause they concentrate more\non their work.\n\n00:09:24.836 --> 00:09:27.334\nAnd you can imagine\na lot more applications.\n\n00:09:27.358 --> 00:09:28.934\nBut I would like to talk further\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:34.734\nabout the combination\nof light and darkness\n\n00:09:34.758 --> 00:09:36.678\nas a quality in our life.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.854\nSo light is, of course,\nfor social interaction also --\n\n00:09:41.878 --> 00:09:45.534\nto create relationships\nwith all the features around us.\n\n00:09:45.558 --> 00:09:47.934\nIt is the place where we gather around\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.214\nwhen we have to say something\nto each other.\n\n00:09:50.238 --> 00:09:52.414\nAnd it is all about this planet.\n\n00:09:52.438 --> 00:09:54.694\nBut when you look at this planet at night,\n\n00:09:54.718 --> 00:09:56.054\nit looks like this.\n\n00:09:56.078 --> 00:09:59.614\nAnd I think this is the most shocking\nimage in my talk today.\n\n00:09:59.638 --> 00:10:03.254\nBecause all this light here\ngoes up to the sky.\n\n00:10:03.278 --> 00:10:07.174\nIt never reaches the ground\nwhere it was meant for.\n\n00:10:07.198 --> 00:10:09.334\nIt never is to the benefit of people.\n\n00:10:09.358 --> 00:10:11.174\nIt only spoils the darkness.\n\n00:10:11.198 --> 00:10:14.414\nSo at a global scale, it looks like this.\n\n00:10:14.438 --> 00:10:17.174\nAnd, I mean, that is quite amazing,\nwhat you see here --\n\n00:10:17.198 --> 00:10:22.534\nhow much light goes up into the sky\nand never reaches the ground.\n\n00:10:22.558 --> 00:10:25.294\nBecause if we look at the Earth\nthe way it should be,\n\n00:10:25.318 --> 00:10:28.334\nit would be something\nlike this very inspiring image\n\n00:10:28.358 --> 00:10:32.654\nwhere darkness is for our imagination\nand for contemplation\n\n00:10:32.678 --> 00:10:35.358\nand to help us to relate to everything.\n\n00:10:36.238 --> 00:10:37.654\nThe world is changing though,\n\n00:10:37.678 --> 00:10:39.894\nand urbanization\nis a big driver of everything.\n\n00:10:39.918 --> 00:10:42.336\nI took this photo\ntwo weeks ago in Guangzhou,\n\n00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.015\nand I realized that 10 years ago,\n\n00:10:44.039 --> 00:10:47.799\nthere was nothing like this,\nof these buildings.\n\n00:10:48.678 --> 00:10:50.774\nIt was just a much smaller city,\n\n00:10:50.798 --> 00:10:54.254\nand the pace of urbanization\nis incredible and enormous.\n\n00:10:54.278 --> 00:10:57.294\nAnd we have to understand\nthese main questions:\n\n00:10:57.318 --> 00:11:00.934\nHow do people move\nthrough these new urban spaces?\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.534\nHow do they share their culture?\n\n00:11:02.558 --> 00:11:04.398\nHow do we tackle things like mobility?\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.854\nAnd how can light help there?\n\n00:11:06.878 --> 00:11:08.334\nBecause the new technologies,\n\n00:11:08.358 --> 00:11:10.814\nthey seem to be\nin a really interesting position\n\n00:11:10.838 --> 00:11:14.694\nto contribute to the solutions\nof urbanization\n\n00:11:14.718 --> 00:11:18.054\nand to provide us\nwith better environments.\n\n00:11:18.078 --> 00:11:19.454\nIt's not that long ago\n\n00:11:19.478 --> 00:11:23.214\nthat our lighting was just done\nwith these kinds of lamps.\n\n00:11:23.238 --> 00:11:25.334\nAnd of course,\nwe had the metal-halide lamps\n\n00:11:25.358 --> 00:11:27.454\nand fluorescent lamps\nand things like that.\n\n00:11:27.478 --> 00:11:28.974\nNow we have LED,\n\n00:11:28.998 --> 00:11:33.054\nbut here you see the latest one,\nand you see how incredibly small it is.\n\n00:11:33.078 --> 00:11:36.694\nAnd this is exactly\nwhat offers us a unique opportunity,\n\n00:11:36.718 --> 00:11:39.934\nbecause this tiny, tiny size allows us\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.294\nto put the light\nwherever we really need it.\n\n00:11:42.318 --> 00:11:45.214\nAnd we can actually leave it out\nwhere it's not needed at all\n\n00:11:45.238 --> 00:11:46.934\nand where we can preserve darkness.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.454\nSo that is a really interesting\nproposition, I think,\n\n00:11:49.478 --> 00:11:53.054\nand a new way of lighting\nthe architectural environment\n\n00:11:53.078 --> 00:11:54.958\nwith our well-being in mind.\n\n00:11:55.558 --> 00:11:59.334\nThe problem is, though, that I wanted\nto explain to you how this really works --\n\n00:11:59.358 --> 00:12:01.774\nbut I can have four of these on my finger,\n\n00:12:01.798 --> 00:12:03.894\nso you would not be able\nto really see them.\n\n00:12:03.918 --> 00:12:06.974\nSo I asked our laboratory\nto do something about it,\n\n00:12:06.998 --> 00:12:09.014\nand they said,\n\"Well, we can do something.\"\n\n00:12:09.038 --> 00:12:11.574\nThey created for me\nthe biggest LED in the world\n\n00:12:11.598 --> 00:12:13.614\nespecially for TEDx in Amsterdam.\n\n00:12:13.638 --> 00:12:14.974\nSo here it is.\n\n00:12:14.998 --> 00:12:17.414\nIt's the same thing\nas you can see over there --\n\n00:12:17.438 --> 00:12:19.054\njust 200 times bigger.\n\n00:12:19.078 --> 00:12:21.414\nAnd I will very quickly\nshow you how it works.\n\n00:12:21.438 --> 00:12:24.294\nSo just to explain.\n\n00:12:24.318 --> 00:12:30.518\nNow, every LED that is made\nthese days gives blue light.\n\n00:12:31.518 --> 00:12:34.734\nNow, this is not very pleasant\nand comfortable.\n\n00:12:34.758 --> 00:12:41.654\nAnd for that reason,\nwe cover the LED with a phosphor cap.\n\n00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:44.374\nAnd the phosphor is excited by the blue\n\n00:12:44.398 --> 00:12:47.494\nand makes the light white\nand warm and pleasant.\n\n00:12:47.518 --> 00:12:49.854\nAnd then when you add the lens to that,\n\n00:12:49.878 --> 00:12:53.574\nyou can bundle the light\nand send it wherever you need it\n\n00:12:53.598 --> 00:12:56.934\nwithout any need to spill any light\nto the sky or anywhere else.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:00.254\nSo you can preserve the darkness\nand make the light.\n\n00:13:00.278 --> 00:13:05.374\nI just wanted to show that to you\nso you understand how this works.\n\n00:13:05.398 --> 00:13:06.414\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:06.438 --> 00:13:07.626\nThank you.\n\n00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:08.714\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:08.738 --> 00:13:09.934\nWe can go further.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:13.174\nSo we have to rethink\nthe way we light our cities.\n\n00:13:13.198 --> 00:13:17.934\nWe have to think again\nabout light as a default solution.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.374\nWhy are all these motorways\npermanently lit?\n\n00:13:20.398 --> 00:13:21.614\nIs it really needed?\n\n00:13:21.638 --> 00:13:23.334\nCan we maybe be much more selective\n\n00:13:23.358 --> 00:13:26.694\nand create better environments\nthat also benefit from darkness?\n\n00:13:26.718 --> 00:13:28.934\nCan we be much more gentle with light?\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.774\nLike here -- this is\na very low light level actually.\n\n00:13:31.798 --> 00:13:35.414\nCan we engage people more\nin the lighting projects that we create,\n\n00:13:35.438 --> 00:13:38.014\nso they really want\nto connect with it, like here?\n\n00:13:38.038 --> 00:13:39.898\nOr can we create simply sculptures\n\n00:13:39.922 --> 00:13:42.534\nthat are very inspiring\nto be in and to be around?\n\n00:13:42.558 --> 00:13:44.534\nAnd can we preserve the darkness?\n\n00:13:44.558 --> 00:13:46.797\nBecause to find a place\nlike this today on Earth\n\n00:13:46.821 --> 00:13:49.461\nis really very, very challenging.\n\n00:13:50.398 --> 00:13:53.694\nAnd to find a starry sky like this\nis even more difficult.\n\n00:13:53.718 --> 00:13:56.694\nEven in the oceans,\nwe are creating a lot of light\n\n00:13:56.718 --> 00:13:58.174\nthat we could actually ban\n\n00:13:58.198 --> 00:14:01.854\nalso for animal life\nto have a much greater well-being.\n\n00:14:01.878 --> 00:14:05.174\nAnd it's known that migrating birds,\nfor example, get very disoriented\n\n00:14:05.198 --> 00:14:07.254\nbecause of these offshore platforms.\n\n00:14:07.278 --> 00:14:10.054\nAnd we discovered that\nwhen we make those lights green,\n\n00:14:10.078 --> 00:14:12.094\nthe birds, they actually go the right way.\n\n00:14:12.118 --> 00:14:14.134\nThey are not disturbed anymore.\n\n00:14:14.158 --> 00:14:15.976\nAnd it turns out once again\n\n00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.158\nthat spectral sensitivity\nis very important here.\n\n00:14:20.878 --> 00:14:23.334\nIn all of these examples, I think,\n\n00:14:23.358 --> 00:14:26.254\nwe should start making\nthe light out of darkness,\n\n00:14:26.278 --> 00:14:30.174\nand use the darkness as a canvas --\nlike the visual artists do,\n\n00:14:30.198 --> 00:14:32.454\nlike Edward Hopper in this painting.\n\n00:14:32.478 --> 00:14:35.174\nI think that there is\na lot of suspense in this painting.\n\n00:14:35.198 --> 00:14:39.414\nI think, when I see it,\nI start to think, who are those people?\n\n00:14:39.438 --> 00:14:41.694\nWhere have they come from?\nWhere are they going?\n\n00:14:41.718 --> 00:14:42.934\nWhat just happened?\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.214\nWhat will be happening\nin the next five minutes?\n\n00:14:45.238 --> 00:14:48.094\nAnd it only embodies\nall these stories and all this suspense\n\n00:14:48.118 --> 00:14:49.974\nbecause of the darkness and the light.\n\n00:14:49.998 --> 00:14:51.774\nEdward Hopper was a real master\n\n00:14:51.798 --> 00:14:55.414\nin creating the narration\nby working with light and dark.\n\n00:14:55.438 --> 00:14:56.734\nAnd we can learn from that\n\n00:14:56.758 --> 00:15:00.534\nand create more interesting\nand inspiring architectural environments.\n\n00:15:00.558 --> 00:15:03.014\nWe can do that in commercial\nspaces like this.\n\n00:15:03.038 --> 00:15:05.894\nAnd you can still also go outside\n\n00:15:05.918 --> 00:15:10.734\nand enjoy the greatest show\nin the universe,\n\n00:15:10.758 --> 00:15:13.198\nwhich is, of course, the universe itself.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:20.374\nSo I give you this wonderful,\ninformative image of the sky,\n\n00:15:20.398 --> 00:15:22.054\nranging from the inner city,\n\n00:15:22.078 --> 00:15:25.774\nwhere you may see one or two stars\nand nothing else,\n\n00:15:25.798 --> 00:15:28.134\nall the way to the rural environments,\n\n00:15:28.158 --> 00:15:32.414\nwhere you can enjoy this great\nand gorgeous and beautiful performance\n\n00:15:32.438 --> 00:15:34.814\nof the constellations and the stars.\n\n00:15:34.838 --> 00:15:36.918\nIn architecture, it works just the same.\n\n00:15:37.598 --> 00:15:40.974\nBy appreciating the darkness\nwhen you design the light,\n\n00:15:40.998 --> 00:15:43.574\nyou create much more\ninteresting environments\n\n00:15:43.598 --> 00:15:45.918\nthat truly enhance our lives.\n\n00:15:46.518 --> 00:15:50.534\nThis is the most well-known example,\nTadao Ando's Church of the Light.\n\n00:15:50.558 --> 00:15:56.174\nBut I also think\nof Peter Zumthor's spa in Vals,\n\n00:15:56.198 --> 00:15:59.014\nwhere light and dark,\nin very gentle combinations,\n\n00:15:59.038 --> 00:16:01.574\nalter each other to define the space.\n\n00:16:01.598 --> 00:16:04.894\nOr Richard MacCormac's\nSouthwark tube station in London,\n\n00:16:04.918 --> 00:16:08.489\nwhere you can really see the sky,\neven though you are under the ground.\n\n00:16:09.118 --> 00:16:10.814\nAnd finally, I want to point out\n\n00:16:10.838 --> 00:16:13.334\nthat a lot of this inspiration\ncomes from theater.\n\n00:16:13.358 --> 00:16:17.494\nAnd I think it's fantastic\nthat we are today experiencing TEDx\n\n00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:20.014\nin a theater for the first time\n\n00:16:20.038 --> 00:16:24.414\nbecause I think we really owe\nto the theater a big thanks.\n\n00:16:24.438 --> 00:16:26.694\nIt wouldn't be\nsuch an inspiring scenography\n\n00:16:26.718 --> 00:16:27.918\nwithout this theater.\n\n00:16:28.518 --> 00:16:34.734\nAnd I think the theater is a place\nwhere we truly enhance life with light.\n\n00:16:34.758 --> 00:16:35.974\nThank you very much.\n\n00:16:35.998 --> 00:16:41.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "If I should have a daughter ...", "duration": "1105", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/sarah_kay_if_i_should_have_a_daughter", "transcript": "If I should have a daughter, instead of \"Mom,\" she's going to call me \"Point B,\" because that way she knows that no matter what happens, at least she can always find her way to me.And I'm going to paint solar systems on the backs of her hands so she has to learn the entire universe before she can say, \"Oh, I know that like the back of my hand.\"And she's going to learn that this life will hit you hard in the face, wait for you to get back up just so it can kick you in the stomach. But getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to remind your lungs how much they like the taste of air. There is hurt, here, that cannot be fixed by Band-Aids or poetry.So the first time she realizes that Wonder Woman isn't coming, I'll make sure she knows she doesn't have to wear the cape all by herself, because no matter how wide you stretch your fingers, your hands will always be too small to catch all the pain you want to heal. Believe me, I've tried. \"And, baby,\" I'll tell her, don't keep your nose up in the air like that. I know that trick; I've done it a million times. You're just smelling for smoke so you can follow the trail back to a burning house, so you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire to see if you can save him. Or else find the boy who lit the fire in the first place, to see if you can change him. But I know she will anyway, so instead I'll always keep an extra supply of chocolate and rain boots nearby, because there is no heartbreak that chocolate can't fix. Okay, there's a few that chocolate can't fix.But that's what the rain boots are for, because rain will wash away everything, if you let it. I want her to look at the world through the underside of a glass-bottom boat, to look through a microscope at the galaxies that exist on the pinpoint of a human mind, because that's the way my mom taught me. That there'll be days like this.(Singing) There'll be days like this, my momma said. When you open your hands to catch and wind up with only blisters and bruises; when you step out of the phone booth and try to fly and the very people you want to save are the ones standing on your cape; when your boots will fill with rain, and you'll be up to your knees in disappointment. And those are the very days you have all the more reason to say thank you.Because there's nothing more beautiful than the way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline, no matter how many times it's sent away. You will put the wind in win some, lose some. You will put the star in starting over, and over. And no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute, be sure your mind lands on the beauty of this funny place called life. And yes, on a scale from one to over-trusting, I am pretty damn naive. But I want her to know that this world is made out of sugar. It can crumble so easily, but don't be afraid to stick your tongue out and taste it.\"Baby,\" I'll tell her, \"remember, your momma is a worrier, and your poppa is a warrior, and you are the girl with small hands and big eyes who never stops asking for more.\" Remember that good things come in threes and so do bad things. Always apologize when you've done something wrong, but don't you ever apologize for the way your eyes refuse to stop shining. Your voice is small, but don't ever stop singing. And when they finally hand you heartache, when they slip war and hatred under your door and offer you handouts on street-corners of cynicism and defeat, you tell them that they really ought to meet your mother.(Applause)Thank you. Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)Thanks.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)All right, so I want you to take a moment, and I want you to think of three things that you know to be true. They can be about whatever you want \u2014 technology, entertainment, design, your family, what you had for breakfast. The only rule is don't think too hard. Okay, ready? Go. Okay.So here are three things I know to be true. I know that Jean-Luc Godard was right when he said that, \"A good story has a beginning, a middle and an end, although not necessarily in that order.\" I know that I'm incredibly nervous and excited to be up here, which is greatly inhibiting my ability to keep it cool.(Laughter)And I know that I have been waiting all week to tell this joke.(Laughter)Why was the scarecrow invited to TED? Because he was out standing in his field.(Laughter)I'm sorry. Okay, so these are three things I know to be true. But there are plenty of things I have trouble understanding. So I write poems to figure things out. Sometimes the only way I know how to work through something is by writing a poem. Sometimes I get to the end of the poem, look back and go, \"Oh, that's what this is all about,\" and sometimes I get to the end of the poem and haven't solved anything, but at least I have a new poem out of it.Spoken-word poetry is the art of performance poetry. I tell people it involves creating poetry that doesn't just want to sit on paper, that something about it demands it be heard out loud or witnessed in person.When I was a freshman in high school, I was a live wire of nervous hormones. And I was underdeveloped and over-excitable. And despite my fear of ever being looked at for too long, I was fascinated by the idea of spoken-word poetry. I felt that my two secret loves, poetry and theater, had come together, had a baby, a baby I needed to get to know. So I decided to give it a try. My first spoken-word poem, packed with all the wisdom of a 14-year-old, was about the injustice of being seen as unfeminine. The poem was very indignant, and mainly exaggerated, but the only spoken-word poetry that I had seen up until that point was mainly indignant, so I thought that's what was expected of me.The first time that I performed, the audience of teenagers hooted and hollered their sympathy, and when I came off the stage, I was shaking. I felt this tap on my shoulder, and I turned around to see this giant girl in a hoodie sweatshirt emerge from the crowd. She was maybe eight feet tall and looked like she could beat me up with one hand, but instead she just nodded at me and said, \"Hey, I really felt that. Thanks.\" And lightning struck. I was hooked.I discovered this bar on Manhattan's Lower East Side that hosted a weekly poetry open Mic, and my bewildered, but supportive, parents took me to soak in every ounce of spoken word that I could. I was the youngest by at least a decade, but somehow the poets at the Bowery Poetry Club didn't seem bothered by the 14-year-old wandering about. In fact, they welcomed me.And it was here, listening to these poets share their stories, that I learned that spoken-word poetry didn't have to be indignant, it could be fun or painful or serious or silly. The Bowery Poetry Club became my classroom and my home, and the poets who performed encouraged me to share my stories as well. Never mind the fact that I was 14. They told me, \"Write about being 14.\" So I did and stood amazed every week when these brilliant, grown-up poets laughed with me and groaned their sympathy and clapped and told me, \"Hey, I really felt that too.\"Now I can divide my spoken-word journey into three steps. Step one was the moment I said, \"I can. I can do this.\" And that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie. Step two was the moment I said, \"I will. I will continue. I love spoken word. I will keep coming back week after week.\" And step three began when I realized I didn't have to write indignant poems, if that's not what I was. There were things that were specific to me, and the more that I focused on those things, the weirder my poetry got, but the more that it felt like mine. It's not just the adage \"Write what you know.\" It's about gathering up all of the knowledge and experience you've collected up to now to help you dive into the things you don't know. I use poetry to help me work through what I don't understand, but I show up to each new poem with a backpack full of everywhere else that I've been.When I got to university, I met a fellow poet who shared my belief in the magic of spoken-word poetry. And actually, Phil Kaye and I coincidentally also share the same last name. When I was in high school I had created Project V.O.I.C.E. as a way to encourage my friends to do spoken word with me. But Phil and I decided to reinvent Project V.O.I.C.E., this time changing the mission to using spoken-word poetry as a way to entertain, educate and inspire. We stayed full-time students, but in between we traveled, performing and teaching nine-year-olds to MFA candidates, from California to Indiana to India to a public high school just up the street from campus.And we saw over and over the way that spoken-word poetry cracks open locks. But it turns out sometimes, poetry can be really scary. Turns out sometimes, you have to trick teenagers into writing poetry. So I came up with lists. Everyone can write lists. And the first list that I assign is \"10 Things I Know to be True.\" And here's what happens, you would discover it too if we all started sharing our lists out loud. At a certain point, you would realize that someone has the exact same thing, or one thing very similar, to something on your list. And then someone else has something the complete opposite of yours. Third, someone has something you've never even heard of before. Fourth, someone has something you thought you knew everything about, but they're introducing a new angle of looking at it. And I tell people that this is where great stories start from \u2014 these four intersections of what you're passionate about and what others might be invested in.And most people respond really well to this exercise. But one of my students, a freshman named Charlotte, was not convinced. Charlotte was very good at writing lists, but she refused to write any poems. \"Miss,\" she'd say, \"I'm just not interesting. I don't have anything interesting to say.\" So I assigned her list after list, and one day I assigned the list \"10 Things I Should Have Learned by Now.\" Number three on Charlotte's list was, \"I should have learned not to crush on guys three times my age.\" I asked her what that meant, and she said, \"Miss, it's kind of a long story.\" And I said, \"Charlotte, it sounds pretty interesting to me.\" And so she wrote her first poem, a love poem unlike any I had ever heard before. And the poem began, \"Anderson Cooper is a gorgeous man.\"(Laughter)\"Did you see him on 60 Minutes, racing Michael Phelps in a pool \u2014 nothing but swim trunks on \u2014 diving in the water, determined to beat this swimming champion? After the race, he tossed his wet, cloud-white hair and said, 'You're a god.' No, Anderson, you're the god.\"(Laughter)(Applause)Now, I know that the number one rule to being cool is to seem unfazed, to never admit that anything scares you or impresses you or excites you. Somebody once told me it's like walking through life like this. You protect yourself from all the unexpected miseries or hurt that might show up. But I try to walk through life like this. And yes, that means catching all of those miseries and hurt, but it also means that when beautiful, amazing things just fall out of the sky, I'm ready to catch them. I use spoken word to help my students rediscover wonder, to fight their instincts to be cool and unfazed and, instead, actively pursue being engaged with what goes on around them, so that they can reinterpret and create something from it.It's not that I think that spoken-word poetry is the ideal art form. I'm always trying to find the best way to tell each story. I write musicals; I make short films alongside my poems. But I teach spoken-word poetry because it's accessible. Not everyone can read music or owns a camera, but everyone can communicate in some way, and everyone has stories that the rest of us can learn from. Plus, spoken-word poetry allows for immediate connection. It's not uncommon to feel like you're alone or that nobody understands you, but spoken word teaches that if you have the ability to express yourself and the courage to present those stories and opinions, you could be rewarded with a room full of your peers, or your community, who will listen. And maybe even a giant girl in a hoodie who will connect with what you've shared. And that is an amazing realization to have, especially when you're 14. Plus, now with YouTube, that connection's not even limited to the room we're in. I'm so lucky that there's this archive of performances that I can share with my students. It allows for even more opportunities for them to find a poet or a poem that they connect to.Once you've figured this out, it is tempting to keep writing the same poem, or keep telling the same story, over and over, once you've figured out that it will gain you applause. It's not enough to just teach that you can express yourself. You have to grow and explore and take risks and challenge yourself. And that is step three: infusing the work you're doing with the specific things that make you you, even while those things are always changing. Because step three never ends. But you don't get to start on step three, until you take step one first: \"I can.\"I travel a lot while I'm teaching, and I don't always get to watch all of my students reach their step three, but I was very lucky with Charlotte, that I got to watch her journey unfold the way it did. I watched her realize that, by putting the things that she knows to be true into the work she's doing, she can create poems that only Charlotte can write, about eyeballs and elevators and Dora the Explorer. And I'm trying to tell stories only I can tell \u2014 like this story. I spent a lot of time thinking about the best way to tell this story, and I wondered if the best way was going to be a PowerPoint, a short film \u2014 And where exactly was the beginning, the middle or the end? I wondered whether I'd get to the end of this talk and finally have figured it all out, or not.And I always thought that my beginning was at the Bowery Poetry Club, but it's possible that it was much earlier. In preparing for TED, I discovered this diary page in an old journal. I think December 54th was probably supposed to be 24th. It's clear that when I was a child, I definitely walked through life like this. I think that we all did. I would like to help others rediscover that wonder \u2014 to want to engage with it, to want to learn, to want to share what they've learned, what they've figured out to be true and what they're still figuring out.So I'd like to close with this poem.When they bombed Hiroshima, the explosion formed a mini-supernova, so every living animal, human or plant that received direct contact with the rays from that sun was instantly turned to ash. And what was left of the city soon followed. The long-lasting damage of nuclear radiation caused an entire city and its population to turn into powder. When I was born, my mom says I looked around the whole hospital room with a stare that said, \"This? I've done this before.\" She says I have old eyes. When my Grandpa Genji died, I was only five years old, but I took my mom by the hand and told her, \"Don't worry, he'll come back as a baby.\" And yet, for someone who's apparently done this already, I still haven't figured anything out yet. My knees still buckle every time I get on a stage. My self-confidence can be measured out in teaspoons mixed into my poetry, and it still always tastes funny in my mouth. But in Hiroshima, some people were wiped clean away, leaving only a wristwatch or a diary page. So no matter that I have inhibitions to fill all my pockets, I keep trying, hoping that one day I'll write a poem I can be proud to let sit in a museum exhibit as the only proof I existed. My parents named me Sarah, which is a biblical name. In the original story, God told Sarah she could do something impossible, and \u2014 she laughed, because the first Sarah, she didn't know what to do with impossible. And me? Well, neither do I, but I see the impossible every day. Impossible is trying to connect in this world, trying to hold onto others while things are blowing up around you, knowing that while you're speaking, they aren't just waiting for their turn to talk \u2014 they hear you. They feel exactly what you feel at the same time that you feel it. It's what I strive for every time I open my mouth \u2014 that impossible connection. There's this piece of wall in Hiroshima that was completely burnt black by the radiation. But on the front step, a person who was sitting there blocked the rays from hitting the stone. The only thing left now is a permanent shadow of positive light. After the A-bomb, specialists said it would take 75 years for the radiation-damaged soil of Hiroshima City to ever grow anything again. But that spring, there were new buds popping up from the earth. When I meet you, in that moment, I'm no longer a part of your future. I start quickly becoming part of your past. But in that instant, I get to share your present. And you, you get to share mine. And that is the greatest present of all. So if you tell me I can do the impossible \u2014 I'll probably laugh at you. I don't know if I can change the world yet, because I don't know that much about it \u2014 and I don't know that much about reincarnation either, but if you make me laugh hard enough, sometimes I forget what century I'm in. This isn't my first time here. This isn't my last time here. These aren't the last words I'll share. But just in case, I'm trying my hardest to get it right this time around.Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1100, "subtitle":

Thanks.\"\n\n00:06:47.472 --> 00:06:48.639\nAnd lightning struck.\n\n00:06:48.932 --> 00:06:50.203\nI was hooked.\n\n00:06:50.429 --> 00:06:53.697\nI discovered this bar\non Manhattan's Lower East Side\n\n00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:55.934\nthat hosted a weekly poetry open Mic,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.934\nand my bewildered,\nbut supportive, parents took me\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.934\nto soak in every ounce\nof spoken word that I could.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.934\nI was the youngest by at least a decade,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.934\nbut somehow the poets\nat the Bowery Poetry Club\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:11.179\ndidn't seem bothered\nby the 14-year-old wandering about.\n\n00:07:11.203 --> 00:07:12.728\nIn fact, they welcomed me.\n\n00:07:12.752 --> 00:07:15.689\nAnd it was here, listening to these poets\nshare their stories,\n\n00:07:15.713 --> 00:07:18.896\nthat I learned that spoken-word\npoetry didn't have to be indignant,\n\n00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.240\nit could be fun or painful\n\n00:07:21.264 --> 00:07:23.200\nor serious or silly.\n\n00:07:23.224 --> 00:07:26.478\nThe Bowery Poetry Club became\nmy classroom and my home,\n\n00:07:26.502 --> 00:07:28.138\nand the poets who performed\n\n00:07:28.162 --> 00:07:30.542\nencouraged me to share my stories as well.\n\n00:07:30.566 --> 00:07:32.455\nNever mind the fact that I was 14.\n\n00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:34.934\nThey told me, \"Write about being 14.\"\n\n00:07:35.598 --> 00:07:37.677\nSo I did and stood amazed every week\n\n00:07:37.701 --> 00:07:39.934\nwhen these brilliant, grown-up poets\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.959\nlaughed with me and groaned their sympathy\n\n00:07:41.983 --> 00:07:45.286\nand clapped and told me,\n\"Hey, I really felt that too.\"\n\n00:07:46.119 --> 00:07:49.361\nNow I can divide my spoken-word journey\n\n00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:50.934\ninto three steps.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.775\nStep one was the moment I said,\n\n00:07:52.799 --> 00:07:54.934\n\"I can. I can do this.\"\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.145\nAnd that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie.\n\n00:07:57.169 --> 00:07:59.224\nStep two was the moment I said,\n\n00:07:59.248 --> 00:08:01.332\n\"I will. I will continue.\n\n00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.320\nI love spoken word. I will keep\ncoming back week after week.\"\n\n00:08:04.344 --> 00:08:05.934\nAnd step three began\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.758\nwhen I realized I didn't have\nto write indignant poems,\n\n00:08:08.782 --> 00:08:10.180\nif that's not what I was.\n\n00:08:10.204 --> 00:08:12.369\nThere were things\nthat were specific to me,\n\n00:08:12.393 --> 00:08:14.934\nand the more that I focused\non those things,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.934\nthe weirder my poetry got,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.934\nbut the more that it felt like mine.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:22.656\nIt's not just the adage\n\"Write what you know.\"\n\n00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.505\nIt's about gathering up\nall of the knowledge and experience\n\n00:08:25.529 --> 00:08:27.140\nyou've collected up to now\n\n00:08:27.164 --> 00:08:29.903\nto help you dive into the things\nyou don't know.\n\n00:08:29.927 --> 00:08:32.810\nI use poetry to help me work\nthrough what I don't understand,\n\n00:08:32.834 --> 00:08:34.779\nbut I show up to each new poem\n\n00:08:34.803 --> 00:08:37.934\nwith a backpack full\nof everywhere else that I've been.\n\n00:08:38.424 --> 00:08:41.149\nWhen I got to university,\nI met a fellow poet\n\n00:08:41.173 --> 00:08:44.665\nwho shared my belief in the magic\nof spoken-word poetry.\n\n00:08:44.689 --> 00:08:46.683\nAnd actually, Phil Kaye and I\n\n00:08:46.707 --> 00:08:49.300\ncoincidentally also share\nthe same last name.\n\n00:08:49.324 --> 00:08:52.059\nWhen I was in high school I had\ncreated Project V.O.I.C.E.\n\n00:08:52.083 --> 00:08:54.934\nas a way to encourage my friends\nto do spoken word with me.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.934\nBut Phil and I decided to reinvent\nProject V.O.I.C.E.,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.934\nthis time changing the mission\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.934\nto using spoken-word poetry\nas a way to entertain,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.934\neducate and inspire.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.673\nWe stayed full-time students,\nbut in between we traveled,\n\n00:09:07.697 --> 00:09:09.525\nperforming and teaching\n\n00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:11.933\nnine-year-olds to MFA candidates,\n\n00:09:11.957 --> 00:09:15.303\nfrom California to Indiana to India\n\n00:09:15.327 --> 00:09:17.934\nto a public high school\njust up the street from campus.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.935\nAnd we saw over and over\n\n00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:21.934\nthe way that spoken-word poetry\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.373\ncracks open locks.\n\n00:09:24.059 --> 00:09:28.178\nBut it turns out sometimes,\npoetry can be really scary.\n\n00:09:28.781 --> 00:09:30.273\nTurns out sometimes,\n\n00:09:30.297 --> 00:09:32.934\nyou have to trick teenagers\ninto writing poetry.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:36.423\nSo I came up with lists.\nEveryone can write lists.\n\n00:09:36.447 --> 00:09:38.473\nAnd the first list that I assign\n\n00:09:38.497 --> 00:09:41.177\nis \"10 Things I Know to be True.\"\n\n00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.136\nAnd here's what happens,\nyou would discover it too\n\n00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.279\nif we all started sharing\nour lists out loud.\n\n00:09:46.303 --> 00:09:51.633\nAt a certain point, you would realize\nthat someone has the exact same thing,\n\n00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:53.634\nor one thing very similar,\n\n00:09:53.658 --> 00:09:54.934\nto something on your list.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.934\nAnd then someone else\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.528\nhas something the complete\nopposite of yours.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nThird, someone has something\nyou've never even heard of before.\n\n00:10:02.982 --> 00:10:06.427\nFourth, someone has something\nyou thought you knew everything about,\n\n00:10:06.451 --> 00:10:08.934\nbut they're introducing\na new angle of looking at it.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:12.006\nAnd I tell people that this is\nwhere great stories start from --\n\n00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.158\nthese four intersections\n\n00:10:14.182 --> 00:10:15.934\nof what you're passionate about\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.341\nand what others might be invested in.\n\n00:10:18.365 --> 00:10:20.934\nAnd most people respond\nreally well to this exercise.\n\n00:10:21.634 --> 00:10:24.079\nBut one of my students,\na freshman named Charlotte,\n\n00:10:24.103 --> 00:10:25.563\nwas not convinced.\n\n00:10:25.999 --> 00:10:29.625\nCharlotte was very good at writing lists,\nbut she refused to write any poems.\n\n00:10:29.649 --> 00:10:31.937\n\"Miss,\" she'd say,\n\"I'm just not interesting.\n\n00:10:31.961 --> 00:10:34.388\nI don't have anything interesting to say.\"\n\n00:10:35.069 --> 00:10:36.934\nSo I assigned her list after list,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.609\nand one day I assigned the list\n\n00:10:38.633 --> 00:10:40.609\n\"10 Things I Should Have Learned by Now.\"\n\n00:10:41.251 --> 00:10:43.161\nNumber three on Charlotte's list was,\n\n00:10:43.185 --> 00:10:45.202\n\"I should have learned\nnot to crush on guys\n\n00:10:45.226 --> 00:10:46.701\nthree times my age.\"\n\n00:10:47.653 --> 00:10:49.026\nI asked her what that meant,\n\n00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.488\nand she said, \"Miss,\nit's kind of a long story.\"\n\n00:10:51.512 --> 00:10:54.336\nAnd I said, \"Charlotte, it sounds\npretty interesting to me.\"\n\n00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.114\nAnd so she wrote her first poem,\n\n00:10:56.138 --> 00:10:59.715\na love poem unlike any\nI had ever heard before.\n\n00:10:59.739 --> 00:11:02.160\nAnd the poem began,\n\n00:11:02.184 --> 00:11:04.302\n\"Anderson Cooper is a gorgeous man.\"\n\n00:11:04.326 --> 00:11:06.795\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:06.819 -->

00:11:15.090\ndiving in the water, determined\nto beat this swimming champion?\n\n00:11:15.114 --> 00:11:17.503\nAfter the race, he tossed\nhis wet, cloud-white hair\n\n00:11:17.527 --> 00:11:18.786\nand said, 'You're a god.'\n\n00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:20.934\nNo, Anderson, you're the god.\"\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:22.958 -->

00:11:41.107\nit's like walking through life like this.\n\n00:11:41.131 --> 00:11:42.505\nYou protect yourself\n\n00:11:42.529 --> 00:11:45.767\nfrom all the unexpected miseries\nor hurt that might show up.\n\n00:11:45.791 --> 00:11:48.421\nBut I try to walk through life like this.\n\n00:11:48.445 --> 00:11:51.312\nAnd yes, that means catching\nall of those miseries and hurt,\n\n00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:55.062\nbut it also means\nthat when beautiful, amazing things\n\n00:11:55.086 --> 00:11:56.503\njust fall out of the sky,\n\n00:11:56.527 --> 00:11:57.934\nI'm ready to catch them.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.339\nI use spoken word to help my students\n\n00:12:00.363 --> 00:12:01.934\nrediscover wonder,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.724\nto fight their instincts\nto be cool and unfazed\n\n00:12:04.748 --> 00:12:08.263\nand, instead, actively pursue being\nengaged with what goes on around them,\n\n00:12:08.287 --> 00:12:11.580\nso that they can reinterpret\nand create something from it.\n\n00:12:11.604 --> 00:12:13.897\nIt's not that I think\nthat spoken-word poetry\n\n00:12:13.921 --> 00:12:15.397\nis the ideal art form.\n\n00:12:15.421 --> 00:12:18.556\nI'm always trying to find\nthe best way to tell each story.\n\n00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.605\nI write musicals; I make short films\nalongside my poems.\n\n00:12:21.629 --> 00:12:23.803\nBut I teach spoken-word poetry\n\n00:12:23.827 --> 00:12:25.772\nbecause it's accessible.\n\n00:12:25.796 --> 00:12:29.244\nNot everyone can read music\nor owns a camera,\n\n00:12:29.268 --> 00:12:31.633\nbut everyone can communicate in some way,\n\n00:12:31.657 --> 00:12:35.434\nand everyone has stories\nthat the rest of us can learn from.\n\n00:12:35.458 --> 00:12:38.690\nPlus, spoken-word poetry allows\nfor immediate connection.\n\n00:12:38.714 --> 00:12:40.909\nIt's not uncommon\nto feel like you're alone\n\n00:12:40.933 --> 00:12:42.526\nor that nobody understands you,\n\n00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:43.934\nbut spoken word teaches\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.689\nthat if you have the ability\nto express yourself\n\n00:12:46.713 --> 00:12:49.530\nand the courage to present\nthose stories and opinions,\n\n00:12:49.554 --> 00:12:50.934\nyou could be rewarded\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.934\nwith a room full of your peers,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.244\nor your community, who will listen.\n\n00:12:55.268 --> 00:12:57.563\nAnd maybe even a giant girl in a hoodie\n\n00:12:57.587 --> 00:12:59.633\nwho will connect with what you've shared.\n\n00:12:59.657 --> 00:13:01.934\nAnd that is an amazing\nrealization to have,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.804\nespecially when you're 14.\n\n00:13:04.424 --> 00:13:05.934\nPlus, now with YouTube,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.600\nthat connection's not even limited\nto the room we're in.\n\n00:13:08.624 --> 00:13:11.846\nI'm so lucky that there's\nthis archive of performances\n\n00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.534\nthat I can share with my students.\n\n00:13:13.558 --> 00:13:16.003\nIt allows for even more opportunities\n\n00:13:16.027 --> 00:13:19.430\nfor them to find a poet or a poem\nthat they connect to.\n\n00:13:19.825 --> 00:13:22.292\nOnce you've figured this out,\n\n00:13:22.316 --> 00:13:24.459\nit is tempting to keep\nwriting the same poem,\n\n00:13:24.483 --> 00:13:26.666\nor keep telling the same story,\nover and over,\n\n00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:29.269\nonce you've figured out\nthat it will gain you applause.\n\n00:13:29.293 --> 00:13:32.276\nIt's not enough to just teach\nthat you can express yourself.\n\n00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.934\nYou have to grow and explore\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.255\nand take risks and challenge yourself.\n\n00:13:36.279 --> 00:13:38.934\nAnd that is step three:\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.934\ninfusing the work you're doing\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.006\nwith the specific things\nthat make you you,\n\n00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:45.360\neven while those things\nare always changing.\n\n00:13:45.667 --> 00:13:48.098\nBecause step three never ends.\n\n00:13:48.507 --> 00:13:50.511\nBut you don't get to start on step three,\n\n00:13:50.535 --> 00:13:52.699\nuntil you take step one first:\n\n00:13:52.723 --> 00:13:53.736\n\"I can.\"\n\n00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.482\nI travel a lot while I'm teaching,\n\n00:13:55.506 --> 00:13:59.008\nand I don't always get to watch\nall of my students reach their step three,\n\n00:13:59.032 --> 00:14:00.750\nbut I was very lucky with Charlotte,\n\n00:14:00.774 --> 00:14:03.414\nthat I got to watch her journey\nunfold the way it did.\n\n00:14:03.438 --> 00:14:04.770\nI watched her realize\n\n00:14:04.794 --> 00:14:08.570\nthat, by putting the things that she knows\nto be true into the work she's doing,\n\n00:14:08.594 --> 00:14:11.034\nshe can create poems\nthat only Charlotte can write,\n\n00:14:11.058 --> 00:14:13.997\nabout eyeballs and elevators\nand Dora the Explorer.\n\n00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.711\nAnd I'm trying to tell\nstories only I can tell --\n\n00:14:16.735 --> 00:14:17.934\nlike this story.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:21.222\nI spent a lot of time thinking\nabout the best way to tell this story,\n\n00:14:21.246 --> 00:14:22.688\nand I wondered if the best way\n\n00:14:22.712 --> 00:14:24.815\nwas going to be\na PowerPoint, a short film --\n\n00:14:24.839 --> 00:14:27.616\nAnd where exactly was the beginning,\nthe middle or the end?\n\n00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.013\nI wondered whether I'd get\nto the end of this talk\n\n00:14:30.037 --> 00:14:32.591\nand finally have\nfigured it all out, or not.\n\n00:14:33.266 --> 00:14:36.530\nAnd I always thought that my beginning\nwas at the Bowery Poetry Club,\n\n00:14:36.554 --> 00:14:38.630\nbut it's possible\nthat it was much earlier.\n\n00:14:38.654 --> 00:14:39.934\nIn preparing for TED,\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.197\nI discovered this diary page\nin an old journal.\n\n00:14:42.221 --> 00:14:45.403\nI think December 54th\nwas probably supposed to be 24th.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.934\nIt's clear that when I was a child,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.211\nI definitely walked\nthrough life like this.\n\n00:14:50.235 --> 00:14:51.545\nI think that we all did.\n\n00:14:52.021 --> 00:14:54.934\nI would like to help others\nrediscover that wonder --\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.423\nto want to engage with it,\nto want to learn,\n\n00:14:57.447 --> 00:14:59.334\nto want to share what they've learned,\n\n00:14:59.358 --> 00:15:01.034\nwhat they've figured out to be true\n\n00:15:01.058 --> 00:15:03.034\nand what they're still figuring out.\n\n00:15:03.058 --> 00:15:05.220\nSo I'd like to close with this poem.\n\n00:15:06.764 --> 00:15:09.345\nWhen they bombed Hiroshima,\n\n00:15:09.369 --> 00:15:12.424\nthe explosion formed a mini-supernova,\n\n00:15:12.448 --> 00:15:15.502\nso every living animal, human or plant\n\n00:15:15.526 --> 00:15:19.204\nthat received direct contact\nwith the rays from that sun\n\n00:15:19.228 --> 00:15:20.824\nwas instantly turned to ash.\n\n00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.199\nAnd what was left\nof the city soon followed.\n\n00:15:23.223 --> 00:15:25.627\nThe long-lasting damage\nof nuclear radiation\n\n00:15:25.651 --> 00:15:28.568\ncaused an entire city and its population\n\n00:15:28.592 --> 00:15:30.436\nto turn into powder.\n\n00:15:31.104 --> 00:15:34.717\nWhen I was born, my mom says\nI looked around the whole hospital room\n\n00:15:34.741 --> 00:15:37.934\nwith a stare that said,\n\"This? I've done this before.\"\n\n00:15:38.382 --> 00:15:40.036\nShe says I have old eyes.\n\n00:15:40.298 --> 00:15:42.934\nWhen my Grandpa Genji died,\nI was only five years old,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.107\nbut I took my mom\nby the hand and told her,\n\n00:15:45.131 --> 00:15:47.671\n\"Don't worry, he'll come back as a baby.\"\n\n00:15:48.242 --> 00:15:51.406\nAnd yet, for someone\nwho's apparently done this already,\n\n00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:53.934\nI still haven't figured anything out yet.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.934\nMy knees still buckle\nevery time I get on a stage.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.934\nMy self-confidence can be measured out\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.934\nin teaspoons mixed into my poetry,\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.934\nand it still always\ntastes funny in my mouth.\n\n00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.481\nBut in Hiroshima, some people\nwere wiped clean away,\n\n00:16:07.505 --> 00:16:10.259\nleaving only a wristwatch or a diary page.\n\n00:16:10.283 --> 00:16:13.715\nSo no matter that I have inhibitions\nto fill all my pockets,\n\n00:16:13.739 --> 00:16:14.934\nI keep trying,\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.934\nhoping that one day I'll write a poem\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:19.101\nI can be proud to let sit\nin a museum exhibit\n\n00:16:19.125 --> 00:16:21.362\nas the only proof I existed.\n\n00:16:21.813 --> 00:16:24.934\nMy parents named me Sarah,\nwhich is a biblical name.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:29.315\nIn the original story, God told Sarah\nshe could do something impossible, and --\n\n00:16:29.783 --> 00:16:31.037\nshe laughed,\n\n00:16:31.061 --> 00:16:32.638\nbecause the first Sarah,\n\n00:16:32.662 --> 00:16:35.006\nshe didn't know what to do\nwith impossible.\n\n00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.230\nAnd me?\n\n00:16:36.414 --> 00:16:37.934\nWell, neither do I,\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.934\nbut I see the impossible every day.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.863\nImpossible is trying\nto connect in this world,\n\n00:16:42.887 --> 00:16:45.991\ntrying to hold onto others while things\nare blowing up around you,\n\n00:16:46.015 --> 00:16:47.691\nknowing that while you're speaking,\n\n00:16:47.715 --> 00:16:50.773\nthey aren't just waiting for their turn\nto talk -- they hear you.\n\n00:16:50.797 --> 00:16:52.288\nThey feel exactly what you feel\n\n00:16:52.312 --> 00:16:53.934\nat the same time that you feel it.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.435\nIt's what I strive for every time\nI open my mouth --\n\n00:16:56.459 --> 00:16:58.539\nthat impossible connection.\n\n00:16:58.563 --> 00:17:00.934\nThere's this piece of wall in Hiroshima\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:03.700\nthat was completely burnt\nblack by the radiation.\n\n00:17:03.724 --> 00:17:06.398\nBut on the front step,\na person who was sitting there\n\n00:17:06.422 --> 00:17:08.692\nblocked the rays from hitting the stone.\n\n00:17:08.716 --> 00:17:09.934\nThe only thing left now\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.466\nis a permanent shadow of positive light.\n\n00:17:12.883 --> 00:17:13.934\nAfter the A-bomb,\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.546\nspecialists said it would take 75 years\n\n00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:18.934\nfor the radiation-damaged\nsoil of Hiroshima City\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.934\nto ever grow anything again.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:24.323\nBut that spring, there were\nnew buds popping up from the earth.\n\n00:17:24.347 --> 00:17:26.350\nWhen I meet you, in that moment,\n\n00:17:26.374 --> 00:17:28.210\nI'm no longer a part of your future.\n\n00:17:28.234 --> 00:17:30.473\nI start quickly becoming\npart of your past.\n\n00:17:30.497 --> 00:17:32.934\nBut in that instant,\nI get to share your present.\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:34.934\nAnd you, you get to share mine.\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:36.934\nAnd that is the greatest present of all.\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:39.220\nSo if you tell me\nI can do the impossible --\n\n00:17:39.852 --> 00:17:41.346\nI'll probably laugh at you.\n\n00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:43.458\nI don't know if I can change\nthe world yet,\n\n00:17:43.482 --> 00:17:45.501\nbecause I don't know that much about it --\n\n00:17:45.525 --> 00:17:48.115\nand I don't know that much\nabout reincarnation either,\n\n00:17:48.139 --> 00:17:49.983\nbut if you make me laugh hard enough,\n\n00:17:50.007 --> 00:17:52.235\nsometimes I forget what century I'm in.\n\n00:17:52.259 --> 00:17:55.718\nThis isn't my first time here.\nThis isn't my last time here.\n\n00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:57.654\nThese aren't the last words I'll share.\n\n00:17:57.678 --> 00:17:59.934\nBut just in case, I'm trying my hardest\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:02.369\nto get it right this time around.\n\n00:18:02.854 --> 00:18:03.957\nThank you.\n\n00:18:03.981 --> 00:18:05.811\n(Applause)\n\n00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:06.867\nThank you.\n\n00:18:06.891 --> 00:18:10.124\n(Applause)\n\n00:18:10.148 --> 00:18:11.295\nThank you.\n\n00:18:11.319 --> 00:18:14.156\n(Applause)\n\n00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.300\nThank you.\n\n00:18:15.324 --> 00:18:17.648\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The magic washing machine", "duration": "555", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_and_the_magic_washing_machine", "transcript": "I was only four years old when I saw my mother load a washing machine for the very first time in her life. That was a great day for my mother. My mother and father had been saving money for years to be able to buy that machine, and the first day it was going to be used, even Grandma was invited to see the machine. And Grandma was even more excited. Throughout her life she had been heating water with firewood, and she had hand washed laundry for seven children. And now she was going to watch electricity do that work.My mother carefully opened the door, and she loaded the laundry into the machine, like this. And then, when she closed the door, Grandma said, \"No, no, no, no. Let me, let me push the button.\" And Grandma pushed the button, and she said, \"Oh, fantastic! I want to see this! Give me a chair! Give me a chair! I want to see it,\" and she sat down in front of the machine, and she watched the entire washing program. She was mesmerized. To my grandmother, the washing machine was a miracle.Today, in Sweden and other rich countries, people are using so many different machines. Look, the homes are full of machines. I can't even name them all. And they also, when they want to travel, they use flying machines that can take them to remote destinations. And yet, in the world, there are so many people who still heat the water on fire, and they cook their food on fire. Sometimes they don't even have enough food, and they live below the poverty line. There are two billion fellow human beings who live on less than two dollars a day. And the richest people over there \u2014 there's one billion people \u2014 and they live above what I call the \"air line,\" because they spend more than $80 a day on their consumption.But this is just one, two, three billion people, and obviously there are seven billion people in the world, so there must be one, two, three, four billion people more who live in between the poverty and the air line. They have electricity, but the question is, how many have washing machines? I've done the scrutiny of market data, and I've found that, indeed, the washing machine has penetrated below the air line, and today there's an additional one billion people out there who live above the \"wash line.\" (Laughter) And they consume more than $40 per day. So two billion have access to washing machines.And the remaining five billion, how do they wash? Or, to be more precise, how do most of the women in the world wash? Because it remains hard work for women to wash. They wash like this: by hand. It's a hard, time-consuming labor, which they have to do for hours every week. And sometimes they also have to bring water from far away to do the laundry at home, or they have to bring the laundry away to a stream far off. And they want the washing machine. They don't want to spend such a large part of their life doing this hard work with so relatively low productivity. And there's nothing different in their wish than it was for my grandma. Look here, two generations ago in Sweden \u2014 picking water from the stream, heating with firewood and washing like that. They want the washing machine in exactly the same way.But when I lecture to environmentally-concerned students, they tell me, \"No, everybody in the world cannot have cars and washing machines.\" How can we tell this woman that she ain't going to have a washing machine? And then I ask my students, I've asked them \u2014 over the last two years I've asked, \"How many of you doesn't use a car?\" And some of them proudly raise their hand and say, \"I don't use a car.\" And then I put the really tough question: \"How many of you hand-wash your jeans and your bed sheets?\" And no one raised their hand. Even the hardcore in the green movement use washing machines.(Laughter)So how come [this is] something that everyone uses and they think others will not stop it? What is special with this? I had to do an analysis about the energy used in the world. Here we are. Look here, you see the seven billion people up there: the air people, the wash people, the bulb people and the fire people. One unit like this is an energy unit of fossil fuel \u2014 oil, coal or gas. That's what most of electricity and the energy in the world is. And it's 12 units used in the entire world, and the richest one billion, they use six of them. Half of the energy is used by one seventh of the world's population. And these ones who have washing machines, but not a house full of other machines, they use two. This group uses three, one each. And they also have electricity. And over there they don't even use one each. That makes 12 of them.But the main concern for the environmentally-interested students \u2014 and they are right \u2014 is about the future. What are the trends? If we just prolong the trends, without any real advanced analysis, to 2050, there are two things that can increase the energy use. First, population growth. Second, economic growth. Population growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here because they have high child mortality and they have many children per woman. And [with] that you will get two extra, but that won't change the energy use very much.What will happen is economic growth. The best of here in the emerging economies \u2014 I call them the New East \u2014 they will jump the air line. \"Wopp!\" they will say. And they will start to use as much as the Old West are doing already. And these people, they want the washing machine. I told you. They'll go there. And they will double their energy use. And we hope that the poor people will get into the electric light. And they'll get a two-child family without a stop in population growth. But the total energy consumption will increase to 22 units. And these 22 units \u2014 still the richest people use most of it. So what needs to be done? Because the risk, the high probability of climate change is real. It's real. Of course they must be more energy-efficient. They must change behavior in some way. They must also start to produce green energy, much more green energy. But until they have the same energy consumption per person, they shouldn't give advice to others \u2014 what to do and what not to do. (Applause) Here we can get more green energy all over.This is what we hope may happen. It's a real challenge in the future. But I can assure you that this woman in the favela in Rio, she wants a washing machine. She's very happy about her minister of energy that provided electricity to everyone \u2014 so happy that she even voted for her. And she became Dilma Rousseff, the president-elect of one of the biggest democracies in the world \u2014 moving from minister of energy to president. If you have democracy, people will vote for washing machines. They love them.And what's the magic with them? My mother explained the magic with this machine the very, very first day. She said, \"Now Hans, we have loaded the laundry. The machine will make the work. And now we can go to the library.\" Because this is the magic: you load the laundry, and what do you get out of the machine? You get books out of the machines, children's books. And mother got time to read for me. She loved this. I got the \"ABC's\" \u2014 this is where I started my career as a professor, when my mother had time to read for me. And she also got books for herself. She managed to study English and learn that as a foreign language. And she read so many novels, so many different novels here. And we really, we really loved this machine.And what we said, my mother and me, \"Thank you industrialization. Thank you steel mill. Thank you power station. And thank you chemical processing industry that gave us time to read books.\"Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1101, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nI was only four years old\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nwhen I saw my mother load a washing machine\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nfor the very first time in her life.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nThat was a great day for my mother.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nMy mother and father had been saving money for years\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nto be able to buy that machine,\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nand the first day it was going to be used,\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\neven Grandma was invited\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nto see the machine.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nAnd Grandma was even more excited.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nThroughout her life\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nshe had been heating water with firewood,\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nand she had hand washed laundry\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nfor seven children.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nAnd now she was going to watch\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nelectricity do that work.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nMy mother carefully opened the door,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nand she loaded the laundry\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\ninto the machine,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nlike this.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nAnd then, when she closed the door,\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nGrandma said, \"No, no, no, no.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nLet me, let me push the button.\"\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nAnd Grandma pushed the button,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nand she said, \"Oh, fantastic!\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nI want to see this! Give me a chair!\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nGive me a chair! I want to see it,\"\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nand she sat down in front of the machine,\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nand she watched the entire washing program.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nShe was mesmerized.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nTo my grandmother,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nthe washing machine was a miracle.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nToday, in Sweden and other rich countries,\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\npeople are using\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nso many different machines.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nLook, the homes are full of machines.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nI can't even name them all.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nAnd they also, when they want to travel,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nthey use flying machines\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nthat can take them to remote destinations.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nAnd yet, in the world, there are so many people\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nwho still heat the water on fire,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nand they cook their food on fire.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nSometimes they don't even have enough food,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nand they live below the poverty line.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nThere are two billion fellow human beings\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nwho live on less than two dollars a day.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nAnd the richest people over there --\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nthere's one billion people --\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nand they live above what I call the \"air line,\"\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nbecause they spend more than $80 a day\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\non their consumption.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nBut this is just one, two, three billion people,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nand obviously there are seven billion people in the world,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nso there must be one, two, three, four billion people more\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nwho live in between the poverty and the air line.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nThey have electricity,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nbut the question is, how many have washing machines?\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nI've done the scrutiny of market data,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nand I've found that, indeed,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nthe washing machine has penetrated below the air line,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nand today there's an additional one billion people out there\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nwho live above the \"wash line.\"\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nAnd they consume more than $40 per day.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nSo two billion have access to washing machines.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nAnd the remaining five billion,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nhow do they wash?\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nOr, to be more precise,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nhow do most of the women in the world wash?\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nBecause it remains hard work for women to wash.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nThey wash like this: by hand.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nIt's a hard, time-consuming labor,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nwhich they have to do for hours every week.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nAnd sometimes they also have to bring water from far away\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nto do the laundry at home,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nor they have to bring the laundry away to a stream far off.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nAnd they want the washing machine.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nThey don't want to spend such a large part of their life\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\ndoing this hard work\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nwith so relatively low productivity.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nAnd there's nothing different in their wish\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nthan it was for my grandma.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nLook here, two generations ago in Sweden --\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\npicking water from the stream,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nheating with firewood and washing like that.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nThey want the washing machine in exactly the same way.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nBut when I lecture to environmentally-concerned students,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nthey tell me, \"No, everybody in the world cannot have cars and washing machines.\"\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nHow can we tell this woman\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nthat she ain't going to have a washing machine?\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nAnd then I ask my students,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nI've asked them -- over the last two years I've asked,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\n\"How many of you doesn't use a car?\"\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nAnd some of them proudly raise their hand\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nand say, \"I don't use a car.\"\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nAnd then I put the really tough question:\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\n\"How many of you\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nhand-wash your jeans and your bed sheets?\"\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nAnd no one raised their hand.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nEven the hardcore in the green movement\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nuse washing machines.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nSo how come [this is] something that everyone uses\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nand they think others will not stop it? What is special with this?\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nI had to do an analysis about the energy used in the world.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nHere we are.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nLook here, you see the seven billion people up there:\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nthe air people, the wash people,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nthe bulb people and the fire people.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nOne unit like this\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nis an energy unit of fossil fuel --\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\noil, coal or gas.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nThat's what most of electricity and the energy in the world is.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nAnd it's 12 units used in the entire world,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nand the richest one billion, they use six of them.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nHalf of the energy is used by one seventh of the world's population.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nAnd these ones who have washing machines,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nbut not a house full of other machines,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nthey use two.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nThis group uses three, one each.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd they also have electricity.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nAnd over there they don't even use one each.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nThat makes 12 of them.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nBut the main concern\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nfor the environmentally-interested students -- and they are right --\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nis about the future.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nWhat are the trends? If we just prolong the trends,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nwithout any real advanced analysis, to 2050,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nthere are two things that can increase the energy use.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nFirst, population growth.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nSecond, economic growth.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nPopulation growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nbecause they have high child mortality\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nand they have many children per woman.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nAnd [with] that you will get two extra,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nbut that won't change the energy use very much.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nWhat will happen is economic growth.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nThe best of here in the emerging economies --\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nI call them the New East --\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nthey will jump the air line.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\n\"Wopp!\" they will say.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nAnd they will start to use as much as the Old West are doing already.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nAnd these people, they want the washing machine.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nI told you. They'll go there.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nAnd they will double their energy use.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nAnd we hope that the poor people will get into the electric light.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nAnd they'll get a two-child family without a stop in population growth.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nBut the total energy consumption\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nwill increase to 22 units.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAnd these 22 units --\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nstill the richest people use most of it.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nSo what needs to be done?\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nBecause the risk,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nthe high probability of climate change is real.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nIt's real.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nOf course they must be more energy-efficient.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nThey must change behavior in some way.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nThey must also start to produce green energy,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nmuch more green energy.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nBut until they have the same energy consumption per person,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nthey shouldn't give advice to others --\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nwhat to do and what not to do.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nHere we can get more green energy all over.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nThis is what we hope may happen.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nIt's a real challenge in the future.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nBut I can assure you that this woman in the favela in Rio,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nshe wants a washing machine.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nShe's very happy about her minister of energy\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nthat provided electricity to everyone --\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nso happy that she even voted for her.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nAnd she became Dilma Rousseff,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nthe president-elect\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nof one of the biggest democracies in the world --\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nmoving from minister of energy to president.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nIf you have democracy,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\npeople will vote for washing machines.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nThey love them.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nAnd what's the magic with them?\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nMy mother explained the magic with this machine\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nthe very, very first day.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nShe said, \"Now Hans,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nwe have loaded the laundry.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nThe machine will make the work.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd now we can go to the library.\"\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nBecause this is the magic:\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nyou load the laundry,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nand what do you get out of the machine?\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nYou get books out of the machines,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nchildren's books.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nAnd mother got time to read for me.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nShe loved this.

It's a place where women run the show, have sex to say hello, and play rules the day \u2014 where fun is serious business. And no, this isn't Burning Man or San Francisco. (Laughter) Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins. This is the world of wild bonobos in the jungles of Congo. Bonobos are, together with chimpanzees, your living closest relative. That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived around six million years ago. Now, chimpanzees are well-known for their aggression.(Laughter)But unfortunately, we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in our narratives of human evolution. But bonobos show us the other side of the coin. While chimpanzees are dominated by big, scary guys, bonobo society is run by empowered females. These guys have really worked something out, since this leads to a highly tolerant society where fatal violence has not been observed yet. But unfortunately, bonobos are the least understood of the great apes. They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle, and it has been very difficult to study them.The Congo is a paradox \u2014 a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of darkness itself \u2014 the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the First World War. Not surprisingly, this destruction also endangers bonobo survival. Bushmeat trades and forest loss means we couldn't fill a small stadium with all the bonobos that are left in the world \u2014 and we're not even sure of that to be honest. Yet, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear hidden laughter swaying the trees.Who are these cousins? We know them as the \"make love, not war\" apes since they have frequent, promiscuous and bisexual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues. Now, I'm not saying this is the solution to all of humanity's problems \u2014 since there's more to bonobo life than the Kama Sutra. Bonobos, like humans, love to play throughout their entire lives. Play is not just child's games. For us and them, play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance. It's where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game. Play increases creativity and resilience, and it's all about the generation of diversity \u2014 diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections. And when you watch bonobo play, you're seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laughter, dance and ritual. Play is the glue that binds us together.Now, I don't know how you play, but I want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild. First, it's a ball game bonobo-style \u2014 and I do not mean football. So here, we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game. Have a look what she's doing. It might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, \"she's got him by the balls.\" (Laughter) Only I think that he's rather loving it here, right? Yeah. (Laughter) So sex play is common in both bonobos and humans. And this video is really interesting because it shows \u2014 this video's really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play \u2014 such as testicles \u2014 and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust \u2014 while at the same time being tremendous fun.But play's a shapeshifter. (Laughter) Play's a shapeshifter, and it can take many forms, some of which are more quiet, imaginative, curious \u2014 maybe where wonder is discovered anew. And I want you to see, this is Fuku, a young female, and she is quietly playing with water. I think, like her, we sometimes play alone, and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds. And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, drives us to interact, and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hotbed for creativity.So these are just small tasters into the insights that bonobo give us to our past and present. But they also hold a secret for our future, a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater cooperation. The secret is that play is the key to these capacities. In other words, play is our adaptive wildcard. In order to adapt successfully to a changing world, we need to play. But will we make the most of our playfulness? Play is not frivolous. Play's essential. For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just red in tooth and claw. In times when it seems least appropriate to play, it might be the times when it is most urgent.And so, my fellow primates, let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together, as we rediscover creativity, fellowship and wonder.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1102, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nI just came back from a

rules of the game.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nPlay increases creativity\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nand resilience,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nand it's all about the generation of diversity --\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\ndiversity of interactions,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\ndiversity of behaviors,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\ndiversity of connections.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nAnd when you watch bonobo play,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nyou're seeing the very evolutionary roots\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nof human laughter, dance\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nand ritual.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nPlay is the glue\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nthat binds us together.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nNow, I don't know how you play,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nbut I want to show you a couple of unique clips\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nfresh from the wild.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nFirst, it's a ball game bonobo-style --\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nand I do not mean football.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nSo here,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nwe have a young female and a male\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nengaged in a chase game.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nHave a look what she's doing.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nIt might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\n\"she's got him by the balls.\"\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nOnly I think that he's rather loving it here, right?\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nYeah.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nSo sex play is common\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nin both bonobos and humans.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd this video is really interesting\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nbecause it shows --\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nthis video's really interesting\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nbecause it shows the inventiveness\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nof bringing unusual elements into play --\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nsuch as testicles --\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nand also how play both requires trust\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nand fosters trust --\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nwhile at the same time being tremendous fun.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nBut play's a shapeshifter.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nPlay's a shapeshifter,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nand it can take many forms,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nsome of which are more quiet,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nimaginative, curious --\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nmaybe where wonder is discovered anew.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nAnd I want you to see,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nthis is Fuku, a young female,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nand she is quietly playing with water.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nI think, like her,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nwe sometimes play alone,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nand we explore the boundaries\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nof our inner and our outer worlds.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd it's that playful curiosity\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nthat drives us to explore, drives us to interact,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nand then the unexpected connections we form\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nare the real hotbed for creativity.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nSo these are just small tasters\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\ninto the insights that bonobo give us\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nto our past and present.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nBut they also hold a secret for our future,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\na future where we need to adapt\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nto an increasingly challenging world\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nthrough greater creativity\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nand greater cooperation.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nThe secret is that play is the key\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nto these capacities.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nIn other words,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nplay is our adaptive wildcard.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nIn order to adapt successfully\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nto a changing world,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nwe need to play.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nBut will we make the most of our playfulness?\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nPlay is not frivolous.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nPlay's essential.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nFor bonobos and humans alike,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nlife is not just red in tooth and claw.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nIn times when it seems least appropriate to play,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nit might be the times when it is most urgent.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nAnd so, my fellow primates,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nlet us embrace this gift from evolution\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nand play together,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nas we rediscover creativity,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nfellowship and wonder.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nThank you.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\n(Applause)"},

about design, but not design as we usually think about it. I want to talk about what is happening now in our scientific, biotechnological culture, where, for really the first time in history, we have the power to design bodies, to design animal bodies, to design human bodies. In the history of our planet, there have been three great waves of evolution.The first wave of evolution is what we think of as Darwinian evolution. So, as you all know, species lived in particular ecological niches and particular environments, and the pressures of those environments selected which changes, through random mutation in species, were going to be preserved. Then human beings stepped out of the Darwinian flow of evolutionary history and created the second great wave of evolution, which was we changed the environment in which we evolved. We altered our ecological niche by creating civilization. And that has been the second great \u2014 couple 100,000 years, 150,000 years \u2014 flow of our evolution. By changing our environment, we put new pressures on our bodies to evolve. Whether it was through settling down in agricultural communities, all the way through modern medicine, we have changed our own evolution. Now we're entering a third great wave of evolutionary history, which has been called many things: \"intentional evolution,\" \"evolution by design\" \u2014 very different than intelligent design \u2014 whereby we are actually now intentionally designing and altering the physiological forms that inhabit our planet.So I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that and then at the end talk a little bit about what some of the implications are for us and for our species, as well as our cultures, because of this change. Now we actually have been doing it for a long time. We started selectively breeding animals many, many thousands of years ago. And if you think of dogs for example, dogs are now intentionally-designed creatures. There isn't a dog on this earth that's a natural creature. Dogs are the result of selectively breeding traits that we like. But we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them. We don't have to do it that way anymore.This is a beefalo. A beefalo is a buffalo-cattle hybrid. And they are now making them, and someday, perhaps pretty soon, you will have beefalo patties in your local supermarket. This is a geep, a goat-sheep hybrid. The scientists that made this cute little creature ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards. I think they said it tasted like chicken. This is a cama. A cama is a camel-llama hybrid, created to try to get the hardiness of a camel with some of the personality traits of a llama. And they are now using these in certain cultures. Then there's the liger. This is the largest cat in the world \u2014 the lion-tiger hybrid. It's bigger than a tiger. And in the case of the liger, there actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild. But these were created by scientists using both selective breeding and genetic technology. And then finally, everybody's favorite, the zorse. None of this is Photoshopped. These are real creatures. And so one of the things we've been doing is using genetic enhancement, or genetic manipulation, of normal selective breeding pushed a little bit through genetics. And if that were all this was about, then it would be an interesting thing. But something much, much more powerful is happening now.These are normal mammalian cells genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene taken out of deep-sea jellyfish. We all know that some deep-sea creatures glow. Well, they've now taken that gene, that bioluminescent gene, and put it into mammal cells. These are normal cells. And what you see here is these cells glowing in the dark under certain wavelengths of light. Once they could do that with cells, they could do it with organisms. So they did it with mouse pups, kittens. And by the way, the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green is because that's a bioluminescent gene from coral, while this is from jellyfish. They did it with pigs. They did it with puppies. And, in fact, they did it with monkeys. And if you can do it with monkeys \u2014 though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate is actually between monkeys and apes \u2014 if they can do it in monkeys, they can probably figure out how to do it in apes, which means they can do it in human beings. In other words, it is theoretically possible that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable of creating human beings that glow in the dark. Be easier to find us at night.And in fact, right now in many states, you can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets. These are zebra fish. They're normally black and silver. These are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered to be yellow, green, red, and they are actually available now in certain states. Other states have banned them. Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures. There is no area of the government \u2014 not the EPA or the FDA \u2014 that controls genetically-engineered pets. And so some states have decided to allow them, some states have decided to ban them.Some of you may have read about the FDA's consideration right now of genetically-engineered salmon. The salmon on top is a genetically engineered Chinook salmon, using a gene from these salmon and from one other fish that we eat, to make it grow much faster using a lot less feed. And right now the FDA is trying to make a final decision on whether, pretty soon, you could be eating this fish \u2014 it'll be sold in the stores. And before you get too worried about it, here in the United States, the majority of food you buy in the supermarket already has genetically-modified components to it. So even as we worry about it, we have allowed it to go on in this country \u2014 much different in Europe \u2014 without any regulation, and even without any identification on the package.These are all the first cloned animals of their type. So in the lower right here, you have Dolly, the first cloned sheep \u2014 now happily stuffed in a museum in Edinburgh; Ralph the rat, the first cloned rat; CC the cat, for cloned cat; Snuppy, the first cloned dog \u2014 Snuppy for Seoul National University puppy \u2014 created in South Korea by the very same man that some of you may remember had to end up resigning in disgrace because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo, which he had not. He actually was the first person to clone a dog, which is a very difficult thing to do, because dog genomes are very plastic. This is Prometea, the first cloned horse. It's a Haflinger horse cloned in Italy, a real \"gold ring\" of cloning, because there are many horses that win important races who are geldings. In other words, the equipment to put them out to stud has been removed. But if you can clone that horse, you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race and his identical genetic duplicate can then be put out to stud. These were the first cloned calves, the first cloned grey wolves, and then, finally, the first cloned piglets: Alexis, Chista, Carrel, Janie and Dotcom.(Laughter)In addition, we've started to use cloning technology to try to save endangered species. This is the use of animals now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create. So with antithrombin in that goat \u2014 that goat has been genetically modified so that the molecules of its milk actually include the molecule of antithrombin that GTC Genetics wants to create. And then in addition, transgenic pigs, knockout pigs, from the National Institute of Animal Science in South Korea, are pigs that they are going to use, in fact, to try to create all kinds of drugs and other industrial types of chemicals that they want the blood and the milk of these animals to produce for them, instead of producing them in an industrial way.These are two creatures that were created in order to save endangered species. The guar is an endangered Southeast Asian ungulate. A somatic cell, a body cell, was taken from its body, gestated in the ovum of a cow, and then that cow gave birth to a guar. Same thing happened with the mouflon, where it's an endangered species of sheep. It was gestated in a regular sheep body, which actually raises an interesting biological problem. We have two kinds of DNA in our bodies. We have our nucleic DNA that everybody thinks of as our DNA, but we also have DNA in our mitochondria, which are the energy packets of the cell. That DNA is passed down through our mothers. So really, what you end up having here is not a guar and not a mouflon, but a guar with cow mitochondria, and therefore cow mitochondrial DNA, and a mouflon with another species of sheep's mitochondrial DNA. These are really hybrids, not pure animals. And it raises the question of how we're going to define animal species in the age of biotechnology \u2014 a question that we're not really sure yet how to solve.This lovely creature is an Asian cockroach. And what they've done here is they've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain and then a transmitter on top, and it's on a big computer tracking ball. And now, using a joystick, they can send this creature around the lab and control whether it goes left or right, forwards or backwards. They've created a kind of insect bot, or bugbot. It gets worse than that \u2014 or perhaps better than that. This actually is one of DARPA's very important \u2014 DARPA is the Defense Research Agency \u2014 one of their projects. These goliath beetles are wired in their wings. They have a computer chip strapped to their backs, and they can fly these creatures around the lab. They can make them go left, right. They can make them take off. They can't actually make them land. They put them about one inch above the ground, and then they shut everything off and they go pfft. But it's the closest they can get to a landing.And in fact, this technology has gotten so developed that this creature \u2014 this is a moth \u2014 this is the moth in its pupa stage, and that's when they put the wires in and they put in the computer technology, so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth, it is already prewired. The wires are already in its body, and they can just hook it up to their technology, and now they've got these bugbots that they can send out for surveillance. They can put little cameras on them and perhaps someday deliver other kinds of ordinance to warzones.It's not just insects. This is the ratbot, or the robo-rat by Sanjiv Talwar at SUNY Downstate. Again, it's got technology \u2014 it's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres; it's got a camera on top of its head. The scientists can make this creature go left, right. They have it running through mazes, controlling where it's going. They've now created an organic robot. The graduate students in Sanjiv Talwar's lab said, \"Is this ethical? We've taken away the autonomy of this animal.\" I'll get back to that in a minute.There's also been work done with monkeys. This is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke. He took owl monkeys, wired them up so that a computer watched their brains while they moved, especially looking at the movement of their right arm. The computer learned what the monkey brain did to move its arm in various ways. They then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm, which you see here in the picture, put the arm in another room. Pretty soon, the computer learned, by reading the monkey's brainwaves, to make that arm in the other room do whatever the monkey's arm did. Then he put a video monitor in the monkey's cage that showed the monkey this prosthetic arm, and the monkey got fascinated. The monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm, this prosthetic arm would do. And eventually she was moving it and moving it, and eventually stopped moving her right arm and, staring at the screen, could move the prosthetic arm in the other room only with her brainwaves \u2014 which means that monkey became the first primate in the history of the world to have three independent functional arms.And it's not just technology that we're putting into animals. This is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida. He took 20,000 and then 60,000 disaggregated rat neurons \u2014 so these are just individual neurons from rats \u2014 put them on a chip. They self-aggregated into a network, became an integrated chip. And he used that as the IT piece of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator. So now we have organic computer chips made out of living, self-aggregating neurons. Finally, Mussa-Ivaldi of Northwestern took a completely intact, independent lamprey eel brain. This is a brain from a lamprey eel. It is living \u2014 fully-intact brain in a nutrient medium with these electrodes going off to the sides, attached photosensitive sensors to the brain, put it into a cart \u2014 here's the cart, the brain is sitting there in the middle \u2014 and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart, when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart, the cart moves toward the light; when you turn it off, it moves away. It's photophilic. So now we have a complete living lamprey eel brain. Is it thinking lamprey eel thoughts, sitting there in its nutrient medium? I don't know, but in fact it is a fully living brain that we have managed to keep alive to do our bidding.So, we are now at the stage where we are creating creatures for our own purposes. This is a mouse created by Charles Vacanti of the University of Massachusetts. He altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin, put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being. Genetic engineering coupled with polymer physiotechnology coupled with xenotransplantation. This is where we are in this process.Finally, not that long ago, Craig Venter created the first artificial cell, where he took a cell, took a DNA synthesizer, which is a machine, created an artificial genome, put it in a different cell \u2014 the genome was not of the cell he put it in \u2014 and that cell then reproduced as the other cell. In other words, that was the first creature in the history of the world that had a computer as its parent \u2014 it did not have an organic parent. And so, asks The Economist: \"The first artificial organism and its consequences.\"So you may have thought that the creation of life was going to happen in something that looked like that. (Laughter) But in fact, that's not what Frankenstein's lab looks like. This is what Frankenstein's lab looks like. This is a DNA synthesizer, and here at the bottom are just bottles of A, T, C and G \u2014 the four chemicals that make up our DNA chain.And so, we need to ask ourselves some questions. For the first time in the history of this planet, we are able to directly design organisms. We can manipulate the plasmas of life with unprecedented power, and it confers on us a responsibility. Is everything okay? Is it okay to manipulate and create whatever creatures we want? Do we have free reign to design animals? Do we get to go someday to Pets 'R' Us and say, \"Look, I want a dog. I'd like it to have the head of a Dachshund, the body of a retriever, maybe some pink fur, and let's make it glow in the dark\"? Does industry get to create creatures who, in their milk, in their blood, and in their saliva and other bodily fluids, create the drugs and industrial molecules we want and then warehouse them as organic manufacturing machines? Do we get to create organic robots, where we remove the autonomy from these animals and turn them just into our playthings?And then the final step of this, once we perfect these technologies in animals and we start using them in human beings, what are the ethical guidelines that we will use then? It's already happening. It's not science fiction. We are not only already using these things in animals, some of them we're already beginning to use on our own bodies.We are now taking control of our own evolution. We are directly designing the future of the species of this planet. It confers upon us an enormous responsibility that is not just the responsibility of the scientists and the ethicists who are thinking about it and writing about it now. It is the responsibility of everybody because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies we will have in the future.Thanks.(Applause)", "id": 1103, "subtitle":

of those environments\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nselected which changes,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nthrough random mutation in species,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nwere going to be preserved.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nThen human beings stepped out\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nof the Darwinian flow of evolutionary history\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nand created the second great wave of evolution,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nwhich was we changed the environment\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nin which we evolved.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nWe altered our ecological niche\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nby creating civilization.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nAnd that has been the second great --\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\ncouple 100,000 years, 150,000 years --\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nflow of our evolution.\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nBy changing our environment,\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nwe put new pressures\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\non our bodies to evolve.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nWhether it was through settling down in agricultural communities,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nall the way through modern medicine,\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nwe have changed our own evolution.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nNow we're entering a third great wave\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nof evolutionary history,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nwhich has been called many things:\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\n\"intentional evolution,\"\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\n\"evolution by design\" --\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nvery different than intelligent design --\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nwhereby we are actually now\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nintentionally designing and altering\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nthe physiological forms that inhabit our planet.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nSo I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nand then at the end talk a little bit\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nabout what some of the implications are for us\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nand for our species, as well as our cultures,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nbecause of this change.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nNow we actually have been doing it for a long time.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nWe started selectively breeding animals\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nmany, many thousands of years ago.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nAnd if you think of dogs for example,\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.958\ndogs are now intentionally-designed creatures.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nThere isn't a dog on this earth that's a natural creature.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nDogs are the result\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nof selectively breeding traits that we like.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nBut we had to do it the hard way in the old days\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nby choosing offspring that looked a particular way\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nand then breeding them.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nWe don't have to do it that way anymore.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nThis is a beefalo.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nA beefalo is a buffalo-cattle hybrid.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nAnd they are now making them,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nand someday, perhaps pretty soon,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nyou will have beefalo patties\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nin your local supermarket.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nThis is a geep,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\na goat-sheep hybrid.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nThe scientists that made this cute little creature\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nI think they said it tasted like chicken.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nThis is a cama.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nA cama is a camel-llama hybrid,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\ncreated to try to get the hardiness of a camel\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nwith some of the personality traits\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nof a llama.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nAnd they are now using these in certain cultures.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nThen there's the liger.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nThis is the largest cat in the world --\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nthe lion-tiger hybrid.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nIt's bigger than a tiger.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nAnd in the case of the liger,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nthere actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nBut these were created by scientists\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nusing both selective breeding and genetic technology.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nAnd then finally, everybody's favorite,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nthe zorse.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nNone of this is Photoshopped. These are real creatures.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nAnd so one of the things we've been doing\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nis using genetic enhancement,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nor genetic manipulation,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nof normal selective breeding\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\npushed a little bit through genetics.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nAnd if that were all this was about,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nthen it would be an interesting thing.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nBut something much, much more powerful\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nis happening now.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nThese are normal mammalian cells\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\ngenetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\ntaken out of deep-sea jellyfish.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nWe all know that some deep-sea creatures glow.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nWell, they've now taken that gene, that bioluminescent gene,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nand put it into mammal cells.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nThese are normal cells.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nAnd what you see here\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nis these cells glowing in the dark\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nunder certain wavelengths of light.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nOnce they could do that with cells, they could do it with organisms.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nSo they did it with mouse pups,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nkittens.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nAnd by the way, the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nis because that's a bioluminescent gene from coral,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nwhile this is from jellyfish.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nThey did it with pigs.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nThey did it with puppies.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nAnd, in fact,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nthey did it with monkeys.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nAnd if you can do it with monkeys --\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nthough the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nis actually between monkeys and apes --\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nif they can do it in monkeys,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nthey can probably figure out how to do it in apes,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nwhich means they can do it in human beings.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nIn other words, it is theoretically possible\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nthat before too long we will be biotechnologically capable\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nof creating human beings\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nthat glow in the dark.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nBe easier to find us at night.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nAnd in fact, right now in many states,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nyou can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nThese are zebra fish. They're normally black and silver.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nThese are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nto be yellow, green, red,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nand they are actually available now in certain states.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nOther states have banned them.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nNobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nThere is no area of the government -- not the EPA or the FDA --\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nthat controls genetically-engineered pets.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nAnd so some states have decided to allow them,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nsome states have decided to ban them.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nSome of you may have read\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nabout the FDA's consideration right now\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nof genetically-engineered salmon.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nThe salmon on top\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nis a genetically engineered Chinook salmon,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nusing a gene from these salmon\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nand from one other fish that we eat,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nto make it grow much faster\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nusing a lot less feed.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd right now the FDA is trying to make a final decision\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\non whether, pretty soon, you could be eating this fish --\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nit'll be sold in the stores.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nAnd before you get too worried about it,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nhere in the United States,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nthe majority of food you buy in the supermarket\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nalready has genetically-modified components to it.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nSo even as we worry about it,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nwe have allowed it to go on in this country -- much different in Europe --\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nwithout any regulation,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nand even without any identification on the package.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nThese are all the first cloned animals\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nof their type.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nSo in the lower right here,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nyou have Dolly, the first cloned sheep --\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nnow happily stuffed in a museum in Edinburgh;\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nRalph the rat, the first cloned rat;\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nCC the cat, for cloned cat;\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nSnuppy, the first cloned dog --\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nSnuppy for Seoul National University puppy --\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\ncreated in South Korea\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nby the very same man that some of you may remember\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nhad to end up resigning in disgrace\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nbecause he claimed he had cloned a human embryo, which he had not.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nHe actually was the first person\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nto clone a dog, which is a very difficult thing to do,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nbecause dog genomes are very plastic.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nThis is Prometea, the first cloned horse.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nIt's a Haflinger horse cloned in Italy,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\na real \"gold ring\" of cloning,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nbecause there are many horses that win important races\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nwho are geldings.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nIn other words, the equipment to put them out to stud\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nhas been removed.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nBut if you can clone that horse,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nyou can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nand his identical genetic duplicate\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\ncan then be put out to stud.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nThese were the first cloned calves,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nthe first cloned grey wolves,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nand then, finally,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nthe first cloned piglets:\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nAlexis, Chista, Carrel, Janie and Dotcom.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nIn addition, we've started to use cloning technology\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nto try to save endangered species.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nThis is the use of animals now\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nto create drugs and other things in their bodies\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nthat we want to create.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nSo with antithrombin in that goat --\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nthat goat has been genetically modified\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nso that the molecules of its milk\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nactually include the molecule of antithrombin\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nthat GTC Genetics wants to create.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nAnd then in addition, transgenic pigs, knockout pigs,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nfrom the National Institute of Animal Science in South Korea,\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nare pigs that they are going to use, in fact,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nto try to create all kinds of drugs\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nand other industrial types of chemicals\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nthat they want the blood and the milk\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nof these animals\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nto produce for them,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\ninstead of producing them in an industrial way.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nThese are two creatures\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nthat were created\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nin order to save endangered species.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nThe guar\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nis an endangered Southeast Asian ungulate.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nA somatic cell, a body cell,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nwas taken from its body,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\ngestated in the ovum of a cow,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nand then that cow gave birth to a guar.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nSame thing happened with the mouflon,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nwhere it's an endangered species of sheep.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nIt was gestated in a regular sheep body,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nwhich actually raises an interesting biological problem.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nWe have two kinds of DNA in our bodies.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nWe have our nucleic DNA\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nthat everybody thinks of as our DNA,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nbut we also have DNA in our mitochondria,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nwhich are the energy packets of the cell.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nThat DNA is passed down through our mothers.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nSo really, what you end up having here\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nis not a guar and not a mouflon,\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nbut a guar\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nwith cow mitochondria,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nand therefore cow mitochondrial DNA,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nand a mouflon with another species of sheep's\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nmitochondrial DNA.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nThese are really hybrids, not pure animals.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nAnd it raises the question of how we're going to define animal species\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nin the age of biotechnology --\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\na question that we're not really sure yet\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nhow to solve.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nThis lovely creature\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nis an Asian cockroach.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nAnd what they've done here\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nis they've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nand then a transmitter on top,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nand it's on a big computer tracking ball.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nAnd now, using a joystick,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nthey can send this creature\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\naround the lab\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nand control whether it goes left or right,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nforwards or backwards.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nThey've created a kind of insect bot,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nor bugbot.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nIt gets worse than that -- or perhaps better than that.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nThis actually is one of DARPA's very important --\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nDARPA is the Defense Research Agency --\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\none of their projects.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nThese goliath beetles\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nare wired in their wings.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nThey have a computer chip strapped to their backs,\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nand they can fly these creatures around the lab.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nThey can make them go left, right. They can make them take off.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nThey can't actually make them land.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nThey put them about one inch above the ground,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nand then they shut everything off and they go pfft.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nBut it's the closest they can get to a landing.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nAnd in fact, this technology has gotten so developed\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nthat this creature --\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nthis is a moth --\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nthis is the moth in its pupa stage,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nand that's when they put the wires in\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nand they put in the computer technology,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nso that when the moth actually emerges as a moth,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nit is already prewired.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nThe wires are already in its body,\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nand they can just hook it up to their technology,\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nand now they've got these bugbots\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nthat they can send out for surveillance.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nThey can put little cameras on them\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nand perhaps someday deliver\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nother kinds of ordinance\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nto warzones.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nIt's not just insects.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nThis is the ratbot, or the robo-rat\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nby Sanjiv Talwar at SUNY Downstate.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nAgain, it's got technology --\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nit's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres;\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nit's got a camera on top of its head.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nThe scientists can make this creature\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\ngo left, right.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nThey have it running through mazes, controlling where it's going.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nThey've now created an organic robot.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nThe graduate students\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nin Sanjiv Talwar's lab\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nsaid, \"Is this ethical?\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nWe've taken away the autonomy of this animal.\"\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nI'll get back to that in a minute.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nThere's also been work done with monkeys.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nThis is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nHe took owl monkeys,\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nwired them up\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nso that a computer watched their brains while they moved,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nespecially looking at the movement of their right arm.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nThe computer learned what the monkey brain did\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nto move its arm in various ways.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nThey then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nwhich you see here in the picture,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nput the arm in another room.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nPretty soon, the computer learned, by reading the monkey's brainwaves,\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nto make that arm in the other room\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\ndo whatever the monkey's arm did.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nThen he put a video monitor\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nin the monkey's cage\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nthat showed the monkey this prosthetic arm,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nand the monkey got fascinated.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nThe monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nthis prosthetic arm would do.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nAnd eventually she was moving it and moving it,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nand eventually stopped moving her right arm\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nand, staring at the screen,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\ncould move the prosthetic arm in the other room\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nonly with her brainwaves --\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nwhich means that monkey\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nbecame the first primate in the history of the world\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nto have three independent functional arms.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nAnd it's not just technology\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nthat we're putting into animals.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nThis is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nHe took 20,000 and then 60,000\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\ndisaggregated rat neurons --\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nso these are just individual neurons from rats --\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nput them on a chip.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nThey self-aggregated into a network,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nbecame an integrated chip.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nAnd he used that\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nas the IT piece\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nof a mechanism which ran a flight simulator.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nSo now we have organic computer chips\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nmade out of living, self-aggregating neurons.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nFinally, Mussa-Ivaldi of Northwestern\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\ntook a completely intact,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nindependent lamprey eel brain.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nThis is a brain from a lamprey eel.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nIt is living --\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nfully-intact brain in a nutrient medium\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nwith these electrodes going off to the sides,\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nattached photosensitive sensors to the brain,\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nput it into a cart --\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nhere's the cart, the brain is sitting there in the middle --\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nand using this brain as the sole processor for this cart,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nwhen you turn on a light and shine it at the cart,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nthe cart moves toward the light;\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nwhen you turn it off, it moves away.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nIt's photophilic.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nSo now we have a complete\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nliving lamprey eel brain.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nIs it thinking lamprey eel thoughts,\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nsitting there in its nutrient medium?\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nI don't know,\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nbut in fact it is a fully living brain\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nthat we have managed to keep alive\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nto do our bidding.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nSo, we are now at the stage\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nwhere we are creating creatures\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nfor our own purposes.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nThis is a mouse created by Charles Vacanti\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nof the University of Massachusetts.\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nHe altered this mouse\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nso that it was genetically engineered\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nto have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nput a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nand created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nand transplanted onto a human being.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nGenetic engineering\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\ncoupled with polymer physiotechnology\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\ncoupled with xenotransplantation.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nThis is where we are in this process.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nFinally, not that long ago,\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nCraig Venter created the first artificial cell,\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nwhere he took a cell, took a DNA synthesizer,\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nwhich is a machine,\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\ncreated an artificial genome,\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nput it in a different cell --\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nthe genome was not of the cell he put it in --\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nand that cell then reproduced\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nas the other cell.\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nIn other words,\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nthat was the first creature in the history of the world\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nthat had a computer as its parent --\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nit did not have an organic parent.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nAnd so, asks The Economist:\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:10.958\n\"The first artificial organism and its consequences.\"\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nSo you may have thought\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nthat the creation of life\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nwas going to happen in something that looked like that.\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:19.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nBut in fact, that's not what Frankenstein's lab looks like.\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nThis is what Frankenstein's lab looks like.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nThis is a DNA synthesizer,\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nand here at the bottom\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:30.958\nare just bottles of A, T, C and G --\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nthe four chemicals\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nthat make up our DNA chain.\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nAnd so, we need to ask

organisms.\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nWe can manipulate the plasmas of life\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:48.958\nwith unprecedented power,\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nand it confers on us a responsibility.\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nIs everything okay?\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nIs it okay to manipulate and create\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nwhatever creatures we want?\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nDo we have free reign\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nto design animals?\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nDo we get to go someday to Pets 'R' Us\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nand say, \"Look, I want a dog.\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nI'd like it to have the head of a Dachshund,\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nthe body of a

creatures\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nwho, in their milk, in their blood, and in their saliva\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nand other bodily fluids,\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:24.958\ncreate

00:18:32.958\nDo we get to create organic robots,\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nwhere we remove the autonomy from these animals\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:38.958\nand turn them just into our playthings?\n\n00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nAnd then the final step of this,\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nonce we perfect these technologies in animals\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nand we start using them in human beings,\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nwhat are the ethical guidelines\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nthat we will use then?\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nIt's already happening. It's not science fiction.\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nWe are not only already using these things in animals,\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:59.958\nsome of them we're already beginning to use\n\n00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:01.958\non our own bodies.\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:04.958\nWe are now taking control of our own evolution.\n\n00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nWe are directly designing\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nthe future of the species of this planet.\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:12.958\nIt confers upon us an enormous responsibility\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nthat is not just the responsibility\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:16.958\nof the scientists and the ethicists\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nwho are thinking about it and writing about it now.\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nIt is the responsibility of everybody\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nbecause it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nwe will have in the future.\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nThanks.\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:32.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Human exoskeletons -- for war and healing", "duration": "383", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/eythor_bender_demos_human_exoskeletons", "transcript": "I want you now to imagine a wearable robot that gives you superhuman abilities, or another one that takes wheelchair users up standing and walking again. We at Berkeley Bionics call these robots exoskeletons. These are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning, and it will give you extra strength, and it will further enhance your speed, and it will help you, for instance, to manage your balance. It is actually the true integration of the man and the machine. But not only that \u2014 it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there.This is just not some blue sky thinking. To show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the American soldier, that on average does carry about 100 lbs. on their backs, and they are being asked to carry more equipment. Obviously, this is resulting in some major complications \u2014 back injuries, 30 percent of them \u2014 chronic back injuries. So we thought we would look at this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help deal with this issue. So let me now introduce to you HULC \u2014 or the Human Universal Load Carrier.Soldier: With the HULC exoskeleton, I can carry 200 lbs. over varied terrain for many hours. Its flexible design allows for deep squats, crawls and high-agility movements. It senses what I want to do, where I want to go, and then augments my strength and endurance.Eythor Bender: We are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device, this new exoskeleton this year. So this is for real. Now let's turn our heads towards the wheelchair users, something that I'm particularly passionate about. There are 68 million people estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide. This is about one percent of the total population. And that's actually a conservative estimate. We are talking here about, oftentimes, very young individuals with spinal cord injuries, that in the prime of their life \u2014 20s, 30s, 40s \u2014 hit a wall and the wheelchair's the only option. But it is also the aging population that is multiplying in numbers. And the only option, pretty much \u2014 when it's stroke or other complications \u2014 is the wheelchair. And that is actually for the last 500 years, since its very successful introduction, I must say. So we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility. Let me now introduce you to eLEGS that is worn by Amanda Boxtel that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured, and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now.(Applause)Amanda Boxtel: Thank you.(Applause)EB: Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set. It has sensors. It's completely non-invasive, sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer that is sitting here at her back. There are battery packs here as well that power motors that are sitting at her hips, as well as her knee joints, that move her forward in this kind of smooth and very natural gait.AB: I was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a freak summersault while downhill skiing paralyzed me. In a split second, I lost all sensation and movement below my pelvis. Not long afterwards, a doctor strode into my hospital room, and he said, \"Amanda, you'll never walk again.\" And that was 19 yeas ago. He robbed every ounce of hope from my being. Adaptive technology has since enabled me to learn how to downhill ski again, to rock climb and even handcycle. But nothing has been invented that enables me to walk, until now.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you. It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations \u2014 not only for the soldiers, or for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users, but for everyone.AB:

I can't make noise. She said, \"Please, sing for me.\" So I closed my eyes, I took breath and the first thing that came up and out was \"Summertime,\" Porgy and Bess.(Singing) Summertime and the livin' is easy. Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high. Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'. So hush little baby, don't you cry.And I opened my eyes, and I saw that she had her eyes closed. And after a moment, she opened her eyes and she looked at me and she said, \"It's like meditation.\"And in that moment I understood that everything I had gone to Thailand to look for, to search for, I had it already in my singing \u2014 the calm, but alertness, the focus, but awareness, and being totally in the moment. When you're totally in the moment \u2014 when I'm totally in the moment, the vessel of expression is open. The emotions can flow from me to you and back. It's an extremely profound experience.There's a piece by a composer, an American composer called John Cage. It's called \"Aria.\" It was written for an amazing singer called Cathy Berberian. And the thing about this piece that's so special \u2014 if you see it behind me \u2014 it's not notated in any way. No notes, no flats, no sharps. But it's a kind of structure. And the singer, within this structure, has total freedom to be creative, spontaneous.For example, there are different colors and each color gets a different type of singing \u2014 pop, country and western, opera, jazz \u2014 and you just have to be consistent with that color. You see there are different lines. You choose in your own tempo in your own way to follow the line, but you must respect it, more or less. And these little dots, these represent a sort of sound that's not a vocal, not a lyrical way of expressing the voice. Using the body \u2014 it could be sneezing, it could be coughing, animals \u2014(Audience member coughs)Exactly. (Laughter)Clapping, whatever. And there's different text. There's Armenian, Russian, French, English, Italian. So within this structure, one is free. To me, this piece is an ode to the voice, because it's mysterious, as we can see. It's quite spontaneous. And it's primal. So I would like to share this piece with you, It's \"Aria,\" of John Cage.(Singing in various languages)Hampart-zoumDirouhiDi questa TerraNaprasnoConscience et(Barks)(Singing) AriseTsk, tsk,

You think I've lost my way, and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat. (Applause) I get that all the time in Dubai. \"Here on holiday are you, dear?\" (Laughter) \"Come to visit the children? How long are you staying?\"Well actually, I hope for a while longer yet. I have been living and teaching in the Gulf for over 30 years. (Applause) And in that time, I have seen a lot of changes. Now that statistic is quite shocking. And I want to talk to you today about language loss and the globalization of English. I want to tell you about my friend who was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi. And one fine day, she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary. But it was she who ended up learning all the Arabic words for the local plants, as well as their uses \u2014 medicinal uses, cosmetics, cooking, herbal. How did those students get all that knowledge? Of course, from their grandparents and even their great-grandparents. It's not necessary to tell you how important it is to be able to communicate across generations.But sadly, today, languages are dying at an unprecedented rate. A language dies every 14 days. Now, at the same time, English is the undisputed global language. Could there be a connection? Well I don't know. But I do know that I've seen a lot of changes. When I first came out to the Gulf, I came to Kuwait in the days when it was still a hardship post. Actually, not that long ago. That is a little bit too early. But nevertheless, I was recruited by the British Council, along with about 25 other teachers. And we were the first non-Muslims to teach in the state schools there in Kuwait. We were brought to teach English because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education. And of course, the U.K. benefited from some of that lovely oil wealth.Okay. Now this is the major change that I've seen \u2014 how teaching English has morphed from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today. No longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum, and no longer the sole domain of mother England, it has become a bandwagon for every English-speaking nation on earth. And why not? After all, the best education \u2014 according to the latest World University Rankings \u2014 is to be found in the universities of the U.K. and the U.S. So everybody wants to have an English education, naturally. But if you're not a native speaker, you have to pass a test.Now can it be right to reject a student on linguistic ability alone? Perhaps you have a computer scientist who's a genius. Would he need the same language as a lawyer, for example? Well, I don't think so. We English teachers reject them all the time. We put a stop sign, and we stop them in their tracks. They can't pursue their dream any longer, 'til they get English. Now let me put it this way: if I met a monolingual Dutch speaker who had the cure for cancer, would I stop him from entering my British University? I don't think so. But indeed, that is exactly what we do. We English teachers are the gatekeepers. And you have to satisfy us first that your English is good enough. Now it can be dangerous to give too much power to a narrow segment of society. Maybe the barrier would be too universal.Okay. \"But,\" I hear you say, \"what about the research? It's all in English.\" So the books are in English, the journals are done in English, but that is a self-fulfilling prophecy. It feeds the English requirement. And so it goes on. I ask you, what happened to translation? If you think about the Islamic Golden Age, there was lots of translation then. They translated from Latin and Greek into Arabic, into Persian, and then it was translated on into the Germanic languages of Europe and the Romance languages. And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe. Now don't get me wrong; I am not against teaching English, all you English teachers out there. I love it that we have a global language. We need one today more than ever. But I am against using it as a barrier. Do we really want to end up with 600 languages and the main one being English, or Chinese? We need more than that. Where do we draw the line? This system equates intelligence with a knowledge of English, which is quite arbitrary.(Applause)And I want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today's intelligentsia stand did not have to have English, they didn't have to pass an English test. Case in point, Einstein. He, by the way, was considered remedial at school because he was, in fact, dyslexic. But fortunately for the world, he did not have to pass an English test. Because they didn't start until 1964 with TOEFL, the American test of English. Now it's exploded. There are lots and lots of tests of English. And millions and millions of students take these tests every year. Now you might think, you and me, \"Those fees aren't bad, they're okay,\" but they are prohibitive to so many millions of poor people. So immediately, we're rejecting them.(Applause)It brings to mind a headline I saw recently: \"Education: The Great Divide.\" Now I get it, I understand why people would want to focus on English. They want to give their children the best chance in life. And to do that, they need a Western education. Because, of course, the best jobs go to people out of the Western Universities, that I put on earlier. It's a circular thing.Okay. Let me tell you a story about two scientists, two English scientists. They were doing an experiment to do with genetics and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals. But they couldn't get the results they wanted. They really didn't know what to do, until along came a German scientist who realized that they were using two words for forelimb and hind limb, whereas genetics does not differentiate and neither does German. So bingo, problem solved. If you can't think a thought, you are stuck. But if another language can think that thought, then, by cooperating, we can achieve and learn so much more.My daughter came to England from Kuwait. She had studied science and mathematics in Arabic. It's an Arabic-medium school. She had to translate it into English at her grammar school. And she was the best in the class at those subjects. Which tells us that when students come to us from abroad, we may not be giving them enough credit for what they know, and they know it in their own language. When a language dies, we don't know what we lose with that language.This is \u2014 I don't know if you saw it on CNN recently \u2014 they gave the Heroes Award to a young Kenyan shepherd boy who couldn't study at night in his village, like all the village children, because the kerosene lamp, it had smoke and it damaged his eyes. And anyway, there was never enough kerosene, because what does a dollar a day buy for you? So he invented a cost-free solar lamp. And now the children in his village get the same grades at school as the children who have electricity at home. (Applause) When he received his award, he said these lovely words: \"The children can lead Africa from what it is today, a dark continent, to a light continent.\" A simple idea, but it could have such far-reaching consequences.People who have no light, whether it's physical or metaphorical, cannot pass our exams, and we can never know what they know. Let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark. Let us celebrate diversity. Mind your language. Use it to spread great ideas.(Applause)Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1106, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nI know what

00:00:46.958\nfor over 30 years.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:50.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nAnd in that time, I have seen a lot of changes.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nNow that statistic\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nis quite shocking.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nAnd I want to talk to you today\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nabout language loss\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nand the globalization of English.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nI want to tell you about my friend\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nwho was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nAnd one fine day,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nshe decided to take them into the garden\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nto teach them some nature vocabulary.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nBut it was she who ended up learning\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nall the Arabic words for the local plants,\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nas well as their uses --\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nmedicinal uses, cosmetics,\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\ncooking, herbal.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nHow did those students get all that knowledge?\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nOf course, from their grandparents\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nand even their great-grandparents.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nIt's not necessary to tell you how important it is\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nto be able to communicate\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nacross generations.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nBut sadly, today,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nlanguages are dying\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nat an unprecedented rate.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nA language dies every 14 days.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nNow, at the same time,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nEnglish is the undisputed global language.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nCould there be a connection?\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nWell I don't know.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nBut I do know that I've seen a lot of changes.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nWhen I first came out to the Gulf, I came to Kuwait\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nin the days when it was still a hardship post.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nActually, not that long ago.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nThat is a little bit too early.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nBut nevertheless,\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nI was recruited by the British Council,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nalong with about 25 other teachers.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nAnd we were the first non-Muslims\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nto teach in the state schools there in Kuwait.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nWe were brought to teach English\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nbecause the government wanted to modernize the country\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nand to empower the citizens through education.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nAnd of course, the U.K. benefited\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nfrom some of that lovely oil wealth.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nOkay.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nNow this is the major change that I've seen --\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nhow teaching English\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nhas morphed\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nfrom being a mutually beneficial practice\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nto becoming a massive international business that it is today.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nNo longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nand no longer the sole domain\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nof mother England,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nit has become a bandwagon\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nfor every English-speaking nation on earth.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nAnd why not?\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nAfter all, the best education --\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\naccording to the latest World University Rankings --\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nis to be found in the universities\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nof the U.K. and the U.S.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nSo everybody wants to have an English education, naturally.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nBut if you're not a native speaker,\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nyou have to pass a test.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nNow can it be right\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nto reject a student\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\non linguistic ability alone?\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nPerhaps you have a computer scientist\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nwho's a genius.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nWould he need the same language as a lawyer, for example?\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nWell, I don't think so.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nWe English teachers reject them all the time.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nWe put a stop sign,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nand we stop them in their tracks.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nThey can't pursue their dream any longer,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\n'til they get English.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nNow let me put it this way:\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nif I met a monolingual Dutch speaker\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nwho had the cure for cancer,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nwould I stop him from entering my British University?\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nI don't think so.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nBut indeed, that is exactly what we do.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nWe English teachers are the gatekeepers.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nAnd you have to satisfy us first\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nthat your English is good enough.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nNow it can be dangerous\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nto give too much power\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nto a narrow segment of society.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nMaybe the barrier would be too universal.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nOkay.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\n\"But,\" I hear you say,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\n\"what about the research?\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nIt's all in English.\"\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nSo the books are in English,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nthe journals are done in English,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nbut that is a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nIt feeds the English requirement.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nAnd so it goes on.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nI ask you, what happened to translation?\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nIf you think about the Islamic Golden Age,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nthere was lots of translation then.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nThey translated from Latin and Greek\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\ninto Arabic, into Persian,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nand then it was translated on\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\ninto the Germanic languages of Europe\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nand the Romance languages.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nAnd so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nNow don't get me wrong;\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nI am not against teaching English,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nall you English teachers out there.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nI love it that we have a global language.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nWe need one today more than ever.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nBut I am against using it\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nas a barrier.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nDo we really want to end up with 600 languages\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nand the main one being English, or Chinese?\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nWe need more than that. Where do we draw the line?\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nThis system\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nequates intelligence\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nwith a knowledge of English,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nwhich is quite arbitrary.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:03.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nAnd I want to remind you\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nthat the giants upon whose shoulders\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\ntoday's intelligentsia stand\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\ndid not have to have English,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nthey didn't have to pass an English test.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nCase in point, Einstein.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nHe, by the way, was considered remedial at school\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nbecause he was, in fact, dyslexic.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nBut fortunately for the world,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nhe did not have to pass an English test.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nBecause they didn't start until 1964\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nwith TOEFL,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nthe American test of English.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nNow it's exploded.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nThere are lots and lots of tests of English.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAnd millions and millions of students\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\ntake these tests every year.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nNow you might think, you and me,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\n\"Those fees aren't bad, they're okay,\"\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nbut they are prohibitive\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nto so many millions of poor people.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nSo immediately, we're rejecting them.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nIt brings to mind a headline I saw recently:\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\n\"Education: The Great Divide.\"\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nNow I get it,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nI understand why people would want to focus on English.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nThey want to give their children the best chance in life.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nAnd to do that, they need a Western education.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nBecause, of course, the best jobs\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\ngo to people out of the Western Universities,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nthat I put on earlier.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nIt's a circular thing.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nOkay.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nLet me tell you a story about two scientists,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\ntwo English scientists.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nThey were doing an experiment\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nto do with genetics\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nand the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nBut they couldn't get the results they wanted.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nThey really didn't know what to do,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nuntil along came a German scientist\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nwho realized that they were using two words\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nfor forelimb and hind limb,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nwhereas genetics does not differentiate\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nand neither does German.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nSo bingo,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nproblem solved.\n\n00:07:58.958 -->

cyber weapon", "duration": "640", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ralph_langner_cracking_stuxnet_a_21st_century_cyberweapon", "transcript": "The idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm is actually quite simple. We don't want Iran to get the bomb. Their major asset for developing nuclear weapons is the Natanz uranium enrichment facility. The gray boxes that you see, these are real-time control systems. Now if we manage to compromise these systems that control drive speeds and valves, we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge. The gray boxes don't run Windows software; they are a completely different technology. But if we manage to place a good Windows virus on a notebook that is used by a maintenance engineer to configure this gray box, then we are in business. And this is the plot behind Stuxnet.So we start with a Windows dropper. The payload goes onto the gray box, damages the centrifuge, and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed \u2014 mission accomplished. That's easy, huh? I want to tell you how we found that out. When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago, it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was. The only thing that was known is it's very, very complex on the Windows part, the dropper part, used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities. And it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes, these real-time control systems. So that got our attention, and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with Stuxnet and checked this thing out. And then some very funny things happened. Stuxnet behaved like a lab rat that didn't like our cheese \u2014 sniffed, but didn't want to eat. Didn't make sense to me. And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese, I realized, well, this is a directed attack. It's completely directed. The dropper is prowling actively on the gray box if a specific configuration is found, and even if the actual program code that it's trying to infect is actually running on that target. And if not, Stuxnet does nothing.So that really got my attention, and we started to work on this nearly around the clock, because I thought, \"Well, we don't know what the target is. It could be, let's say for example, a U.S. power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany. So we better find out what the target is soon.\" So we extracted and decompiled the attack code, and we discovered that it's structured in two digital bombs \u2014 a smaller one and a bigger one. And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered by people who obviously had all insider information. They knew all the bits and bites that they had to attack. They probably even know the shoe size of the operator. So they know everything.And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet is complex and high-tech, let me tell you this: the payload is rocket science. It's way above everything that we have ever seen before. Here you see a sample of this actual attack code. We are talking about \u2014 around about 15,000 lines of code. Looks pretty much like old-style assembly language. And I want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code. So what we were looking for is, first of all, system function calls, because we know what they do.And then we were looking for timers and data structures and trying to relate them to the real world \u2014 to potential real world targets. So we do need target theories that we can prove or disprove. In order to get target theories, we remember that it's definitely hardcore sabotage, it must be a high-value target and it is most likely located in Iran, because that's where most of the infections had been reported. Now you don't find several thousand targets in that area. It basically boils down to the Bushehr nuclear power plant and to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant.So I told my assistant, \"Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base.\" And I phoned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their expertise with what we found in code and data. And that worked pretty well. So we were able to associate the small digital warhead with the rotor control. The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge, that black object that you see. And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor, you are actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even have the centrifuge explode. What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and creepy \u2014 obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers crazy, that they would not be able to figure this out quickly.The big digital warhead \u2014 we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures. So for example, the number 164 really stands out in that code; you can't overlook it. I started to research scientific literature on how these centrifuges are actually built in Natanz and found they are structured in what is called a cascade, and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges. So that made sense, that was a match.And it even got better. These centrifuges in Iran are subdivided into 15, what is called, stages. And guess what we found in the attack code? An almost identical structure. So again, that was a real good match. And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at. Now don't get me wrong here, it didn't go like this. These results have been obtained over several weeks of really hard labor. And we often went into just a dead end and had to recover.Anyway, so we figured out that both digital warheads were actually aiming at one and the same target, but from different angles. The small warhead is taking one cascade, and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down, and the big warhead is talking to six cascades and manipulating valves. So in all, we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is. It is Natanz, and it is only Natanz. So we don't have to worry that other targets might be hit by Stuxnet.Here's some very cool stuff that we saw \u2014 really knocked my socks off. Down there is the gray box, and on the top you see the centrifuges. Now what this thing does is it intercepts the input values from sensors \u2014 so for example, from pressure sensors and vibration sensors \u2014 and it provides legitimate program code, which is still running during the attack, with fake input data. And as a matter of fact, this fake input data is actually prerecorded by Stuxnet. So it's just like from the Hollywood movies where during the heist, the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video. That's cool, huh?The idea here is obviously not only to fool the operators in the control room. It actually is much more dangerous and aggressive. The idea is to circumvent a digital safety system. We need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act quick enough. So for example, in a power plant, when your big steam turbine gets too over speed, you must open relief valves within a millisecond. Obviously, this cannot be done by a human operator. So this is where we need digital safety systems. And when they are compromised, then real bad things can happen. Your plant can blow up. And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it. That's scary.But it gets worse. And this is very important, what I'm going to say. Think about this: this attack is generic. It doesn't have anything to do, in specifics, with centrifuges, with uranium enrichment. So it would work as well, for example, in a power plant or in an automobile factory. It is generic. And you don't have \u2014 as an attacker \u2014 you don't have to deliver this payload by a USB stick, as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet. You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading. Just spread it as wide as possible. And if you do that, what you end up with is a cyber weapon of mass destruction. That's the consequence that we have to face. So unfortunately, the biggest number of targets for such attacks are not in the Middle East. They're in the United States and Europe and in Japan. So all of the green areas, these are your target-rich environments. We have to face the consequences, and we better start to prepare right now.Thanks.(Applause)Chris Anderson: I've got a question. Ralph, it's been quite widely reported that people assume that Mossad is the main entity behind this. Is that your opinion?Ralph Langner: Okay, you really want to hear that? Yeah. Okay. My opinion is that the Mossad is involved, but that the leading force is not Israel. So the leading force behind that is the cyber superpower. There is only one, and that's the United States \u2014 fortunately, fortunately. Because otherwise, our problems would even be bigger.CA: Thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us.

00:04:23.958\nIt basically boils down\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nto the Bushehr nuclear power plant\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nand to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nSo I told my assistant,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\n\"Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base.\"\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nAnd I phoned them up and picked their brain\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nin an effort to match their expertise\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nwith what we found in code and data.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nAnd that worked pretty well.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nSo we were able to associate\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nthe small digital warhead\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nwith the rotor control.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nThe rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nthat black object that you see.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nAnd if you manipulate the speed of this rotor,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nyou are actually able to crack the rotor\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nand eventually even have the centrifuge explode.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nWhat we also saw\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nis that the goal of the attack\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nwas really to do it slowly and creepy --\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nobviously in an effort\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nto drive maintenance engineers crazy,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nthat they would not be able to figure this out quickly.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nThe big digital warhead -- we had a shot at this\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nby looking very closely\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nat data and data structures.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nSo for example, the number 164\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nreally stands out in that code;\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nyou can't overlook it.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nI started to research scientific literature\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\non how these centrifuges\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nare actually built in Natanz\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nand found they are structured\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nin what is called a cascade,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nand each cascade holds 164 centrifuges.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nSo that made sense, that was a match.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nAnd it even got better.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nThese centrifuges in Iran\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nare subdivided into 15, what is called, stages.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nAnd guess what we found in the attack code?\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nAn almost identical structure.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nSo again, that was a real good match.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nAnd this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nNow don't get me wrong here, it didn't go like this.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nThese results have been obtained\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nover several weeks of really hard labor.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd we often went into just a dead end\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nand had to recover.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nAnyway, so we figured out\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nthat both digital warheads\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nwere actually aiming at one and the same target,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nbut from different angles.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nThe small warhead is taking one cascade,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nand spinning up the rotors and slowing them down,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nand the big warhead\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nis talking to six cascades\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nand manipulating valves.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nSo in all, we are very confident\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nthat we have actually determined what the target is.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nIt is Natanz, and it is only Natanz.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nSo we don't have to worry\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nthat other targets\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nmight be hit by Stuxnet.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nHere's some very cool stuff that we saw --\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nreally knocked my socks off.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nDown there is the gray box,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nand on the top you see the centrifuges.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nNow what this thing does\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nis it intercepts the input values from sensors --\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nso for example, from pressure sensors\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nand vibration sensors --\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nand it provides legitimate program code,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nwhich is still running during the attack,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nwith fake input data.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nAnd as a matter of fact, this fake input data\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nis actually prerecorded by Stuxnet.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nSo it's just like from the Hollywood movies\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nwhere during the heist,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nthe observation camera is fed with prerecorded video.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nThat's cool, huh?\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nThe idea here is obviously\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nnot only to fool the operators in the control room.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nIt actually is much more dangerous and aggressive.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nThe idea\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nis to circumvent a digital safety system.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nWe need digital safety systems\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nwhere a human operator could not act quick enough.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nSo for example, in a power plant,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nwhen your big steam turbine gets too over speed,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nyou must open relief valves within a millisecond.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nObviously, this cannot be done by a human operator.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nSo this is where we need digital safety systems.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nAnd when they are compromised,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nthen real bad things can happen.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nYour plant can blow up.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nAnd neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nThat's scary.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nBut it gets worse.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nAnd this is very important, what I'm going to say.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nThink about this:\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nthis attack is generic.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nIt doesn't have anything to do, in specifics,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nwith centrifuges,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nwith uranium enrichment.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nSo it would work as well, for example,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nin a power plant\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nor in an automobile factory.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nIt is generic.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nAnd you don't have -- as an attacker --\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nyou don't have to deliver this payload\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nby a USB stick,\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nas we saw it in the case of Stuxnet.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nYou could also use conventional worm technology for spreading.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nJust spread it as wide as possible.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nAnd if you do that,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nwhat you end up with\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nis a cyber weapon of mass destruction.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nThat's the consequence\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nthat we have to face.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nSo unfortunately,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nthe biggest number of targets for such attacks\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nare not in the Middle East.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nThey're in the United States and Europe and in Japan.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nSo all of the green areas,\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nthese are your target-rich environments.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nWe have to face the consequences,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nand we better start to prepare right now.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nThanks.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:45.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nChris Anderson: I've got a question.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nRalph, it's been quite widely reported\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nthat people assume that Mossad\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nis the main entity behind this.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nIs that your opinion?\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nRalph Langner: Okay, you really want to hear that?\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nYeah. Okay.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nMy opinion is that the Mossad is involved,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nbut that the leading force is not Israel.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nSo the leading force behind that\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nis the cyber superpower.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nThere is only one,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nand that's the United States --\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nfortunately, fortunately.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nBecause otherwise,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nour problems would even be bigger.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nCA: Thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us. Thank you, Ralph.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The genius puppetry behind War Horse", "duration": "1091", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/handpring_puppet_co_the_genius_puppetry_behind_war_horse", "transcript": "Adrian Kohler: Well, we're here today to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse.Basil Jones: But actually we're going to start this evolution with a hyena.AK: The ancestor of the horse. Okay, we'll do something with it. (Laughter) Hahahaha. The hyena is the ancestor of the horse because it was part of a production called \"Faustus in Africa,\" a Handspring Production from 1995, where it had to play draughts with Helen of Troy. This production was directed by South African artist and theater director, William Kentridge. So it needed a very articulate front paw. But, like all puppets, it has other attributes.BJ: One of them is breath, and it kind of breathes.AK: Haa haa haaa.BJ: Breath is really important for us. It's the kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage. It's the thing that distinguishes the puppet \u2014AK: Oops.BJ: From an actor. Puppets always have to try to be alive. It's their kind of ur-story onstage, that desperation to live.AK: Yeah, it's basically a dead object, as you can see, and it only lives because you make it. An actor struggles to die onstage, but a puppet has to struggle to live. And in a way that's a metaphor for life.BJ: So every moment it's on the stage, it's making the struggle. So we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up-to-the-minute 17th century technology \u2014 (Laughter) to turn nouns into verbs.AK: Well actually I prefer to say that it's an object constructed out of wood and cloth with movement built into it to persuade you to believe that it has life.BJ: Okay so.AK: It has ears that move passively when the head goes.BJ: And it has these bulkheads made out of plywood, covered with fabric \u2014 curiously similar, in fact, to the plywood canoes that Adrian's father used to make when he was a boy in their workshop.AK: In Port Elizabeth, the village outside Port Elizabeth in South Africa.BJ: His mother was a puppeteer. And when we met at art school and fell in love in 1971, I hated puppets. I really thought they were so beneath me. I wanted to become an avant-garde artist \u2014 and Punch and Judy was certainly not where I wanted to go. And, in fact, it took about 10 yearsto discover the Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa, where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry, to learn a renewed, or a new, respect for this art form.AK: So in 1981, I persuaded Basil and some friends of mine to form a puppet company. And 20 years later, miraculously, we collaborated with a company from Mali, the Sogolon Marionette Troupe of Bamako, where we made a piece about a tall giraffe. It was just called \"Tall Horse,\" which was a life-sized giraffe.BJ: And here again, you see the same structure. The bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane, but it's ultimately the same structure. It's got two people inside it on stilts, which give them the height, and somebody in the front who's using a kind of steering wheel to move that head.AK: The person in the hind legs is also controlling the tail, a bit like the hyena \u2014 same mechanism, just a bit bigger. And he's controlling the ear movement.BJ: So this production was seen by Tom Morris of the National Theatre in London. And just around that time, his mother had said, \"Have you seen this book by Michael Morpurgo called 'War Horse'?\"AK: It's about a boy who falls in love with a horse. The horse is sold to the First World War, and he joins up to find his horse.BJ: So Tom gave us a call and said, \"Do you think you could make us a horse for a show to happen at the National Theatre?\"AK: It seemed a lovely idea.BJ: But it had to ride. It had to have a rider.AK: It had to have a rider, and it had to participate in cavalry charges. (Laughter) A play about early 20th century plowing technology and cavalry charges was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department at the National Theatre in London. But they agreed to go along with it for a while. So we began with a test.BJ: This is Adrian and Thys Stander, who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse, and our next-door neighbor Katherine, riding on a ladder. The weight is really difficult when it's up above your head.AK: And once we put Katherine through that particular brand of hell, we knew that we might be able to make a horse, which could be ridden. So we made a model. This is a cardboard model, a little bit smaller than the hyena. You'll notice that the legs are plywood legs and the canoe structure is still there.BJ: And the two manipulators are inside. But we didn't realize at the time that we actually needed a third manipulator, because we couldn't manipulate the neck from inside and walk the horse at the same time.AK: We started work on the prototype after the model was approved, and the prototype took a bit longer than we anticipated. We had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones. And we had a crate built for it. It had to be shipped to London. We were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in Cape Town, and it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet.BJ: So we got a camera, and we posed the puppet in various galloping stances. And we sent it off to the National Theatre, hoping that they believed that we created something that worked. (Laughter)AK: A month later, we were there in London with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us.BJ: About 40 people.AK: We were terrified. We opened the lid, we took the horse out, and it did work; it walked and it was able to be ridden. Here I have an 18-second clip of the very first walk of the prototype. This is in the National Theatre studio, the place where they cook new ideas. It had by no means got the green light yet. The choreographer, Toby Sedgwick, invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse, which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs, grew up into the big horse. And Nick Starr, the director of the National Theatre, saw that particular moment, he was standing next to me \u2014 he nearly wet himself. And so the show was given the green light. And we went back to Cape Town and redesigned the horse completely. Here is the plan.(Laughter)And here is our factory in Cape Town where we make horses. You can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there. The horses are completely handmade. There is very little 20th century technology in them. We used a bit of laser cutting on the plywood and some of the aluminum pieces. But because they have to be light and flexible, and each one of them is different, they can't be mass-produced, unfortunately. So here are some half-finished horses ready to be worked in London. And now we would like to introduce you to Joey. Joey boy, you there? Joey. (Applause) (Applause) Joey. Joey, come here. No, no, I haven't got it. He's got it; it's in his pocket.BJ: Joey. AK: Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey. Come here. Stand here where people can see you. Move around. Come on. I'd just like to describe \u2014 I won't talk too loud. He might get irritated. Here, Craig is working the head. He has bicycle brake cables going down to the head control in his hand. Each one of them operates either an ear, separately, or the head, up and down. But he also controls the head directly by using his hand. The ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse. When they point right back, the horse is fearful or angry, depending upon what's going on in front of him, around him. Or, when he's more relaxed, the head comes down and the ears listen, either side. Horses' hearing is very important. It's almost more important than their eyesight. Over here, Tommy's got what you call the heart position. He's working the leg. You see the string tendon from the hyena, the hyena's front leg, automatically pulls the hoop up. (Laughter) Horses are so unpredictable. (Laughter) The way a hoof comes up with a horse immediately gives you the feeling that it's a convincing horse action. The hind legs have got the same action.BJ: And Mikey also has, in his fingers, the ability to move the tail from left to right, and up and down with the other hand. And together, there's quite a complex possibility of tail expression.AK: You want to say something about the breathing?BJ: We had a big challenge with breathing. Adrian thought that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two and make it breathe like that \u2014 because that's how a horse would breathe, with an expanded chest. But we realized that, if that were to be happening, you wouldn't, as an audience, see the breath. So he made a channel in here, and the chest moves up and down in that channel. So it's anti-naturalistic really, the up and down movement, but it feels like breath. And it's very, very simple because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees.AK: Other emotional stuff. If I were to touch the horse here on his skin, the heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside and get the skin to quiver. You'll notice, of course, that the puppet is made out of cane lines. And I would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice, that I was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space. But of course, it was the cane is light, the cane is flexible, the cane is durable and the cane is moldable. And so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane.The skin itself is made out of a see-through nylon mesh, which, if the lighting designer wants the horse to almost disappear, she can light the background and the horse becomes ghostlike. You see the skeletal structure of it. Or if you light it from above, it becomes more solid. Again, that was a practical consideration. The guys inside the horse have to be able to see out. They have to be able to act along with their fellow actors in the production. And it's very much an in-the-moment activity that they're engaged in. It's three heads making one character.But now we would like you to put Joey through some paces. And plant.(Whinny)Thank you. And now just \u2014 (Applause) All the way from sunny California we have Zem Joaquin who's going to ride the horse for us.(Applause)(Applause)(Music)So we would like to stress that the performance you see in the horse is three guys who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly.BJ: Not being able to talk to one another while they're onstage because they're mic'd. The sound that that very large chest makes, of the horse \u2014 the whinnying and the nickering and everything \u2014 that starts usually with one performer, carries on with a second person and ends with a third.AK: Mikey Brett from Leicestershire.

00:00:16.958\nto talk about the evolution of a puppet horse.\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nBasil Jones: But actually we're going to start this evolution\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nwith a hyena.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nAK: The ancestor of the horse.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nOkay, we'll do something with it.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nHahahaha.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nThe hyena is the ancestor of the horse\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nbecause it was part of a production\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\ncalled \"Faustus in Africa,\"\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.958\na Handspring Production from 1995,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nwhere it had to play draughts with Helen of Troy.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nThis production was directed\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nby South African artist and theater director,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nWilliam Kentridge.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nSo it needed a very articulate front paw.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nBut, like all puppets, it has other attributes.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nBJ: One of them is breath,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nand it kind of breathes.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nAK: Haa haa haaa.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nBJ: Breath is really important for us.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nIt's the kind of original movement\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nfor any puppet for us onstage.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nIt's the thing that distinguishes the puppet --\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nAK: Oops.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nBJ: From an actor.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nPuppets always have to try to be alive.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nIt's their kind of ur-story onstage,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nthat desperation to live.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nAK: Yeah, it's basically a dead object, as you can see,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nand it only lives\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nbecause you make it.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nAn actor struggles to die onstage,\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nbut a puppet has to struggle to live.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nAnd in a way that's a metaphor for life.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nBJ: So every moment it's on the stage, it's making the struggle.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nSo we call this\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:47.958\na piece of emotional engineering\n\n00:02:47.958 -->

00:03:18.958\nBJ: And it has these bulkheads\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nmade out of plywood,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\ncovered with fabric --\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\ncuriously similar, in fact,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nto the plywood canoes\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nthat Adrian's father used to make\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nwhen he was a boy in

00:03:44.958\nI hated puppets.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nI really thought they were so beneath me.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nI wanted to become an avant-garde artist --\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nand Punch and Judy was certainly not where I wanted to go.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nAnd, in fact, it took about 10 years\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nto discover\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nthe Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nwhere there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nto learn a renewed, or a new, respect\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nfor this art form.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nAK: So in 1981, I persuaded Basil and some friends of

from Mali,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nthe Sogolon Marionette Troupe of Bamako,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nwhere we made a piece about a tall giraffe.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nIt was just called \"Tall Horse,\" which was a life-sized giraffe.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nBJ: And here again, you see the same structure.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nThe bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nbut it's ultimately the same structure.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nIt's got two people inside it on stilts,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nwhich give them the height,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nand somebody in the front\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nwho's using a kind of steering wheel to move that head.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nAK: The person in the hind legs\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nis also controlling the tail, a bit like the hyena --\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nsame mechanism, just a bit bigger.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nAnd he's controlling the ear movement.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nBJ: So this production\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nwas seen by Tom Morris\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nof the National Theatre in London.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nAnd just around that time,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nhis mother had said,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\n\"Have you seen this book by Michael Morpurgo\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\ncalled 'War Horse'?\"\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAK: It's about a boy who

It had to have a rider.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nAK: It had to have a rider,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nand it had to participate in cavalry charges.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nA play about early 20th century plowing technology\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nand cavalry charges\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nwas a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nat the National Theatre in London.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nBut they agreed to go along with it for a while.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nSo we began with a test.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nBJ: This is Adrian and Thys Stander,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nwho went on to actually design the cane system for the horse,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nand our next-door neighbor Katherine,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nriding on a ladder.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nThe weight is really difficult when it's up above your head.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nAK: And once we put Katherine\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nthrough that particular brand of hell,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nwe knew that we might be able to make a horse, which could be ridden.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nSo we made a model.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nThis is a cardboard model,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\na little bit smaller than the hyena.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nYou'll notice that the legs are plywood legs\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nand the canoe structure is still there.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nBJ: And the two manipulators are inside.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nBut we didn't realize at the time\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nthat we actually needed a third manipulator,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nbecause we couldn't manipulate the neck\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nfrom inside\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nand walk the horse at the same time.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nAK: We started work on the prototype\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nafter the model was approved,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nand the prototype took a bit longer\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nthan we anticipated.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nWe had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd we had a crate built for it.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nIt had to be shipped to London.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nWe were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in Cape Town,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nand it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nBJ: So we got a camera,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nand we posed the puppet\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nin various galloping stances.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nAnd we sent it off\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nto the National Theatre,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nhoping that they believed\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nthat we created something that worked.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nAK: A month later, we were there in London\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nwith this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nBJ: About 40 people.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nAK: We were terrified.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nWe opened the lid, we took the horse out,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nand it did work; it walked and it was able to be ridden.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nHere I have an 18-second clip\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nof the very first walk of the prototype.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nThis is in the National Theatre studio,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nthe place where they cook new ideas.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nIt had by no means got the green light yet.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nThe choreographer, Toby Sedgwick,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\ninvented a beautiful sequence\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nwhere the baby horse,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nwhich was made out of sticks and bits of twigs,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\ngrew up into the big horse.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nAnd Nick Starr, the director of the National Theatre,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nsaw that particular moment, he was standing next to me -- he nearly wet himself.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nAnd so the show was given the green light.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd we went back to Cape Town and redesigned the horse completely.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nHere is the plan.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nAnd here is our factory in Cape Town\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nwhere we make horses.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nYou can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nThe horses are completely handmade.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nThere is very little 20th century technology in them.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nWe used a bit of laser cutting on the plywood\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nand some of the aluminum pieces.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nBut because they have to be light and flexible,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nand each one of them is different,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nthey can't be mass-produced, unfortunately.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nSo here are some half-finished horses\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nready to be worked in London.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nAnd now we would like to introduce you\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nto Joey.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nJoey boy, you there?\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nJoey.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:34.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nJoey.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nJoey, come here.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nNo, no, I haven't got it.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nHe's got it; it's in his pocket.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nBJ: Joey.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nAK: Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nCome here. Stand here where people can see you.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nMove around. Come on.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nI'd just like to describe --\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nI won't talk too loud. He might get irritated.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nHere, Craig is working the head.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nHe has bicycle brake cables\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\ngoing down to the head control in his hand.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nEach one of them\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\noperates either an ear, separately,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nor the head, up and down.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nBut he also controls the head directly\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nby using his hand.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nThe ears are obviously\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\na very important emotional indicator of the horse.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nWhen they point right back,\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nthe horse is fearful or angry,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\ndepending upon what's going on in front of him, around him.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nOr, when he's more relaxed, the head comes down\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nand the ears listen, either side.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nHorses' hearing is very important.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nIt's almost more important than their eyesight.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nOver here,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nTommy's got what you call the heart position.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nHe's working the leg.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nYou see the string tendon from the hyena,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nthe hyena's front leg,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nautomatically pulls the hoop up.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:12:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nHorses are so unpredictable.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nThe way a hoof comes up with a horse\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nimmediately gives you the feeling\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nthat it's a convincing horse action.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nThe hind legs have got the same action.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nBJ: And Mikey also has,\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nin his fingers,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nthe ability to move the tail\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nfrom left to right,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nand up and down with the other hand.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nAnd together, there's quite a complex possibility\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nof tail expression.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nAK: You want to say something about the breathing?\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nBJ: We had a big challenge with breathing.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nAdrian thought\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nthat he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nand make it breathe like that --\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nbecause that's how a horse would breathe, with an expanded chest.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nBut we realized\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nthat, if that were to be happening,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nyou wouldn't, as an audience, see the breath.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nSo he made a channel in here,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nand the chest moves up and down in that channel.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nSo it's anti-naturalistic really, the up and down movement,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nbut it feels like breath.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nAnd it's very, very simple\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nbecause all that happens\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nis that the puppeteer breathes with his knees.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nAK: Other emotional stuff.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nIf I were to touch the horse here\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\non his skin,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nthe heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nand get the skin to quiver.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nYou'll notice, of course,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nthat the puppet is made out of cane lines.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nAnd I would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nthat I was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horse\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nthat somehow moves in space.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nBut of course, it was the cane is light,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nthe cane is flexible, the cane is durable\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nand the cane is moldable.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nAnd so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nThe skin itself\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nis made out of a see-through nylon mesh,\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nwhich, if the lighting designer\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nwants the horse to almost disappear,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nshe can light the background\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nand the horse becomes ghostlike.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nYou see the skeletal structure of it.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nOr if you light it from above, it becomes more solid.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nAgain, that was a practical consideration.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nThe guys inside the horse have to be able to see out.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nThey have to be able to act\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nalong with their fellow actors in the production.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nAnd it's very much an in-the-moment activity that they're engaged in.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nIt's three heads making one character.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nBut now we would like you to put Joey through some paces.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nAnd plant.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:13.958\n(Whinny)\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nThank you.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nAnd now just --\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:33.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nAll the way from sunny California\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nwe have Zem Joaquin\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nwho's going to ride the horse for us.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:43.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:44.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:50.958\n(Music)\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nSo we would like to stress\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nthat the performance you see in the horse\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nis three guys\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nwho have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nBJ: Not being able to talk to one another\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nwhile they're onstage\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nbecause they're mic'd.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nThe sound that that very large chest makes, of the horse --\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nthe whinnying and the nickering and everything

"https://www.ted.com/talks/eric_whitacre_a_virtual_choir_2_000_voices_strong", "transcript": "I wanted to be a rock star. I dreamed of it, and that's all I dreamed of. To be more accurate, I wanted to be a pop star. This was in the late '80s. And mostly I wanted to be the fifth member of Depeche Mode or Duran Duran. They wouldn't have me. I didn't read music, but I played synthesizers and drum machines. And I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nevada. And I was certain that's what my life would be.And when I went to college at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas when I was 18, I was stunned to find that there was not a Pop Star 101, or even a degree program for that interest. And the choir conductor there knew that I sang and invited me to come and join the choir. And I said, \"Yes, I would love to do that. It sounds great.\" And I left the room and said, \"No way.\" The choir people in my high school were pretty geeky, and there was no way I was going to have anything to do with those people. And about a week later, a friend of mine came to me and said, \"Listen, you've got to join choir. At the end of the semester, we're taking a trip to Mexico, all expenses paid. And the soprano section is just full of hot girls.\" And so I figured for Mexico and babes, I could do just about anything.And I went to my first day in choir, and I sat down with the basses and sort of looked over my shoulder to see what they were doing. They opened their scores, the conductor gave the downbeat, and boom, they launched into the Kyrie from the \"Requiem\" by Mozart. In my entire life I had seen in black and white, and suddenly everything was in shocking Technicolor. The most transformative experience I've ever had \u2014 in that single moment, hearing dissonance and harmony and people singing, people together, the shared vision. And I felt for the first time in my life that I was part of something bigger than myself. And there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section, as it turns out.I decided to write a piece for choir a couple of years later as a gift to this conductor who had changed my life. I had learned to read music by then, or slowly learning to read music. And that piece was published, and then I wrote another piece, and that got published. And then I started conducting, and I ended up doing my master's degree at the Juilliard School. And I find myself now in the unlikely position of standing in front of all of you as a professional classical composer and conductor.Well a couple of years ago, a friend of mine emailed me a link, a YouTube link, and said, \"You have got to see this.\" And it was this young woman who had posted a fan video to me, singing the soprano line to a piece of mine called \"Sleep.\"(Video) Britlin Losee: Hi Mr. Eric Whitacre. My name is Britlin Losee, and this is a video that I'd like to make for you. Here's me singing \"Sleep.\" I'm a little nervous, just to let you know. \u266b If there are noises \u266b \u266b in the night \u266bEric Whitacre: I was thunderstruck. Britlin was so innocent and so sweet, and her voice was so pure. And I even loved seeing behind her; I could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room. Such an intimate video.And I had this idea: if I could get 50 people to all do this same thing, sing their parts \u2014 soprano, alto, tenor and bass \u2014 wherever they were in the world, post their videos to YouTube, we could cut it all together and create a virtual choir. So I wrote on my blog, \"OMG OMG.\" I actually wrote, \"OMG,\" hopefully for the last time in public ever. (Laughter) And I sent out this call to singers. And I made free the download of the music to a piece that I had written in the year 2000 called \"Lux Aurumque,\" which means \"light and gold.\" And lo and behold, people started uploading their videos.Now I should say, before that, what I did is I posted a conductor track of myself conducting. And it's in complete silence when I filmed it, because I was only hearing the music in my head, imagining the choir that would one day come to be. Afterwards, I played a piano track underneath so that the singers would have something to listen to. And then as the videos started to come in ...(Singing) This is Cheryl Ang from Singapore.(Singing) This is Evangelina Etienne(Singing) from Massachusetts.(Singing) Stephen Hanson from Sweden.(Singing) This is Jamal Walker from Dallas, Texas.(Singing)There was even a little soprano solo in the piece, and so I had auditions. And a number of sopranos uploaded their parts. I was told later, and also by lots of singers who were involved in this, that they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes until they got just the right take \u2014 they uploaded it. Here's our winner of the soprano solo. This is Melody Myers from Tennessee. (Singing) I love the little smile she does right over the top of the note \u2014 like, \"No problem, everything's fine.\"(Laughter)And from the crowd emerged this young man, Scott Haines. And he said, \"Listen, this is the project I've been looking for my whole life. I'd like to be the person to edit this all together.\" I said, \"Thank you, Scott. I'm so glad that you found me.\" And Scott aggregated all of the videos. He scrubbed the audio. He made sure that everything lined up. And then we posted this video to YouTube about a year and a half ago. This is \"Lux Aurumque\" sung by the Virtual Choir.(Singing)I'll stop it there in the interest of time. (Applause)Thank you. Thank you.(Applause)Thank you. So there's more. There's more. Thank you so much.And I had the same reaction you did. I actually was moved to tears when I first saw it. I just couldn't believe the poetry of all of it \u2014 these souls all on their own desert island, sending electronic messages in bottles to each other. And the video went viral. We had a million hits in the first month and got a lot of attention for it. And because of that, then a lot of singers started saying, \"All right, what's Virtual Choir 2.0?\" And so I decided for Virtual Choir 2.0 that I would choose the same piece that Britlin was singing, \"Sleep,\" which is another work that I wrote in the year 2000 \u2014 poetry by my dear friend Charles Anthony Silvestri. And again, I posted a conductor video, and we started accepting submissions. This time we got some more mature members. (Singing) And some younger members.(Video) Soprano: \u266b Upon my pillow \u266b \u266b Safe in bed \u266b EW: That's Georgie from England. She's only nine. Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever seen?Someone did all eight videos \u2014 a bass even singing the soprano parts. This is Beau Awtin. (Video) Beau Awtin: \u266b Safe in bed \u266bEW: And our goal \u2014 it was sort of an arbitrary goal \u2014 there was an MTV video where they all sang \"Lollipop\" and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody. And there were 900 people involved in that. So I told the singers, \"That's our goal. That's the number for us to beat.\" And we just closed submissions January 10th, and our final tally was 2,051 videos from 58 different countries. Thank you. (Applause) From Malta, Madagascar, Thailand, Vietnam, Jordan, Egypt, Israel, as far north as Alaska and as far south as New Zealand.And we also put a page on Facebook for the singers to upload their testimonials, what it was like for them, their experience singing it. And I've just chosen a few of them here. \"My sister and I used to sing in choirs together constantly. Now she's an airman in the air force constantly traveling. It's so wonderful to sing together again!\" I love the idea that she's singing with her sister. \"Aside from the beautiful music, it's great just to know I'm part of a worldwide community of people I never met before, but who are connected anyway.\" And my personal favorite, \"When I told my husband that I was going to be a part of this, he told me that I did not have the voice for it.\" Yeah, I'm sure a lot of you have heard that too. Me too. \"It hurt so much, and I shed some tears, but something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words. It is a dream come true to be part of this choir, as I've never been part of one. When I placed a marker on the Google Earth Map, I had to go with the nearest city, which is about 400 miles away from where I live. As I am in the Great Alaskan Bush, satellite is my connection to the world.\"So two things struck me deeply about this. The first is that human beings will go to any lengths necessary to find and connect with each other. It doesn't matter the technology. And the second is that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection. It wasn't a virtual choir. There are people now online that are friends; they've never met. But, I know myself too, I feel this virtual esprit de corps, if you will, with all of them. I feel a closeness to this choir \u2014 almost like a family.What I'd like to close with then today is the first look at \"Sleep\" by Virtual Choir 2.0. This will be a premiere today. We're not finished with the video yet. You can imagine, with 2,000 synchronized YouTube videos, the render time is just atrocious. But we do have the first three minutes. And it's a tremendous honor for me to be able to show it to you here first. You're the very first people to see this. This is \"Sleep,\" the Virtual Choir.(Video) Virtual Choir: \u266b The evening hangs \u266b \u266b beneath the moon \u266b \u266b A silver thread on darkened dune \u266b \u266b With closing eyes and resting head \u266b \u266b I know that sleep is coming soon \u266b \u266b Upon my pillow, \u266b \u266b safe in bed, \u266b \u266b a thousand pictures fill my head \u266b \u266b I cannot sleep \u266b \u266b my mind's aflight \u266b \u266b and yet my limbs seem made of lead \u266b \u266b If there are noises in the night \u266bEric Whitacre: Thank you very, very much.

It sounds great.\"\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nAnd I left the room and said, \"No way.\"\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nThe choir people in my high school were pretty geeky,\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nand there was no way I was going to have anything to do with those people.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nAnd about a week later, a friend of mine came to me and said,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\n\"Listen, you've got to join choir.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nAt the end of the semester, we're taking a trip to Mexico,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nall expenses paid.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nAnd the soprano section is just full of hot girls.\"\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nAnd so I figured for Mexico and babes,\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nI could do just about anything.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nAnd I went to my first day in choir,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nand I sat down with the basses\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nand sort of looked over my shoulder\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nto see what they were doing.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nThey opened their scores, the conductor gave the downbeat,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nand boom, they launched into the Kyrie\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nfrom the \"Requiem\" by Mozart.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nIn my entire life I had seen in black and white,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nand suddenly everything was in shocking Technicolor.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nThe most transformative experience I've ever had --\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nin that single moment, hearing dissonance and harmony\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nand people singing, people together,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nthe shared vision.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nAnd I felt for the first time in my life\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nthat I was part of something bigger than myself.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nAnd there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section, as it turns out.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nI decided to write a piece for choir\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\na couple of years later\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nas a gift to this conductor\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nwho had changed my life.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nI had learned to read music by then, or slowly learning to read music.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nAnd that piece was published,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nand then I wrote another piece, and that got published.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nAnd then I started conducting,\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nand I ended up doing my master's degree at the Juilliard School.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nAnd I find myself now in the unlikely position\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nof standing in front of all of you\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nas a professional classical composer and conductor.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nWell a couple of years ago,\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\na friend of mine emailed me\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\na link, a YouTube link,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nand said, \"You have got to see this.\"\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nAnd it was this young woman who had posted a fan video to me,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nsinging the soprano line\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nto a piece of mine called \"Sleep.\"\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\n(Video) Britlin Losee: Hi Mr. Eric Whitacre.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nMy name is Britlin Losee,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nand this is a video\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nthat I'd like to make for you.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nHere's me singing \"Sleep.\"\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nI'm a little nervous, just to let you know.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:15.958\n\u266b If there are noises \u266b\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:21.958\n\u266b in the night \u266b\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nEric Whitacre: I was thunderstruck.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nBritlin was so innocent and so sweet,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nand her voice was so pure.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAnd I even loved seeing behind her;\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nI could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nSuch an intimate video.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nAnd I had this idea: if I could get 50 people\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nto all do this same thing,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nsing their parts -- soprano, alto, tenor and bass --\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nwherever they were in the world, post their videos to YouTube,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nwe could cut it all together and create a virtual choir.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nSo I wrote on my blog, \"OMG OMG.\"\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nI actually wrote, \"OMG,\"\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nhopefully for the last time in public ever.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nAnd I sent out this call to singers.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nAnd I made free the download of the music\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nto a piece that I had written in the year 2000\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\ncalled \"Lux Aurumque,\" which means \"light and gold.\"\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nAnd lo and behold, people started uploading their videos.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nNow I should say, before that,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nwhat I did is I posted a conductor track\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nof myself conducting.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nAnd it's in complete silence when I filmed it,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nbecause I was only hearing the music in my head,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nimagining the choir that would one day come to be.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nAfterwards, I played a piano track underneath\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nso that the singers would have something to listen to.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nAnd then as the videos started to come in ...\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:38.958\n(Singing)\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nThis is Cheryl Ang from Singapore.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:47.958\n(Singing)\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nThis is Evangelina Etienne\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:56.958\n(Singing)\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nfrom Massachusetts.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\n(Singing)\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nStephen Hanson from Sweden.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\n(Singing)\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nThis is Jamal Walker from Dallas, Texas.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:16.958\n(Singing)\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nThere was even a little soprano solo in the piece,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nand so I had auditions.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nAnd a number of sopranos uploaded their parts.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nI was told later,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nand also by lots of singers who were involved in this,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nthat they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nuntil they got just the right take -- they uploaded it.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nHere's our winner of the soprano solo.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nThis is Melody Myers from Tennessee.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:54.958\n(Singing)\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nI love the little smile she does right over the top of the note --\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nlike, \"No problem, everything's fine.\"\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nAnd from the crowd\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nemerged this young man, Scott Haines.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nAnd he said, \"Listen, this is the project\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nI've been looking for my whole life.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nI'd like to be the person to edit this all together.\"\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nI said, \"Thank you, Scott. I'm so glad that you found me.\"\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nAnd Scott aggregated all of the videos.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nHe scrubbed the audio.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nHe made sure that everything lined up.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nAnd then we posted this video to YouTube about a year and a half ago.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nThis is \"Lux Aurumque\" sung by the Virtual Choir.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:35.958\n(Singing)\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nI'll stop it there in the interest of time.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:52.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nThank you.

But you have to have the right tools. If I'm going to teach my daughter about electronics, I'm not going to give her a soldering iron. And similarly, she finds prototyping boards really frustrating for her little hands. So my wonderful student Sam and I decided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of: Play-Doh. And so we spent a summer looking at different Play-Doh recipes. And these recipes probably look really familiar to any of you who have made homemade play-dough \u2014 pretty standard ingredients you probably have in your kitchen. We have two favorite recipes \u2014 one that has these ingredients and a second that had sugar instead of salt. And they're great. We can make great little sculptures with these.But the really cool thing about them is when we put them together. You see that really salty Play-Doh? Well, it conducts electricity. And this is nothing new. It turns out that regular Play-Doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity, and high school physics teachers have used that for years. But our homemade play-dough actually has half the resistance of commercial Play-Doh. And that sugar dough? Well it's 150 times more resistant to electric current than that salt dough. So what does that mean? Well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits \u2014 circuits that the most creative, tiny, little hands can build on their own.(Applause)And so I want to do a little demo for you. So if I take this salt dough, again, it's like the play-dough you probably made as kids, and I plug it in \u2014 it's a two-lead battery pack, simple battery pack, you can buy them at Radio Shack and pretty much anywhere else \u2014 we can actually then light things up. But if any of you have studied electrical engineering, we can also create a short circuit. If I push these together, the light turns off. Right, the current wants to run through the play-dough, not through that LED. If I separate them again, I have some light. Well now if I take that sugar dough, the sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity. It's like a wall to the electricity. If I place that between, now all the dough is touching, but if I stick that light back in, I have light. In fact, I could even add some movement to my sculptures. If I want a spinning tail, let's grab a motor, put some play-dough on it, stick it on and we have spinning.(Applause)And once you have the basics, we can make a slightly more complicated circuit. We call this our sushi circuit. It's very popular with kids. I plug in again the power to it. And now I can start talking about parallel and series circuits. I can start plugging in lots of lights. And we can start talking about things like electrical load. What happens if I put in lots of lights and then add a motor? It'll dim. We can even add microprocessors and have this as an input and create squishy sound music that we've done. You could do parallel and series circuits for kids using this.So this is all in your home kitchen. We've actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab. We have a website, it's all there. These are the home recipes. We've got some videos. You can make them yourselves. And it's been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone. We've had a mom in Utah who used them with her kids, to a science researcher in the U.K., and curriculum developers in Hawaii.So I would encourage you all to grab some Play-Doh, grab some salt, grab some sugar and start playing. We don't usually think of our kitchen as an electrical engineering lab or little kids as circuit designers, but maybe we should.Have fun.

It's very popular with kids.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nI plug in again the power to it.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nAnd now I can start talking about parallel and series circuits.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nI can start plugging in lots of lights.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nAnd we can start talking about things like electrical load.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nWhat happens if I put in lots of lights\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nand then add a motor?\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nIt'll dim.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nWe can even add microprocessors\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nand have this as an input\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nand create squishy sound music that we've done.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nYou could do parallel and series circuits\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nfor kids using this.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nSo this is all in your home kitchen.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nWe've actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nWe have a website, it's all there. These are the home recipes.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nWe've got some videos. You can make them yourselves.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAnd it's been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nWe've had a mom in Utah who used them with her kids,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nto a science researcher in the U.K.,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nand curriculum developers in Hawaii.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nSo I would encourage you all to grab some Play-Doh,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\ngrab some salt, grab some sugar and start playing.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nWe don't usually think of our kitchen as an electrical engineering lab\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nor little kids as circuit designers,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nbut maybe we should.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nHave fun. Thank you.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:58.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Listen, learn ... then lead", "duration": "938", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/stanley_mcchrystal", "transcript": "Ten years ago, on a Tuesday morning, I conducted a parachute jump at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. It was a routine training jump, like many more I'd done since I became a paratrooper 27 years before. We went down to the airfield early because this is the Army and you always go early. You do some routine refresher training, and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you. And you put on the T-10 parachute. And you're very careful how you put the straps, particularly the leg straps because they go between your legs. And then you put on your reserve, and then you put on your heavy rucksack. And then a jumpmaster comes, and he's an experienced NCO in parachute operations. He checks you out, he grabs your adjusting straps and he tightens everything so that your chest is crushed, your shoulders are crushed down, and, of course, he's tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well. Then you sit down, and you wait a little while, because this is the Army. Then you load the aircraft, and then you stand up and you get on, and you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this, in a line of people, and you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft. And you wait a little bit longer, because this is the Air Force teaching the Army how to wait.Then you take off. And it's painful enough now \u2014 and I think it's designed this way \u2014 it's painful enough so you want to jump. You didn't really want to jump, but you want out. So you get in the aircraft, you're flying along, and at 20 minutes out, these jumpmasters start giving you commands. They give 20 minutes \u2014 that's a time warning. You sit there, OK. Then they give you 10 minutes. And of course, you're responding with all of these. And that's to boost everybody's confidence, to show that you're not scared. Then they give you, \"Get ready.\" Then they go, \"Outboard personnel, stand up.\" If you're an outboard personnel, now you stand up. If you're an inboard personnel, stand up. And then you hook up, and you hook up your static line. And at that point, you think, \"Hey, guess what? I'm probably going to jump. There's no way to get out of this at this point.\" You go through some additional checks, and then they open the door.And this was that Tuesday morning in September, and it was pretty nice outside. So nice air comes flowing in. The jumpmasters start to check the door. And then when it's time to go, a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes, \"Go.\" The first guy goes, and you're just in line, and you just kind of lumber to the door. Jump is a misnomer; you fall. You fall outside the door, you're caught in the slipstream. The first thing you do is lock into a tight body position \u2014 head down in your chest, your arms extended, put over your reserve parachute. You do that because, 27 years before, an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that. I have no idea whether it makes any difference, but he seemed to make sense, and I wasn't going to test the hypothesis that he'd be wrong. And then you wait for the opening shock for your parachute to open. If you don't get an opening shock, you don't get a parachute \u2014 you've got a whole new problem set. But typically you do; typically it opens. And of course, if your leg straps aren't set right, at that point you get another little thrill. Boom.So then you look around, you're under a canopy and you say, \"This is good.\" Now you prepare for the inevitable. You are going to hit the ground. You can't delay that much. And you really can't decide where you hit very much, because they pretend you can steer, but you're being delivered. So you look around, where you're going to land, you try to make yourself ready. And then as you get close, you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line, so that it's not on you when you land, and you prepare to do a parachute-landing fall. Now the Army teaches you to do five points of performance \u2014 the toes of your feet, your calves, your thighs, your buttocks and your push-up muscles. It's this elegant little land, twist and roll. And that's not going to hurt. In 30-some years of jumping, I never did one. (Laughter) I always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window.(Laughter)And as soon as I hit, the first thing I did is I'd see if I'd broken anything that I needed. I'd shake my head, and I'd ask myself the eternal question: \"Why didn't I go into banking?\" (Laughter) And I'd look around, and then I'd see another paratrooper, a young guy or girl, and they'd have pulled out their M4 carbine and they'd be picking up their equipment. They'd be doing everything that we had taught them. And I realized that, if they had to go into combat, they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders. And I realized that, if they came out of combat, it would be because we led them well. And I was hooked again on the importance of what I did.So now I do that Tuesday morning jump, but it's not any jump \u2014 that was September 11th, 2001. And when we took off from the airfield, America was at peace. When we landed on the drop-zone, everything had changed. And what we thought about the possibility of those young soldiers going into combat as being theoretical was now very, very real \u2014 and leadership seemed important. But things had changed; I was a 46-year-old brigadier general. I'd been successful, but things changed so much that I was going to have to make some significant changes, and on that morning, I didn't know it.I was raised with traditional stories of leadership: Robert E. Lee, John Buford at Gettysburg. And I also was raised with personal examples of leadership. This was my father in Vietnam. And I was raised to believe that soldiers were strong and wise and brave and faithful; they didn't lie, cheat, steal or abandon their comrades. And I still believe real leaders are like that. But in my first 25 years of career, I had a bunch of different experiences.One of my first battalion commanders, I worked in his battalion for 18 months and the only conversation he ever had with Lt. McChrystal was at mile 18 of a 25-mile road march, and he chewed my ass for about 40 seconds. And I'm not sure that was real interaction. But then a couple of years later, when I was a company commander, I went out to the National Training Center. And we did an operation, and my company did a dawn attack \u2014 you know, the classic dawn attack: you prepare all night, move to the line of departure. And I had an armored organization at that point. We move forward, and we get wiped out \u2014 I mean, wiped out immediately. The enemy didn't break a sweat doing it. And after the battle, they bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an \"after action review\" to teach you what you've done wrong. Sort of leadership by humiliation. They put a big screen up, and they take you through everything: \"and then you didn't do this, and you didn't do this, etc.\" I walked out feeling as low as a snake's belly in a wagon rut. And I saw my battalion commander, because I had let him down. And I went up to apologize to him, and he said, \"Stanley, I thought you did great.\" And in one sentence, he lifted me, put me back on my feet, and taught me that leaders can let you fail and yet not let you be a failure.When 9/11 came, 46-year-old Brig. Gen. McChrystal sees a whole new world. First, the things that are obvious, that you're familiar with: the environment changed \u2014 the speed, the scrutiny, the sensitivity of everything now is so fast, sometimes it evolves faster than people have time to really reflect on it. But everything we do is in a different context. More importantly, the force that I led was spread over more than 20 countries. And instead of being able to get all the key leaders for a decision together in a single room and look them in the eye and build their confidence and get trust from them, I'm now leading a force that's dispersed, and I've got to use other techniques. I've got to use video teleconferences, I've got to use chat, I've got to use email, I've got to use phone calls \u2014 I've got to use everything I can, not just for communication, but for leadership. A 22-year-old individual operating alone, thousands of miles from me, has got to communicate to me with confidence. I have to have trust in them and vice versa. And I also have to build their faith. And that's a new kind of leadership for me.We had one operation where we had to coordinate it from multiple locations. An emerging opportunity came \u2014 didn't have time to get everybody together. So we had to get complex intelligence together, we had to line up the ability to act. It was sensitive, we had to go up the chain of command, convince them that this was the right thing to do and do all of this on electronic medium. We failed. The mission didn't work. And so now what we had to do is I had to reach out to try to rebuild the trust of that force, rebuild their confidence \u2014 me and them, and them and me, and our seniors and us as a force \u2014 all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder. Entirely new requirement.Also, the people had changed. You probably think that the force that I led was all steely-eyed commandos with big knuckle fists carrying exotic weapons. In reality, much of the force I led looked exactly like you. It was men, women, young, old \u2014 not just from military; from different organizations, many of them detailed to us just from a handshake. And so instead of giving orders, you're now building consensus and you're building a sense of shared purpose. Probably the biggest change was understanding that the generational difference, the ages, had changed so much. I went down to be with a Ranger platoon on an operation in Afghanistan, and on that operation, a sergeant in the platoon had lost about half his arm throwing a Taliban hand grenade back at the enemy after it had landed in his fire team. We talked about the operation, and then at the end I did what I often do with a force like that. I asked, \"Where were you on 9/11?\" And one young Ranger in the back \u2014 his hair's tousled and his face is red and windblown from being in combat in the cold Afghan wind \u2014 he said, \"Sir, I was in the sixth grade.\" And it reminded me that we're operating a force that must have shared purpose and shared consciousness, and yet he has different experiences, in many cases a different vocabulary, a completely different skill set in terms of digital media than I do and many of the other senior leaders. And yet, we need to have that shared sense.It also produced something which I call an inversion of expertise, because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics and whatnot, that suddenly the things that we grew up doing wasn't what the force was doing anymore. So how does a leader stay credible and legitimate when they haven't done what the people you're leading are doing? And it's a brand new leadership challenge. And it forced me to become a lot more transparent, a lot more willing to listen, a lot more willing to be reverse-mentored from lower. And yet, again, you're not all in one room. Then another thing. There's an effect on you and on your leaders. There's an impact, it's cumulative. You don't reset, or recharge your battery every time.I stood in front of a screen one night in Iraq with one of my senior officers and we watched a firefight from one of our forces. And I remembered his son was in our force. And I said, \"John, where's your son? And how is he?\" And he said, \"Sir, he's fine. Thanks for asking.\" I said, \"Where is he now?\" And he pointed at the screen, he said, \"He's in that firefight.\" Think about watching your brother, father, daughter, son, wife in a firefight in real time and you can't do anything about it. Think about knowing that over time. And it's a new cumulative pressure on leaders.And you have to watch and take care of each other. I probably learned the most about relationships. I learned they are the sinew which hold the force together. I grew up much of my career in the Ranger regiment. And every morning in the Ranger regiment, every Ranger \u2014 and there are more than 2,000 of them \u2014 says a six-stanza Ranger creed. You may know one line of it, it says, \"I'll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy.\" And it's not a mindless mantra, and it's not a poem. It's a promise. Every Ranger promises every other Ranger, \"No matter what happens, no matter what it costs me, if you need me, I'm coming.\" And every Ranger gets that same promise from every other Ranger. Think about it. It's extraordinarily powerful. It's probably more powerful than marriage vows. And they've lived up to it, which gives it special power. And so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing.And I learned personal relationships were more important than ever. We were in a difficult operation in Afghanistan in 2007, and an old friend of mine, that I had spent many years at various points of my career with \u2014 godfather to one of their kids \u2014 he sent me a note, just in an envelope, that had a quote from Sherman to Grant that said, \"I knew if I ever got in a tight spot, that you would come, if alive.\" And having that kind of relationship, for me, turned out to be critical at many points in my career.And I learned that you have to give that in this environment, because it's tough. That was my journey. I hope it's not over. I came to believe that a leader isn't good because they're right; they're good because they're willing to learn and to trust. This isn't easy stuff. It's not like that electronic abs machine where, 15 minutes a month, you get washboard abs. (Laughter) And it isn't always fair. You can get knocked down, and it hurts and it leaves scars. But if you're a leader, the people you've counted on will help you up. And if you're a leader, the people who count on you need you on your feet.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1112, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nTen years ago, on a Tuesday morning,\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nI conducted a parachute jump at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nIt was a routine training jump, like many more I'd done\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nsince I became a paratrooper\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\n27 years before.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nWe went down to the airfield early\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nbecause this is the Army and you always go early.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nYou do some routine refresher training,\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nand then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nAnd you put on the T-10 parachute.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nAnd you're very careful how you put the straps,\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nparticularly the leg straps because they go between your legs.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nAnd then you put on your reserve, and then you put on your heavy rucksack.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nAnd then a jumpmaster comes,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nand he's an experienced NCO in parachute operations.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nHe checks you out, he grabs your adjusting straps\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nand he tightens everything\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nso that your chest is crushed,\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nyour shoulders are crushed down,\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nand, of course, he's tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nThen you sit down, and you wait a little while,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nbecause this is the Army.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nThen you load the aircraft, and then you stand up and you get on,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nand you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this, in a line of people,\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nand you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nAnd you wait a little bit longer,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nbecause this is the Air Force teaching the Army how to wait.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nThen you take off.\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nAnd it's painful enough now --\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nand I think it's designed this way --\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nit's painful enough so you want to jump.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nYou didn't really want to jump, but you want out.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nSo you get in the aircraft, you're flying along,\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nand at 20 minutes out, these jumpmasters start giving you commands.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nThey give 20 minutes -- that's a time warning.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nYou sit there, OK.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nThen they give you 10 minutes.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nAnd of course, you're responding with all of these.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nAnd that's to boost everybody's confidence, to show that you're not scared.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nThen they give you, \"Get ready.\"\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nThen they go, \"Outboard personnel, stand up.\"\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nIf you're an outboard personnel, now you stand up.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nIf you're an inboard personnel, stand up.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nAnd then you hook up, and you hook up your static line.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nAnd at that point, you think, \"Hey, guess what?\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nI'm probably going to jump.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nThere's no way to get out of this at this point.\"\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nYou go through some additional checks, and then they open the door.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nAnd this was that Tuesday morning in September,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nand it was pretty nice outside.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nSo nice air comes flowing in.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nThe jumpmasters start to check the door.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nAnd then when it's time to go,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\na green light goes and the jumpmaster goes, \"Go.\"\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nThe first guy goes, and you're just in line,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nand you just kind of lumber to the door.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nJump is a misnomer; you fall.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nYou fall outside the door,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nyou're caught in the slipstream.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nThe first thing you do is lock into a tight body position --\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nhead down in your chest, your arms extended,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nput over your reserve parachute.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nYou do that because, 27 years before,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nan airborne sergeant had taught me to do that.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nI have no idea whether it makes any difference,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nbut he seemed to make sense,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nand I wasn't going to test the hypothesis that he'd be wrong.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nAnd then you wait for the opening shock\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nfor your parachute to open.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nIf you don't get an opening shock, you don't get a parachute --\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nyou've got a whole new problem set.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nBut typically you do; typically it opens.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nAnd of course, if your leg straps aren't set right,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nat that point you get another little thrill.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nBoom.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nSo then you look around,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nyou're under a canopy and you say, \"This is good.\"\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nNow you prepare for the inevitable.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nYou are going to hit the ground.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nYou can't delay that much.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nAnd you really can't decide where you hit very much,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nbecause they pretend you can steer,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nbut you're being delivered.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nSo you look around, where you're going to land,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nyou try to make yourself ready.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nAnd then as you get close, you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nso that it's not on you when you land,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nand you prepare to do a parachute-landing fall.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nNow the Army teaches you\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nto do five points of performance --\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nthe toes of your feet,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nyour calves, your thighs,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nyour buttocks and your push-up muscles.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nIt's this elegant little land, twist and roll.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nAnd that's not going to hurt.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nIn 30-some years of jumping, I never did one.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nI always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nAnd as soon as I hit,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nthe first thing I did is I'd see if I'd broken anything that I needed.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nI'd shake my head,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nand I'd ask myself the eternal question:\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\n\"Why didn't I go into banking?\"\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nAnd I'd look around,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nand then I'd see another paratrooper,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\na young guy or girl,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nand they'd have pulled out their M4 carbine\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nand they'd be picking up their equipment.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nThey'd be doing everything\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nthat we had taught them.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nAnd I realized\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nthat, if they had to go into combat,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nthey would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nAnd I realized that, if they came out of combat,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nit would be because we led them well.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nAnd I was hooked again on the importance of what I did.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nSo now I do that Tuesday morning jump,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nbut it's not any jump --\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nthat was September 11th, 2001.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nAnd when we took off from the airfield, America was at peace.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nWhen we landed on the drop-zone, everything had changed.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nAnd what we thought\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nabout the possibility of those young soldiers going into combat\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nas being theoretical\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nwas now very, very real --\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nand leadership seemed important.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nBut things had changed;\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nI was a 46-year-old brigadier general.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nI'd been successful,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nbut things changed so much\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nthat I was going to have to make some significant changes,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nand on that morning, I didn't know it.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nI was raised with traditional stories of leadership:\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nRobert E. Lee, John Buford at Gettysburg.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nAnd I also was raised\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nwith personal examples of leadership.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nThis was my father in Vietnam.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nAnd I was raised to believe\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nthat soldiers were strong and wise\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nand brave and faithful;\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nthey didn't lie, cheat, steal\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nor abandon their comrades.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nAnd I still believe real leaders are like that.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nBut in my first 25 years of career,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nI had a bunch of different experiences.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nOne of my first battalion commanders,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nI worked in his battalion for 18 months\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nand the only conversation he ever had with Lt. McChrystal\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nwas at mile 18 of a 25-mile road march,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nand he chewed my ass for about 40 seconds.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nAnd I'm not sure that was real interaction.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nBut then a couple of years later, when I was a company commander,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nI went out to the National Training Center.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nAnd we did an operation,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nand my company did a dawn attack --\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nyou know, the classic dawn attack:\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nyou prepare all night, move to the line of departure.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nAnd I had an armored organization at that point.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nWe move forward, and we get wiped out --\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nI mean, wiped out immediately.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nThe enemy didn't break a sweat doing it.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd after the battle,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nthey bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an \"after action review\"\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nto teach you what you've done wrong.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nSort of leadership by humiliation.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nThey put a big screen up, and they take you through everything:\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\n\"and then you didn't do this, and you didn't do this, etc.\"\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nI walked out feeling as low\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nas a snake's belly in a wagon rut.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nAnd I saw my battalion commander, because I had let him down.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nAnd I went up to apologize to him,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nand he said, \"Stanley, I thought you did great.\"\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nAnd in one sentence,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nhe lifted me, put me back on my feet,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nand taught me that leaders can let you fail\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nand yet not let you be a failure.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nWhen 9/11 came,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\n46-year-old Brig. Gen. McChrystal sees a whole new world.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nFirst, the things that are obvious, that you're familiar with:\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nthe environment changed --\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nthe speed, the scrutiny,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nthe sensitivity of everything now is so fast,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nsometimes it evolves faster\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nthan people have time to really reflect on it.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nBut everything we do\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nis in a different context.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nMore importantly, the force that I led\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nwas spread over more than 20 countries.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nAnd instead of being able to get all the key leaders\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nfor a decision together in a single room\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nand look them in the eye and build their confidence\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nand get trust from them,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nI'm now leading a force that's dispersed,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nand I've got to use other techniques.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nI've got to use video teleconferences, I've got to use chat,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nI've got to use email, I've got to use phone calls --\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nI've got to use everything I can,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nnot just for communication,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nbut for leadership.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nA 22-year-old individual\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\noperating alone,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nthousands of miles from me,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nhas got to communicate to me with confidence.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nI have to have trust in them and vice versa.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nAnd I also have to build their faith.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nAnd that's a new kind of leadership\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nfor me.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nWe had one operation\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nwhere we had to coordinate it from multiple locations.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nAn emerging opportunity came --\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\ndidn't have time to get everybody together.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nSo we had to get complex intelligence together,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nwe had to line up the ability to act.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nIt was sensitive, we had to go up the chain of command,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nconvince them that this was the right thing to do\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nand do all of this\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\non electronic medium.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nWe failed.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nThe mission didn't work.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nAnd so now what we had to do\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nis I had to reach out\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nto try to rebuild the trust of that force,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nrebuild their confidence --\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nme and them, and them and me,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nand our seniors and us as a force --\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nall without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nEntirely new requirement.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nAlso, the people had changed.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nYou probably think that the force that I led\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nwas all steely-eyed commandos with big knuckle fists\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\ncarrying exotic weapons.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nIn reality,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nmuch of the force I led\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nlooked exactly like you.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nIt was men, women, young, old --\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nnot just from military; from different organizations,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nmany of them detailed to us just from a handshake.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nAnd so instead of giving orders,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nyou're now building consensus\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nand you're building a sense of shared purpose.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nProbably the biggest change\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nwas understanding that the generational difference,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nthe ages, had changed so much.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nI went down to be with a Ranger platoon\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\non an operation in Afghanistan,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nand on that operation,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\na sergeant in the platoon\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nhad lost about half his arm\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nthrowing a Taliban hand grenade\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nback at the enemy\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nafter it had landed in his fire team.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nWe talked about the operation,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nand then at the end I did what I often do with a force like that.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nI asked, \"Where were you on 9/11?\"\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nAnd one young Ranger in the back --\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nhis hair's tousled and his face is red and windblown\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nfrom being in combat in the cold Afghan wind --\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nhe said, \"Sir, I was in the sixth grade.\"\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nAnd it reminded me\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nthat we're operating a force\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nthat must have shared purpose\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nand shared consciousness,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nand yet he has different experiences,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nin many cases a different vocabulary,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\na completely different skill set\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nin terms of digital media\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nthan I do and many of the other senior leaders.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nAnd yet, we need to have that shared sense.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nIt also produced something\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nwhich I call an inversion of expertise,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nbecause we had so many changes at the lower levels\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nin technology and tactics and whatnot,\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nthat suddenly the things that we grew up doing\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nwasn't what the force was doing anymore.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nSo how does a leader\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nstay credible and legitimate\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nwhen they haven't done\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nwhat the people you're leading are doing?\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nAnd it's a brand new leadership challenge.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nAnd it forced me to become a lot more transparent,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\na lot more willing to listen,\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:56.958\na lot more willing to be reverse-mentored from lower.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nAnd yet, again, you're not all in one room.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nThen another thing.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nThere's an effect on you and on your leaders.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nThere's an impact, it's cumulative.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nYou don't reset, or recharge your battery every time.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nI stood in front of a screen one night in Iraq\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nwith one of my senior officers\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nand we watched a firefight from one of our forces.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nAnd I remembered his son was in our force.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nAnd I said, \"John, where's your son?

It's extraordinarily powerful.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nIt's probably more powerful than marriage vows.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nAnd they've lived up to it, which gives it special power.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nAnd so the organizational relationship that bonds them\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nis just amazing.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nAnd I learned personal relationships\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nwere more important than ever.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nWe were in a difficult operation in Afghanistan in 2007,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nand an old friend of mine,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nthat I had spent many years\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nat various points of my career with --\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\ngodfather to one of their kids --\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nhe sent me a note, just in an envelope,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nthat had a quote from Sherman to Grant\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nthat said, \"I knew if I ever got in a tight spot,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nthat you would come, if alive.\"\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nAnd having that kind of relationship, for me,\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nturned out to be critical at many points in my career.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nAnd I learned that you have to give that\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nin this environment,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nbecause it's tough.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nThat was my journey.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nI hope it's not over.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nI came to believe\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nthat a leader isn't good because they're right;\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nthey're good because they're willing to learn and to trust.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nThis isn't easy stuff.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nIt's not like that electronic abs machine\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nwhere, 15 minutes a month, you get washboard abs.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nAnd it isn't always fair.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nYou can get knocked down,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nand it hurts\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nand it leaves scars.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nBut if you're a leader,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nthe people you've counted on\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nwill help you up.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nAnd if you're a leader,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nthe people who count on you need you on your feet.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nThank you.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:28.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Everyday compassion at Google", "duration": "848", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/chade_meng_tan_everyday_compassion_at_google", "transcript": "So what does the happiest man in the world look like? He certainly doesn't look like me. He looks like this. His name is Matthieu Ricard. So how do you get to be the happiest man in the world? Well it turns out there is a way to measure happiness in the brain. And you do that by measuring the relative activation of the left prefrontal cortex in the fMRI, versus the right prefrontal cortex. And Matthieu's happiness measure is off the charts. He's by far the happiest man ever measured by science. Which leads us to a question: What was he thinking when he was being measured? Perhaps something very naughty. (Laughter) Actually, he was meditating on compassion. Matthieu's own experience is that compassion is the happiest state ever.Reading about Matthieu was one of the pivotal moments of my life. My dream is to create the conditions for world peace in my lifetime \u2014 and to do that by creating the conditions for inner peace and compassion on a global scale. And learning about Matthieu gave me a new angle to look at my work. Matthieu's brain scan shows that compassion is not a chore. Compassion is something that creates happiness. Compassion is fun. And that mind-blowing insight changes the entire game. Because if compassion was a chore, nobody's going to do it, except maybe the Dalai Lama or something. But if compassion was fun, everybody's going to do it. Therefore, to create the conditions for global compassion, all we have to do is to reframe compassion as something that is fun.But fun is not enough. What if compassion is also profitable? What if compassion is also good for business? Then, every boss, every manager in the world, will want to have compassion \u2014 like this. That would create the conditions for world peace. So, I started paying attention to what compassion looks like in a business setting. Fortunately, I didn't have to look very far. Because what I was looking for was right in front of my eyes \u2014 in Google, my company.I know there are other compassionate companies in the world, but Google is the place I'm familiar with because I've been there for 10 years, so I'll use Google as the case study. Google is a company born of idealism. It's a company that thrives on idealism. And maybe because of that, compassion is organic and widespread company-wide. In Google, expressions of corporate compassion almost always follow the same pattern. It's sort of a funny pattern. It starts with a small group of Googlers taking the initiative to do something. And they don't usually ask for permission; they just go ahead and do it, and then other Googlers join in, and it just gets bigger and bigger. And sometimes it gets big enough to become official. So in other words, it almost always starts from the bottom up.And let me give you some examples. The first example is the largest annual community event \u2014 where Googlers from around the world donate their labor to their local communities \u2014 was initiated and organized by three employees before it became official, because it just became too big. Another example, three Googlers \u2014 a chef, an engineer and, most funny, a massage therapist \u2014 three of them, they learned about a region in India where 200,000 people live without a single medical facility. So what do they do? They just go ahead and start a fundraiser. And they raise enough money to build this hospital \u2014 the first hospital of its kind for 200,000 people. During the Haiti earthquake, a number of engineers and product managers spontaneously came together and stayed overnight to build a tool to allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones. And expressions of compassion are also found in our international offices.In China for example, one mid-level employee initiated the largest social action competition in China, involving more than 1,000 schools in China, working on issues such as education, poverty, health care and the environment. There is so much organic social action all around Google that the company decided to form a social responsibility team just to support these efforts. And this idea, again, came from the grassroots, from two Googlers who wrote their own job descriptions and volunteered themselves for the job. And I found it fascinating that the social responsibility team was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy. It was two persons saying, \"Let's do this,\" and the company said, \"Yes.\" So it turns out that Google is a compassionate company, because Googlers found compassion to be fun.But again, fun is not enough. There are also real business benefits. So what are they? The first benefit of compassion is that it creates highly effective business leaders. What does that mean? There are three components of compassion. There is the affective component, which is, \"I feel for you.\" There is the cognitive component, which is, \"I understand you.\" And there is a motivational component, which is, \"I want to help you.\" So what has this got to do with business leadership? According to a very comprehensive study led by Jim Collins, and documented in the book \"Good to Great,\" it takes a very special kind of leader to bring a company from goodness to greatness. And he calls them \"Level 5 leaders.\" These are leaders who, in addition to being highly capable, possess two important qualities, and they are humility and ambition. These are leaders who are highly ambitious for the greater good. And because they're ambitious for a greater good, they feel no need to inflate their own egos. And they, according to the research, make the best business leaders. And if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion, we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion \u2014 understanding people and empathizing with people \u2014 inhibits, tones down, what I call the excessive self-obsession that's in us, therefore creating the conditions for humility.The motivational component of compassion creates ambition for greater good. In other words, compassion is the way to grow Level 5 leaders. And this is the first compelling business benefit. The second compelling benefit of compassion is that it creates an inspiring workforce. Employees mutually inspire each other towards greater good. It creates a vibrant, energetic community where people admire and respect each other. I mean, you come to work in the morning, and you work with three guys who just up and decide to build a hospital in India. It's like how can you not be inspired by those people \u2014 your own coworkers? So this mutual inspiration promotes collaboration, initiative and creativity. It makes us a highly effective company.So, having said all that, what is the secret formula for brewing compassion in the corporate setting? In our experience, there are three ingredients. The first ingredient is to create a culture of passionate concern for the greater good. So always think: how is your company and your job serving the greater good? Or, how can you further serve the greater good? This awareness of serving the greater good is very self-inspiring and it creates fertile ground for compassion to grow in. That's one.The second ingredient is autonomy. So in Google, there's a lot of autonomy. And one of our most popular managers jokes that, this is what he says, \"Google is a place where the inmates run the asylum.\" And he considers himself one of the inmates. If you already have a culture of compassion and idealism and you let your people roam free, they will do the right thing in the most compassionate way.The third ingredient is to focus on inner development and personal growth. Leadership training in Google, for example, places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities, such as self-awareness, self-mastery, empathy and compassion, because we believe that leadership begins with character. We even created a seven-week curriculum on emotion intelligence, which we jokingly call \"Searching Inside Yourself.\" It's less naughty than it sounds. So I'm an engineer by training, but I'm one of the creators and instructors of this course, which I find kind of funny, because this is a company that trusts an engineer to teach emotion intelligence. What a company.(Laughter)So \"Search Inside Yourself\" \u2014 how does it work? It works in three steps. The first step is attention training. Attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities. Therefore, any curriculum for training emotion intelligence has to begin with attention training. The idea here is to train attention to create a quality of mind that is calm and clear at the same time. And this creates the foundation for emotion intelligence. The second step follows the first step.The second step is developing self-knowledge and self-mastery. So using the supercharged attention from step one, we create a high-resolution perception into the cognitive and emotive processes. What does that mean? It means being able to observe our thought stream and the process of emotion with high clarity, objectivity and from a third-person perspective. And once you can do that, you create the kind of self-knowledge that enables self-mastery.The third step, following the second step, is to create new mental habits. What does that mean? Imagine this. Imagine whenever you meet any other person, any time you meet a person, your habitual, instinctive first thought is, \"I want you to be happy. I want you to be happy.\" Imagine you can do that. Having this habit, this mental habit, changes everything at work. Because this good will is unconsciously picked up by other people, and it creates trust, and trust creates a lot of good working relationships. And this also creates the conditions for compassion in the workplace. Someday, we hope to open-source \"Search Inside Yourself\" so that everybody in the corporate world will at least be able to use it as a reference.And in closing, I want to end the same place I started, with happiness. I want to quote this guy \u2014 the guy in robes, not the other guy \u2014 the Dalai Lama, who said, \"If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion.\" I found this to be true, both on the individual level and at a corporate level. And I hope that compassion will be both fun and profitable for you too.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1113, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 -->

starts with a small group of Googlers\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\ntaking the initiative to do something.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nAnd they don't usually ask for permission;\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nthey just go ahead and do it,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nand then other Googlers join in, and it just gets bigger and bigger.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nAnd sometimes it gets big enough\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nto become official.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nSo in other words,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nit almost always starts from the bottom up.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nAnd let me give you some examples.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nThe first example is the largest annual community event --\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nwhere Googlers from around the world\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\ndonate their labor to their local communities --\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nwas initiated and organized\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nby three employees\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nbefore it became official,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nbecause it just became too big.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nAnother example, three Googlers --\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\na chef, an engineer\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nand, most funny, a massage therapist --\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nthree of them, they learned about a region in India\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nwhere 200,000 people live\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nwithout a single medical facility.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nSo what do they do?\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nThey just go ahead and start a fundraiser.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nAnd they raise enough money to build this hospital --\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nthe first hospital of its kind\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nfor 200,000 people.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nDuring the Haiti earthquake,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\na number of engineers and product managers\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nspontaneously came together\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nand stayed overnight\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nto build a tool\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nto allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nAnd expressions of compassion\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nare also found in our international offices.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nIn China for example,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\none mid-level employee\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:09.958\ninitiated the largest social action competition in China,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\ninvolving more than 1,000 schools in China,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nworking on issues\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nsuch as education, poverty,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nhealth care and the environment.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nThere is so much organic social action\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nall around Google\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nthat the company decided to form\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\na social responsibility team\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\njust to support these efforts.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nAnd this idea, again,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\ncame from the grassroots,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nfrom two Googlers who wrote their own job descriptions\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nand volunteered themselves for the job.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nAnd I found it fascinating\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nthat the social responsibility team\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nwas not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nIt was two persons saying, \"Let's do this,\"\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand the company said, \"Yes.\"\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nSo it turns out\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nthat Google is a compassionate company,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nbecause Googlers found\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\ncompassion to be fun.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nBut again, fun is not enough.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nThere are also real business benefits.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nSo what are they?\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nThe first benefit of compassion\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nis that it creates highly effective business leaders.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nWhat does that mean?\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nThere are three components of compassion.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nThere is the affective component,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nwhich is, \"I feel for you.\"\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nThere is the cognitive component,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nwhich is, \"I understand you.\"\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nAnd there is a motivational component,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nwhich is, \"I want to help you.\"\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nSo what has this got to do with business leadership?\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nAccording to a very comprehensive study\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nled by Jim Collins,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nand documented in the book \"Good to Great,\"\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nit takes a very special kind of leader\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nto bring a company\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nfrom goodness to greatness.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nAnd he calls them \"Level 5 leaders.\"\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nThese are leaders\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nwho, in addition to being highly capable,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\npossess two important qualities,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nand they are\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nhumility and ambition.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nThese are leaders\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nwho are highly ambitious for the greater good.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nAnd because they're ambitious for a greater good,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nthey feel no need to inflate their own egos.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nAnd they, according to the research,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nmake the best business leaders.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nAnd if you look at these qualities\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nin the context of compassion,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nwe find\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nthat the cognitive and affective components of compassion --\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nunderstanding people and empathizing with people --\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\ninhibits, tones down,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nwhat I call the excessive self-obsession that's in us,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\ntherefore creating the conditions\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nfor humility.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nThe motivational component of compassion\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\ncreates ambition for greater good.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nIn other words,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:07.958\ncompassion is the way to grow Level 5 leaders.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nAnd this is the first compelling business benefit.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nThe second compelling benefit of compassion\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nis that it creates an inspiring workforce.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nEmployees mutually inspire each other\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\ntowards greater good.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nIt creates a vibrant, energetic community\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nwhere people admire and respect each other.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nI mean, you come to work in the morning,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nand you work with three guys\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nwho just up and decide to build a hospital in India.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nIt's like how can you not be inspired by those people --\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nyour own coworkers?\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nSo this mutual inspiration\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\npromotes collaboration,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\ninitiative and creativity.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nIt makes us a highly effective company.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nSo, having said all that,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nwhat is the secret formula\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nfor brewing compassion\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nin the corporate setting?\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nIn our experience,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nthere are three ingredients.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nThe first ingredient\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nis to create a culture\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nof passionate concern\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nfor the greater good.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nSo always think:\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nhow is your company and your job\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nserving the greater good?\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nOr, how can you further serve\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nthe greater good?\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nThis awareness of serving the greater good\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nis very self-inspiring\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nand it creates fertile ground\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nfor compassion to grow in.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nThat's one.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nThe second ingredient\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nis autonomy.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nSo in Google, there's a lot of autonomy.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nAnd one of our most popular managers jokes that,\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nthis is what he says,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\n\"Google is a place\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nwhere the inmates run the asylum.\"\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nAnd he considers himself one of the inmates.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nIf you already have\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\na culture of compassion\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nand idealism\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nand you let your people roam free,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nthey will do the right thing\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nin the most compassionate way.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nThe third ingredient\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nis to focus on inner development\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nand personal growth.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nLeadership training in Google, for example,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nplaces a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nsuch as self-awareness, self-mastery,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nempathy and compassion,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nbecause we believe\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nthat leadership begins\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nwith character.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nWe even created a seven-week curriculum\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\non emotion intelligence,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nwhich we jokingly call \"Searching Inside Yourself.\"\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nIt's less naughty than it sounds.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nSo I'm an engineer by training,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nbut I'm one of the creators and instructors of this course,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nwhich I find kind of funny,\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nbecause this is a company that trusts an engineer\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nto teach emotion intelligence.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nWhat a company.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nSo \"Search Inside Yourself\" -- how does it work?\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nIt works in three steps.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nThe first step\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nis attention training.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nAttention is the basis\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nof all higher cognitive and emotional abilities.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nTherefore, any curriculum\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nfor training emotion intelligence\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nhas to begin with attention training.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nThe idea here is to train attention\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nto create a quality of mind\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nthat is calm and clear\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nat the same time.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nAnd this creates the foundation\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nfor emotion intelligence.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nThe second step follows the first step.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nThe second step is developing self-knowledge\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nand self-mastery.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nSo using the supercharged attention from step one,\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nwe create a high-resolution perception\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\ninto the cognitive and emotive processes.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nWhat does that mean?\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nIt means being able to observe our thought stream\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nand the

that mean?

I went to prison \u2014 difficult. I worked in a coal mine \u2014 dangerous. I filmed in war zones \u2014 difficult and dangerous. And I spent 30 days eating nothing but this \u2014 fun in the beginning, little difficult in the middle, very dangerous in the end. In fact, most of my career, I've been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging, that make them interesting, that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience. So when I knew I was coming here to do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship, I knew I would want to do something a little different.So as some of you may or may not have heard, a couple weeks ago, I took out an ad on eBay. I sent out some Facebook messages, some Twitter messages, and I gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my 2011 TED Talk. (Laughter) That's right, some lucky individual, corporation, for-profit or non-profit, was going to get the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity \u2014 because I'm sure Chris Anderson will never let it happen again \u2014 (Laughter) to buy the naming rights to the talk you're watching right now, that at the time didn't have a title, didn't really have a lot of content and didn't really give much hint as to what the subject matter would actually be. So what you were getting was this: Your name here presents: My TED Talk that you have no idea what the subject is and, depending on the content, could ultimately blow up in your face, especially if I make you or your company look stupid for doing it. But that being said, it's a very good media opportunity. (Laughter) You know how many people watch these TED Talks? It's a lot. That's just a working title, by the way. (Laughter) So even with that caveat, I knew that someone would buy the naming rights.Now if you'd have asked me that a year ago, I wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certainty. But in the new project that I'm working on, my new film, we examine the world of marketing, advertising. And as I said earlier, I put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years, but nothing could prepare me, nothing could ready me, for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys. (Laughter) You see, I had this idea for a movie.(Video) Morgan Spurlock: What I want to do is make a film all about product placement, marketing and advertising, where the entire film is funded by product placement, marketing and advertising. So the movie will be called \"The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.\" So what happens in \"The Greatest Movie Ever Sold,\" is that everything from top to bottom, from start to finish, is branded from beginning to end \u2014 from the above-the-title sponsor that you'll see in the movie, which is brand X. Now this brand, the Qualcomm Stadium, the Staples Center ... these people will be married to the film in perpetuity \u2014 forever. And so the film explores this whole idea \u2014 (Michael Kassan: It's redundant.) It's what? (MK: It's redundant.) In perpetuity, forever? I'm a redundant person. (MK: I'm just saying.) That was more for emphasis. It was, \"In perpetuity. Forever.\" But not only are we going to have the brand X title sponsor, but we're going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film. So maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore ... the greatest car you ever drove from \"The Greatest Movie Ever Sold,\" the greatest drink you've ever had, courtesy of \"The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.\"Xavier Kochhar: So the idea is, beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life, but actually get them to finance the film? (MS: Get them to finance the film.)MS: And actually we show the whole process of how does it work. The goal of this whole film is transparency. You're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie. So that's the whole concept, the whole film, start to finish. And I would love for CEG to help make it happen.Robert Friedman: You know it's funny, because when I first hear it, it is the ultimate respect for an audience.Guy: I don't know how receptive people are going to be to it, though.XK: Do you have a perspective \u2014 I don't want to use \"angle\" because that has a negative connotation \u2014 but do you know how this is going to play out? (MS: No idea.)David Cohn: How much money does it take to do this?MS: 1.5 million. (DC: Okay.)John Kamen: I think that you're going to have a hard time meeting with them, but I think it's certainly worth pursuing a couple big, really obvious brands.XK: Who knows, maybe by the time your film comes out, we look like a bunch of blithering idiots.MS: What do you think the response is going to be?Stuart Ruderfer: The responses mostly will be \"no.\"MS: But is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me?JK: Both.MS: ... Meaning not so optimistic. So, sir, can you help me? I need help.MK: I can help you.MS: Okay. (MK: Good.) Awesome.MK: We've gotta figure out which brands.MS: Yeah. (MK: That's the challenge.) When you look at the people you deal with ..MK: We've got some places we can go. (MS: Okay.) Turn the camera off.MS: I thought \"Turn the camera off\" meant, \"Let's have an off-the-record conversation.\" Turns out it really means, \"We want nothing to do with your movie.\"MS: And just like that, one by one, all of these companies suddenly disappeared. None of them wanted anything to do with this movie. I was amazed. They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project. And I was blown away, because I thought the whole concept, the idea of advertising, was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible, to get as many people to see it as possible. Especially in today's world, this intersection of new media and old media and the fractured media landscape, isn't the idea to get that new buzz-worthy delivery vehicle that's going to get that message to the masses? No, that's what I thought.But the problem was, you see, my idea had one fatal flaw, and that flaw was this. Actually no, that was not the flaw whatsoever. That wouldn't have been a problem at all. This would have been fine. But what this image represents was the problem. See, when you do a Google image search for transparency, this is \u2014- (Laughter) (Applause) This is one of the first images that comes up. So I like the way you roll, Sergey Brin. No. (Laughter) This is was the problem: transparency \u2014 free from pretense or deceit; easily detected or seen through; readily understood; characterized by visibility or accessibility of information, especially concerning business practices \u2014 that last line being probably the biggest problem. You see, we hear a lot about transparency these days. Our politicians say it, our president says it, even our CEO's say it. But suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality, something suddenly changes. But why? Well, transparency is scary \u2014 (Roar) like that odd, still-screaming bear. (Laughter) It's unpredictable \u2014 (Music) (Laughter) like this odd country road. And it's also very risky. (Laughter) What else is risky? Eating an entire bowl of Cool Whip. (Laughter) That's very risky.Now when I started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story, and they said, \"No, we want you to tell a story. We want you to tell a story, but we just want to tell our story.\" See, when I was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie \u2014 and there he is giving me the look he often gave me \u2014 he would say, \"Son, there's three sides to every story. There's your story, there's my story and there's the real story.\" Now you see, with this film, we wanted to tell the real story. But with only one company, one agency willing to help me \u2014 and that's only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years \u2014 I realized that I would have to go on my own, I'd have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team. So what you suddenly started to realize \u2014 or what I started to realize \u2014 is that when you started having conversations with these companies, the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.(Video) MS: I have friends who make great big, giant Hollywood films, and I have friends who make little independent films like I make. And the friends of mine who make big, giant Hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have. And then my friends who make small independent films say, \"Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant Hollywood movies?\" And the movie is called \"The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.\" So how specifically will we see Ban in the film? Any time I'm ready to go, any time I open up my medicine cabinet, you will see Ban deodorant. While anytime I do an interview with someone, I can say, \"Are you fresh enough for this interview? Are you ready? You look a little nervous. I want to help you calm down. So maybe you should put some one before the interview.\" So we'll offer one of these fabulous scents. Whether it's a \"Floral Fusion\" or a \"Paradise Winds,\" they'll have their chance. We will have them geared for both male or female \u2014 solid, roll-on or stick, whatever it may be. That's the two-cent tour. So now I can answer any of your questions and give you the five-cent tour.Karen Frank: We are a smaller brand. Much like you talked about being a smaller movie, we're very much a challenger brand. So we don't have the budgets that other brands have. So doing things like this \u2014 you know, remind people about Ban \u2014 is kind of why were interested in it.MS: What are the words that you would use to describe Ban? Ban is blank.KF: That's a great question.(Laughter)Woman: Superior technology.MS: Technology's not the way you want to describe something somebody's putting in their armpit.Man: We talk about bold, fresh. I think \"fresh\" is a great word that really spins this category into the positive, versus \"fights odor and wetness.\" It keeps you fresh. How do we keep you fresher longer \u2014 better freshness, more freshness, three times fresher. Things like that that are more of that positive benefit.MS: And that's a multi-million dollar corporation. What about me? What about a regular guy? I need to go talk to the man on the street, the people who are like me, the regular Joes. They need to tell me about my brand.(Video) MS: How would you guys describe your brand?Man: Um, my brand? I don't know. I like really nice clothes.Woman: 80's revival meets skater-punk, unless it's laundry day.MS: All right, what is brand Gerry?Gerry: Unique. (MS: Unique.)Man: I guess what kind of genre, style I am would be like dark glamor. I like a lot of black colors, a lot of grays and stuff like that. But usually I have an accessory, like sunglasses, or I like crystal and things like that too.Woman: If Dan were a brand, he might be a classic convertible Mercedes Benz.Man 2: The brand that I am is, I would call it casual fly.Woman 2: Part hippie, part yogi, part Brooklyn girl \u2014 I don't know.Man 3: I'm the pet guy. I sell pet toys all over the country, all over the world. So I guess that's my brand. In my warped little industry, that's my brand.Man 4: My brand is FedEx because I deliver the goods.Man 5: Failed writer-alcoholic brand. Is that something?Lawyer: I'm a lawyer brand.Tom: I'm Tom.MS: Well we can't all be brand Tom, but I do often find myself at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly.(Laughter)And what I realized is I needed an expert. I needed somebody who could get inside my head, somebody who could really help me understand what they call your \"brand personality.\" And so I found a company called Olson Zaltman in Pittsburg. They've helped companies like Nestle, Febreze, Hallmark discover that brand personality. If they could do it for them, surely they could do it for me.(Video) Abigail: You brought your pictures, right?MS: I did. The very first picture is a picture of my family.A: So tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are.MS: These are the people who shape the way I look at the world.A: Tell me about this world.MS: This world? I think your world is the world that you live in \u2014 like people who are around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the job you do. All those things stemmed and started from one place, and for me they stemmed and started with my family in West Virginia.A: What's the next one you want to talk about?MS: The next one: This was the best day ever.A: How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are?MS: It's like, who do I want to be? I like things that are different. I like things that are weird. I like weird things.A: Tell me about the \"why\" phase \u2014 what does that do for us? What is the machete? What pupa stage are you in now? Why is it important to reboot? What does the red represent? Tell me a little bit about that part. ... A little more about you that is not who you are. What are some other metamorphoses that you've had? ... Doesn't have to be fear. What kind of roller coaster are you on?MS: EEEEEE! (A: Thank you.) No, thank you.A: Thanks for you patience. (MS: Great job.)A: Yeah. (MS: Thanks a lot.) All right.MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come of this. There was a whole lot of crazy going on in there.Lindsay Zaltman: The first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distinct, but complementary sides to your brand personality \u2014 the Morgan Spurlock brand is a mindful/play brand. Those are juxtaposed very nicely together. And I think there's almost a paradox with those. And I think some companies will just focus on one of their strengths or the other instead of focusing on both. Most companies tend to \u2014 and it's human nature \u2014 to avoid things that they're not sure of, avoid fear, those elements, and you really embrace those, and you actually turn them into positives for you, and it's a neat thing to see. What other brands are like that? The first on here is the classic, Apple. And you can see here too, Target, Wii, Mini from the Mini Coopers, and JetBlue. Now there's playful brands and mindful brands, those things that have come and gone, but a playful, mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing.MS: A playful, mindful brand. What is your brand? If somebody asked you to describe your brand identity, your brand personality, what would you be? Are you an up attribute? Are you something that gets the blood flowing? Or are you more of a down attribute? Are you something that's a little more calm, reserved, conservative? Up attributes are things like being playful, being fresh like the Fresh Prince, contemporary, adventurous, edgy or daring like Errol Flynn, nimble or agile, profane, domineering, magical or mystical like Gandalf. Or are you more of a down attribute? Are you mindful, sophisticated like 007? Are you established, traditional, nurturing, protective, empathetic like the Oprah? Are you reliable, stable, familiar, safe, secure, sacred, contemplative or wise like the Dalai Lama or Yoda?Over the course of this film, we had 500-plus companies who were up and down companies saying, \"no,\" they didn't want any part of this project. They wanted nothing to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control, they would have no control over the final product. But we did get 17 brand partners who were willing to relinquish that control, who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and as playful as myself and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn't be able to tell \u2014 stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind.They enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing, as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they're using MRI's to target the desire centers of your brain for both commercials as well as movie marketing. We went to San Paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising. In the entire city for the past five years, there's no billboards, there's no posters, there's no flyers, nothing. (Applause) And we went to school districts where now companies are making their way into cash-strapped schools all across America. What's incredible for me is the projects that I've gotten the most feedback out of, or I've had the most success in, are ones where I've interacted with things directly.And that's what these brands did. They cut out the middleman, they cut out their agencies and said, \"Maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind. I'm going to deal directly with the artist. I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to get people thinking, that's going to challenge the way we look at the world.\"And how has that been for them? Has it been successful? Well, since the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, let's take a look. According to Burrelles, the movie premiered in January, and since then \u2014 and this isn't even the whole thing \u2014 we've had 900 million media impressions for this film. That's literally covering just like a two and a half-week period. That's only online \u2014 no print, no TV. The film hasn't even been distributed yet. It's not even online. It's not even streaming. It's not even been out into other foreign countries yet. So ultimately, this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum. And not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advised their clients not to take part.What I always believe is that if you take chances, if you take risks, that in those risks will come opportunity. I believe that when you push people away from that, you're pushing them more towards failure. I believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse, then you're preparing your whole company to be reward challenged. I feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks. We need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare them. Ultimately, moving forward, I think we have to embrace fear. We've got to put that bear in a cage. (Laughter) Embrace fear. Embrace risk. One big spoonful at a time, we have to embrace risk.And ultimately, we have to embrace transparency. Today, more than ever, a little honesty is going to go a long way. And that being said, through honesty and transparency, my entire talk, \"Embrace Transparency,\" has been brought to you by my good friends at EMC, who for $7,100 bought the naming rights on eBay. (Applause) EMC: Turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world. EMC presents: \"Embrace Transparency.\"Thank you very much, guys.(Applause)June Cohen: So, Morgan, in the name of transparency, what exactly happened to that $7,100? MS: That is a fantastic question. I have in my pocket a check made out to the parent organization to the TED organization, the Sapling Foundation \u2014 a check for $7,100 to be applied toward my attendance for next year's TED.(Laughter)(Applause)", "id": 1114, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nI have spent the past few years\n\n00:00:14.958 -->

--> 00:01:43.958\nto the talk you're watching right now,\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nthat at the time didn't have a title, didn't really have a lot of content\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nand didn't really give much hint\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nas to what the subject matter would actually be.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nSo what you were getting was this:\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nYour name here presents:\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nMy TED Talk that you have no idea what the subject is\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nand, depending on the content, could ultimately blow up in your face,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nespecially if I make you or your company look stupid for doing it.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nBut that being said,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nit's a very good media opportunity.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nYou know how many people watch these TED Talks?\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nIt's a lot.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nThat's just a working title, by the way.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nSo even with that caveat,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nI knew that someone would buy the naming rights.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nNow if you'd have asked me that a year ago,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nI wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certainty.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nBut in the new project that I'm working on, my new film,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nwe examine the world of marketing, advertising.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nAnd as I said earlier,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nI put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years,\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nbut nothing could prepare me, nothing could ready me,\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nfor anything as difficult\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nor as dangerous\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nas going into the rooms with these guys.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nYou see, I had this idea for a movie.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\n(Video) Morgan Spurlock: What I want to do is make a film\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nall about product placement, marketing and advertising,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nwhere the entire film is funded\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nby product placement, marketing and advertising.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nSo the movie will be called \"The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.\"\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nSo what happens in \"The Greatest Movie Ever Sold,\"\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nis that everything from top to bottom, from start to finish,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nis branded from beginning to end --\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nfrom the above-the-title sponsor that you'll see in the movie,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nwhich is brand X.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nNow this brand, the Qualcomm Stadium,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nthe Staples Center ...\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nthese people will be married to the film in perpetuity -- forever.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nAnd so the film explores this whole idea -- (Michael Kassan: It's redundant.)\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nIt's what? (MK: It's redundant.) In perpetuity, forever?\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nI'm a redundant person. (MK: I'm just saying.)\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nThat was more for emphasis.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nIt was, \"In perpetuity. Forever.\"\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nBut not only are we going to have the brand X title sponsor,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nbut we're going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nSo maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore ...\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nthe greatest car you ever drove from \"The Greatest Movie Ever Sold,\"\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthe greatest drink you've ever had, courtesy of \"The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.\"\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nXavier Kochhar: So the idea is,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nbeyond just showing that brands are a part of your life,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nbut actually get them to finance the film? (MS: Get them to finance the film.)\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nMS: And actually we show the whole process of how does it work.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nThe goal of this whole film is transparency.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nYou're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nSo that's the whole concept,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nthe whole film, start to finish.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nAnd I would love for CEG to help make it happen.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nRobert Friedman: You know it's funny,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nbecause when I first hear it,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nit is the ultimate respect\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nfor an audience.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nGuy: I don't know how receptive\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\npeople are going to be to it, though.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nXK: Do you have a perspective --\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nI don't want to use \"angle\" because that has a negative connotation --\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nbut do you know how this is going to play out? (MS: No idea.)\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nDavid Cohn: How much money does it take to do this?\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nMS: 1.5 million. (DC: Okay.)\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nJohn Kamen: I think that you're going to have a hard time meeting with them,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nbut I think it's certainly worth pursuing\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\na couple big, really obvious brands.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nXK: Who knows, maybe by the time your film comes out,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nwe look like a bunch of blithering idiots.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nMS: What do you think the response is going to be?\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nStuart Ruderfer: The responses mostly will be \"no.\"\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nMS: But is it a tough sell because of the film\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nor a tough sell because of me?\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nJK: Both.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nMS: ... Meaning not so optimistic.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nSo, sir, can you help me? I need help.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nMK: I can help you.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nMS: Okay. (MK: Good.)\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nAwesome.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nMK: We've gotta figure out which brands.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nMS: Yeah. (MK: That's the challenge.)\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nWhen you look at the people you deal with ..\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nMK: We've got some places we can go. (MS: Okay.)\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nTurn the camera off.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nMS: I thought \"Turn the camera off\"\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nmeant, \"Let's have an off-the-record conversation.\"\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nTurns out it really means,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\n\"We want nothing to do with your movie.\"\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nMS: And just like that, one by one,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nall of these companies suddenly disappeared.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nNone of them wanted anything to do with this movie.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nI was amazed.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nThey wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAnd I was blown away, because I thought the whole concept, the idea of advertising,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nwas to get your product out in front of as many people as possible,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nto get as many people to see it as possible.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nEspecially in today's world,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nthis intersection of new media and old media\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nand the fractured media landscape,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nisn't the idea to get\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nthat new buzz-worthy delivery vehicle\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nthat's going to get that message to the masses?\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nNo, that's what I thought.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nBut the problem was, you see,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nmy idea had one fatal flaw,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nand that flaw was this.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nActually no, that was not the flaw whatsoever.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nThat wouldn't have been a problem at all.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nThis would have been fine.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nBut what this image represents was the problem.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nSee, when you do a Google image search for transparency,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nthis is ---\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nThis is one of the first images that comes up.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nSo I like the way you roll, Sergey Brin.

Are you something that gets the blood flowing?\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nOr are you more of a down attribute?\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nAre you something that's a little more calm, reserved, conservative?\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nUp attributes are things like being playful,\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nbeing fresh like the Fresh Prince,\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\ncontemporary, adventurous,\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nedgy or daring like Errol Flynn,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nnimble or agile, profane, domineering,\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nmagical or mystical like Gandalf.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nOr are you more of a down attribute?\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nAre you mindful, sophisticated like 007?\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nAre you established, traditional, nurturing, protective,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nempathetic like the Oprah?\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nAre you reliable, stable, familiar,\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nsafe, secure, sacred,\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\ncontemplative or wise\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nlike the Dalai Lama or Yoda?\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nOver the course of this film,\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nwe had 500-plus companies\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nwho were up and down companies\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nsaying, \"no,\" they didn't want any part of this project.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nThey wanted nothing to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control,\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nthey would have no control over the final product.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nBut we did get 17 brand partners\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nwho were willing to relinquish that control,\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nwho wanted to be in business\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nwith someone as mindful and as playful as myself\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nand who ultimately empowered us to tell stories\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nthat normally we wouldn't be able to tell --\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nstories that an advertiser would normally never get behind.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nThey enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing,\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nas we got into telling the story in this film\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nabout how now they're using MRI's\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nto target the desire centers of your brain\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nfor both commercials as well as movie marketing.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nWe went to San Paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nIn the entire city for the past five years,\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nthere's no billboards, there's no posters, there's no flyers, nothing.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nAnd we went to school districts\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nwhere now companies are making their way\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\ninto cash-strapped schools all across America.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nWhat's incredible for me is the projects that I've gotten the most feedback out of,\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nor I've had the most success in,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nare ones where I've interacted with things directly.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nAnd that's what these brands did.\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nThey cut out the middleman, they cut out their agencies\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nand said, \"Maybe these agencies\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\ndon't have my best interest in mind.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nI'm going to deal directly with the artist.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nI'm going to work with him to create something different,\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nsomething that's going to get people thinking,\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nthat's going to challenge the way we look at the world.\"\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nAnd how has that been for them? Has it been successful?\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nWell, since the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, let's take a look.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nAccording to Burrelles, the movie premiered in January,\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nand since then -- and this isn't even the whole thing --\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nwe've had 900 million media impressions for this film.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nThat's literally covering just like a two and a half-week period.\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nThat's only online -- no print, no TV.\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nThe film hasn't even been distributed yet.\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nIt's not even online. It's not even streaming.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nIt's not even been out into other foreign countries yet.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nSo ultimately,\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nthis film has already started to gain a lot of momentum.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nAnd not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nadvised their clients not to take part.\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nWhat I always believe\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nis that if you take chances, if you take risks,\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nthat in those risks will come opportunity.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nI believe that when you push people away from that,\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nyou're pushing them more towards failure.\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nI believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse,\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nthen you're preparing your whole company\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nto be reward challenged.\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nI feel like that what has to happen moving forward\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:30.958\nis we need to encourage people to take risks.\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nWe need to encourage people to not be afraid\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nof opportunities that may scare them.\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nUltimately, moving forward,\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nI think we have to embrace fear.\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nWe've got to put that bear in a cage.\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nEmbrace fear. Embrace risk.\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nOne big spoonful at a time, we have to embrace risk.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nAnd ultimately, we have to embrace transparency.\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nToday, more than ever,\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:01.958\na little honesty is going to go a long way.\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nAnd that being said, through honesty and transparency,\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nmy entire talk, \"Embrace Transparency,\"\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nhas been brought to you\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:12.958\nby my good friends at EMC,\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nwho for $7,100\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nbought the naming rights on eBay.\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:25.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nEMC: Turning big data\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:30.958\ninto big opportunity\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nfor organizations all over the world.\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nEMC presents: \"Embrace Transparency.\"\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nThank you very much, guys.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:50.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nJune Cohen: So, Morgan,\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nin the name of transparency,\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nwhat exactly happened to that $7,100?\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nMS: That is a fantastic question.\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:03.958\nI have in my pocket a check\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nmade out to the parent organization to the TED organization,\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nthe Sapling Foundation --\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.958\na check for $7,100\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:12.958\nto be applied toward my attendance for next year's TED.\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:17.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The invention that unlocked a locked-in artist", "duration": "469", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/mick_ebeling_the_invention_that_unlocked_a_locked_in_artist", "transcript": "I have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects. But the coolest I ever worked on was around this guy. This guy's name is TEMPT. TEMPT was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s. And he came up home from a run one day and said, \"Dad, my legs are tingling.\" And that was the onset of ALS. So TEMPT is now completely paralyzed. He only has use of his eyes.I was exposed to him. I have a company that does design and animation, so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part of what we admire and respect in the art world. And so we decided that we were going to sponsor Tony, TEMPT, and his cause. So I went and met with his brother and father and said, \"We're going to give you this money. What are you going to do with it?\" And his brother said, \"I just want to be able to talk to Tony again. I just want to be able to communicate with him and him to be able to communicate with me.\" And I said, \"Wait a second, isn't that \u2014 I've seen Stephen Hawking \u2014 don't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate via these devices?\" And he said, \"No, unless you're in the upper echelon and you've got really amazing insurance, you can't actually do that. These devices aren't accessible to people.\" And I said, \"Well, how do you actually communicate?\" Has everyone seen the movie \"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly?\" That's how they communicate \u2014 so run their finger along. I said, \"That's archaic. How can that be?\"So I showed up with the desire to just write a check, and instead, I wrote a check that I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash. I committed to his brother and his father right then and there \u2014 I'm like, \"All right, here's the deal: Tony's going to speak, we're going to get him a machine, and we're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again. Because it's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn't able to communicate it.\"So I spoke at a conference a couple months after that. I met these guys called GRL, Graffiti Research Lab, and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then, with a laser pointer, draw on it, and it just registers the negative space. So they go around and do art installations like this. All the things that go up there, they said there's a life cycle. First it starts with the sexual organs, then it starts with cuss words, then it was Bush slanders and then people actually got to art. But there was always a life cycle to their presentations. So I went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this, and we were like, \"Well wait a second. If we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things, why don't we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser and he could do graf again? Well that would be awesome.\"So that started the journey. And about two years later, about a year later, after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around, we'd accomplished a couple things. One, we battered down the doors of the insurance companies, and we actually got TEMPT a machine that let him communicate \u2014 a Stephen Hawking machine. (Applause) Which was awesome. And he's seriously one of the funniest \u2014 I call him Yoda, because you talk to the guy, you get an email from him, and you're like, \"I'm not worthy. This guy's so amazing.\"The other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world \u2014 literally every corner of the world \u2014 into our house. My wife and kids and I moved to our back garage, and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house. A lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls. But for over two weeks, we programmed, we went to the Venice boardwalk, my kids got involved, my dog got involved, and we created this.This is called the EyeWriter, and you can see the description. This is a cheap pair of sunglasses that we bought at the Venice Beach boardwalk, some copper wire and some stuff from Home Depot and Radio Shack. We took a PS3 camera, hacked it open, mounted it to an LED light, and now there's a device that is free \u2014 you build this yourself, we publish the code for free, you download the software for free. And now we've created a device that has absolutely no limitations. There's no insurance company that can say \"No.\" There's no hospital that can say \"No.\" Anybody who's paralyzed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes.(Applause)Thank you. Thank you guys very much. That was awesome.So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to TEMPT's room. I love this picture, because this is someone else's room and that's his room. So there's all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling. And after over a year of planning, two weeks of programming, carb-fest and all-night sessions, Tony drew again for the first time in seven years. And this is an amazing picture, because this is his life support system, and he's looking over his life support system. We kicked his bed so that he could see out. And we set up a projector on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital. And he drew again for the first time, in front of his family and friends \u2014 and you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was. The funny thing was, we had to break into the parking lot too, so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too.(Laughter)So at the end of this, he sent us an email, and this is what the email said: \"That was the first time I've drawn anything for seven years. I feel like I had been held underwater, and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so I could breathe.\" Isn't that awesome?(Applause)So that's kind of our battle cry. That's what keeps us going and keeps us developing. And we've got such a long way to go with this. This is an amazing device, but it's the equivalent of an Etch A Sketch. And someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more. So we're in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better, faster, stronger.Since that time, we've had all kinds of acknowledgment. We've won a bunch of awards. Remember, it's free; none of us are making any money on this thing. It's all coming out of our own pockets. So the awards were like, \"Oh, this is fantastic.\" Armstrong Twittered about us, and then in December, Time magazine honored us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, which was really cool.(Applause)The coolest thing about this \u2014 and this is what's completing the whole circle \u2014 is that in April of this year, at the Geffen MOCA in downtown Los Angeles, there's going to be an exhibition called \"Art of the Streets.\" And \"Art of the Streets\" is going to have pretty much the bad-asses of the street art scene \u2014 Banksy, Shepard Fairey, KAWS \u2014 all of these guys will be there. TEMPT's going to be in the show, which is pretty awesome.(Applause)So basically this is my point: If you see something that's not possible, make it possible. Everything in this room wasn't possible \u2014 this stage, this computer, this mic, the EyeWriter \u2014 wasn't possible at one point. Make it possible, everyone in this room. I'm not a programmer, never done anything with ocular recognition technology, but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen. And this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done: if not now, then when?

And on my seventeenth birthday, my parents, knowing how much I loved speed, gave me one driving lesson for my seventeenth birthday.

Because big sisters are always supposed to support their little sisters. And my little sister wanted to be a pilot \u2014 God help her. So I used to get my eyes tested just for fun. And on my seventeenth birthday, after my fake eye exam, the eye specialist just noticed it happened to be my birthday. And he said, \"So what are you going to do to celebrate?\" And I took that driving lesson, and I said, \"I'm going to learn how to drive.\" And then there was a silence \u2014 one of those awful silences when you know something's wrong. And he turned to my mother, and he said, \"You haven't told her yet?\" On my seventeenth birthday, as Janis Ian would best say, I learned the truth at 17. I am, and have been since birth, legally blind.And you know, how on earth did I get to 17 and not know that? Well, if anybody says country music isn't powerful, let me tell you this: I got there because my father's passion for Johnny Cash and a song, \"A Boy Named Sue.\" I'm the eldest of three. I was born in 1971. And very shortly after my birth, my parents found out I had a condition called ocular albinism. And what the hell does that mean to you? So let me just tell you, the great part of all of this? I can't see this clock and I can't see the timing, so holy God, woohoo! (Laughter) I might buy some more time. But more importantly, let me tell you \u2014 I'm going to come up really close here. Don't freak out, Pat. Hey. See this hand? Beyond this hand is a world of Vaseline. Every man in this room, even you, Steve, is George Clooney. (Laughter) And every woman, you are so beautiful. And when I want to look beautiful, I step three feet away from the mirror, and I don't have to see these lines etched in my face from all the squinting I've done all my life from all the dark lights.The really strange part is that, at three and a half, just before I was going to school, my parents made a bizarre, unusual and incredibly brave decision. No special needs schools. No labels. No limitations. My ability and my potential. And they decided to tell me that I could see. So just like Johnny Cash's Sue, a boy given a girl's name, I would grow up and learn from experience how to be tough and how to survive, when they were no longer there to protect me, or just take it all away. But more significantly, they gave me the ability to believe, totally, to believe that I could. And so when I heard that eye specialist tell me all the things, a big fat \"no,\" everybody imagines I was devastated. And don't get me wrong, because when I first heard it \u2014 aside from the fact that I thought he was insane \u2014 I got that thump in my chest, just that \"huh?\" But very quickly I recovered. It was like that. The first thing I thought about was my mom, who was crying over beside me. And I swear to God, I walked out of his office, \"I will drive. I will drive. You're mad. I'll drive. I know I can drive.\"And with the same dogged determination that my father had bred into me since I was such a child \u2014 he taught me how to sail, knowing I could never see where I was going, I could never see the shore, and I couldn't see the sails, and I couldn't see the destination. But he told me to believe and feel the wind in my face. And that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad and I would drive. And for the next 11 years, I swore nobody would ever find out that I couldn't see, because I didn't want to be a failure, and I didn't want to be weak. And I believed I could do it. So I rammed through life as only a Casey can do. And I was an archeologist, and then I broke things. And then I managed a restaurant, and then I slipped on things. And then I was a masseuse. And then I was a landscape gardener. And then I went to business school. And you know, disabled people are hugely educated. And then I went in and I got a global consulting job with Accenture. And they didn't even know. And it's extraordinary how far belief can take you.In 1999, two and a half years into that job, something happened. Wonderfully, my eyes decided, enough. And temporarily, very unexpectedly, they dropped. And I'm in one of the most competitive environments in the world, where you work hard, play hard, you gotta be the best, you gotta be the best. And two years in, I really could see very little. And I found myself in front of an HR manager in 1999, saying something I never imagined that I would say. I was 28 years old. I had built a persona all around what I could and couldn't do. And I simply said, \"I'm sorry. I can't see, and I need help.\" Asking for help can be incredibly difficult. And you all know what it is. You don't need to have a disability to know that. We all know how hard it is to admit weakness and failure. And it's frightening, isn't it? But all that belief had fueled me so long.And can I tell you, operating in the sighted world when you can't see, it's kind of difficult \u2014 it really is. Can I tell you, airports are a disaster. Oh, for the love of God. And please, any designers out there? OK, designers, please put up your hands, even though I can't even see you. I always end up in the gents' toilets. And there's nothing wrong with my sense of smell. But can I just tell you, the little sign for a gents' toilet or a ladies' toilet is determined by a triangle. Have you ever tried to see that if you have Vaseline in front of your eyes? It's such a small thing, right? And you know how exhausting it can be to try to be perfect when you're not, or to be somebody that you aren't?And so after admitting I couldn't see to HR, they sent me off to an eye specialist. And I had no idea that this man was going to change my life. But before I got to him, I was so lost. I had no idea who I was anymore. And that eye specialist, he didn't bother testing my eyes. God no, it was therapy. And he asked me several questions, of which many were, \"Why? Why are you fighting so hard not to be yourself? And do you love what you do, Caroline?\" And you know, when you go to a global consulting firm, they put a chip in your head, and you're like, \"I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture.\" (Laughter) To leave would be failure. And he said, \"Do you love it?\" I couldn't even speak I was so choked up. I just was so \u2014 how do I tell him? And then he said to me, \"What did you want to be when you were little?\" Now listen, I wasn't going to say to him, \"Well, I wanted to race cars and motorbikes.\" Hardly appropriate at this moment in time. He thought I was mad enough anyway. And as I left his office, he called me back and he said, \"I think it's time. I think it's time to stop fighting and do something different.\" And that door closed. And that silence just outside a doctor's office, that many of us know. And my chest ached. And I had no idea where I was going. I had no idea. But I did know the game was up.And I went home, and, because the pain in my chest ached so much, I thought, \"I'll go out for a run.\" Really not a very sensible thing to do. And I went on a run that I know so well. I know this run so well, by the back of my hand. I always run it perfectly fine. I count the steps and the lampposts and all those things that visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with. And there was a rock that I always missed. And I'd never fallen on it, never. And there I was crying away, and smash, bash on my rock. Broken, fallen over on this rock in the middle of March in 2000, typical Irish weather on a Wednesday \u2014 gray, snot, tears everywhere, ridiculously self-pitying.And I was floored, and I was broken, and I was angry. And I didn't know what to do. And I sat there for quite some time going, \"How am I going to get off this rock and go home? Because who am I going to be? What am I going to be?\" And I thought about my dad, and I thought, \"Good God, I'm so not Sue now.\" And I kept thinking over and over in my mind, what had happened? Where did it go wrong? Why didn't I understand? And you know, the extraordinary part of it is I just simply had no answers. I had lost my belief. Look where my belief had brought me to. And now I had lost it. And now I really couldn't see. I was crumpled. And then I remember thinking about that eye specialist asking me, \"What do you want to be? What do you want to be? What did you want to be when you were little? Do you love what you do? Do something different. What do you want to be? Do something different. What do you want to be?\" And really slowly, slowly, slowly, it happened. And it did happen this way. And then the minute it came, it blew up in my head and bashed in my heart \u2014 something different. \"Well, how about Mowgli from 'The Jungle Book'? You don't get more different than that.\" And the moment, and I mean the moment, the moment that hit me, I swear to God, it was like woo hoo! You know \u2014 something to believe in. And nobody can tell me no. Yes, you can say I can't be an archeologist. But you can't tell me, no, I can't be Mowgli, because guess what? Nobody's ever done it before, so I'm going to go do it. And it doesn't matter whether I'm a boy or a girl, I'm just going to scoot.And so I got off that rock, and, oh my God, did I run home. And I sprinted home, and I didn't fall, and I didn't crash. And I ran up the stairs, and there was one of my favorite books of all time, \"Travels on My Elephant\" by Mark Shand \u2014 I don't know if any of you know it. And I grabbed this book off, and I'm sitting on the couch going, \"I know what I'm going to do. I know how to be Mowgli. I'm going to go across India on the back of an elephant. I'm going to be an elephant handler.\" And I had no idea how I was going to be an elephant handler. From global management consultant to elephant handler. I had no idea how. I had no idea how you hire an elephant, get an elephant. I didn't speak Hindi. I'd never been to India. Hadn't a clue. But I knew I would. Because, when you make a decision at the right time and the right place, God, that universe makes it happen for you.Nine months later, after that day on snot rock, I had the only blind date in my life with a seven and a half foot elephant called Kanchi. And together we would trek a thousand kilometers across India. (Applause) The most powerful thing of all, it's not that I didn't achieve before then. Oh my God, I did. But you know, I was believing in the wrong thing. Because I wasn't believing in me, really me, all the bits of me \u2014 all the bits of all of us. Do you know how much of us all pretend to be somebody we're not? And you know what, when you really believe in yourself and everything about you, it's extraordinary what happens.And you know what, that trip, that thousand kilometers, it raised enough money for 6,000 cataract eye operations. Six thousand people got to see because of that. When I came home off that elephant, do you know what the most amazing part was? I chucked in my job at Accenture. I left, and I became a social entrepreneur, and I set up an organization with Mark Shand called Elephant Family, which deals with Asian elephant conservation. And I set up Kanchi, because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant, because disability is like the elephant in the room. And I wanted to make you see it in a positive way \u2014 no charity, no pity. But I wanted to work only and truly with business and media leadership to totally reframe disability in a way that was exciting and possible. It was extraordinary. That's what I wanted to do. And I never thought about noes anymore, or not seeing, or any of that kind of nothing. It just seemed that it was possible.And you know, the oddest part is, when I was on my way traveling here to TED, I'll be honest, I was petrified. And I speak, but this is an amazing audience, and what am I doing here? But as I was traveling here, you'll be very happy to know, I did use my white symbol stick cane, because it's really good to skip queues in the airport. And I got my way here being happily proud that I couldn't see. And the one thing is that a really good friend of mine, he texted me on the way over, knowing I was scared. Even though I present confident, I was scared. He said, \"Be you.\" And so here I am. This is me, all of me.(Applause)And I have learned, you know what, cars and motorbikes and elephants, that's not freedom. Being absolutely true to yourself is freedom. And I never needed eyes to see \u2014 never. I simply needed vision and belief. And if you truly believe \u2014 and I mean believe from the bottom of your heart \u2014 you can make change happen. And we need to make it happen, because every single one of us \u2014 woman, man, gay, straight, disabled, perfect, normal, whatever \u2014 everyone of us must be the very best of ourselves. I no longer want anybody to be invisible. We all have to be included. And stop with the labels, the limiting. Losing of labels, because we are not jam jars. We are extraordinary, different, wonderful people.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1116, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nCan any of you\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nremember what you wanted to be\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nwhen you were 17?\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nDo you know what I wanted to be?\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nI wanted to be a biker chick.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nI wanted to race cars,\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nand I wanted to be a cowgirl,\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nand I wanted to be Mowgli from \"The Jungle Book.\"\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nBecause they were all about being free,\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nthe wind in your hair -- just to be free.\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nAnd on my seventeenth birthday,\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nmy parents, knowing how much I loved speed,\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\ngave me one driving lesson\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nfor my seventeenth birthday.\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nNot that we could have afforded I drive,\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nbut to give me the dream of driving.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nAnd on my seventeenth birthday,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nI accompanied my little sister\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nin complete innocence,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nas I always had all my life --\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nmy visually impaired sister --\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nto go to see an eye specialist.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nBecause big sisters\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nare always supposed to support their little sisters.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nAnd my little sister wanted to be a pilot --\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nGod help her.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nSo I used to get my eyes tested\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\njust for fun.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nAnd on my seventeenth birthday,\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nafter my fake eye exam,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nthe eye specialist just noticed it happened to be my birthday.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nAnd he said, \"So what are you going to do to celebrate?\"\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nAnd I took that driving lesson,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nand I said, \"I'm going to learn how to drive.\"\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nAnd then there was a silence --\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\none of those awful silences\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nwhen you know something's wrong.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nAnd he turned to my mother,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nand he said, \"You haven't told her yet?\"\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nOn my seventeenth birthday,\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nas Janis Ian would best say,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nI learned the truth at 17.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nI am, and have been since birth,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nlegally blind.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nAnd you know,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nhow on earth did I get to 17\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nand not know that?\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nWell, if anybody says country music isn't powerful,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nlet me tell you this:\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nI got there\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nbecause my father's passion for Johnny Cash\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nand a song, \"A Boy Named Sue.\"\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nI'm the eldest of three.

we're not?\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nAnd you know what, when you really believe in yourself and everything about you,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nit's extraordinary what happens.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nAnd you know what, that trip, that thousand kilometers,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nit raised enough money for 6,000 cataract eye operations.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nSix thousand people got to see because of that.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nWhen I came home off that elephant,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\ndo you know what the most amazing part was?\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nI chucked in my job at Accenture.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nI left, and I became a social entrepreneur,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nand I set up an organization with Mark Shand called Elephant Family,\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nwhich deals with Asian elephant conservation.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nAnd I set up Kanchi,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nbecause my organization was always going to be named after my elephant,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nbecause disability is like the elephant in the room.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nAnd I wanted to make you see it in a positive way --\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nno charity, no pity.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nBut I wanted to work only and truly\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nwith business and media leadership\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nto totally reframe disability\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nin a way that was exciting and possible.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nIt was extraordinary.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nThat's what I wanted to do.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nAnd I never thought about noes anymore, or not seeing,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nor any of that kind of nothing.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nIt just seemed that it was possible.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nAnd you know, the oddest part is,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nwhen I was on my way traveling here to TED,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nI'll be honest, I was petrified.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nAnd I speak,\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nbut this is an amazing audience,\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nand what am I doing here?\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nBut as I was traveling here,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nyou'll be very happy to know,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nI did use my white symbol stick cane,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nbecause it's really good to skip queues in the airport.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nAnd I got my way here\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nbeing happily proud that I couldn't see.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nAnd the one thing is that a really good friend of mine,\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nhe texted me on the way over, knowing I was scared.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nEven though I present confident, I was scared.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nHe said, \"Be you.\"\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nAnd so here I am.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nThis is me, all of me.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:15.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nAnd I have learned, you know what,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\ncars and motorbikes and elephants,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nthat's not freedom.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nBeing absolutely true to yourself is freedom.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nAnd I never needed eyes to see -- never.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nI simply needed vision and belief.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nAnd if you truly believe --\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nand I mean believe from the bottom of your heart --\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nyou can make change happen.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nAnd we need to make it happen,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nbecause every single one of us --\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nwoman, man, gay, straight,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\ndisabled, perfect,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nnormal, whatever --\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\neveryone of us\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nmust be the very best of ourselves.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nI no longer want anybody to be invisible.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nWe all have to be included.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nAnd stop with the labels, the limiting.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nLosing of labels,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nbecause we are not jam jars.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nWe are extraordinary, different, wonderful people.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nThank you.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:23.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A song inspired by the ocean", "duration": "266", "url":

{"title": "The history of our world in 18 minutes", "duration": "1060", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_christian_big_history", "transcript": "First, a video. Yes, it is a scrambled egg. But as you look at it, I hope you'll begin to feel just slightly uneasy. Because you may notice that what's actually happening is that the egg is unscrambling itself. And you'll now see the yolk and the white have separated. And now they're going to be poured back into the egg. And we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works. A scrambled egg is mush \u2014 tasty mush \u2014 but it's mush. An egg is a beautiful, sophisticated thing that can create even more sophisticated things, such as chickens. And we know in our heart of hearts that the universe does not travel from mush to complexity. In fact, this gut instinct is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics, the second law of thermodynamics, or the law of entropy. What that says basically is that the general tendency of the universe is to move from order and structure to lack of order, lack of structure \u2014 in fact, to mush. And that's why that video feels a bit strange.And yet, look around us. What we see around us is staggering complexity. Eric Beinhocker estimates that in New York City alone, there are some 10 billion SKUs, or distinct commodities, being traded. That's hundreds of times as many species as there are on Earth. And they're being traded by a species of almost seven billion individuals, who are linked by trade, travel, and the Internet into a global system of stupendous complexity.So here's a great puzzle: in a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics, how is it possible to generate the sort of complexity I've described, the sort of complexity represented by you and me and the convention center? Well, the answer seems to be, the universe can create complexity, but with great difficulty. In pockets, there appear what my colleague, Fred Spier, calls \"Goldilocks conditions\" \u2014 not too hot, not too cold, just right for the creation of complexity. And slightly more complex things appear. And where you have slightly more complex things, you can get slightly more complex things. And in this way, complexity builds stage by stage. Each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost out of nowhere in the universe. We refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments. And at each threshold, the going gets tougher. The complex things get more fragile, more vulnerable; the Goldilocks conditions get more stringent, and it's more difficult to create complexity.Now, we, as extremely complex creatures, desperately need to know this story of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law, and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility. And that's the story that we tell in big history. But to do it, you have do something that may, at first sight, seem completely impossible. You have to survey the whole history of the universe. So let's do it.(Laughter)Let's begin by winding the timeline back 13.7 billion years, to the beginning of time.Around us, there's nothing. There's not even time or space. Imagine the darkest, emptiest thing you can and cube it a gazillion times and that's where we are. And then suddenly, bang! A universe appears, an entire universe. And we've crossed our first threshold. The universe is tiny; it's smaller than an atom. It's incredibly hot. It contains everything that's in today's universe, so you can imagine, it's busting. And it's expanding at incredible speed. And at first, it's just a blur, but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur. Within the first second, energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity. And energy does something else quite magical: it congeals to form matter \u2014 quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons. And all of that happens in the first second.Now we move forward 380,000 years. That's twice as long as humans have been on this planet. And now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium. Now I want to pause for a moment, 380,000 years after the origins of the universe, because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage. We know above all that it was extremely simple. It consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms, and they have no structure. They're really a sort of cosmic mush. But that's not completely true. Recent studies by satellites such as the WMAP satellite have shown that, in fact, there are just tiny differences in that background. What you see here, the blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree cooler than the red areas. These are tiny differences, but it was enough for the universe to move on to the next stage of building complexity.And this is how it works. Gravity is more powerful where there's more stuff. So where you get slightly denser areas, gravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms. So we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion clouds. And each cloud is compacted, gravity gets more powerful as density increases, the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud, and then, at the center, the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of 10 million degrees, protons start to fuse, there's a huge release of energy, and \u2014 bam! We have our first stars. From about 200 million years after the Big Bang, stars begin to appear all through the universe, billions of them. And the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex.Stars will create the Goldilocks conditions for crossing two new thresholds. When very large stars die, they create temperatures so high that protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations, to form all the elements of the periodic table. If, like me, you're wearing a gold ring, it was forged in a supernova explosion. So now the universe is chemically more complex. And in a chemically more complex universe, it's possible to make more things. And what starts happening is that, around young suns, young stars, all these elements combine, they swirl around, the energy of the star stirs them around, they form particles, they form snowflakes, they form little dust motes, they form rocks, they form asteroids, and eventually, they form planets and moons. And that is how our solar system was formed, four and a half billion years ago. Rocky planets like our Earth are significantly more complex than stars because they contain a much greater diversity of materials. So we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity.Now, the going gets tougher. The next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile, significantly more vulnerable, but they're also much more creative and much more capable of generating further complexity. I'm talking, of course, about living organisms. Living organisms are created by chemistry. We are huge packages of chemicals. So, chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force. That operates over smaller scales than gravity, which explains why you and I are smaller than stars or planets. Now, what are the ideal conditions for chemistry? What are the Goldilocks conditions? Well, first, you need energy, but not too much. In the center of a star, there's so much energy that any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again. But not too little. In intergalactic space, there's so little energy that atoms can't combine. What you want is just the right amount, and planets, it turns out, are just right, because they're close to stars, but not too close.You also need a great diversity of chemical elements, and you need liquids, such as water. Why? Well, in gases, atoms move past each other so fast that they can't hitch up. In solids, atoms are stuck together, they can't move. In liquids, they can cruise and cuddle and link up to form molecules. Now, where do you find such Goldilocks conditions? Well, planets are great, and our early Earth was almost perfect. It was just the right distance from its star to contain huge oceans of liquid water. And deep beneath those oceans, at cracks in the Earth's crust, you've got heat seeping up from inside the Earth, and you've got a great diversity of elements. So at those deep oceanic vents, fantastic chemistry began to happen, and atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations.But of course, life is more than just exotic chemistry. How do you stabilize those huge molecules that seem to be viable? Well, it's here that life introduces an entirely new trick. You don't stabilize the individual; you stabilize the template, the thing that carries information, and you allow the template to copy itself. And DNA, of course, is the beautiful molecule that contains that information. You'll be familiar with the double helix of DNA. Each rung contains information. So, DNA contains information about how to make living organisms. And DNA also copies itself. So, it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean. So the information spreads. Notice that information has become part of our story. The real beauty of DNA though is in its imperfections. As it copies itself, once in every billion rungs, there tends to be an error. And what that means is that DNA is, in effect, learning. It's accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those errors work. So DNA's learning and it's building greater diversity and greater complexity. And we can see this happening over the last four billion years.For most of that time of life on Earth, living organisms have been relatively simple \u2014 single cells. But they had great diversity, and, inside, great complexity. Then from about 600 to 800 million years ago, multi-celled organisms appear. You get fungi, you get fish, you get plants, you get amphibia, you get reptiles, and then, of course, you get the dinosaurs. And occasionally, there are disasters. Sixty-five million years ago, an asteroid landed on Earth near the Yucatan Peninsula, creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war, and the dinosaurs were wiped out. Terrible news for the dinosaurs, but great news for our mammalian ancestors, who flourished in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs. And we human beings are part of that creative evolutionary pulse that began 65 million years ago with the landing of an asteroid.Humans appeared about 200,000 years ago. And I believe we count as a threshold in this great story. Let me explain why. We've seen that DNA learns in a sense, it accumulates information. But it is so slow. DNA accumulates information through random errors, some of which just happen to work. But DNA had actually generated a faster way of learning: it had produced organisms with brains, and those organisms can learn in real time. They accumulate information, they learn. The sad thing is, when they die, the information dies with them. Now what makes humans different is human language. We are blessed with a language, a system of communication, so powerful and so precise that we can share what we've learned with such precision that it can accumulate in the collective memory. And that means it can outlast the individuals who learned that information, and it can accumulate from generation to generation. And that's why, as a species, we're so creative and so powerful, and that's why we have a history. We seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift.I call this ability collective learning. It's what makes us different. We can see it at work in the earliest stages of human history. We evolved as a species in the savanna lands of Africa, but then you see humans migrating into new environments, into desert lands, into jungles, into the Ice Age tundra of Siberia \u2014 tough, tough environment \u2014 into the Americas, into Australasia. Each migration involved learning \u2014 learning new ways of exploiting the environment, new ways of dealing with their surroundings.Then 10,000 years ago, exploiting a sudden change in global climate with the end of the last ice age, humans learned to farm. Farming was an energy bonanza. And exploiting that energy, human populations multiplied. Human societies got larger, denser, more interconnected. And then from about 500 years ago, humans began to link up globally through shipping, through trains, through telegraph, through the Internet, until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost seven billion individuals. And that brain is learning at warp speed. And in the last 200 years, something else has happened. We've stumbled on another energy bonanza in fossil fuels. So fossil fuels and collective learning together explain the staggering complexity we see around us.So \u2014 Here we are, back at the convention center. We've been on a journey, a return journey, of 13.7 billion years. I hope you agree this is a powerful story. And it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role. But it also contains warnings. Collective learning is a very, very powerful force, and it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it. I remember very vividly as a child growing up in England, living through the Cuban Missile Crisis. For a few days, the entire biosphere seemed to be on the verge of destruction. And the same weapons are still here, and they are still armed. If we avoid that trap, others are waiting for us. We're burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seem to be undermining the Goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last 10,000 years. So what big history can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us, but it can also show us our power with collective learning.And now, finally \u2014 this is what I want. I want my grandson, Daniel, and his friends and his generation, throughout the world, to know the story of big history, and to know it so well that they understand both the challenges that face us and the opportunities that face us. And that's why a group of us are building a free, online syllabus in big history for high-school students throughout the world. We believe that big history will be a vital intellectual tool for them, as Daniel and his generation face the huge challenges and also the huge opportunities ahead of them at this threshold moment in the history of our beautiful planet.I thank you for your attention.(Applause)", "id": 1118, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.807 -->

begin to feel\njust slightly uneasy.\n\n00:00:33.347 --> 00:00:36.685\nBecause you may notice\nthat what's actually happening\n\n00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:38.934\nis that the egg is unscrambling

that the general\ntendency of the universe\n\n00:01:20.794 --> 00:01:24.397\nis to move from order and structure\n\n00:01:24.421 --> 00:01:27.085\nto lack of order, lack of structure

universe can create complexity,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.513\nbut with great difficulty.\n\n00:02:30.568 --> 00:02:31.665\nIn pockets,\n\n00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:34.006\nthere appear\nwhat my colleague, Fred Spier,\n\n00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.172\ncalls \"Goldilocks conditions\" --\n\n00:02:36.196 --> 00:02:38.247\nnot too hot, not too cold,\n\n00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:40.934\njust right for the creation of complexity.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.225\nAnd slightly more complex things appear.\n\n00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:45.488\nAnd where you have\nslightly more complex things,\n\n00:02:45.512 --> 00:02:47.884\nyou can get slightly more complex things.\n\n00:02:47.908 --> 00:02:51.934\nAnd in this way, complexity\nbuilds stage by stage.\n\n00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:55.111\nEach stage is magical\n\n00:02:55.135 --> 00:02:58.708\nbecause it creates the impression\nof something utterly new\n\n00:02:58.732 --> 00:03:01.535\nappearing almost out of nowhere\nin the universe.\n\n00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:04.790\nWe refer in big history to these moments\nas threshold moments.\n\n00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.934\nAnd at each threshold,\nthe going gets tougher.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:12.200\nThe complex things get more fragile,\n\n00:03:12.224 --> 00:03:13.934\nmore vulnerable;\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:17.489\nthe Goldilocks conditions\nget more stringent,\n\n00:03:17.513 --> 00:03:20.500\nand it's more difficult\nto create complexity.\n\n00:03:21.426 --> 00:03:24.730\nNow, we, as extremely complex creatures,\n\n00:03:24.754 --> 00:03:26.934\ndesperately need to know this story\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:31.616\nof how the universe creates complexity\ndespite the second law,\n\n00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.672\nand why complexity means\nvulnerability and fragility.\n\n00:03:37.443 --> 00:03:40.363\nAnd that's the story\nthat we tell in big history.\n\n00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.094\nBut to do it, you have do something\n\n00:03:42.118 --> 00:03:44.823\nthat may, at first sight,\nseem completely impossible.\n\n00:03:44.847 --> 00:03:48.027\nYou have to survey the whole\nhistory of the universe.\n\n00:03:49.446 --> 00:03:50.446\nSo let's do it.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.867\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:52.891 --> 00:03:56.337\nLet's begin by winding the timeline back\n\n00:03:56.361 -->

are.\n\n00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.030\nAnd then suddenly,\n\n00:04:25.054 --> 00:04:26.062\nbang!\n\n00:04:26.086 --> 00:04:28.293\nA universe appears, an entire universe.\n\n00:04:28.317 -->

second.\n\n00:05:06.415 --> 00:05:10.644\nNow we move forward 380,000 years.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.605\nThat's twice as long as humans\nhave been on this planet.\n\n00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:19.369\nAnd now simple atoms appear\nof hydrogen and helium.\n\n00:05:20.575 --> 00:05:22.178\nNow I want to pause for a moment,\n\n00:05:22.202 --> 00:05:24.934\n380,000 years after the origins\nof the universe,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:28.934\nbecause we actually know quite a lot\nabout the universe at this stage.\n\n00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:32.392\nWe know above all\nthat it was

00:05:40.558\nThey're really a sort of cosmic mush.\n\n00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.020\nBut that's not completely true.\n\n00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.934\nRecent studies\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.819\nby satellites such as the WMAP satellite\n\n00:05:47.843 --> 00:05:49.420\nhave shown that, in fact,\n\n00:05:49.444 --> 00:05:52.193\nthere are just tiny differences\nin that background.\n\n00:05:52.217 --> 00:05:53.934\nWhat you see here,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:58.264\nthe blue areas are about a thousandth\nof a degree cooler\n\n00:05:58.288 --> 00:05:59.680\nthan the red areas.\n\n00:05:59.704 --> 00:06:01.077\nThese are tiny differences,\n\n00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:03.371\nbut it was enough\nfor the universe to move on\n\n00:06:03.395 --> 00:06:05.370\nto the next stage of building complexity.\n\n00:06:05.394 --> 00:06:06.586\nAnd this is how it works.\n\n00:06:07.593 --> 00:06:11.841\nGravity is more powerful\nwhere there's more stuff.\n\n00:06:12.515 --> 00:06:14.833\nSo where you get slightly denser areas,\n\n00:06:14.857 --> 00:06:18.774\ngravity starts compacting clouds\nof hydrogen and helium atoms.\n\n00:06:18.798 --> 00:06:22.348\nSo we can imagine the early universe\nbreaking up into a billion clouds.\n\n00:06:22.372 --> 00:06:24.174\nAnd each cloud is compacted,\n\n00:06:24.198 --> 00:06:27.214\ngravity gets more powerful\nas density

stars.\n\n00:06:45.636 --> 00:06:49.494\nFrom about 200 million years\nafter the Big Bang,\n\n00:06:49.518 --> 00:06:52.925\nstars begin to appear\nall through the universe,\n\n00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:54.020\nbillions of them.\n\n00:06:54.457 --> 00:06:57.313\nAnd the universe is now\nsignificantly more interesting\n\n00:06:57.337 --> 00:06:58.432\nand more complex.\n\n00:06:59.886 --> 00:07:03.002\nStars will create\nthe Goldilocks conditions\n\n00:07:03.026 --> 00:07:04.925\nfor crossing two new thresholds.\n\n00:07:05.329 --> 00:07:07.908\nWhen very large stars die,\n\n00:07:07.932 --> 00:07:10.253\nthey create temperatures so high\n\n00:07:10.277 --> 00:07:13.910\nthat protons begin to fuse\nin all sorts of exotic combinations,\n\n00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:16.764\nto form all the elements\nof the periodic table.\n\n00:07:16.788 --> 00:07:19.084\nIf, like me, you're wearing a gold ring,\n\n00:07:19.108 --> 00:07:21.934\nit was forged in a supernova explosion.\n\n00:07:22.576 --> 00:07:25.775\nSo now the universe\nis chemically more complex.\n\n00:07:25.799 --> 00:07:28.164\nAnd in a chemically more complex universe,\n\n00:07:28.188 --> 00:07:30.632\nit's possible to make more things.\n\n00:07:30.656 --> 00:07:34.148\nAnd what starts happening\nis that, around young suns,\n\n00:07:34.172 --> 00:07:35.934\nyoung stars,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.149\nall these elements combine,\nthey swirl around,\n\n00:07:38.173 --> 00:07:40.953\nthe energy of the star stirs them around,\n\n00:07:40.977 --> 00:07:45.702\nthey form particles, they form snowflakes,\nthey form little dust motes,\n\n00:07:45.726 --> 00:07:47.922\nthey form rocks, they form asteroids,\n\n00:07:47.946 --> 00:07:50.541\nand eventually,\nthey form planets and moons.\n\n00:07:50.565 --> 00:07:53.515\nAnd that is how our\nsolar system was formed,\n\n00:07:53.539 --> 00:07:55.934\nfour and a half billion years ago.\n\n00:07:57.151 --> 00:08:02.524\nRocky planets like our Earth\nare significantly more complex than stars\n\n00:08:02.548 --> 00:08:05.310\nbecause they contain\na much greater diversity of materials.\n\n00:08:05.334 --> 00:08:08.115\nSo we've crossed a fourth\nthreshold of complexity.\n\n00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:12.256\nNow, the going gets tougher.\n\n00:08:13.109 --> 00:08:17.387\nThe next stage introduces entities\nthat are significantly more fragile,\n\n00:08:17.411 --> 00:08:19.323\nsignificantly more vulnerable,\n\n00:08:19.347 --> 00:08:21.934\nbut they're also much more creative\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.934\nand much more capable\nof generating further complexity.\n\n00:08:25.304 --> 00:08:28.728\nI'm talking, of course,\nabout living organisms.\n\n00:08:29.432 --> 00:08:31.575\nLiving organisms are created by chemistry.\n\n00:08:31.599 --> 00:08:33.982\nWe are huge packages of chemicals.\n\n00:08:34.813 --> 00:08:37.934\nSo, chemistry is dominated\nby the electromagnetic force.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.197\nThat operates over smaller\nscales than gravity,\n\n00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:44.136\nwhich explains why you and I\nare smaller than stars or planets.\n\n00:08:44.731 --> 00:08:47.025\nNow, what are the ideal\nconditions for chemistry?\n\n00:08:47.572 --> 00:08:49.342\nWhat are the Goldilocks conditions?\n\n00:08:49.366 --> 00:08:51.723\nWell, first, you need energy,\n\n00:08:51.747 --> 00:08:52.934\nbut not too much.\n\n00:08:53.363 --> 00:08:55.618\nIn the center of a star,\nthere's so much energy\n\n00:08:55.642 --> 00:08:58.784\nthat any atoms that combine\nwill just get busted apart again.\n\n00:08:58.808 --> 00:08:59.934\nBut not too little.\n\n00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.571\nIn intergalactic space,\n\n00:09:01.595 --> 00:09:04.478\nthere's so little energy\nthat atoms can't combine.\n\n00:09:05.076 --> 00:09:06.934\nWhat you want is just the right amount,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nand planets, it turns out, are just right,\n\n00:09:08.982 --> 00:09:11.489\nbecause they're close to stars,\nbut not too close.\n\n00:09:12.092 --> 00:09:15.687\nYou also need a great diversity\nof chemical elements,\n\n00:09:15.711 --> 00:09:18.719\nand you need liquids, such as water.\n\n00:09:18.743 --> 00:09:19.790\nWhy?\n\n00:09:19.814 --> 00:09:23.686\nWell, in gases, atoms move\npast each other so fast\n\n00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.163\nthat they can't hitch up.\n\n00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:27.370\nIn solids,\n\n00:09:27.394 --> 00:09:29.934\natoms are stuck together, they can't move.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.676\nIn liquids,\n\n00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.738\nthey can cruise and cuddle\n\n00:09:34.762 --> 00:09:37.064\nand link up to form molecules.\n\n00:09:37.738 --> 00:09:40.093\nNow, where do you find\nsuch Goldilocks conditions?\n\n00:09:40.632 --> 00:09:42.624\nWell, planets are great,\n\n00:09:42.648 --> 00:09:45.934\nand our early Earth was almost perfect.\n\n00:09:46.735 --> 00:09:48.783\nIt was just the right\ndistance from its star\n\n00:09:48.807 --> 00:09:50.934\nto contain huge oceans of liquid water.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.934\nAnd deep beneath those oceans,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.934\nat cracks in the Earth's crust,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.934\nyou've got heat seeping up\nfrom inside the Earth,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.085\nand you've got a great\ndiversity of elements.\n\n00:10:00.109 --> 00:10:02.655\nSo at those deep oceanic vents,\n\n00:10:02.679 --> 00:10:04.934\nfantastic chemistry began to happen,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nand atoms combined in all sorts\nof exotic combinations.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:13.323\nBut of course, life is more\nthan just exotic chemistry.\n\n00:10:13.752 --> 00:10:17.509\nHow do you stabilize those huge molecules\n\n00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:18.890\nthat seem to be viable?\n\n00:10:19.648 --> 00:10:24.004\nWell, it's here that life introduces\nan entirely new trick.\n\n00:10:24.918 --> 00:10:27.453\nYou don't stabilize the individual;\n\n00:10:27.477 --> 00:10:29.580\nyou stabilize the template,\n\n00:10:29.604 --> 00:10:31.709\nthe thing that carries information,\n\n00:10:31.733 --> 00:10:33.950\nand you allow the template to copy itself.\n\n00:10:33.974 --> 00:10:37.125\nAnd DNA, of course,\nis the beautiful molecule\n\n00:10:37.149 --> 00:10:39.475\nthat contains that information.\n\n00:10:39.499 --> 00:10:42.314\nYou'll be familiar\nwith the double helix of DNA.\n\n00:10:42.338 --> 00:10:44.854\nEach rung contains information.\n\n00:10:44.878 --> 00:10:49.451\nSo, DNA contains information\nabout how to make living organisms.\n\n00:10:50.013 --> 00:10:51.937\nAnd DNA also copies itself.\n\n00:10:51.961 --> 00:10:53.167\nSo, it copies itself\n\n00:10:53.191 --> 00:10:55.873\nand scatters the templates\nthrough the ocean.\n\n00:10:55.897 --> 00:10:57.691\nSo the information spreads.\n\n00:10:57.715 --> 00:11:00.353\nNotice that information\nhas become part of our story.\n\n00:11:00.835 --> 00:11:04.480\nThe real beauty of DNA though\nis in its imperfections.\n\n00:11:04.504 --> 00:11:08.432\nAs it copies itself,\nonce in every billion rungs,\n\n00:11:08.456 --> 00:11:10.201\nthere tends to be an error.\n\n00:11:10.225 --> 00:11:14.934\nAnd what that means\nis that DNA is, in effect, learning.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:18.278\nIt's accumulating new ways\nof making living organisms\n\n00:11:18.302 --> 00:11:19.922\nbecause some of those errors work.\n\n00:11:19.946 --> 00:11:21.144\nSo DNA's learning\n\n00:11:21.168 --> 00:11:24.402\nand it's building greater\ndiversity and greater complexity.\n\n00:11:24.426 --> 00:11:27.608\nAnd we can see this happening\nover the last four billion years.\n\n00:11:27.632 --> 00:11:29.807\nFor most of that time of life on Earth,\n\n00:11:29.831 --> 00:11:32.068\nliving organisms have been\nrelatively simple --\n\n00:11:32.092 --> 00:11:33.480\nsingle cells.\n\n00:11:33.504 --> 00:11:36.934\nBut they had great diversity,\nand, inside, great complexity.\n\n00:11:37.369 --> 00:11:40.273\nThen from about 600\nto 800 million years ago,\n\n00:11:40.297 --> 00:11:42.388\nmulti-celled organisms appear.\n\n00:11:42.412 --> 00:11:44.913\nYou get fungi, you get fish,\n\n00:11:44.937 --> 00:11:46.452\nyou get plants,\n\n00:11:46.476 --> 00:11:49.187\nyou get amphibia, you get reptiles,\n\n00:11:49.211 --> 00:11:51.641\nand then, of course,\nyou get the dinosaurs.\n\n00:11:52.697 --> 00:11:55.206\nAnd occasionally, there are disasters.\n\n00:11:56.284 --> 00:11:58.673\nSixty-five million years ago,\n\n00:11:58.697 --> 00:12:00.661\nan asteroid landed on Earth\n\n00:12:00.685 --> 00:12:02.475\nnear the Yucatan Peninsula,\n\n00:12:02.499 --> 00:12:05.467\ncreating conditions equivalent\nto those of a nuclear war,\n\n00:12:05.491 --> 00:12:07.380\nand the dinosaurs were wiped out.\n\n00:12:07.864 --> 00:12:10.934\nTerrible news for the dinosaurs,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:14.713\nbut great news\nfor our mammalian ancestors,\n\n00:12:14.737 --> 00:12:15.934\nwho flourished\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:19.615\nin the niches left empty by the dinosaurs.\n\n00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:24.694\nAnd we human beings are part\nof that creative evolutionary pulse\n\n00:12:24.718 --> 00:12:27.054\nthat began 65 million years ago\n\n00:12:27.078 --> 00:12:28.958\nwith the landing of an asteroid.\n\n00:12:30.494 --> 00:12:33.208\nHumans appeared about 200,000 years ago.\n\n00:12:33.232 --> 00:12:37.580\nAnd I believe we count\nas a threshold in this great story.\n\n00:12:37.604 --> 00:12:38.811\nLet me explain why.\n\n00:12:39.398 --> 00:12:42.429\nWe've seen that DNA learns in a sense,\n\n00:12:42.453 --> 00:12:44.240\nit accumulates information.\n\n00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:45.934\nBut it is so slow.\n\n00:12:46.826 --> 00:12:50.298\nDNA accumulates information\nthrough random errors,\n\n00:12:50.322 --> 00:12:52.458\nsome of which just happen to work.\n\n00:12:53.188 --> 00:12:55.822\nBut DNA had actually generated\na faster way of learning:\n\n00:12:55.846 --> 00:12:58.624\nit had produced organisms with brains,\n\n00:12:58.648 --> 00:13:01.867\nand those organisms\ncan learn in real time.\n\n00:13:01.891 --> 00:13:04.217\nThey accumulate information, they learn.\n\n00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:07.066\nThe sad thing is, when they die,\n\n00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:08.788\nthe information dies with them.\n\n00:13:09.177 --> 00:13:13.164\nNow what makes humans different\nis human language.\n\n00:13:13.188 --> 00:13:15.951\nWe are blessed with a language,\na system of communication,\n\n00:13:15.975 --> 00:13:18.596\nso powerful and so precise\n\n00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.778\nthat we can share what we've learned\nwith such precision\n\n00:13:21.802 --> 00:13:24.691\nthat it can accumulate\nin the collective memory.\n\n00:13:24.715 --> 00:13:25.934\nAnd that means\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:29.737\nit can outlast the individuals\nwho learned that information,\n\n00:13:29.761 --> 00:13:32.934\nand it can accumulate\nfrom generation to generation.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:37.014\nAnd that's why, as a species,\nwe're so creative and so powerful,\n\n00:13:37.038 --> 00:13:39.094\nand that's why we have a history.\n\n00:13:39.713 --> 00:13:43.014\nWe seem to be the only species\nin four billion years\n\n00:13:43.038 --> 00:13:44.280\nto have this gift.\n\n00:13:44.755 --> 00:13:48.320\nI call this ability collective learning.\n\n00:13:48.693 --> 00:13:50.082\nIt's what makes us different.\n\n00:13:50.384 --> 00:13:53.934\nWe can see it at work\nin the earliest stages of human history.\n\n00:13:54.647 --> 00:13:57.934\nWe evolved as a species\nin the savanna lands of Africa,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:01.418\nbut then you see humans migrating\ninto new environments,\n\n00:14:01.442 --> 00:14:03.592\ninto desert lands, into jungles,\n\n00:14:03.616 --> 00:14:06.052\ninto the Ice Age tundra of Siberia --\n\n00:14:06.076 --> 00:14:07.521\ntough, tough environment --\n\n00:14:07.545 --> 00:14:09.878\ninto the Americas, into Australasia.\n\n00:14:09.902 --> 00:14:11.939\nEach migration involved learning --\n\n00:14:11.963 --> 00:14:14.446\nlearning new ways of exploiting\nthe environment,\n\n00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.644\nnew ways of dealing\nwith their surroundings.\n\n00:14:16.668 --> 00:14:18.484\nThen 10,000 years ago,\n\n00:14:18.508 --> 00:14:21.503\nexploiting a sudden\nchange in global climate\n\n00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:23.099\nwith the end of the last ice age,\n\n00:14:23.123 --> 00:14:24.704\nhumans learned to farm.\n\n00:14:25.321 --> 00:14:27.757\nFarming was an energy bonanza.\n\n00:14:27.781 --> 00:14:31.608\nAnd exploiting that energy,\nhuman populations multiplied.\n\n00:14:31.632 --> 00:14:35.219\nHuman societies got larger,\ndenser, more interconnected.\n\n00:14:35.799 --> 00:14:39.150\nAnd then from about 500 years ago,\n\n00:14:39.174 --> 00:14:41.213\nhumans began to link up globally\n\n00:14:41.237 --> 00:14:43.618\nthrough shipping, through trains,\n\n00:14:43.642 --> 00:14:45.934\nthrough telegraph, through the Internet,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:51.149\nuntil now we seem to form\na single global brain\n\n00:14:51.173 --> 00:14:53.305\nof almost seven billion individuals.\n\n00:14:53.329 --> 00:14:56.491\nAnd that brain is learning at warp speed.\n\n00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.842\nAnd in the last 200 years,\nsomething else has happened.\n\n00:14:59.866 --> 00:15:02.532\nWe've stumbled on another energy bonanza\n\n00:15:02.556 --> 00:15:03.683\nin fossil fuels.\n\n00:15:03.707 --> 00:15:06.410\nSo fossil fuels and collective\nlearning together\n\n00:15:06.434 --> 00:15:09.958\nexplain the staggering complexity\nwe see around us.\n\n00:15:13.203 --> 00:15:14.203\nSo --\n\n00:15:15.366 --> 00:15:16.683\nHere we are,\n\n00:15:16.707 --> 00:15:18.231\nback at the convention center.\n\n00:15:18.255 --> 00:15:22.961\nWe've been on a journey,\na return journey, of 13.7 billion years.\n\n00:15:23.665 --> 00:15:26.134\nI hope you agree this is a powerful story.\n\n00:15:26.158 --> 00:15:30.823\nAnd it's a story in which humans\nplay an astonishing and creative role.\n\n00:15:31.164 --> 00:15:33.379\nBut it also contains warnings.\n\n00:15:34.172 --> 00:15:38.505\nCollective learning is a very,\nvery powerful force,\n\n00:15:38.529 --> 00:15:42.934\nand it's not clear\nthat we humans are in charge of it.\n\n00:15:43.821 --> 00:15:46.890\nI remember very vividly\nas a child growing up in England,\n\n00:15:46.914 --> 00:15:48.934\nliving through the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\n00:15:49.545 --> 00:15:53.156\nFor a few days, the entire biosphere\n\n00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.479\nseemed to be on the verge of destruction.\n\n00:15:56.172 --> 00:15:59.337\nAnd the same weapons are still here,\n\n00:15:59.361 --> 00:16:00.934\nand they are still armed.\n\n00:16:01.702 --> 00:16:04.934\nIf we avoid that trap,\nothers are waiting for us.\n\n00:16:05.345 --> 00:16:07.934\nWe're burning fossil fuels at such a rate\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:11.369\nthat we seem to be undermining\nthe Goldilocks conditions\n\n00:16:11.393 --> 00:16:13.621\nthat made it possible\nfor human civilizations\n\n00:16:13.645 --> 00:16:16.727\nto flourish over the last 10,000 years.\n\n00:16:17.331 --> 00:16:19.607\nSo what big history can do\n\n00:16:19.631 --> 00:16:22.952\nis show us the nature\nof our complexity and fragility\n\n00:16:22.976 --> 00:16:24.900\nand the dangers that face us,\n\n00:16:24.924 --> 00:16:28.504\nbut it can also show us\nour power with collective learning.\n\n00:16:29.284 --> 00:16:31.236\nAnd now, finally --\n\n00:16:32.355 --> 00:16:34.510\nthis is what I want.\n\n00:16:36.146 --> 00:16:39.178\nI want my grandson, Daniel,\n\n00:16:39.202 --> 00:16:41.959\nand his friends and his generation,\n\n00:16:41.983 --> 00:16:43.776\nthroughout the world,\n\n00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.640\nto know the story of big history,\n\n00:16:46.664 --> 00:16:48.703\nand to know it so well\n\n00:16:48.727 --> 00:16:52.393\nthat they understand\nboth the challenges that face us\n\n00:16:52.417 --> 00:16:54.934\nand the opportunities that face us.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.838\nAnd that's why a group of us\n\n00:16:56.862 --> 00:16:59.874\nare building a free, online syllabus\n\n00:16:59.898 --> 00:17:01.216\nin big history\n\n00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.391\nfor high-school students\nthroughout the world.\n\n00:17:03.923 --> 00:17:06.359\nWe believe that big history\n\n00:17:06.383 --> 00:17:08.934\nwill be a vital\nintellectual tool for them,\n\n00:17:08.958

"How often do we hear that people just don't care? How many times have you been told that real, substantial change isn't possible because most people are too selfish, too stupid or too lazy to try to make a difference in their community? I propose to you today that apathy as we think we know it doesn't actually exist; but rather, that people do care, but that we live in a world that actively discourages engagement by constantly putting obstacles and barriers in our way.I'll give you some examples of what I mean. Let's start with city hall. You ever see one of these before? This is a newspaper ad. It's a notice of a zoning application change for a new office building so the neighborhood knows what's happening. As you can see, it's impossible to read. You need to get halfway down to even find out which address they're talking about, and then further down, in tiny 10-point font, to find out how to actually get involved. Imagine if the private sector advertised in the same way \u2014 if Nike wanted to sell a pair of shoes \u2014(Laughter)And put an ad in the paper like that.(Applause)Now, that would never happen. You'll never see an ad like that, because Nike actually wants you to buy their shoes, whereas the city of Toronto clearly doesn't want you involved with the planning process, otherwise their ads would look something like this, with all the information laid out clearly. As long as the city's putting out notices like this to try to get people engaged, then of course people aren't going to be engaged. But that's not apathy; that's intentional exclusion.Public space.(Applause)The manner in which we mistreat our public spaces is a huge obstacle towards any type of progressive political change, because we've essentially put a price tag on freedom of expression. Whoever has the most money gets the loudest voice, dominating the visual and mental environment. The problem with this model is there are some amazing messages that need to be said, that aren't profitable to say. So you're never going to see them on a billboard.The media plays an important role in developing our relationship with political change, mainly by ignoring politics and focusing on celebrities and scandals, but even when they do talk about important political issues, they do it in a way that I feel discourages engagement. I'll give you an example. The \"Now\" magazine from last week: progressive, downtown weekly in Toronto. This is the cover story. It's an article about a theater performance, and it starts with basic information about where it is, in case you actually want to go and see it after you've read the article \u2014 where, the time, the website. Same with this \u2014 it's a movie review. An art review. A book review \u2014 where the reading is in case you want to go. A restaurant \u2014 you might not want to just read about it, maybe you want to go there. So they tell you where it is, the prices, the address, the phone number, etc.Then you get to their political articles. Here's a great article about an important election race that's happening. It talks about the candidates, written very well, but no information, no follow-up, no websites for the campaigns, no information about when the debates are, where the campaign offices are. Here's another good article, about a new campaign opposing privatization of transit, without any contact information for the campaign. The message seems to be that the readers are most likely to want to eat, maybe read a book, maybe see a movie, but not be engaged in their community. You might think this is a small thing, but I think it's important, because it sets a tone and it reinforces the dangerous idea that politics is a spectator sport.Heroes: How do we view leadership? Look at these 10 movies. What do they have in common? Anyone? They all have heroes who were chosen. Someone came up to them and said, \"You're the chosen one. There's a prophecy. You have to save the world.\" And then they go off and save the world because they've been told to, with a few people tagging along. This helps me understand why a lot of people have trouble seeing themselves as leaders \u2014 because it sends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about. A heroic effort is a collective effort, number one. Number two, it's imperfect; it's not very glamorous, and doesn't suddenly start and suddenly end. It's an ongoing process your whole life. But most importantly, it's voluntary. It's voluntary. As long as we're teaching our kids that heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead, or someone tells you you're part of a prophecy, they're missing the most important characteristic of leadership, which is that it comes from within. It's about following your own dreams, uninvited, and then working with others to make those dreams come true.Political parties: oh, boy. Political parties could and should be one of the basic entry points for people to get engaged in politics. Instead, they've become, sadly, uninspiring and uncreative organizations that rely so heavily on market research and polling and focus groups that they end up all saying the same thing, pretty much regurgitating back to us what we already want to hear at the expense of putting forward bold and creative ideas. And people can smell that, and it feeds cynicism.(Applause)Charitable status. Groups who have charitable status in Canada aren't allowed to do advocacy. This is a huge problem and a huge obstacle to change, because it means that some of the most passionate and informed voices are completely silenced, especially during election time. Which leads us to the last one, which is: our elections.As you may have noticed, our elections in Canada are a complete joke. We use out-of-date systems that are unfair and create random results. Canada's currently led by a party that most Canadians didn't actually want. How can we honestly and genuinely encourage more people to vote when votes don't count in Canada? You add all this up together, and of course people are apathetic. It's like trying to run into a brick wall.Now, I'm not trying to be negative by throwing all these obstacles out and explaining what's in our way. Quite the opposite \u2014 I actually think people are amazing and smart and that they do care, but that, as I said, we live in this environment where all these obstacles are being put in our way. As long as we believe that people, our own neighbors, are selfish, stupid or lazy, then there's no hope. But we can change all those things I mentioned. We can open up city hall. We can reform our electoral systems. We can democratize our public spaces.My main message is: if we can redefine apathy, not as some kind of internal syndrome, but as a complex web of cultural barriers that reinforces disengagement, and if we can clearly define, clearly identify what those obstacles are, and then if we can work together collectively to dismantle those obstacles, then anything is possible.Thank you.(Applause)", "id":

smell that,\nand it feeds cynicism.\n\n00:05:11.338 --> 00:05:17.314\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:17.682 --> 00:05:19.126\nCharitable status.\n\n00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.904\nGroups who have charitable status\nin Canada aren't allowed to do advocacy.\n\n00:05:22.928 --> 00:05:25.459\nThis is a huge problem\nand a huge obstacle to change,\n\n00:05:25.483 --> 00:05:28.955\nbecause it means that some\nof the most passionate and informed voices\n\n00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.862\nare completely silenced,\nespecially during election time.\n\n00:05:31.886 --> 00:05:35.249\nWhich leads us to the last one,\nwhich is: our elections.\n\n00:05:35.654 --> 00:05:36.822\nAs you may have noticed,\n\n00:05:36.846 --> 00:05:38.953\nour elections in Canada\nare a complete joke.\n\n00:05:38.977 --> 00:05:40.468\nWe use out-of-date systems\n\n00:05:40.492 --> 00:05:42.793\nthat are unfair and create random results.\n\n00:05:42.817 --> 00:05:44.534\nCanada's currently led by a party\n\n00:05:44.558 --> 00:05:47.006\nthat most Canadians didn't actually want.\n\n00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.645\nHow can we honestly and genuinely\nencourage more people to vote\n\n00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.946\nwhen votes don't count in Canada?\n\n00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.338\nYou add all this up together,\nand of course people are apathetic.\n\n00:05:56.362 --> 00:05:58.422\nIt's like trying to run into a brick wall.\n\n00:05:58.446 --> 00:06:01.763\nNow, I'm not trying to be negative\nby throwing all these obstacles out\n\n00:06:01.787 --> 00:06:03.387\nand explaining what's in our way.\n\n00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:04.564\nQuite the opposite --\n\n00:06:04.588 --> 00:06:09.072\nI actually think people are amazing\nand smart and that they do care,\n\n00:06:09.175 --> 00:06:11.534\nbut that, as I said,\nwe live in this environment\n\n00:06:11.558 --> 00:06:14.696\nwhere all these obstacles\nare being put in our way.\n\n00:06:15.446 --> 00:06:18.897\nAs long as we believe\nthat people, our own neighbors,\n\n00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:21.617\nare selfish, stupid or lazy,\n\n00:06:22.375 --> 00:06:23.667\nthen there's no hope.\n\n00:06:24.762 --> 00:06:27.073\nBut we can change\nall those things I mentioned.\n\n00:06:27.097 --> 00:06:28.534\nWe can open up city hall.\n\n00:06:28.558 --> 00:06:30.290\nWe can reform our electoral systems.\n\n00:06:30.314 --> 00:06:32.291\nWe can democratize our public spaces.\n\n00:06:32.315 --> 00:06:34.087\nMy main message is:\n\n00:06:34.111 --> 00:06:35.789\nif we can redefine apathy,\n\n00:06:35.813 --> 00:06:37.835\nnot as some kind of internal syndrome,\n\n00:06:37.859 --> 00:06:42.653\nbut as a complex web of cultural barriers\nthat reinforces disengagement,\n\n00:06:43.287 --> 00:06:48.850\nand if we can clearly define,\nclearly identify what those obstacles are,\n\n00:06:48.874 --> 00:06:52.465\nand then if we can work together\ncollectively to dismantle those obstacles,\n\n00:06:52.489 --> 00:06:53.743\nthen anything is possible.\n\n00:06:53.767 --> 00:06:54.927\nThank you.\n\n00:06:54.951 --> 00:06:56.951\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Remaking my voice", "duration": "1169", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/roger_ebert_remaking_my_voice", "transcript": "Roger Ebert: These are my words, but this is not my voice. This is Alex, the best computer voice I've been able to find, which comes as standard equipment on every Macintosh. For most of my life, I never gave a second thought to my ability to speak. It was like breathing. In those days, I was living in a fool's paradise. After surgeries for cancer took away my ability to speak, eat or drink, I was forced to enter this virtual world in which a computer does some of my living for me.For several days now, we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at TED. I used to be able to talk like that. Maybe I wasn't as smart, but I was at least as talkative. I want to devote my talk today to the act of speaking itself, and how the act of speaking or not speaking is tied so indelibly to one's identity as to force the birth of a new person when it is taken away. However, I've found that listening to a computer voice for any great length of time can be monotonous. So I've decided to recruit some of my TED friends to read my words aloud for me. I will start with my wife, Chaz.Chaz Ebert: It was Chaz who stood by my side through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw and restore my ability to speak. Going into the first surgery for a recurrence of salivary cancer in 2006, I expected to be out of the hospital in time to return to my movie review show, 'Ebert and Roeper at the Movies.' I had pre-taped enough shows to get me through six weeks of surgery and recuperation. The doctors took a fibula bone from my leg and some tissue from my shoulder to fashion into a new jaw. My tongue, larynx and vocal cords were still healthy and unaffected.(Laughter)(Laughter)CE: I was optimistic, and all was right with the world. The first surgery was a great success. I saw myself in the mirror and I looked pretty good. Two weeks later, I was ready to return home. I was using my iPod to play the Leonard Cohen song 'I'm Your Man' for my doctors and nurses. Suddenly, I had an episode of catastrophic bleeding. My carotid artery had ruptured. Thank God I was still in my hospital room and my doctors were right there. Chaz told me that if that song hadn't played for so long, I might have already been in the car, on the way home, and would have died right there and then. So thank you, Leonard Cohen, for saving my life.(Applause)There was a second surgery \u2014 which held up for five or six days and then it also fell apart. And then a third attempt, which also patched me back together pretty well, until it failed. A doctor from Brazil said he had never seen anyone survive a carotid artery rupture. And before I left the hospital, after a year of being hospitalized, I had seven ruptures of my carotid artery.There was no particular day when anyone told me I would never speak again; it just sort of became obvious. Human speech is an ingenious manipulation of our breath within the sound chamber of our mouth and respiratory system. We need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath in order to form sounds. Therefore, the system must be essentially airtight in order to capture air. Because I had lost my jaw, I could no longer form a seal, and therefore my tongue and all of my other vocal equipment was rendered powerless.Dean Ornish: At first for a long time, I wrote messages in notebooks. Then I tried typing words on my laptop and using its built in voice. This was faster, and nobody had to try to read my handwriting. I tried out various computer voices that were available online, and for several months I had a British accent, which Chaz called Sir Lawrence.\" (Laughter) \"It was the clearest I could find. Then Apple released the Alex voice, which was the best I'd heard. It knew things like the difference between an exclamation point and a question mark. When it saw a period, it knew how to make a sentence sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air. There are all sorts of html codes you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices, and I've experimented with them. For me, they share a fundamental problem: they're too slow. When I find myself in a conversational situation, I need to type fast and to jump right in. People don't have the time or the patience to wait for me to fool around with the codes for every word or phrase.But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice? How does that affect who you are as a person? When people hear Alex speaking my words, do they experience a disconnect? Does that create a separation or a distance from one person to the next? How did I feel not being able to speak? I felt, and I still feel, a lot of distance from the human mainstream. I've become uncomfortable when I'm separated from my laptop. Even then, I'm aware that most people have little patience for my speaking difficulties.So Chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice using my TV show voice from a period of 30 years. At first I was against it. I thought it would be creepy to hear my own voice coming from a computer. There was something comforting about a voice that was not my own. But I decided then to just give it a try. So we contacted a company in Scotland that created personalized computer voices. They'd never made one from previously-recorded materials. All of their voices had been made by a speaker recording original words in a control booth. But they were willing to give it a try.So I sent them many hours of recordings of my voice, including several audio commentary tracks that I'd made for movies on DVDs. And it sounded like me, it really did. There was a reason for that; it was me. But it wasn't that simple. The tapes from my TV show weren't very useful because there were too many other kinds of audio involved \u2014 movie soundtracks, for example, or Gene Siskel arguing with me \u2014 (Laughter) and my words often had a particular emphasis that didn't fit into a sentence well enough.I'll let you hear a sample of that voice. These are a few of the comments I recorded for use when Chaz and I appeared on the Oprah Winfrey program. And here's the voice we call Roger Jr. or Roger 2.0.Roger 2.0: Oprah, I can't tell you how great it is to be back on your show. We have been talking for a long time, and now here we are again. This is the first version of my computer voice. It still needs improvement, but at least it sounds like me and not like HAL 9000. When I heard it the first time, it sent chills down my spine. When I type anything, this voice will speak whatever I type. When I read something, it will read in my voice. I have typed these words in advance, as I didn't think it would be thrilling to sit here watching me typing.The voice was created by a company in Scotland named CereProc. It makes me feel good that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken while I was commenting on \"Casablanca\" and \"Citizen Kane.\" This is the first voice they've created for an individual. There are several very good voices available for computers, but they all sound like somebody else, while this voice sounds like me. I plan to use it on television, radio and the Internet. People who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built-in speaking systems. Many blind people use them to read pages on the Web to themselves. But I've got to say, in first grade, they said I talked too much, and now I still can.(Laughter)Roger Ebert: As you can hear, it sounds like me, but the words jump up and down. The flow isn't natural. The good people in Scotland are still improving my voice, and I'm optimistic about it. But so far, the Apple Alex voice is the best one I've heard. I wrote a blog about it and actually got a comment from the actor who played Alex. He said he recorded many long hours in various intonations to be used in the voice. A very large sample is needed.John Hunter: All my life I was a motormouth. Now I have spoken my last words, and I don't even remember for sure what they were. I feel like the hero of that Harlan Ellison story titled \"I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream.\" On Wednesday, David Christian explained to us what a tiny instant the human race represents in the time-span of the universe. For almost all of its millions and billions of years, there was no life on Earth at all. For almost all the years of life on Earth, there was no intelligent life. Only after we learned to pass knowledge from one generation to the next, did civilization become possible. In cosmological terms, that was about 10 minutes ago. Finally came mankind's most advanced and mysterious tool, the computer. That has mostly happened in my lifetime.Some of the famous early computers were being built in my hometown of Urbana, the birthplace of HAL 9000. When I heard the amazing talk by Salman Khan on Wednesday, about the Khan Academy website that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world, I had a flashback. It was about 1960. As a local newspaper reporter still in high school, I was sent over to the computer lab of the University of Illinois to interview the creators of something called PLATO. The initials stood for Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations. This was a computer-assisted instruction system, which in those days ran on a computer named ILLIAC. The programmers said it could assist students in their learning.I doubt, on that day 50 years ago, they even dreamed of what Salman Khan has accomplished. But that's not the point. The point is PLATO was only 50 years ago, an instant in time. It continued to evolve and operated in one form or another on more and more sophisticated computers, until only five years ago. I have learned from Wikipedia that, starting with that humble beginning, PLATO established forums, message boards, online testing, email, chat rooms, picture languages, instant messaging, remote screen sharing and multiple-player games.Since the first Web browser was also developed in Urbana, it appears that my hometown in downstate Illinois was the birthplace of much of the virtual, online universe we occupy today. But I'm not here from the Chamber of Commerce. (Laughter) I'm here as a man who wants to communicate.All of this has happened in my lifetime. I started writing on a computer back in the 1970s when one of the first Atech systems was installed at the Chicago Sun-Times. I was in line at Radio Shack to buy one of the first Model 100's. And when I told the people in the press room at the Academy Awards that they'd better install some phone lines for Internet connections, they didn't know what I was talking about. When I bought my first desktop, it was a DEC Rainbow. Does anybody remember that?\" (Applause) \"The Sun Times sent me to the Cannes Film Festival with a portable computer the size of a suitcase named the Porteram Telebubble. I joined CompuServe when it had fewer numbers than I currently have followers on Twitter.(Laughter)CE: All of this has happened in the blink of an eye. It is unimaginable what will happen next. It makes me incredibly fortunate to live at this moment in history. Indeed, I am lucky to live in history at all, because without intelligence and memory there is no history. For billions of years, the universe evolved completely without notice. Now we live in the age of the Internet, which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness. And because of it, I can communicate as well as I ever could. We are born into a box of time and space. We use words and communication to break out of it and to reach out to others.For me, the Internet began as a useful tool and now has become something I rely on for my actual daily existence. I cannot speak; I can only type so fast. Computer voices are sometimes not very sophisticated, but with my computer, I can communicate more widely than ever before. I feel as if my blog, my email, Twitter and Facebook have given me a substitute for everyday conversation. They aren't an improvement, but they're the best I can do. They give me a way to speak. Not everybody has the patience of my wife, Chaz. But online, everybody speaks at the same speed.This whole adventure has been a learning experience. Every time there was a surgery that failed, I was left with a little less flesh and bone. Now I have no jaw left at all. While harvesting tissue from both my shoulders, the surgeries left me with back pain and reduced my ability to walk easily. Ironic that my legs are fine, and it's my shoulders that slow up my walk. When you see me today, I look like the Phantom of the Opera.But no you don't.(Laughter)(Applause)It is human nature to look at someone like me and assume I have lost some of my marbles. People \u2014 (Applause) People talk loudly \u2014I'm so sorry. Excuse me.(Applause)People talk loudly and slowly to me. Sometimes they assume I am deaf. There are people who don't want to make eye contact.Believe me, he didn't mean this as \u2014 anyway, let me just read it. (Laughter) You should never let your wife read something like this.(Laughter)It is human nature to look away from illness. We don't enjoy a reminder of our own fragile mortality. That's why writing on the Internet has become a lifesaver for me. My ability to think and write have not been affected. And on the Web, my real voice finds expression. I have also met many other disabled people who communicate this way. One of my Twitter friends can type only with his toes. One of the funniest blogs on the Web is written by a friend of mine named Smartass Cripple. (Laughter) Google him and he will make you laugh. All of these people are saying, in one way or another, that what you see is not all you get.So I have not come here to complain. I have much to make me happy and relieved. I seem, for the time being, to be cancer-free. I am writing as well as ever. I am productive. If I were in this condition at any point before a few cosmological instants ago, I would be as isolated as a hermit. I would be trapped inside my head. Because of the rush of human knowledge, because of the digital revolution, I have a voice, and I do not need to scream.RE: Wait. I have one more thing to add. A guy goes into a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist says, \"You're crazy.\" The guy says, \"I want a second opinion.\" The psychiatrist says, \"All right, you're ugly.\"(Laughter)You all know the test for artificial intelligence \u2014 the Turing test. A human judge has a conversation with a human and a computer. If the judge can't tell the machine apart from the human, the machine has passed the test. I now propose a test for computer voices \u2014 the Ebert test. If a computer voice can successfully tell a joke and do the timing and delivery as well as Henny Youngman, then that's the voice I want.(Applause)", "id": 1121, "subtitle":

00:03:12.958\nfor saving my life.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:16.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nThere was a second surgery --\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nwhich held up for five or six days\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nand then it also fell apart.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nAnd then a third attempt,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nwhich also patched me back together pretty well,\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nuntil it failed.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nA doctor from Brazil said\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nhe had never seen anyone survive\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\na carotid artery rupture.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nAnd before I left the hospital,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nafter a year of being hospitalized,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nI had seven ruptures\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nof my carotid artery.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nThere was no particular day\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nwhen anyone told me\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nI would never speak again;\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nit just sort of became obvious.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nHuman speech\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nis an ingenious manipulation of our breath\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nwithin the sound chamber of our mouth\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nand respiratory system.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nWe need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nin order to form sounds.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nTherefore, the system\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nmust be essentially airtight\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nin order to capture air.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nBecause I had lost my jaw,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nI could no longer form a seal,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nand therefore my tongue\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nand all of my other vocal equipment\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nwas rendered powerless.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nDean Ornish: At first for a long time,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nI wrote messages in notebooks.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nThen I tried typing words on my laptop\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nand using its built in voice.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nThis was faster,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nand nobody had to try to read my handwriting.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nI tried out various computer voices that were available online,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nand for several months I had a British accent,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nwhich Chaz called Sir Lawrence.\"\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\n\"It was the clearest I could find.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nThen Apple released the Alex voice,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nwhich was the best I'd heard.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nIt knew things like the difference\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nbetween an exclamation point and a question mark.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nWhen it saw a period, it knew how to make a sentence\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nsound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nThere are all sorts of html codes you can use\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nto control the timing and inflection of computer voices,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nand I've experimented with them.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nFor me, they share a fundamental problem: they're too slow.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nWhen I find myself in a conversational situation,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nI need to type fast and to jump right in.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nPeople don't have the time or the patience\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nto wait for me to fool around with the codes\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nfor every word or phrase.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nBut what value do we place on the sound of our own voice?\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nHow does that affect who you are as a person?\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nWhen people hear Alex speaking my words,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\ndo they experience a disconnect?\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nDoes that create a separation or a distance\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nfrom one person to the next?\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nHow did I feel not being able to speak?\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nI felt, and I still feel,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\na lot of distance from the human mainstream.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nI've become uncomfortable when I'm separated from my laptop.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nEven then, I'm aware that most people have little patience\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nfor my speaking difficulties.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nSo Chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nusing my TV show voice\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nfrom a period of 30 years.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nAt first I was against it.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nI thought it would be creepy\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nto hear my own voice coming from a computer.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nThere was something comforting about a voice that was not my own.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nBut I decided then to just give it a try.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nSo we contacted a company in Scotland\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nthat created personalized computer voices.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nThey'd never made one from previously-recorded materials.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAll of their voices had been made by a speaker\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nrecording original words in a control booth.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nBut they were willing to give it a try.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nSo I sent them many hours of recordings of my voice,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nincluding several audio commentary tracks\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nthat I'd made for movies on DVDs.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nAnd it sounded like me, it really did.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nThere was a reason for that; it was me.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nBut it wasn't that simple.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nThe tapes from my TV show weren't very useful\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nbecause there were too many other kinds of audio involved --\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nmovie soundtracks, for example, or Gene Siskel arguing with me --\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nand my words often had a particular emphasis\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nthat didn't fit into a sentence well enough.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nI'll let you hear a sample of that voice.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nThese are a few of the comments I recorded for use\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nwhen Chaz and I appeared on the Oprah Winfrey program.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nAnd here's the voice we call Roger Jr.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nor Roger 2.0.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nRoger 2.0: Oprah, I can't tell you how great it is\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nto be back on your show.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nWe have been talking for a long time,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nand now here we are again.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nThis is the first version of my computer voice.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nIt still needs improvement,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nbut at least it sounds like me\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nand not like HAL 9000.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nWhen I heard it the first time,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nit sent chills down my spine.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nWhen I type anything,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nthis voice will speak whatever I type.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nWhen I read something, it will read in my voice.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nI have typed these words in advance,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nas I didn't think it would be thrilling\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nto sit here watching me typing.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nThe voice was created by a company in Scotland\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nnamed CereProc.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nIt makes me feel good\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nthat many of the words you are hearing were first spoken\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nwhile I was commenting on \"Casablanca\"\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nand \"Citizen Kane.\"\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nThis is the first voice they've created for an individual.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nThere are several very good voices available for computers,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nbut they all sound like somebody else,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nwhile this voice sounds like me.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nI plan to use it on television, radio\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nand the Internet.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nPeople who need a voice should know\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nthat most computers already come with built-in speaking systems.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nMany blind people use them\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nto read pages on the Web to themselves.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nBut I've got to say, in first grade,\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nthey said I talked too much,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nand now I still can.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nRoger Ebert: As you can hear, it sounds like me,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nbut the words jump up and down.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nThe flow isn't natural.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nThe good people in Scotland are still improving my voice,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nand I'm optimistic about it.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nBut so far, the Apple Alex voice\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nis the best one I've heard.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nI wrote a blog about it\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nand actually got a comment from the actor who played Alex.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nHe said he recorded many long hours in various intonations\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nto be used in the voice.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nA very large sample is needed.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nJohn Hunter: All my life I was a motormouth.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nNow I have spoken my last words,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nand I don't even remember for sure\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nwhat they were.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nI feel like the hero of that Harlan Ellison story\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.958\ntitled \"I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream.\"\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nOn Wednesday, David Christian explained to us\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nwhat a tiny instant the human race represents\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nin the time-span of the universe.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nFor almost all of its millions and billions of years,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nthere was no life on Earth at all.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nFor almost all the years of life on Earth,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nthere was no intelligent life.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nOnly after we learned to pass knowledge\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nfrom one generation to the next,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\ndid civilization become possible.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nIn cosmological terms,\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nthat was about 10 minutes ago.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nFinally came mankind's most advanced and mysterious tool,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nthe computer.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nThat has mostly happened in my lifetime.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nSome of the famous early computers\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nwere being built in my hometown of Urbana,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nthe birthplace of HAL 9000.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nWhen I heard the amazing talk\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nby Salman Khan on Wednesday,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nabout the Khan Academy website\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nthat teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nI had a flashback.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nIt was about 1960.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nAs a local newspaper reporter still in high school,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nI was sent over to the computer lab of the University of Illinois\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nto interview the creators\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nof something called PLATO.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nThe initials stood for Programmed Logic\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nfor Automated Teaching Operations.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nThis was a computer-assisted instruction system,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nwhich in those days ran on a computer named ILLIAC.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nThe programmers said it could assist students in their learning.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nI doubt, on that day 50 years ago,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nthey even dreamed of what Salman Khan has accomplished.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nBut that's not the point.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nThe point is PLATO was only 50 years ago,\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nan

I was born in Poland, now in the U.S. I started a group called Open Source Ecology. We've identified the 50 most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist \u2014 things from tractors, bread ovens, circuit makers. Then we set out to create an open source, DIY, do it yourself version that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost. We call this the Global Village Construction Set.So let me tell you a story. So I finished my 20s with a Ph.D. in fusion energy, and I discovered I was useless. I had no practical skills. The world presented me with options, and I took them. I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle. So I started a farm in Missouri and learned about the economics of farming. I bought a tractor \u2014 then it broke. I paid to get it repaired \u2014 then it broke again. Then pretty soon, I was broke too.I realized that the truly appropriate, low-cost tools that I needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just didn't exist yet. I needed tools that were robust, modular, highly efficient and optimized, low-cost, made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime, not designed for obsolescence. I found that I would have to build them myself. So I did just that. And I tested them. And I found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale.So then I published the 3D designs, schematics, instructional videos and budgets on a wiki. Then contributors from all over the world began showing up, prototyping new machines during dedicated project visits. So far, we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines. And now the project is beginning to grow on its own.We know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity. And the same is starting to happen with hardware too. We're focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people's lives in such tangible material ways. If we can lower the barriers to farming, building, manufacturing, then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential.That's not only in the developing world. Our tools are being made for the American farmer, builder, entrepreneur, maker. We've seen lots of excitement from these people, who can now start a construction business, parts manufacturing, organic CSA or just selling power back to the grid. Our goal is a repository of published designs so clear, so complete, that a single burned DVD is effectively a civilization starter kit.I've planted a hundred trees in a day. I've pressed 5,000 bricks in one day from the dirt beneath my feet and built a tractor in six days. From what I've seen, this is only the beginning.If this idea is truly sound, then the implications are significant. A greater distribution of the means of production, environmentally sound supply chains, and a newly relevant DIY maker culture can hope to transcend artificial scarcity. We're exploring the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hardware technology.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1122, "subtitle":

learned about the economics of farming.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nI bought a tractor -- then it broke.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nI paid to get it repaired --\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nthen it broke again.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nThen pretty soon,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nI was broke too.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nI realized\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nthat the truly appropriate, low-cost tools that I needed\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nto start a sustainable farm and settlement\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\njust didn't exist yet.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nI needed tools that were robust, modular,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nhighly efficient and optimized,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nlow-cost,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nmade from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime,\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nnot designed for obsolescence.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nI found that I would have to build them myself.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nSo I did just that.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nAnd I tested them.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nAnd I found that industrial productivity\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\ncan be achieved on a small scale.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nSo then I published the 3D designs,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nschematics,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\ninstructional videos and budgets\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\non a wiki.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nThen contributors from all over the world\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nbegan showing up, prototyping new machines\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nduring dedicated project visits.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nSo far, we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nAnd now the project\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nis beginning to grow on its own.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nWe know that open source has succeeded\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nwith tools for managing knowledge and creativity.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nAnd the same is starting to happen with hardware too.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nWe're focusing on hardware\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nbecause it is hardware that can change people's lives\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nin such tangible material ways.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nIf we can lower the barriers to farming, building, manufacturing,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nthen we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nThat's not only in the developing world.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nOur tools are being made\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nfor the American farmer, builder, entrepreneur, maker.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nWe've seen lots of excitement from these people,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nwho can now start a construction business,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nparts manufacturing,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\norganic CSA\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nor just selling power back to the grid.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nOur goal is a repository of published designs\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nso clear, so complete,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nthat a single burned DVD\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nis effectively a civilization starter kit.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nI've planted a hundred trees in a day.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nI've pressed 5,000 bricks in one day\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nfrom the dirt beneath my feet\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nand built a tractor in six days.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nFrom what I've seen, this is only the beginning.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nIf this idea is truly sound,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nthen the implications are significant.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nA greater distribution of the means of production,\n\n00:03:37.958 -->

"url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/susan_lim", "transcript": "So I was privileged to train in transplantation under two great surgical pioneers: Thomas Starzl, who performed the world's first successful liver transplant in 1967, and Sir Roy Calne, who performed the first liver transplant in the U.K. in the following year. I returned to Singapore and, in 1990, performed Asia's first successful cadaveric liver transplant procedure, but against all odds. Now when I look back, the transplant was actually the easiest part. Next, raising the money to fund the procedure. But perhaps the most challenging part was to convince the regulators \u2014 a matter which was debated in the parliament \u2014 that a young female surgeon be allowed the opportunity to pioneer for her country. But 20 years on, my patient, Surinder, is Asia's longest surviving cadaveric liver transplant to date. (Applause) And perhaps more important, I am the proud godmother to her 14 year-old son.(Applause)But not all patients on the transplant wait list are so fortunate. The truth is, there are just simply not enough donor organs to go around. As the demand for donor organs continues to rise, in large part due to the aging population, the supply has remained relatively constant. In the United States alone, 100,000 men, women and children are on the waiting list for donor organs, and more than a dozen die each day because of a lack of donor organs. The transplant community has actively campaigned in organ donation. And the gift of life has been extended from brain-dead donors to living, related donors \u2014 relatives who might donate an organ or a part of an organ, like a split liver graft, to a relative or loved one.But as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs, the gift of life was then extended from living, related donors to now living, unrelated donors. And this then has given rise to unprecedented and unexpected moral controversy. How can one distinguish a donation that is voluntary and altruistic from one that is forced or coerced from, for example, a submissive spouse, an in-law, a servant, a slave, an employee? Where and how can we draw the line? In my part of the world, too many people live below the poverty line. And in some areas, the commercial gifting of an organ in exchange for monetary reward has led to a flourishing trade in living, unrelated donors.Shortly after I performed the first liver transplant, I received my next assignment, and that was to go to the prisons to harvest organs from executed prisoners. I was also pregnant at the time. Pregnancies are meant to be happy and fulfilling moments in any woman's life. But my joyful period was marred by solemn and morbid thoughts \u2014 thoughts of walking through the prison's high-security death row, as this was the only route to take me to the makeshift operating room. And at each time, I would feel the chilling stares of condemned prisoners' eyes follow me. And for two years, I struggled with the dilemma of waking up at 4:30 am on a Friday morning, driving to the prison, getting down, gloved and scrubbed, ready to receive the body of an executed prisoner, remove the organs and then transport these organs to the recipient hospital and then graft the gift of life to a recipient the same afternoon. No doubt, I was informed, the consent had been obtained.But, in my life, the one fulfilling skill that I had was now invoking feelings of conflict \u2014 conflict ranging from extreme sorrow and doubt at dawn to celebratory joy at engrafting the gift of life at dusk. In my team, the lives of one or two of my colleagues were tainted by this experience. Some of us may have been sublimated, but really none of us remained the same. I was troubled that the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners was at least as morally controversial as the harvesting of stem cells from human embryos. And in my mind, I realized as a surgical pioneer that the purpose of my position of influence was surely to speak up for those who have no influence. It made me wonder if there could be a better way \u2014 a way to circumvent death and yet deliver the gift of life that might exponentially impact millions of patients worldwide.Now just about that time, the practice of surgery evolved from big to small, from wide open incisions to keyhole procedures, tiny incisions. And in transplantation, concepts shifted from whole organs to cells. In 1988, at the University of Minnesota, I participated in a small series of whole organ pancreas transplants. I witnessed the technical difficulty. And this inspired in my mind a shift from transplanting whole organs to perhaps transplanting cells. I thought to myself, why not take the individual cells out of the pancreas \u2014 the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes \u2014 and transplant these cells? \u2014 technically a much simpler procedure than having to grapple with the complexities of transplanting a whole organ.And at that time, stem cell research had gained momentum, following the isolation of the world's first human embryonic stem cells in the 1990s. The observation that stem cells, as master cells, could give rise to a whole variety of different cell types \u2014 heart cells, liver cells, pancreatic islet cells \u2014 captured the attention of the media and the imagination of the public. I too was fascinated by this new and disruptive cell technology, and this inspired a shift in my mindset, from transplanting whole organs to transplanting cells. And I focused my research on stem cells as a possible source for cell transplants.Today we realize that there are many different types of stem cells. Embryonic stem cells have occupied center stage, chiefly because of their pluripotency \u2014 that is their ease in differentiating into a variety of different cell types. But the moral controversy surrounding embryonic stem cells \u2014 the fact that these cells are derived from five-day old human embryos \u2014 has encouraged research into other types of stem cells.Now to the ridicule of my colleagues, I inspired my lab to focus on what I thought was the most non-controversial source of stem cells, adipose tissue, or fat, yes fat \u2014 nowadays available in abundant supply \u2014 you and I, I think, would be very happy to get rid of anyway. Fat-derived stem cells are adult stem cells. And adult stem cells are found in you and me \u2014 in our blood, in our bone marrow, in our fat, our skin and other organs. And as it turns out, fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells. But adult stem cells are not embryonic stem cells. And here is the limitation: adult stem cells are mature cells, and, like mature human beings, these cells are more restricted in their thought and more restricted in their behavior and are unable to give rise to the wide variety of specialized cell types, as embryonic stem cells [can].But in 2007, two remarkable individuals, Shinya Yamanaka of Japan and Jamie Thomson of the United States, made an astounding discovery. They discovered that adult cells, taken from you and me, could be reprogrammed back into embryonic-like cells, which they termed IPS cells, or induced pluripotent stem cells. And so guess what, scientists around the world and in the labs are racing to convert aging adult cells \u2014 aging adult cells from you and me \u2014 they are racing to reprogram these cells back into more useful IPS cells. And in our lab, we are focused on taking fat and reprogramming mounds of fat into fountains of youthful cells \u2014 cells that we may use to then form other, more specialized, cells, which one day may be used as cell transplants. If this research is successful, it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice human embryos.Indeed, there is a lot of hype, but also hope that the promise of stem cells will one day provide cures for a whole range of conditions. Heart disease, stroke, diabetes, spinal cord injury, muscular dystrophy, retinal eye diseases \u2014 are any of these conditions relevant, personally, to you?In May 2006, something horrible happened to me. I was about to start a robotic operation, but stepping out of the elevator into the bright and glaring lights of the operating room, I realized that my left visual field was fast collapsing into darkness. Earlier that week, I had taken a rather hard knock during late spring skiing \u2014 yes, I fell. And I started to see floaters and stars, which I casually dismissed as too much high-altitude sun exposure. What happened to me might have been catastrophic, if not for the fact that I was in reach of good surgical access. And I had my vision restored, but not before a prolonged period of convalescence \u2014 three months \u2014 in a head down position. This experience taught me to empathize more with my patients, and especially those with retinal diseases.37 million people worldwide are blind, and 127 million more suffer from impaired vision. Stem cell-derived retinal transplants, now in a research phase, may one day restore vision, or part vision, to millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide. Indeed, we live in both challenging as well as exciting times. As the world population ages, scientists are racing to discover new ways to enhance the power of the body to heal itself through stem cells.It is a fact that when our organs or tissues are injured, our bone marrow releases stem cells into our circulation. And these stem cells then float in the bloodstream and hone in to damaged organs to release growth factors to repair the damaged tissue. Stem cells may be used as building blocks to repair damaged scaffolds within our body, or to provide new liver cells to repair damaged liver. As we speak, there are 117 or so clinical trials researching the use of stem cells for liver diseases.What lies ahead? Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. 1.1 million Americans suffer heart attacks yearly. 4.8 million suffer cardiac failure. Stem cells may be used to deliver growth factors to repair damaged heart muscle or be differentiated into heart muscle cells to restore heart function. There are 170 clinical trials investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease. While still in a research phase, stem cells may one day herald a quantum leap in the field of cardiology.Stem cells provide hope for new beginnings \u2014 small, incremental steps, cells rather than organs, repair rather than replacement. Stem cell therapies may one day reduce the need for donor organs. Powerful new technologies always present enigmas. As we speak, the world's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury is currently underway following the USFDA approval. And in the U.K., neural stem cells to treat stroke are being investigated in a phase one trial.The research success that we celebrate today has been made possible by the curiosity and contribution and commitment of individual scientists and medical pioneers. Each one has his story. My story has been about my journey from organs to cells \u2014 a journey through controversy, inspired by hope \u2014 hope that, as we age, you and I may one day celebrate longevity with an improved quality of life.Thank you.", "id": 1124, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nSo I was privileged to train in

00:03:34.958\nin living, unrelated donors.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nShortly after I performed the first liver transplant,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nI received my next assignment,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nand that was to go to the prisons\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nto harvest organs\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nfrom executed prisoners.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nI was also pregnant at the time.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nPregnancies are meant\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nto be happy and fulfilling

--\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nthoughts of walking through\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nthe prison's high-security death row,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nas this was the only route\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nto take me to the makeshift operating room.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nAnd at each time,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nI would feel the chilling stares\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nof condemned prisoners' eyes follow me.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nAnd for two years,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nI struggled with the dilemma\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nof waking up at 4:30 am\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\non a Friday morning,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\ndriving to the prison,\n\n00:04:35.958 -->

graft the gift of life\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nto a recipient the same afternoon.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nNo doubt, I was informed,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nthe consent had been obtained.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nBut, in my life,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nthe one fulfilling skill that I had\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nwas now invoking feelings of conflict --\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nconflict ranging\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nfrom extreme sorrow and doubt at dawn\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nto celebratory

colleagues\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nwere tainted by this experience.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nSome of us may have been sublimated,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nbut really none of us remained the same.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nI was troubled\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nthat the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nwas at least as morally controversial\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nas the harvesting of stem cells\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nfrom human embryos.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nAnd in my mind,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nI realized as a surgical pioneer\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nthat the purpose of my position of influence\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nwas surely to speak up\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nfor those who have no influence.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nIt made me wonder\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nif there could be a better way --\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\na way to circumvent death\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nand yet deliver the gift of life\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nthat might exponentially impact\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nmillions of patients worldwide.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nNow just about that time,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nthe practice of surgery evolved\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nfrom big to small,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nfrom wide open incisions\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nto keyhole procedures,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\ntiny incisions.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nAnd in transplantation, concepts shifted\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nfrom whole organs to cells.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nIn 1988, at the University of Minnesota,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nI participated in a small series\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nof whole organ pancreas

transplanting whole organs\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nto perhaps transplanting cells.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nI thought to myself,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nwhy not take the individual cells\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nout of the pancreas --\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nthe cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes --\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nand transplant these cells? --\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\ntechnically a much simpler procedure\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nthan having to grapple with the complexities\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nof transplanting a whole organ.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nAnd at that time,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nstem cell research\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nhad gained momentum,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nfollowing the isolation of the world's first\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nhuman embryonic stem cells\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nin the 1990s.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nThe observation that stem cells, as master cells,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\ncould give rise\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nto a whole variety of different cell types --\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nheart cells, liver cells,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\npancreatic islet cells --\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\ncaptured the attention of the media\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nand the imagination of the public.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nI too was fascinated\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nby this new and disruptive cell technology,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nand this inspired a shift in my mindset,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nfrom transplanting whole organs\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nto transplanting cells.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nAnd I focused my research on stem cells\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nas a possible source\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nfor cell transplants.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nToday we realize\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nthat there are many different types of stem cells.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nEmbryonic stem cells\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nhave occupied center stage,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nchiefly because of their pluripotency --\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nthat is their ease in differentiating\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\ninto a variety of different cell types.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nBut the moral controversy\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nsurrounding embryonic stem cells --\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nthe fact that these cells are derived\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nfrom five-day old human embryos --\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nhas encouraged research\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\ninto other types of stem cells.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nNow to the ridicule of my colleagues,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nI inspired my lab\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nto focus on what I thought\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nwas the most non-controversial source of stem cells,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nadipose tissue, or fat, yes fat --\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nnowadays available in abundant supply --\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nyou and I, I think, would be very happy to get rid of anyway.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nFat-derived stem cells\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nare adult stem cells.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nAnd adult stem

organs.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nAnd as it turns out,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nfat is one of the best sources\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nof adult stem cells.\n\n00:09:36.958

00:09:46.958\nadult stem cells are mature cells,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nand, like mature human beings,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nthese cells are more restricted in their thought\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nand more restricted in their behavior\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nand are unable to give rise\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nto the wide variety of

discovery.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nThey discovered\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nthat adult cells, taken from you and me,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\ncould be

stem cells.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nAnd so guess what,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nscientists around the world and in the labs\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nare

fact\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nthat I was in reach of good surgical access.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nAnd I had my vision restored,\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nbut not before a prolonged period of convalescence --\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nthree months --\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nin a head down position.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nThis experience\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\ntaught me to empathize more with my patients,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nand especially those with retinal diseases.\n\n00:12:50.958 -->

"transcript": "My students often ask me, \"What is sociology?\" And I tell them it's the study of the way in which human beings are shaped by things that they don't see. And they say, \"So, how can I be a sociologist? How can I understand those invisible forces?\" And I say, \"Empathy. Start with empathy. It all begins with empathy. Take yourself out of your shoes, put yourself into the shoes of another person.\"Here, I'll give you an example. So I imagine my life if, a hundred years ago, China had been the most powerful nation in the world and they came to the United States in search of coal. And they found it, and, in fact, they found lots of it right here. And pretty soon, they began shipping that coal, ton by ton, railcar by railcar, boatload by boatload, back to China and elsewhere around the world. And they got fabulously wealthy in doing so. And they built beautiful cities all powered on that coal. And back here in the United States, we saw economic despair, deprivation. This is what I saw. I saw people struggling to get by, not knowing what was what and what was next. And I asked myself the question: How is it possible that we could be so poor here in the United States, because coal is such a wealthy resource; it's so much money? And I realize: because the Chinese ingratiated themselves with a small ruling class here in the United States, who stole all of that money and all of that wealth for themselves. And the rest of us, the vast majority of us, struggle to get by. And the Chinese gave this small ruling elite loads of military weapons and sophisticated technology in order to ensure that people like me would not speak out against this relationship. Does this sound familiar?And they did things like train Americans to help protect the coal. And everywhere, there were symbols of the Chinese \u2014 everywhere, a constant reminder. And back in China, what do they say in China? Nothing! They don't talk about us. They don't talk about the coal. If you ask them, they'll say, \"Well, you know, we need the coal. I mean, come on, I'm not going to turn down my thermostat. You can't expect that.\" And so, I get angry, and I get pissed, as do lots of average people. And we fight back, and it gets really ugly. And the Chinese respond in a very ugly way. And before we know it, they send in the tanks and they send in the troops. And lots of people are dying. And it's a very, very difficult situation.Can you imagine what you would feel if you were in my shoes? Can you imagine walking out of this building and seeing a tank sitting out there, or a truck full of soldiers? Just imagine what you would feel, because you know why they're here; you know what they're doing here. And you just feel the anger and you feel the fear. If you can, that's empathy. That's empathy. You've left your shoes, and you've stood in mine. And you've got to feel that.OK, so that's the warm-up. That's the warm-up. Now we're going to have the real radical experiment. So, for the remainder of my talk, what I want you to do is put yourselves in the shoes of an ordinary Arab Muslim living in the Middle East \u2014 in particular, in Iraq. And so to help you, perhaps you're a member of this middle-class family in Baghdad. What you want is the best for your kids. You want your kids to have a better life. And you watch the news, you pay attention. You read the newspaper, you go down to the coffee shop with your friends, you read the newspapers from around the world. Sometimes you even watch satellite, CNN, from the United States. You have a sense of what the Americans are thinking. But really, you just want a better life for yourself. That's what you want. You're Arab Muslim living in Iraq. You want a better life for yourself.So here, let me help you. Let me help you with some things that you might be thinking. Number one: this incursion into your land these past 20 years and before \u2014 the reason anyone is interested in your land, and particularly the United States, is oil. It's all about oil; you know that, everybody knows that. People back in the United States know it's about oil. It's because somebody else has a design for your resource. It's your resource \u2014 it's not somebody else's. It's your land; it's your resource. Somebody else has a design for it. And you know why they have a design? You know why they have their eyes set on it? Because they have an entire economic system that's dependent on that oil \u2014 foreign oil, oil from other parts of the world that they don't own.And what else do you think about these people? The Americans, they're rich. Come on, they live in big houses, they have big cars. They all have blond hair, blue eyes. They're happy. You think that. It's not true, of course, but that's the media impression. And that's what you get. And they have big cities, and the cities are all dependent on oil. And back home, what do you see? Poverty, despair, struggle. Look, you don't live in a wealthy country. I mean \u2014 this is Iraq. This is what you see. You see people struggling to get by. It's not easy; you see a lot of poverty. And you feel something about this. These people have designs for your resource, and this is what you see?Something else you see that you talk about \u2014 Americans don't talk about this, but you do \u2014 there's this thing, this militarization of the world, and it's centered right in the United States. And the United States is responsible for almost one half of the world's military spending. Four percent of the world's population! And you feel it; you see it every day. It's part of your life. And you talk about it with your friends. You read about it. And back when Saddam Hussein was in power, the Americans didn't care about his crimes. When he was gassing the Kurds and gassing Iran, they didn't care about it. When oil was at stake, somehow, suddenly, things mattered. And what you see, something else: the United States, the hub of democracy around the world \u2014 they don't seem to really be supporting democratic countries all around the world. There are a lot of countries, oil-producing countries, that aren't very democratic, but supported by the United States. That's odd.Oh \u2014 these incursions, these two wars, the 10 years of sanctions, the eight years of occupation, the insurgency that's been unleashed on your people, the tens of thousands, the hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths? All because of oil. You can't help but think that. You talk about it. It's in the forefront of your mind, always. You say, \"How is that possible?\" And this man, he's everyman \u2014 your grandfather, your uncle, your father, your son, your neighbor, your professor, your student. Once a life of happiness and joy and suddenly, pain and sorrow. Everyone in your country has been touched by the violence, the bloodshed, the pain, the horror \u2014 everybody. Not a single person in your country has not been touched.But there's something else. There's something else about these people, these Americans who are there. There's something else about them that you see that they don't see themselves. And what do you see? They're Christians! They're Christians. They worship the Christian God, they have crosses, they carry Bibles. Their Bibles have a little insignia that says \"US Army\" on them. And their leaders, their leaders: before they send their sons and daughters off to war in your country \u2014 and you know the reason \u2014 before they send them off, they go to a Christian church, and they pray to their Christian God, and they ask for protection and guidance from that god. Why? Well, obviously, when people die in the war, they are Muslims, they are Iraqis \u2014 they're not Americans. You don't want Americans to die \u2014 \"Protect Our Troops.\" And you feel something about that \u2014 of course you do. And they do wonderful things. You read about it, you hear about it. They're there to build schools and help people. That's what they want to do. They do wonderful things, but they also do the bad things, and you can't tell the difference.And this guy, you get a guy like Lt. Gen. William Boykin. Here's a guy who says that your god is a false god. Your god's an idol; his god is the true god. The solution to the problem in the Middle East, according to him, is to convert you all to Christianity \u2014 just get rid of your religion. And you know that. Americans don't read about this guy. They don't know anything about him, but you do. You pass it around. You pass his words around. I mean, this is serious. You're afraid. He was one of the leading commanders in the second invasion of Iraq. And you're thinking, \"My God, if this guy is saying that, then all the soldiers must be saying that.\" And this word here \u2014 George Bush called this war a crusade. Man, the Americans, they're just like, \"Ah, crusade. Whatever. I don't know what that means.\" You know what it means \u2014 it's a holy war against Muslims. Look, invade, subdue them, take their resources. If they won't submit, kill them. That's what this is about. And you're thinking, \"My God, these Christians are coming to kill us.\" This is frightening. You feel frightened. Of course you feel frightened.And this man, Terry Jones: I mean here's a guy who wants to burn Qurans, right? And the Americans: \"Ah, he's a knucklehead. He's a former hotel manager; he's got three dozen members of his church ...\" They laugh him off. You don't laugh him off, because in the context of everything else, all the pieces fit. Of course this is how Americans think. So people all over the Middle East, not just in your country, are protesting. \"He wants to burn Qurans, our holy book. These Christians \u2014 who are these Christians? They're so evil, they're so mean \u2014 this is what they're about?\" This is what you're thinking as an Arab Muslim, as an Iraqi. Of course you're going to think this.And then your cousin says, \"Hey coz, check out this website. You've got to see this \u2014 Bible Boot Camp. These Christians are nuts! They're training their little kids to be soldiers for Jesus. They take little kids and run them through these things till they teach them how to say, 'Sir! Yes, sir!' and things like 'grenade toss' and 'weapons care and maintenance.' And go to the website \u2014 it says 'US Army' right on it. I mean, these Christians, they're nuts. How can they do this to their little kids?\" And you're reading this website. And of course, Christians in the United States, or anybody, says, \"This is some little church in the middle of nowhere.\" You don't know that. For you, this is like, all Christians. It's all over the Web: \"Bible Boot Camp.\" And look at this. They even teach their kids \u2014 they train them in the same way the US Marines train. Isn't that interesting. And it scares you, and it frightens you.So these guys, you see them. You see, I, Sam Richards \u2014 I know who these guys are. They're my students, my friends; I know what they're thinking. You don't know. When you see them, they're something else. They're something else. That's what they are to you. We don't see it that way in the United States, but you see it that way. So here. Of course, you've got it wrong. You're generalizing. It's wrong. You don't understand the Americans. It's not a Christian invasion. We're not just there for oil; we're there for lots of reasons. You have it wrong. You've missed it. And of course, most of you don't support the insurgency; you don't support killing Americans; you don't support the terrorists. Of course you don't. Very few people do. But \u2014 some of you do. And this is a perspective. OK. So now, here's what we're going to do.Step outside of your shoes that you're in right now, and step back into your normal shoes. So everyone's back in the room. OK? Now here comes the radical experiment. So we're all back home. This photo: this woman \u2014 man, I feel her. I feel her. She's my sister, my wife, my cousin, my neighbor. She's anybody to me. These guys standing there, everybody in the photo \u2014 I feel this photo, man. So here's what I want you to do.Let's go back to my first example, of the Chinese. I want you to go there. It's all about coal, and the Chinese are here in the United States. What I want you to do is picture her as a Chinese woman receiving a Chinese flag because her loved one has died in America in the coal uprising. And the soldiers are Chinese, and everybody else is Chinese. As an American, how do you feel about this picture? What do you think about that scene?OK, try this. Bring it back. This is the scene here. It's an American, American soldiers, American woman who lost her loved one in the Middle East, in Iraq or Afghanistan. Now, put yourself in the shoes, go back to the shoes of an Arab Muslim living in Iraq. What are you feeling and thinking about this photo, about this woman?OK, now follow me on this, because I'm taking a big risk here. And so I'm going to invite you to take a risk with me. These gentlemen here, they're insurgents. They were caught by the American soldiers, trying to kill Americans. And maybe they succeeded. Maybe they succeeded. Put yourself in the shoes of the Americans who caught them. Can you feel the rage? Can you feel that you just want to take these guys and wring their necks? Can you go there? It shouldn't be that difficult. You just \u2014 oh, man. Now, put yourself in their shoes. Are they brutal killers or patriotic defenders? Which one? Can you feel their anger, their fear, their rage at what has happened in their country? Can you imagine that maybe one of them, in the morning, bent down to their child and hugged their child and said, \"Dear, I'll be back later. I'm going out to defend your freedom, your lives. I'm going out to look out for us, the future of our country.\" Can you imagine that? Can you imagine saying that? Can you go there? What do you think they're feeling? You see, that's empathy. It's also understanding.[understand]Now, you might ask, \"OK, Sam, so why do you do this sort of thing? Why would you use this example of all examples?\" And I say, because. You're allowed to hate these people. You're allowed to just hate them with every fiber of your being. And if I can get you to step into their shoes and walk an inch \u2014 one tiny inch \u2014 then imagine the kind of sociological analysis that you can do in all other aspects of your life. You can walk a mile when it comes to understanding why that person's driving 40 miles per hour in the passing lane; or your teenage son; or your neighbor who annoys you by cutting his lawn on Sunday mornings. Whatever it is, you can go so far. And this is what I tell my students: step outside of your tiny, little world. Step inside of the tiny, little world of somebody else. And then do it again and do it again and do it again. And suddenly, all these tiny, little worlds, they come together in this complex web. And they build a big, complex world. And suddenly, without realizing it, you're seeing the world differently. Everything has changed. Everything in your life has changed. And that's, of course, what this is about.Attend to other lives, other visions. Listen to other people, enlighten ourselves. I'm not saying that I support the terrorists in Iraq.

country.\"\n\n00:15:41.038 --> 00:15:42.335\nCan you imagine that?\n\n00:15:42.359 --> 00:15:43.862\nCan you imagine saying that?\n\n00:15:45.086 --> 00:15:46.502\nCan you go there?\n\n00:15:49.658 --> 00:15:51.393\nWhat do you think they're feeling?\n\n00:15:59.681 --> 00:16:01.086\nYou see, that's empathy.\n\n00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.284\nIt's also understanding.\n\n00:16:03.308 --> 00:16:04.936\n[understand]\n\n00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.268\nNow, you might ask,\n\n00:16:06.292 --> 00:16:09.559\n\"OK, Sam, so why do you\ndo this sort of thing?\n\n00:16:09.583 --> 00:16:11.943\nWhy would you use\nthis example of all examples?\"\n\n00:16:11.967 --> 00:16:14.634\nAnd I say, because.\n\n00:16:14.658 --> 00:16:16.459\nYou're allowed to hate these people.\n\n00:16:16.483 --> 00:16:21.634\nYou're allowed to just hate them\nwith every fiber of your being.\n\n00:16:21.658 --> 00:16:25.435\nAnd if I can get you\nto step into their shoes\n\n00:16:25.459 --> 00:16:29.016\nand walk an inch -- one tiny inch --\n\n00:16:29.838 --> 00:16:32.552\nthen imagine the kind\nof sociological analysis\n\n00:16:32.576 --> 00:16:36.194\nthat you can do in all other\naspects of your life.\n\n00:16:37.226 --> 00:16:38.634\nYou can walk a mile\n\n00:16:38.658 --> 00:16:43.729\nwhen it comes to understanding why\nthat person's driving 40 miles per hour\n\n00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:45.150\nin the passing lane;\n\n00:16:45.951 --> 00:16:47.622\nor your teenage son;\n\n00:16:48.332 --> 00:16:51.975\nor your neighbor who annoys you\nby cutting his lawn on Sunday mornings.\n\n00:16:51.999 --> 00:16:54.855\nWhatever it is, you can go so far.\n\n00:16:55.459 --> 00:16:57.554\nAnd this is what I tell my students:\n\n00:16:57.578 --> 00:17:01.070\nstep outside of your tiny, little world.\n\n00:17:01.094 --> 00:17:05.606\nStep inside of the tiny,\nlittle world of somebody else.\n\n00:17:05.847 --> 00:17:07.288\nAnd then do it again\n\n00:17:07.312 --> 00:17:09.011\nand do it again and do it again.\n\n00:17:09.035 --> 00:17:11.144\nAnd suddenly, all these tiny,\nlittle worlds,\n\n00:17:11.168 --> 00:17:13.420\nthey come together in this complex web.\n\n00:17:13.444 --> 00:17:16.514\nAnd they build a big, complex world.\n\n00:17:16.538 --> 00:17:18.917\nAnd suddenly, without realizing it,\n\n00:17:18.941 --> 00:17:21.118\nyou're seeing the world differently.\n\n00:17:21.142 --> 00:17:22.905\nEverything has changed.\n\n00:17:22.929 --> 00:17:24.672\nEverything in your life has changed.\n\n00:17:25.779 -->

--> 00:17:45.968\nBut as a sociologist, what I am saying is:\n\n00:17:46.658 --> 00:17:49.407\nI understand.\n\n00:17:50.658 --> 00:17:54.886\nAnd now perhaps -- perhaps -- you do,

"https://www.ted.com/talks/kathryn_schulz_on_being_wrong", "transcript": "So it's 1995, I'm in college, and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence, Rhode Island to Portland, Oregon. And you know, we're young and unemployed, so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests \u2014 basically the longest route we can possibly take. And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota, I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that's been bothering me for 2,000 miles. \"What's up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road?\" My friend looks at me totally blankly. There's actually a gentleman in the front row who's doing a perfect imitation of her look. (Laughter) And I'm like, \"You know, all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them.\" She just stares at me for a few moments, and then she cracks up, because she figures out what I'm talking about. And what I'm talking about is this. (Laughter) Right, the famous Chinese character for picnic area.(Laughter)I've spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this \u2014 why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us, and how we behave when that happens, and what all of this can tell us about human nature. In other words, as you heard Chris say, I've spent the last five years thinking about being wrong. This might strike you as a strange career move, but it actually has one great advantage: no job competition. (Laughter) In fact, most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong, or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong. We get it in the abstract. We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes. The human species, in general, is fallible \u2014 okay fine.But when it comes down to me, right now, to all the beliefs I hold, here in the present tense, suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window \u2014 and I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about. And the thing is, the present tense is where we live. We go to meetings in the present tense; we go on family vacations in the present tense; we go to the polls and vote in the present tense. So effectively, we all kind of wind up traveling through life, trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything.I think this is a problem. I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals, in our personal and professional lives, and I think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture. So what I want to do today is, first of all, talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right. And second, why it's such a problem. And finally, I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so, it is the single greatest moral, intellectual and creative leap you can make.So why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right? One reason, actually, has to do with a feeling of being wrong. So let me ask you guys something \u2014 or actually, let me ask you guys something, because you're right here: How does it feel \u2014 emotionally \u2014 how does it feel to be wrong? Dreadful. Thumbs down. Embarrassing. Okay, wonderful, great. Dreadful, thumbs down, embarrassing \u2014 thank you, these are great answers, but they're answers to a different question. You guys are answering the question: How does it feel to realize you're wrong? (Laughter) Realizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things, right? I mean it can be devastating, it can be revelatory, it can actually be quite funny, like my stupid Chinese character mistake. But just being wrong doesn't feel like anything.I'll give you an analogy. Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon where there's this pathetic coyote who's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner? In pretty much every episode of this cartoon, there's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff, which is fine \u2014 he's a bird, he can fly. But the thing is, the coyote runs off the cliff right after him. And what's funny \u2014 at least if you're six years old \u2014 is that the coyote's totally fine too. He just keeps running \u2014 right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he's in mid-air. That's when he falls. When we're wrong about something \u2014 not when we realize it, but before that \u2014 we're like that coyote after he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down. You know, we're already wrong, we're already in trouble, but we feel like we're on solid ground. So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago. It does feel like something to be wrong; it feels like being right.(Laughter)So this is one reason, a structural reason, why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness. I call this error blindness. Most of the time, we don't have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we're wrong about something, until it's too late. But there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well \u2014 and this one is cultural. Think back for a moment to elementary school. You're sitting there in class, and your teacher is handing back quiz papers, and one of them looks like this. This is not mine, by the way. (Laughter) So there you are in grade school, and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper. It's the dumb kid, the troublemaker, the one who never does his homework. So by the time you are nine years old, you've already learned, first of all, that people who get stuff wrong are lazy, irresponsible dimwits \u2014 and second of all, that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes.We learn these really bad lessons really well. And a lot of us \u2014 and I suspect, especially a lot of us in this room \u2014 deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students, perfectionists, over-achievers. Right, Mr. CFO, astrophysicist, ultra-marathoner? (Laughter) You're all CFO, astrophysicists, ultra-marathoners, it turns out. Okay, so fine. Except that then we freak out at the possibility that we've gotten something wrong. Because according to this, getting something wrong means there's something wrong with us. So we just insist that we're right, because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe.So let me tell you a story. A couple of years ago, a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery. Beth Israel's in Boston. It's the teaching hospital for Harvard \u2014 one of the best hospitals in the country. So this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room. She's anesthetized, the surgeon does his thing \u2014 stitches her back up, sends her out to the recovery room. Everything seems to have gone fine. And she wakes up, and she looks down at herself, and she says, \"Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages?\" Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one. When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident, he said something very interesting. He said, \"For whatever reason, the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient.\" (Laughter) The point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous.This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world. And when we act like it is, and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong, well that's when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, or torpedoing the global economy. So this is a huge practical problem. But it's also a huge social problem.Think for a moment about what it means to feel right. It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality. And when you feel that way, you've got a problem to solve, which is, how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you? It turns out, most of us explain those people the same way, by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions. The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they're ignorant. They don't have access to the same information that we do, and when we generously share that information with them, they're going to see the light and come on over to our team. When that doesn't work, when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us, then we move on to a second assumption, which is that they're idiots. (Laughter) They have all the right pieces of the puzzle, and they are too moronic to put them together correctly. And when that doesn't work, when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart, then we move on to a third assumption: they know the truth, and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes. So this is a catastrophe.This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly. But to me, what's most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human. It's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds. And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing. That is not true, and if it were, life would be incredibly boring. The miracle of your mind isn't that you can see the world as it is. It's that you can see the world as it isn't. We can remember the past, and we can think about the future, and we can imagine what it's like to be some other person in some other place. And we all do this a little differently, which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this. And yeah, it is also why we get things wrong.1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing about \"I think therefore I am,\" this guy, St. Augustine, sat down and wrote \"Fallor ergo sum\" \u2014 \"I err therefore I am.\" Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up, it's not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system, something we can eradicate or overcome. It's totally fundamental to who we are. Because, unlike God, we don't really know what's going on out there. And unlike all of the other animals, we are obsessed with trying to figure it out. To me, this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity.Last year, for various reasons, I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the Public Radio show This American Life. And so I'm listening and I'm listening, and at some point, I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong. And my first thought was, \"I've lost it. I've become the crazy wrongness lady. I just imagined it everywhere,\" which has happened. But a couple of months later, I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass, who's the host of the show. And I mentioned this to him, and he was like, \"No actually, that's true. In fact,\" he says, \"as a staff, we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto-theme. And the crypto-theme is: 'I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead.' And the thing is,\" says Ira Glass, \"we need this. We need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work.\" And for the rest of us, audience members, as listeners, as readers, we eat this stuff up. We love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings. When it comes to our stories, we love being wrong.But, you know, our stories are like this because our lives are like this. We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead. George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq, find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction, liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East. And something else happened instead. And Hosni Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life, until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son. And something else happened instead. And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together. And something else happened instead. And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize. And something else happened instead.(Laughter)I mean, this is life. For good and for ill, we generate these incredible stories about the world around us, and then the world turns around and astonishes us. No offense, but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong. We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements, but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements? Because half the stuff that's the most mind-boggling and world-altering \u2014 TED 1998 \u2014 eh. (Laughter) Didn't really work out that way, did it? (Laughter) Where's my jet pack, Chris?(Laughter)(Applause)So here we are again. And that's how it goes. We come up with another idea. We tell another story. We hold another conference. The theme of this one, as you guys have now heard seven million times, is the rediscovery of wonder. And to me, if you really want to rediscover wonder, you need to step outside of that tiny, terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say, \"Wow, I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.\"Thank you.(Applause)Thank you guys.(Applause)", "id": 1126, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nSo it's

back roads\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nthrough state parks\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nand national forests --\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nbasically the longest route we can possibly take.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nAnd somewhere in the middle of South Dakota,\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nI turn to my friend\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nand I ask her a question\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nthat's been bothering me\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nfor 2,000 miles.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:55.958\n\"What's up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road?\"\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nMy friend looks at me totally blankly.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nThere's actually a gentleman in the front row\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nwho's doing a perfect imitation of her look.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nAnd I'm like, \"You know,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nall the signs we keep seeing\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nwith the Chinese character on them.\"\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nShe just stares at me for a few moments,\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nand then she cracks up,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nbecause she figures out what I'm talking about.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nAnd what I'm talking about is this.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:35.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nRight, the famous Chinese character for picnic area.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nI've spent the last five years of my life\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nthinking about situations\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nexactly like this --\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nwhy we sometimes misunderstand\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nthe signs around us,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nand how we behave when that happens,\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nand what all of this can tell us about human nature.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nIn other words, as you heard Chris say,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nI've spent the last five years\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nthinking about being wrong.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nThis might strike you as a strange career move,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nbut it actually has one great advantage:\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nno job competition.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nIn fact, most of us do everything we can\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nto avoid thinking about being wrong,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nor at least to avoid thinking about the possibility\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nthat we ourselves are wrong.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nWe get it in the abstract.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nWe all know everybody in this room makes mistakes.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nThe human species, in general, is fallible -- okay fine.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nBut when it comes down to me, right now,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nto all the beliefs I hold,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nhere in the present tense,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nsuddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\ngoes out the window --\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nand I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nAnd the thing is, the present tense is where we live.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nWe go to meetings in the present tense;\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nwe go on family vacations in the present tense;\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nwe go to the polls and vote in the present tense.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nSo effectively, we all kind of wind up traveling through life,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\ntrapped in this little bubble\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nof feeling very right about everything.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nI think this is a problem.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nI think it's a problem for each of us as individuals,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nin our personal and professional lives,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nand I think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nSo what I want to do today\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nis, first of all, talk about why we get stuck\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\ninside this feeling of being right.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nAnd second, why it's such a problem.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nAnd finally, I want to convince you\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nthat it is possible\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nto step outside of that feeling\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nand that if you can do so,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nit is the single greatest\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nmoral, intellectual and creative leap you can make.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nSo why do we get stuck\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nin this feeling of being right?\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nOne reason, actually, has to do with a feeling of being wrong.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nSo let me ask you guys something --\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nor actually, let me ask you guys something, because you're right here:\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nHow does it feel -- emotionally --\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nhow does it feel to be wrong?\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nDreadful. Thumbs down.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nEmbarrassing. Okay, wonderful, great.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nDreadful, thumbs down, embarrassing --\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nthank you, these are great answers,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nbut they're answers to a different question.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nYou guys are answering the question:\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nHow does it feel to realize you're wrong?\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nRealizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things, right?\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nI mean it can be devastating, it can be revelatory,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nit can actually be quite funny,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nlike my stupid Chinese character mistake.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nBut just being wrong\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\ndoesn't feel like anything.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nI'll give you an analogy.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nDo you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nwhere there's this pathetic coyote\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nwho's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner?\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nIn pretty much every episode of this cartoon,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nthere's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nand the roadrunner runs off a cliff,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nwhich is fine -- he's a bird, he can fly.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nBut the thing is, the coyote runs off the cliff right after him.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nAnd what's funny --\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nat least if you're six years old --\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nis that the coyote's totally fine too.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nHe just keeps running --\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nright up until the moment that he looks down\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nand realizes that he's in mid-air.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nThat's when he falls.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nWhen we're wrong about something --\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nnot when we realize it, but before that --\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nwe're like that coyote\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nafter he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nYou know, we're already wrong,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nwe're already in trouble,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nbut we feel like we're on solid ground.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nSo I should actually correct something I said a moment ago.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nIt does feel like something to be wrong;\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nit feels like being right.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nSo this is one reason, a structural reason,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nwhy we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nI call this error blindness.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nMost of the time,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nwe don't have any kind of internal cue\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nto let us know that we're wrong about something,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nuntil it's too late.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nBut there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well --\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nand this one is cultural.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nThink back for a moment to elementary school.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nYou're sitting there in class,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nand your teacher is handing back quiz papers,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nand one of them looks like this.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nThis is not mine, by the way.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nSo there you are in grade school,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand you know exactly what to think\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nabout the kid who got this paper.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nIt's the dumb kid, the troublemaker,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nthe one who never does his homework.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nSo by the time you are nine years old,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nyou've already learned, first of all,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nthat people who get stuff wrong\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nare lazy, irresponsible dimwits --\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nand second of all,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nthat the way to succeed in life\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nis to never make any mistakes.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nWe learn these really bad lessons really well.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nAnd a lot of us --\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nand I suspect, especially a lot of us in this room --\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\ndeal with them by just becoming\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nperfect little A students,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nperfectionists, over-achievers.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nRight,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nMr. CFO, astrophysicist, ultra-marathoner?\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nYou're all CFO, astrophysicists, ultra-marathoners, it turns out.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nOkay, so fine.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nExcept that then we freak out\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nat the possibility that we've gotten something wrong.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nBecause according to this,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\ngetting something wrong\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nmeans there's something wrong with us.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nSo we just insist that we're right,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nbecause it makes us feel smart and responsible\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nand virtuous and safe.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nSo let me tell you a story.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nA couple of years ago,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\na woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nBeth Israel's in Boston.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nIt's the teaching hospital for Harvard --\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\none of the best hospitals in the country.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nSo this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nShe's anesthetized, the surgeon does his thing --\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nstitches her back up, sends her out to the recovery room.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nEverything seems to have gone fine.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nAnd she wakes up, and she looks down at herself,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nand she says, \"Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages?\"\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nWell the wrong side of her body is in bandages\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nbecause the surgeon has performed a major operation\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\non her left leg instead of her right one.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nWhen the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nspoke about this incident,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nhe said something very interesting.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nHe said, \"For whatever reason,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nthe surgeon simply felt\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nthat he was on the correct side of the patient.\"\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nThe point of this story\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nis that trusting too much in the feeling\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nof being on the correct side of anything\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\ncan be very dangerous.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nThis internal sense of rightness\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nthat we all experience so often\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nis not a reliable guide\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nto what is actually going on in the external world.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nAnd when we act like it is,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nand we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nwell that's when we end up doing things\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nlike dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nor torpedoing the global economy.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nSo this is a huge practical problem.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nBut it's also a huge social problem.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nThink for a moment about what it means to feel right.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nIt means that you think that your beliefs\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\njust perfectly reflect reality.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nAnd when you feel that way,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nyou've got a problem to solve,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nwhich is, how are you going to explain\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nall of those people who disagree with you?\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nIt turns out, most of us explain those people the same way,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nby resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nThe first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nis we just assume they're ignorant.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nThey don't have access to the same information that we do,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nand when we generously share that information with them,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nthey're going to see the light and come on over to our team.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nWhen that doesn't work,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nwhen it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nand they still disagree with us,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nthen we move on to a second assumption,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nwhich is that they're idiots.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nThey have all the right pieces of the puzzle,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nand they are too moronic to put them together correctly.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nAnd when that doesn't work,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nwhen it turns out that people who disagree with us\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nhave all the same facts we do\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nand are actually pretty smart,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nthen we move on to a third assumption:\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nthey know the truth,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nand they are deliberately distorting it\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nfor their own malevolent purposes.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nSo this is a catastrophe.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nThis attachment to our own rightness\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nkeeps us from preventing mistakes\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nwhen we absolutely need to\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nand causes us to treat each other terribly.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nBut to me, what's most baffling\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nand most tragic about this\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nis that it misses the whole point of being human.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nIt's like we want to imagine\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nthat our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nand we just gaze out of them\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nand describe the world as it unfolds.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nAnd we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nand see the exact same thing.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nThat is not true,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nand if it were, life would be incredibly boring.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nThe miracle of your mind\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nisn't that you can see the world as it is.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nIt's that you can see the world as it isn't.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nWe can remember the past,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nand we can think about the future,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nand we can imagine what it's like\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nto be some other person in some other place.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nAnd we all do this a little differently,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nwhich is why we can all look up at the same night sky\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nand see this\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand also this\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nand also this.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nAnd yeah, it is also why we get things wrong.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\n1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nabout \"I think therefore I am,\"\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nthis guy, St. Augustine, sat down\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nand wrote \"Fallor ergo sum\" --\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:43.958\n\"I err therefore I am.\"\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nAugustine understood\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nthat our capacity to screw up,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nit's not some kind of embarrassing defect\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nin the human system,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nsomething we can eradicate or overcome.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nIt's totally fundamental to who we are.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nBecause, unlike God,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nwe don't really know what's going on out there.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nAnd unlike all of the other animals,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nwe are obsessed with trying to figure it out.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nTo me, this obsession\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nis the source and root\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nof all of our productivity and creativity.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nLast year, for various reasons,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nI found myself listening to a lot of episodes\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nof the Public Radio show This American Life.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nAnd so I'm listening and I'm listening,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nand at some point, I start feeling\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nlike all the stories are about being wrong.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nAnd my first thought was,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\n\"I've lost it.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nI've become the crazy wrongness lady.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nI just imagined it everywhere,\"\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nwhich has happened.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nBut a couple of months later,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nI actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass, who's the host of the show.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nAnd I mentioned this to him,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nand he was like, \"No actually, that's true.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nIn fact,\" he says,\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\n\"as a staff, we joke\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nthat every single episode of our show\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nhas the same crypto-theme.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nAnd the crypto-theme is:\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\n'I thought this one thing was going to happen\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nand something else happened instead.'\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nAnd the thing is,\" says Ira Glass, \"we need this.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nWe need these moments\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nof surprise and reversal and wrongness\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nto make these stories work.\"\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nAnd for the rest of us, audience members,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nas listeners, as readers,\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nwe eat this stuff up.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nWe love things like plot twists\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nand red herrings and surprise endings.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nWhen it comes to our stories,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nwe love being wrong.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nBut, you know, our stories are like this\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nbecause our lives are like this.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nWe think this one thing is going to happen\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nand something else happens instead.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nGeorge Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq,\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nfind a bunch of weapons of mass destruction,\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nliberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nAnd something else happened instead.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nAnd Hosni Mubarak\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nthought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nuntil he got too old or too sick\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nand could pass the reigns of power onto his son.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nAnd something else happened instead.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nAnd maybe you thought\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nyou were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nand move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nAnd something else happened instead.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nAnd I have to tell you\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nthat I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nabout a subject everybody hates\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nfor an audience that would never materialize.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nAnd something else happened instead.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nI mean, this is life.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nFor good and for ill,\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nwe generate these incredible stories\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nabout the world around us,\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nand then the world turns around and astonishes us.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nNo offense, but this entire conference\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nis an unbelievable monument\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nto our capacity to get stuff wrong.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nWe just spent an entire week\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\ntalking about innovations and advancements\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nand improvements,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nbut you know why we need all of those innovations\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nand advancements and improvements?\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nBecause half the stuff\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nthat's the most mind-boggling and world-altering --\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nTED 1998 --\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\neh.\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nDidn't really work out that way, did it?\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nWhere's my jet pack, Chris?\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:38.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nSo here we are again.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nAnd that's how it goes.\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nWe come up with another idea.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nWe tell another story.\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nWe hold another conference.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nThe theme of this one,\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nas you guys have now heard seven million times,\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nis the rediscovery of wonder.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nAnd to me,\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nif you really want to rediscover wonder,\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nyou need to step outside\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nof that tiny, terrified space of rightness\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nand look around at each other\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nand look out at the vastness\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nand complexity and

fortunate to be here. I feel so fortunate. I've been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me. I called my wife Leslie, and I said, \"You know, there's so many good people trying to do so much good. It feels like I've landed in a colony of angels.\" It's a true feeling. But let me get to the talk \u2014 I see the clock is running.I'm a public school teacher, and I just want to share a story of my superintendent. Her name is Pam Moran in Albemarle County, Virginia, the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. And she's a very high-tech superintendent. She uses smart boards, she blogs, she Tweets, she does Facebook, she does all this sort of high-tech stuff. She's a technology leader and instructional leader. But in her office, there's this old wooden, weather-worn table, kitchen table \u2014 peeling green paint, it's kind of rickety. And I said, \"Pam, you're such a modern, cutting-edge person. Why is this old table in your office?\"And she told me, she said, \"You know, I grew up in Southwestern Virginia, in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia, and this table was in my grandfather's kitchen. And we'd come in from playing, he'd come in from plowing and working, and we'd sit around that table every night. And as I grew up, I heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table, I began to call it the wisdom table. And when he passed on, I took this table with me and brought it to my office, and it reminds me of him. It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes.\" The project I'm going to tell you about is called the World Peace Game, and essentially it is also an empty space. And I'd like to think of it as a 21st century wisdom table, really.It all started back in 1977. I was a young man, and I had been dropping in and out of college. And my parents were very patient, but I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India on a mystical quest. And I remember the last time I came back from India \u2014 in my long white flowing robes and my big beard and my John Lennon glasses \u2014 and I said to my father, \"Dad, I think I've just about found spiritual enlightenment.\" He said, \"Well there's one more thing you need to find.\" I said, \"What is that, dad?\" \"A job.\" (Laughter) And so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something. So I got a degree and it turned out to be education. It was an experimental education program. It could have been dentistry, but the word \"experimental\" was in it, and so that's what I had to go for.And I went in for a job interview in the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia, the capital city, bought a three-piece suit \u2014 my concession to convention \u2014 kept my long beard and my afro and my platform shoes \u2014 at the time it was the '70s \u2014 and I walked in, and I sat down and had an interview. And I guess they were hard up for teachers because the supervisor, her name was Anna Aro, said I had the job teaching gifted children. And I was so shocked, so stunned, I got up and said, \"Well, thank you, but what do I do?\" (Laughter) Gifted education hadn't really taken hold too much. There weren't really many materials or things to use. And I said, \"What do I do?\" And her answer shocked me. It stunned me. Her answer set the template for the entire career I was to have after that. She said, \"What do you want to do?\" And that question cleared the space. There was no program directive, no manual to follow, no standards in gifted education in that way. And she cleared such a space that I endeavored from then on to clear a space for my students, an empty space, whereby they could create and make meaning out of their own understanding.So this happened in 1978, and I was teaching many years later, and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker. His name is Chris Farina. Chris Farina is here today at his own cost. Chris, could you stand up and let them see you \u2014 a young, visionary filmmaker who's made a film. (Applause) This film is called \"World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements.\" He proposed the film to me \u2014 it's a great title. He proposed the film to me, and I said, \"Yeah, maybe it'll be on local TV, and we can say hi to our friends.\" But the film has really gone places. Now it's still in debt, but Chris has managed, through his own sacrifice, to get this film out. So we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me, more than a story about one teacher. It's a story that's a testament to teaching and teachers. And it's a beautiful thing.And the strange thing is, when I watch the film \u2014 I have the eerie sensation of seeing it \u2014 I saw myself literally disappear. What I saw was my teachers coming through me. I saw my geometry teacher in high school, Mr. Rucell's wry smile under his handlebar mustache. That's the smile I use \u2014 that's his smile. I saw Jan Polo's flashing eyes. And they weren't flashing in anger, they were flashing in love, intense love for her students. And I have that kind of flash sometimes. And I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day. And you know, she had that old-school teacher stare. You know the one. (Laughter) \"And I'm not even talking about you behind me, because I've got eyes in the back of my head.\" (Laughter) You know that teacher? I didn't use that stare very often, but I do have it in my repertoire. And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me.And then I saw my own parents, my first teachers. My father, very inventive, spatial thinker. That's my brother Malcolm there on the right. And my mother, who taught me in fourth grade in segregated schools in Virginia, who was my inspiration. And really, I feel as though, when I see the film \u2014 I have a gesture she does, like this \u2014 I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture. I am one of her teaching gestures. And the beautiful thing was, I got to teach my daughter in elementary school, Madeline. And so that gesture of my mother's continues through many generations. It's an amazing feeling to have that lineage. And so I'm here standing on the shoulders of many people. I'm not here alone. There are many people on this stage right now.And so this World Peace Game I'd like to tell you about. It started out like this: it's just a four-foot by five-foot plywood board in an inner-city urban school, 1978. I was creating a lesson for students on Africa. We put all the problems of the world there, and I thought, let's let them solve it. I didn't want to lecture or have just book reading. I wanted to have them be immersed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies. So I thought, well they like to play games. I'll make something \u2014 I didn't say interactive; we didn't have that term in 1978 \u2014 but something interactive. And so we made the game, and it has since evolved to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot Plexiglass structure. And it has four Plexiglass layers.There's an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and asteroid mining. There's an air and space level with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around and territorial air spaces and air forces, a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it \u2014 even an undersea level with submarines and undersea mining. There are four countries around the board. The kids make up the names of the countries \u2014 some are rich; some are poor. They have different assets, commercial and military. And each country has a cabinet. There's a Prime Minister, Secretary of State, Minister of Defense and a CFO, or Comptroller. I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them. I offer them the job, they can turn it down, and then they choose their own cabinet. There's a World Bank, arms dealers and a United Nations. There's also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather.(Laughter)That's not all. And then there's a 13-page crisis document with 50 interlocking problems. So that, if one thing changes, everything else changes. I throw them into this complex matrix, and they trust me because we have a deep, rich relationship together. And so with all these crises, we have \u2014 let's see \u2014 ethnic and minority tensions; we have chemical and nuclear spills, nuclear proliferation. There's oil spills, environmental disasters, water rights disputes, breakaway republics, famine, endangered species and global warming. If Al Gore is here, I'm going to send my fourth-graders from Agnor-Hurt and Venable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week. (Laughter) (Applause) And they've done it several times too.(Laughter)So I also have in the game a saboteur \u2014 some child \u2014 it's basically a troublemaker \u2014 and I have my troublemaker put to use because they, on the surface, are trying to save the world and their position in the game. But they're also trying to undermine everything in the game. And they do it secretly through misinformation and ambiguities and irrelevancies, trying to cause everyone to think more deeply. The saboteur is there, and we also read from Sun Tzu's \"The Art of War.\" Fourth-graders understand it \u2014 nine years old \u2014 and they handle that and use that to understand how to, not follow \u2014 at first they do \u2014 the paths to power and destruction, the path to war. They learn to overlook short-sighted reactions and impulsive thinking, to think in a long-term, more consequential way.Stewart Brand is here, and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a CoEvolution Quarterly article on a peace force. And in the game, sometimes students actually form a peace force. I'm just a clock watcher. I'm just a clarifier. I'm just a facilitator. The students run the game. I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing. So I'll just share with you ...(Video) Boy: The World Peace Game is serious. You're actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world. See, Mr. Hunter is doing that because he says his time has messed up a lot, and he's trying to tell us how to fix that problem.John Hunter: I offered them a \u2014 (Applause) Actually, I can't tell them anything because I don't know the answer. And I admit the truth to them right up front: I don't know. And because I don't know, they've got to dig up the answer. And so I apologize to them as well. I say, \"I'm so sorry, boys and girls, but the truth is we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape, and we hope you can fix it for us, and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it.\" It's a sincere apology, and they take it very seriously.Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like. Well when we have the game start, here's what you see.(Video) JH: All right, we're going into negotiations as of now. Go. (Chatter)JH: My question to you is, who's in charge of that classroom? It's a serious question: who is really in charge? I've learned to cede control of the classroom over to the students over time. There's a trust and an understanding and a dedication to an ideal that I simply don't have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher: control every conversation and response in the classroom. It's impossible. Their collective wisdom is much greater than mine, and I admit it to them openly. So I'll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened.In this game we had a little girl, and she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation. And the Defense Minister \u2014 she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth. And she was next door to a very wealthy, oil-rich neighbor. Without provocation, suddenly she attacked, against her Prime Minister's orders, the next-door neighbor's oil fields. She marched into the oil field reserves, surrounded it, without firing a shot, and secured it and held it. And that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations because their fuel supply was locked up.We were all upset with her, \"Why are you doing this? This is the World Peace Game. What is wrong with you?\" (Laughter) This was a little girl and, at nine years old, she held her pieces and said, \"I know what I'm doing.\" To her girlfriends she said that. That's a breach there. And we learned in this, you don't really ever want to cross a nine year-old girl with tanks. (Laughter) They are the toughest opponents. And we were very upset. I thought I was failing as a teacher. Why would she do this?But come to find out, a few game days later \u2014 and there are turns where we take negotiation from a team \u2014 actually there's a negotiation period with all teams, and each team takes a turn, then we go back in negotiation, around and around, so each turn around is one game day. So a few game days later it came to light that we found out this major country was planning a military offensive to dominate the entire world. Had they had their fuel supplies, they would have done it. She was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game.Now she used a small war to avert a larger war, so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion about whether that was right, conditional good, or not right. That's the kind of thinking that we put them in, the situations. I could not have designed that in teaching it. It came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom.(Applause)Another example, a beautiful thing happened. We have a letter in the game. If you're a military commander and you wage troops \u2014 the little plastic toys on the board \u2014 and you lose them, I put in a letter. You have to write a letter to their parents \u2014 the fictional parents of your fictional troops \u2014 explaining what happened and offering your condolences. So you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat. And so we had this situation come up \u2014 last summer actually, at Agnor-Hurt School in Albemarle County \u2014 and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said, \"Mr. Hunter, let's ask \u2014 there's a parent over there.\" There was a parent visiting that day, just sitting in the back of the room. \"Let's ask that mom to read the letter. It'll be more realer if she reads it.\" So we did, we asked her, and she gamely picked up the letter. \"Sure.\" She started reading. She read one sentence. She read two sentences. By the third sentence, she was in tears. I was in tears. Everybody understood that when we lose somebody, the winners are not gloating. We all lose. And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding.I'll show you what my friend David says about this. He's been in many battles.(Video) David: We've really had enough of people attacking. I mean, we've been lucky [most of] the time. But now I'm feeling really weird because I'm living what Sun Tzu said one week. One week he said, \"Those who go into battle and win will want to go back, and those who lose in battle will want to go back and win.\" And so I've been winning battles, so I'm going into battles, more battles. And I think it's sort of weird to be living what Sun Tzu said.JH: I get chills every time I see that. That's the kind of engagement you want to have happen. And I can't design that, I can't plan that, and I can't even test that. But it's self-evident assessment. We know that's an authentic assessment of learning. We have a lot of data, but I think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what's going on.So I'll just share a third story. This is about my friend Brennan. We had played the game one session after school for many weeks, about seven weeks, and we had essentially solved all 50 of the interlocking crises. The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved and every country's asset value has to be increased above its starting point. Some are poor, some are wealthy. There are billions. The World Bank president was a third-grader one time. He says, \"How many zeros in a trillion? I've got to calculate that right away.\" But he was setting fiscal policy in that game for high school players who were playing with him.So the team that was the poorest had gotten even poorer. There was no way they could win. And we were approaching four o'clock, our cut-off time \u2014 there was about a minute left \u2014 and despair just settled over the room. I thought, I'm failing as a teacher. I should have gotten it so they could have won. They shouldn't be failing like this. I've failed them. And I was just feeling so sad and dejected. And suddenly, Brennan walked over to my chair and he grabbed the bell, the bell I ring to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets, and he ran back to his seat, rang the bell. Everybody ran to his chair: there was screaming; there was yelling, waving of their dossiers. They get these dossiers full of secret documents. They were gesticulating; they were running around. I didn't know what they were doing. I'd lost control of my classroom. Principal walks in, I'm out of a job. The parents were looking in the window.And Brennan runs back to his seat. Everybody runs back to their seat. He rings the bell again. He says, \"We have\" \u2014 and there's 12 seconds left on the clock \u2014 \"we have, all nations, pooled all our funds together. And we've got 600 billion dollars. We're going to offer it as a donation to this poor country. And if they accept it, it'll raise their asset value and we can win the game. Will you accept it?\" And there are three seconds left on the clock. Everybody looks at this prime minister of that country, and he says, \"Yes.\" And the game is won. Spontaneous compassion that could not be planned for, that was unexpected and unpredictable.Every game we play is different. Some games are more about social issues, some are more about economic issues. Some games are more about warfare. But I don't try to deny them that reality of being human. I allow them to go there and, through their own experience, learn, in a bloodless way, how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing. And they find out what is right their own way, their own selves. And so in this game, I've learned so much from it, but I would say that if only they could pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game and leverage something good for the world, they may save us all. If only.And on behalf of all of my teachers on whose shoulders I'm standing, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1127, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nI'm very fortunate to be here.\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nI feel so fortunate.\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nI've been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nI called my wife Leslie,\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nand I said, \"You know, there's so many good people\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\ntrying to do so much good.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nIt feels like I've landed in a colony of angels.\"\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nIt's a true feeling.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nBut let me get to the talk -- I see the clock is running.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nI'm a public school teacher,\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nand I just want to share a story of my superintendent.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nHer name is Pam Moran\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nin Albemarle County, Virginia,\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nthe foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nAnd she's a very high-tech superintendent.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nShe uses smart boards, she blogs,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nshe Tweets, she does Facebook,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nshe does all this sort of high-tech stuff.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nShe's a technology leader and instructional leader.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nBut in her office,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nthere's this old wooden, weather-worn table, kitchen table --\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\npeeling green paint, it's kind of rickety.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nAnd I said, \"Pam, you're such a modern, cutting-edge person.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nWhy is this old table in your office?\"\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nAnd she told me, she said,\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\n\"You know, I grew up in Southwestern Virginia,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nin the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia,\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nand this table was in my grandfather's kitchen.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nAnd we'd come in from playing, he'd come in from plowing and working,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nand we'd sit around that table every night.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nAnd as I grew up, I heard so much knowledge\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nand so many insights and so much wisdom\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\ncome out around this table,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nI began to call it the wisdom table.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nAnd when he passed on, I took this table with me and brought it to my office,\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nand it reminds me of him.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nIt reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes.\"\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nThe project I'm going to tell you about\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nis called the World Peace Game,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nand essentially it is also an empty space.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nAnd I'd like to think of it\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nas a 21st century wisdom table, really.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nIt all started back in 1977.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nI was a young man,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nand I had been dropping in and out of college.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nAnd my parents were very patient,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nbut I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\non a mystical quest.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nAnd I remember the last time I came back from India --\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nin my long white flowing robes\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nand my big beard and my John Lennon glasses --\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nand I said to my father,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\n\"Dad, I think I've just about found spiritual enlightenment.\"\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nHe said, \"Well there's one more thing you need to find.\"\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nI said, \"What is that, dad?\" \"A job.\"\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nAnd so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nSo I got a degree\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nand it turned out to be education.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nIt was an experimental education program.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nIt could have been dentistry, but the word \"experimental\" was in it,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nand so that's what I had to go for.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nAnd I went in for a job interview\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nin the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia, the capital city,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nbought a three-piece suit -- my concession to convention --\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nkept my long beard and my afro\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nand my platform shoes -- at the time it was the '70s --\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nand I walked in, and I sat down and had an interview.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nAnd I guess they were hard up for teachers\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nbecause the supervisor, her name was Anna Aro,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nsaid I had the job teaching gifted children.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nAnd I was so shocked, so stunned,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nI got up and said, \"Well, thank you, but what do I

She read one sentence.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nShe read two sentences.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nBy the third sentence, she was in tears.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nI was in tears.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nEverybody understood\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nthat when we lose somebody, the winners are not gloating.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nWe all lose.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nAnd it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nI'll show you what my friend David says about this.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nHe's been in many battles.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\n(Video) David: We've really had enough of people attacking.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nI mean, we've been lucky [most of] the time.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nBut now I'm feeling really weird\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nbecause I'm living what Sun Tzu said one week.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nOne week he said,\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\n\"Those who go into battle and win\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nwill want to go back,\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nand those who lose in battle\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nwill want to go back and win.\"\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nAnd so I've been winning battles,\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nso I'm going into battles, more battles.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nAnd I think it's sort of weird to be living\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nwhat Sun Tzu said.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nJH: I get chills every time I see that.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nThat's the kind of engagement you want to have happen.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nAnd I can't design that, I can't plan that,\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nand I can't even test that.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nBut it's self-evident assessment.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nWe know that's an authentic assessment of learning.\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nWe have a lot of data, but I think sometimes we go beyond data\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nwith the real truth of what's going on.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nSo I'll just share a third story.\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nThis is about my friend Brennan.\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nWe had played the game one session after school\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nfor many weeks, about seven weeks,\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nand we had essentially solved all 50 of the interlocking crises.\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nThe way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nand every country's asset value\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nhas to be increased above its starting point.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nSome are poor, some are wealthy. There are billions.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nThe World Bank president was a third-grader one time.\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nHe says, \"How many zeros in a trillion? I've got to calculate that right away.\"\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nBut he was setting fiscal policy in that game\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nfor high school players who were playing with him.\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nSo the team that was the poorest\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nhad gotten even poorer.\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nThere was no way they could win.\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:30.958\nAnd we were approaching four o'clock, our cut-off time --\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nthere was about a minute left --\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nand despair just settled over the room.\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nI thought, I'm failing as a teacher.\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nI should have gotten it so they could have won.\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nThey shouldn't be failing like this.\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nI've failed them.\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nAnd I was just feeling so sad and dejected.\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nAnd suddenly, Brennan walked over to my chair\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nand he grabbed the bell, the bell I ring\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nto signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets,\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nand he ran back to his seat, rang the bell.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nEverybody ran to his chair: there was screaming;\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nthere was yelling, waving of their dossiers.\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nThey get these dossiers full of secret documents.\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nThey were gesticulating; they were running around.\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nI didn't know what they were doing. I'd lost control of my classroom.\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nPrincipal walks in, I'm out of a job.\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:12.958\nThe parents were looking in the window.\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:15.958\nAnd Brennan runs back to his seat. Everybody runs back to their seat.\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nHe rings the bell again. He says, \"We have\" --\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nand there's 12 seconds left on the clock --\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:22.958\n\"we have, all nations, pooled all our funds together.\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nAnd we've got 600 billion dollars.\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nWe're going to offer it as a donation to this poor country.\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nAnd if they accept it, it'll raise their asset value and we can win the game.\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:31.958\nWill you accept it?\"\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nAnd there are three seconds left on the clock.\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nEverybody looks at this prime minister of that country,\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:38.958\nand he says, \"Yes.\"\n\n00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nAnd the game is won.\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:44.958\nSpontaneous compassion\n\n00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:46.958\nthat could not be planned for,\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nthat was unexpected and unpredictable.\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nEvery game we play is different.\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nSome games are more about social issues,\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nsome are more about economic issues.\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nSome games are more about warfare.\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nBut I don't try to deny them that reality of being human.\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nI allow them to go there\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nand, through their own experience, learn, in a bloodless way,\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nhow not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing.\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nAnd they find out what is right\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:13.958\ntheir own way, their own selves.\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:16.958\nAnd so in this game,\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nI've learned so much from it,\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:20.958\nbut I would say\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:23.958\nthat if only\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:25.958\nthey could pick up a critical thinking tool\n\n00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:27.958\nor creative thinking tool\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:29.958\nfrom this game\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:33.958\nand leverage something good for the world,\n\n00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:36.958\nthey may save us all.\n\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:39.958\nIf only.\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:41.958\nAnd on behalf of all of my teachers\n\n00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:43.958\non whose shoulders I'm standing,\n\n00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:46.958\nthank you.

My own interest in this subject, and my passion for it, began rather accidentally. I had bought a copy of this book, \"The Universe and Dr. Einstein\" \u2014 a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in Seattle. A few years after that, in Bangalore, I was finding it hard to fall asleep one night, and I picked up this book, thinking it would put me to sleep in 10 minutes. And as it happened, I read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot. And I was left with this intense feeling of awe and exhilaration at the universe and our own ability to understand as much as we do. And that feeling hasn't left me yet.That feeling was the trigger for me to actually change my career \u2014 from being a software engineer to become a science writer \u2014 so that I could partake in the joy of science, and also the joy of communicating it to others. And that feeling also led me to a pilgrimage of sorts, to go literally to the ends of the earth to see telescopes, detectors, instruments that people are building, or have built, in order to probe the cosmos in greater and greater detail. So it took me from places like Chile \u2014 the Atacama Desert in Chile \u2014 to Siberia, to underground mines in the Japanese Alps, in Northern America, all the way to Antarctica and even to the South Pole.And today I would like to share with you some images, some stories of these trips. I have been basically spending the last few years documenting the efforts of some extremely intrepid men and women who are putting, literally at times, their lives at stake working in some very remote and very hostile places so that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos in order for us to understand this universe.And I first begin with a pie chart \u2014 and I promise this is the only pie chart in the whole presentation \u2014 but it sets up the state of our knowledge of the cosmos. All the theories in physics that we have today properly explain what is called normal matter \u2014 the stuff that we're all made of \u2014 and that's four percent of the universe. Astronomers and cosmologists and physicists think that there is something called dark matter in the universe, which makes up 23 percent of the universe, and something called dark energy, which permeates the fabric of space-time, that makes up another 73 percent. So if you look at this pie chart, 96 percent of the universe, at this point in our exploration of it, is unknown or not well understood. And most of the experiments, telescopes that I went to see are in some way addressing this question, these two twin mysteries of dark matter and dark energy.I will take you first to an underground mine in Northern Minnesota where people are looking for something called dark matter. And the idea here is that they are looking for a sign of a dark matter particle hitting one of their detectors. And the reason why they have to go underground is that, if you did this experiment on the surface of the Earth, the same experiment would be swamped by signals that could be created by things like cosmic rays, ambient radio activity, even our own bodies. You might not believe it, but even our own bodies are radioactive enough to disturb this experiment. So they go deep inside mines to find a kind of environmental silence that will allow them to hear the ping of a dark matter particle hitting their detector.And I went to see one of these experiments, and this is actually \u2014 you can barely see it, and the reason for that is it's entirely dark in there \u2014 this is a cavern that was left behind by the miners who left this mine in 1960. And physicists came and started using it sometime in the 1980s. And the miners in the early part of the last century worked, literally, in candlelight. And today, you would see this inside the mine, half a mile underground. This is one of the largest underground labs in the world. And, among other things, they're looking for dark matter.There is another way to search for dark matter, which is indirectly. If dark matter exists in our universe, in our galaxy, then these particles should be smashing together and producing other particles that we know about \u2014 one of them being neutrinos. And neutrinos you can detect by the signature they leave when they hit water molecules. When a neutrino hits a water molecule it emits a kind of blue light, a flash of blue light, and by looking for this blue light, you can essentially understand something about the neutrino and then, indirectly, something about the dark matter that might have created this neutrino. But you need very, very large volumes of water in order to do this. You need something like tens of megatons of water \u2014 almost a gigaton of water \u2014 in order to have any chance of catching this neutrino. And where in the world would you find such water? Well the Russians have a tank in their own backyard.This is Lake Baikal. It is the largest lake in the world. It's 800 km long. It's about 40 to 50 km wide in most places, and one to two kilometers deep. And what the Russians are doing is they're building these detectors and immersing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake so that they can watch for these flashes of blue light. And this is the scene that greeted me when I landed there. This is Lake Baikal in the peak of the Siberian winter. The lake is entirely frozen. And the line of black dots that you see in the background, that's the ice camp where the physicists are working. The reason why they have to work in winter is because they don't have the money to work in summer and spring, which, if they did that, they would need ships and submersibles to do their work. So they wait until winter \u2014 the lake is completely frozen over \u2014 and they use this meter-thick ice as a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work.So this is the Russians working on the ice in the peak of the Siberian winter. They have to drill holes in the ice, dive down into the water \u2014 cold, cold water \u2014 to get hold of the instrument, bring it up, do any repairs and maintenance that they need to do, put it back and get out before the ice melts. Because that phase of solid ice lasts for two months and it's full of cracks. And you have to imagine, there's an entire sea-like lake underneath, moving. I still don't understand this one Russian man working in his bare chest, but that tells you how hard he was working. And these people, a handful of people, have been working for 20 years, looking for particles that may or may not exist. And they have dedicated their lives to it. And just to give you an idea, they have spent 20 million over 20 years. It's very harsh conditions. They work on a shoestring budget. The toilets there are literally holes in the ground covered with a wooden shack. And it's that basic, but they do this every year.From Siberia to the Atacama Desert in Chile, to see something called The Very Large Telescope. The Very Large Telescope is one of these things that astronomers do \u2014 they name their telescopes rather unimaginatively. I can tell you for a fact, that the next one that they're planning is called The Extremely Large Telescope. (Laughter) And you wouldn't believe it, but the one after that is going to be called The Overwhelmingly Large Telescope. But nonetheless, it's an extraordinary piece of engineering. These are four 8.2 meter telescopes. And these telescopes, among other things, they're being used to study how the expansion of the universe is changing with time. And the more you understand that, the better you would understand what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about.And one piece of engineering that I want to leave you with as regards this telescope is the mirror. Each mirror, there are four of them, is made of a single piece of glass, a monolithic piece of high-tech ceramic, that has been ground down and polished to such accuracy that the only way to understand what that is is [to] imagine a city like Paris, with all its buildings and the Eiffel Tower, if you grind down Paris to that kind of accuracy, you would be left with bumps that are one millimeter high. And that's the kind of polishing that these mirrors have endured. An extraordinary set of telescopes. Here's another view of the same. The reason why you have to build these telescopes in places like the Atacama Desert is because of the high altitude desert. The dry air is really good for telescopes, and also, the cloud cover is below the summit of these mountains so that the telescopes have about 300 days of clear skies.Finally, I want to take you to Antarctica. I want to spend most of my time on this part of the world. This is cosmology's final frontier. Some of the most amazing experiments, some of the most extreme experiments, are being done in Antarctica. I was there to view something called a long-duration balloon flight, which basically takes telescopes and instruments all the way to the upper atmosphere, the upper stratosphere, 40 km up. And that's where they do their experiments, and then the balloon, the payload, is brought down. So this is us landing on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica. That's an American C-17 cargo plane that flew us from New Zealand to McMurdo in Antarctica. And here we are about to board our bus. And I don't know if you can read the lettering, but it says, \"Ivan the Terribus.\" And that's taking us to McMurdo.And this is the scene that greets you in McMurdo. And you barely might be able to make out this hut here. This hut was built by Robert Falcon Scott and his men when they first came to Antarctica on their first expedition to go to the South Pole. Because it's so cold, the entire contents of that hut is still as they left it, with the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there. It's an extraordinary place. This is McMurdo itself. About a thousand people work here in summer, and about 200 in winter when it's completely dark for six months.I was here to see the launch of this particular type of instrument. This is a cosmic ray experiment that has been launched all the way to the upper-stratosphere to an altitude of 40 km. What I want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight. So you're using a balloon to carry something that is two tons all the way to an altitude of 40 km. And the engineers, the technicians, the physicists have all got to assemble on the Ross Ice Shelf, because Antarctica \u2014 I won't go into the reasons why \u2014 but it's one of the most favorable places for doing these balloon launches, except for the weather. The weather, as you can imagine, this is summer, and you're standing on 200 ft of ice. And there's a volcano behind, which has glaciers at the very top. And what they have to do is they have to assemble the entire balloon \u2014 the fabric, parachute and everything \u2014 on the ice and then fill it up with helium. And that process takes about two hours.And the weather can change as they're putting together this whole assembly. For instance, here they are laying down the balloon fabric behind, which is eventually going to be filled up with helium. Those two trucks you see at the very end carry 12 tanks each of compressed helium. Now, in case the weather changes before the launch, they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes and take it out back to McMurdo Station. And this particular balloon, because it has to launch two tons of weight, is an extremely huge balloon. The fabric alone weighs two tons. In order to minimize the weight, it's very thin, it's as thin as a sandwich wrapper. And if they have to pack it back, they have to put it into boxes and stamp on it so that it fits into the box again \u2014 except, when they did it first, it would have been done in Texas. Here, they can't do it with the kind shoes they're wearing, so they have to take their shoes off, get barefoot into the boxes, in this cold, and do that kind of work. That's the kind of dedication these people have.Here's the balloon being filled up with helium, and you can see it's a gorgeous sight. Here's a scene that shows you the balloon and the payload end-to-end. So the balloon is being filled up with helium on the left-hand side, and the fabric actually runs all the way to the middle where there's a piece of electronics and explosives being connected to a parachute, and then the parachute is then connected to the payload. And remember, all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold, in sub-zero temperatures. They're wearing about 15 kg of clothing and stuff, but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that. And I would like to share with you a launch.(Video) Radio: Okay, release the balloon, release the balloon, release the balloon.Anil Ananthaswamy: And I'll finally like to leave you with two images. This is an observatory in the Himalayas, in Ladakh in India. And the thing I want you to look at here is the telescope on the right-hand side. And on the far left there is a 400 year-old Buddhist monastery. This is a close-up of the Buddhist monastery. And I was struck by the juxtaposition of these two enormous disciplines that humanity has. One is exploring the cosmos on the outside, and the other one is exploring our interior being. And both require silence of some sort.And what struck me was every place that I went to to see these telescopes, the astronomers and cosmologists are in search of a certain kind of silence, whether it's silence from radio pollution or light pollution or whatever. And it was very obvious that, if we destroy these silent places on Earth, we will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look outwards, because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1129, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nI would like to talk today\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nabout what I think is one of the greatest adventures\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nhuman beings have embarked upon,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nwhich is the quest to understand the universe\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nand our place in it.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nMy own interest in this subject, and my passion for it,\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nbegan rather accidentally.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nI had bought a copy of this book,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\n\"The Universe and Dr. Einstein\" --\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\na used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in Seattle.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nA few years after that, in Bangalore,\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nI was finding it hard to fall asleep one night,\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nand I picked up this book,\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nthinking it would put me to sleep in 10 minutes.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nAnd as it happened,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nI read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nAnd I was left with this intense feeling\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nof awe and exhilaration\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nat the universe\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nand our own ability to understand as much as we do.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nAnd that feeling hasn't left me yet.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nThat feeling was the trigger for me\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nto actually change my career --\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nfrom being a software engineer to become a science writer --\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nso that I could partake in the joy of science,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nand also the joy of communicating it to others.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nAnd that feeling also led me\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nto a pilgrimage of sorts,\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nto go literally to the ends of the earth\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nto see telescopes, detectors,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\ninstruments that people are building, or have built,\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nin order to probe the cosmos\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nin greater and greater detail.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nSo it took me from places like Chile --\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nthe Atacama Desert in Chile --\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nto Siberia,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nto underground mines\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nin the Japanese Alps, in Northern America,\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nall the way to Antarctica\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nand even to the South Pole.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nAnd today I would like to share with you\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nsome images, some stories of these trips.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nI have been basically spending the last few years\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\ndocumenting the efforts\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nof some extremely intrepid men and women\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nwho are putting,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nliterally at times, their lives at stake\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nworking in some very remote and very hostile places\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nso that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nin order for us to understand this universe.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nAnd I first begin with a pie chart --\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nand I promise this is the only pie chart\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nin the whole presentation --\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nbut it sets up the state of our knowledge of the cosmos.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAll the theories in physics that we have today\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nproperly explain what is called normal matter --\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nthe stuff that we're all made of --\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nand that's four percent of the universe.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nAstronomers and cosmologists and physicists think\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nthat there is something called dark matter in the universe,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nwhich makes up 23 percent of the universe,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nand something called dark energy,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nwhich permeates the fabric of space-time,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nthat makes up another 73 percent.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nSo if you look at this pie chart, 96 percent of the universe,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nat this point in our exploration of it,\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nis unknown or not well understood.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nAnd most of the experiments, telescopes that I went to see\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nare in some way addressing this question,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nthese two twin mysteries of dark matter and dark energy.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nI will take you first to an underground mine\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nin Northern Minnesota\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nwhere people are looking\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nfor something called dark matter.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nAnd the idea here is that they are looking for a sign\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nof a dark matter particle hitting one of their detectors.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nAnd the reason why they have to go underground\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nis that, if you did this experiment on the surface of the Earth,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nthe same experiment would be swamped by signals\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nthat could be created by things like cosmic rays,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nambient radio activity,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\neven our own bodies. You might not believe it,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nbut even our own bodies are radioactive enough to disturb this experiment.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nSo they go deep inside mines\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nto find a kind of environmental silence\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nthat will allow them to hear\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nthe ping of a dark matter particle hitting their detector.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nAnd I went to see one of these experiments,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nand this is actually -- you can barely see it,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nand the reason for that is it's entirely dark in there --\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nthis is a cavern that was left behind by the miners\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nwho left this mine in 1960.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nAnd physicists came and started using it\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nsometime in the 1980s.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nAnd the miners in the early part of the last century\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nworked, literally, in candlelight.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nAnd today, you would see this inside the mine,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nhalf a mile underground.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nThis is one of the largest underground labs in the world.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nAnd, among other things, they're looking for dark matter.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nThere is another way to search for dark matter,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nwhich is indirectly.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nIf dark matter exists in our universe,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nin our galaxy,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nthen these particles should be smashing together\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nand producing other particles that we know about --\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\none of them being neutrinos.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAnd neutrinos you can detect\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nby the signature they leave\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nwhen they hit water molecules.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nWhen a neutrino hits a water molecule\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nit emits a kind of blue light,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\na flash of blue light,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nand by looking for this blue light,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nyou can essentially understand something about the neutrino\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nand then, indirectly, something about the dark matter\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nthat might have created this neutrino.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nBut you need very, very large volumes of water\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nin order to do this.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nYou need something like tens of megatons of water --\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nalmost a gigaton of water --\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nin order to have any chance of catching this neutrino.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nAnd where in the world would you find such water?\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nWell the Russians have a tank in their own backyard.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nThis is Lake Baikal.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nIt is the largest lake in the world. It's 800 km long.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nIt's about 40 to 50 km wide\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nin most places,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nand one to two kilometers deep.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nAnd what the Russians are doing\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nis they're building these detectors\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nand immersing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nso that they can watch for these flashes of blue light.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nAnd this is the scene that greeted me when I landed there.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nThis is Lake Baikal\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nin the peak of the Siberian winter.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nThe lake is entirely frozen.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nAnd the line of black dots\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nthat you see in the background,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nthat's the ice camp where the physicists are working.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nThe reason why they have to work in winter\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nis because they don't have the money to work in summer and spring,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nwhich, if they did that,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nthey would need ships and submersibles to do their work.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nSo they wait until winter --\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nthe lake is completely frozen over --\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nand they use this meter-thick ice\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nas a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nSo this is the Russians working on the ice\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nin the peak of the Siberian winter.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nThey have to drill holes in the ice,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\ndive down into the water -- cold, cold water --\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nto get hold of the instrument, bring it up,\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\ndo any repairs and maintenance that they need to do,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nput it back and get out before the ice melts.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nBecause that phase of solid ice lasts for two months\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nand it's full of cracks.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nAnd you have to imagine, there's an entire sea-like lake\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nunderneath, moving.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nI still don't understand this one Russian man\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nworking in his bare chest,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nbut that tells you how hard he was working.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nAnd these people, a handful of people,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nhave been working for 20 years,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nlooking for particles that may or may not exist.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nAnd they have dedicated their lives to it.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nAnd just to give you an idea,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nthey have spent 20 million over 20 years.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nIt's very harsh conditions.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nThey work on a shoestring budget.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nThe toilets there are literally holes in the ground\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\ncovered with a wooden shack.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nAnd it's that basic,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nbut they do this every year.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nFrom Siberia to the Atacama Desert in Chile,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nto see something called The Very Large Telescope.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nThe Very Large Telescope\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nis one of these things that astronomers do --\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nthey name their telescopes rather unimaginatively.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nI can tell you for a fact,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nthat the next one that they're planning is called The Extremely Large Telescope.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd you wouldn't believe it,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nbut the one after that is going to be called The Overwhelmingly Large Telescope.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nBut nonetheless,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nit's an extraordinary piece of engineering.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nThese are four 8.2 meter telescopes.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nAnd these telescopes, among other things,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nthey're being used to study\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nhow the expansion of the universe is changing with time.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nAnd the more you understand that,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nthe better you would understand\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nwhat this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nAnd one piece of engineering that I want to leave you with\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nas regards this telescope\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nis the mirror.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nEach mirror, there are four of them,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nis made of a single piece of glass,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\na monolithic piece of high-tech ceramic,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nthat has been ground down and polished to such accuracy\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nthat the only way to understand what that is\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nis [to] imagine a city like Paris,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nwith all its buildings and the Eiffel Tower,\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nif you grind down Paris to that kind of accuracy,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nyou would be left with bumps that are one millimeter high.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nAnd that's the kind of polishing that these mirrors have endured.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nAn extraordinary set of telescopes.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nHere's another view of the same.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nThe reason why you have to build these telescopes\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nin places like the Atacama Desert\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nis because of the high altitude desert.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nThe dry air is really good for telescopes,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nand also, the cloud cover is below the summit of these mountains\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nso that the telescopes have\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nabout 300 days of clear skies.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nFinally, I want to take you to Antarctica.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nI want to spend most of my time on this part of the world.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nThis is cosmology's final frontier.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nSome of the most amazing experiments,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nsome of the most extreme experiments,\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nare being done in Antarctica.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nI was there to view something called a long-duration balloon flight,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nwhich basically takes telescopes and instruments\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nall the way to the upper atmosphere,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nthe upper stratosphere, 40 km up.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nAnd that's where they do their experiments,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nand then the balloon, the payload, is brought down.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nSo this is us landing on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nThat's an American C-17 cargo plane\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nthat flew us from New Zealand\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nto McMurdo in Antarctica.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nAnd here we are about to board our bus.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nAnd I don't know if you can read the lettering,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nbut it says, \"Ivan the Terribus.\"\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nAnd that's taking us to McMurdo.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nAnd this is the scene that greets you in McMurdo.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nAnd you barely might be able to make out\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nthis hut here.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nThis hut was built by Robert Falcon Scott and his men\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nwhen they first came to Antarctica\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\non their first expedition to go to the South Pole.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nBecause it's so cold,\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nthe entire contents of that hut is still as they left it,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nwith the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nIt's an extraordinary place.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nThis is McMurdo itself. About a thousand people work here in summer,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nand about 200 in winter\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nwhen it's completely dark for six months.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nI was here to see the launch\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nof this particular type of instrument.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nThis is a cosmic ray experiment\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nthat has been launched all the way to the upper-stratosphere\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nto an altitude of 40 km.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nWhat I want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nSo you're using a balloon\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nto carry something that is two tons\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nall the way to an altitude of 40 km.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nAnd the engineers, the technicians, the physicists\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nhave all got to assemble on the Ross Ice Shelf,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nbecause Antarctica -- I won't go into the reasons why --\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nbut it's one of the most favorable places for doing these balloon launches,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nexcept for the weather.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nThe weather, as you can imagine,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nthis is summer, and you're standing on 200 ft of ice.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nAnd there's a volcano behind,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nwhich has glaciers at the very top.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAnd what they have to do\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nis they have to assemble the entire balloon --\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nthe fabric, parachute and everything -- on the ice\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nand then fill it up with helium.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nAnd that process takes about two hours.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nAnd the weather can change as they're putting together this whole assembly.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nFor instance, here they are laying down the balloon fabric behind,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nwhich is eventually going to be filled up with helium.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nThose two trucks you see at the very end\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\ncarry 12 tanks each of compressed helium.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nNow, in case the weather changes before the launch,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nthey have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nand take it out back to McMurdo Station.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nAnd this particular balloon,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nbecause it has to launch two tons of weight,\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nis an extremely huge balloon.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nThe fabric alone weighs two tons.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nIn order to minimize the weight,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nit's very thin, it's as thin as a sandwich wrapper.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nAnd if they have to pack it back,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nthey have to put it into boxes\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand stamp on it so that it fits into the box again --\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nexcept, when they did it first,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nit would have been done in Texas.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nHere, they can't do it with the kind shoes they're wearing,\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nso they have to take their shoes off,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nget barefoot into the boxes, in this cold,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nand do that kind of work.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nThat's the kind of dedication these people have.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nHere's the balloon being filled up with helium,\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nand you can see it's a gorgeous sight.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nHere's a scene\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nthat shows you the balloon and the payload end-to-end.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nSo the balloon is being filled up with helium on the left-hand side,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nand the fabric actually runs all the way to the middle\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nwhere there's a piece of electronics and explosives\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nbeing connected to a parachute,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nand then the parachute is then connected to the payload.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nAnd remember, all this wiring is being done\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nby people in extreme cold, in sub-zero temperatures.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nThey're wearing about 15 kg of clothing and stuff,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nbut they have to take their gloves off in order to do that.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nAnd I would like to share with you a launch.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\n(Video) Radio: Okay, release the balloon,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nrelease the balloon, release the balloon.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nAnil Ananthaswamy: And I'll finally like to leave you with two images.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nThis is an observatory in the Himalayas, in Ladakh in India.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nAnd the thing I want you to look at here\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nis the telescope on the right-hand side.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nAnd on the far left there\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nis a 400 year-old Buddhist monastery.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nThis is a close-up of the Buddhist monastery.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nAnd I was struck by the juxtaposition\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nof these two enormous disciplines that humanity has.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nOne is exploring the cosmos on the outside,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nand the other one is exploring our interior being.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nAnd both require silence of some sort.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nAnd what struck me was\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nevery place that I went to to see these telescopes,\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nthe astronomers and cosmologists\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nare in search of a certain kind of silence,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nwhether it's silence from radio pollution\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nor light pollution or whatever.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nAnd it was very obvious\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nthat, if we destroy these silent places on Earth,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nwe will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look outwards,\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nbecause we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nThank you.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "3 things I learned while my plane crashed", "duration": "302", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ric_elias", "transcript": "Imagine a big explosion as you climb through 3,000 ft. Imagine a plane full of smoke. Imagine an engine going clack, clack, clack. It sounds scary.Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in 1D. I was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants. So I looked at them right away, and they said, \"No problem. We probably hit some birds.\" The pilot had already turned the plane around, and we weren't that far. You could see Manhattan. Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.The pilot lines up the plane with the Hudson River. That's usually not the route.(Laughter)He turns off the engines. Now, imagine being in a plane with no sound. And then he says three words. The most unemotional three words I've ever heard. He says, \"Brace for impact.\" I didn't have to talk to the flight attendant anymore.(Laughter)I could see in her eyes, it was terror. Life was over.Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day. I learned that it all changes in an instant. We have this bucket list, we have these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out to that I didn't, all the fences I wanted to mend, all the experiences I wanted to have and I never did. As I thought about that later on, I came up with a saying, which is, \"I collect bad wines.\" Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm opening it. I no longer want to postpone anything in life. And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.The second thing I learned that day \u2014 and this is as we clear the George Washington Bridge, which was by not a lot \u2014(Laughter)I thought about, wow, I really feel one real regret. I've lived a good life. In my own humanity and mistakes, I've tried to get better at everything I tried. But in my humanity, I also allow my ego to get in. And I regretted the time I wasted on things that did not matter with people that matter. And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people. And after, as I reflected on that, I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life. It's not perfect, but it's a lot better. I've not had a fight with my wife in two years. It feels great. I no longer try to be right; I choose to be happy.The third thing I learned \u2014 and this is as your mental clock starts going, \"15, 14, 13.\" You can see the water coming. I'm saying, \"Please blow up.\" I don't want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you've seen in those documentaries. And as we're coming down, I had a sense of, wow, dying is not scary. It's almost like we've been preparing for it our whole lives. But it was very sad. I didn't want to go; I love my life. And that sadness really framed in one thought, which is, I only wish for one thing. I only wish I could see my kids grow up. About a month later, I was at a performance by my daughter \u2014 first-grader, not much artistic talent \u2014(Laughter)Yet!(Laughter)And I'm bawling, I'm crying, like a little kid. And it made all the sense in the world to me. I realized at that point, by connecting those two dots, that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad. Above all, above all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good dad.I was given the gift of a miracle, of not dying that day. I was given another gift, which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently. I challenge you guys that are flying today, imagine the same thing happens on your plane \u2014 and please don't \u2014 but imagine, and how would you change? What would you get done that you're waiting to get done because you think you'll be here forever? How would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them? And more than anything, are you being the best parent you can?Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1130, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:17.934\nImagine a big explosion\nas you climb through 3,000 ft.\n\n00:00:18.783 --> 00:00:21.697\nImagine a plane full of smoke.\n\n00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.348\nImagine an engine\ngoing clack, clack, clack.\n\n00:00:26.301 --> 00:00:27.681\nIt sounds scary.\n\n00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.041\nWell, I had a unique seat that day.\n\n00:00:30.065 --> 00:00:31.784\nI was sitting in 1D.\n\n00:00:31.808 --> 00:00:34.617\nI was the only one who could talk\nto the flight attendants.\n\n00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:36.691\nSo I looked at them right away,\n\n00:00:36.715 --> 00:00:39.693\nand they said, \"No problem.\nWe probably hit some birds.\"\n\n00:00:39.717 --> 00:00:41.889\nThe pilot had already\nturned the plane around,\n\n00:00:41.913 --> 00:00:43.183\nand we weren't that far.\n\n00:00:43.207 --> 00:00:44.648\nYou could see Manhattan.\n\n00:00:46.077 --> 00:00:47.284\nTwo minutes later,\n\n00:00:47.308 --> 00:00:49.176\nthree things happened at the same time.\n\n00:00:50.854 --> 00:00:53.934\nThe pilot lines up the plane\nwith the Hudson River.\n\n00:00:55.151 --> 00:00:56.546\nThat's usually not the route.\n\n00:00:56.908 --> 00:00:58.596\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.351\nHe turns off the engines.\n\n00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.489\nNow, imagine being\nin a plane with no sound.\n\n00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:06.832\nAnd then he says three words.\n\n00:01:06.856 --> 00:01:09.234\nThe most unemotional\nthree words I've ever heard.\n\n00:01:09.713 --> 00:01:11.346\nHe says, \"Brace for impact.\"\n\n00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:15.788\nI didn't have to talk\nto the flight attendant anymore.\n\n00:01:15.812 --> 00:01:17.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:21.086\nI could see in her eyes, it was terror.\n\n00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.354\nLife was over.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:27.309\nNow I want to share with you three things\nI learned about myself that day.\n\n00:01:28.148 --> 00:01:30.257\nI learned that it\nall changes in an instant.\n\n00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.362\nWe have this bucket list,\n\n00:01:33.386 --> 00:01:35.729\nwe have these things\nwe want to do in life,\n\n00:01:35.753 --> 00:01:39.270\nand I thought about all the people\nI wanted to reach out to that I didn't,\n\n00:01:39.294 --> 00:01:41.426\nall the fences I wanted to mend,\n\n00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.065\nall the experiences I wanted\nto have and I never did.\n\n00:01:45.221 --> 00:01:47.632\nAs I thought about that later on,\n\n00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:48.934\nI came up with a saying,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.031\nwhich is, \"I collect bad wines.\"\n\n00:01:52.055 --> 00:01:55.364\nBecause if the wine is ready\nand the person is there, I'm opening it.\n\n00:01:55.388 --> 00:01:58.040\nI no longer want to postpone\nanything in life.\n\n00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.847\nAnd that urgency, that purpose,\nhas really changed my life.\n\n00:02:03.196 --> 00:02:05.278\nThe second thing I learned that day --\n\n00:02:05.302 --> 00:02:07.934\nand this is as we clear\nthe George Washington Bridge,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.142\nwhich was by not a lot --\n\n00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:11.741\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:15.446\nI thought about, wow,\nI really feel one real regret.\n\n00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.934\nI've lived a good life.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.934\nIn my own humanity and mistakes,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.792\nI've tried to get better\nat everything I tried.\n\n00:02:21.816 --> 00:02:24.934\nBut in my humanity,\nI also allow my ego to get in.\n\n00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.251\nAnd I regretted the time I wasted\non things that did not matter\n\n00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:31.848\nwith people that matter.\n\n00:02:32.755 --> 00:02:35.134\nAnd I thought about\nmy relationship with my wife,\n\n00:02:35.158 --> 00:02:36.769\nwith my friends, with people.\n\n00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.761\nAnd after, as I reflected on that,\n\n00:02:39.785 --> 00:02:42.312\nI decided to eliminate\nnegative energy from my life.\n\n00:02:42.336 --> 00:02:44.716\nIt's not perfect, but it's a lot better.\n\n00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.480\nI've not had a fight\nwith my wife in two years.\n\n00:02:47.504 --> 00:02:48.716\nIt feels great.\n\n00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.040\nI no longer try to be right;\n\n00:02:51.064 --> 00:02:52.481\nI choose to be happy.\n\n00:02:54.012 --> 00:02:55.473\nThe third thing I learned --\n\n00:02:55.497 --> 00:02:59.938\nand this is as your mental clock\nstarts going, \"15, 14, 13.\"\n\n00:02:59.962 --> 00:03:01.398\nYou can see the water coming.\n\n00:03:01.422 --> 00:03:02.934\nI'm saying, \"Please blow up.\"\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.101\nI don't want this thing\nto break in 20 pieces\n\n00:03:05.125 --> 00:03:07.147\nlike you've seen in those documentaries.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.219\nAnd as we're coming down,\n\n00:03:10.243 --> 00:03:14.934\nI had a sense of, wow, dying is not scary.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.934\nIt's almost like we've been preparing\nfor it our whole lives.\n\n00:03:18.661 --> 00:03:19.889\nBut it was very sad.\n\n00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.280\nI didn't want to go; I love my life.\n\n00:03:23.165 --> 00:03:27.390\nAnd that sadness\nreally framed in one thought,\n\n00:03:27.414 --> 00:03:29.934\nwhich is, I only wish for one thing.\n\n00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.811\nI only wish I could see my kids grow up.\n\n00:03:34.455 --> 00:03:37.932\nAbout a month later,\nI was at a performance by my daughter --\n\n00:03:37.956 --> 00:03:40.663\nfirst-grader, not much artistic talent --\n\n00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:41.761\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:41.785 --> 00:03:42.888\nYet!\n\n00:03:42.912 --> 00:03:44.766\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.933\nAnd I'm bawling,\nI'm crying, like a little kid.\n\n00:03:49.962 --> 00:03:52.134\nAnd it made all the sense\nin the world to me.\n\n00:03:52.542 --> 00:03:56.283\nI realized at that point,\nby connecting those two dots,\n\n00:03:56.307 --> 00:03:58.649\nthat the only thing\nthat matters in my life\n\n00:03:58.673 --> 00:03:59.934\nis being a great dad.\n\n00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.557\nAbove all, above all,\n\n00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:05.949\nthe only goal I have in life\nis to be a good dad.\n\n00:04:07.278 -->

00:04:15.719\nwhich was to be able\nto see into the future\n\n00:04:15.743 --> 00:04:17.020\nand come back\n\n00:04:17.044 --> 00:04:19.096\nand live differently.\n\n00:04:19.856 --> 00:04:22.848\nI challenge you guys\nthat are flying today,\n\n00:04:22.872 --> 00:04:25.523\nimagine the same thing\nhappens on your plane --\n\n00:04:25.547 --> 00:04:26.934\nand please don't --\n\n00:04:26.958 -->

Now, when I was a young man \u2014 40 years ago, the country was very, very poor with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty. We decided to do something about it, but we didn't begin with a welfare program or a poverty reduction program. But we began with a family-planning program, following a very successful maternal child health activity, sets of activities. So basically, no one would accept family planning if their children didn't survive. So the first step: get to the children, get to the mothers, and then follow up with family planning. Not just child mortality alone, you need also family planning. Now let me take you back as to why we needed to do it.In my country, that was the case in 1974. Seven children per family \u2014 tremendous growth at 3.3 percent. There was just no future. We needed to reduce the population growth rate. So we said, \"Let's do it.\" The women said, \"We agree. We'll use pills, but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills,\" and we had very, very few doctors. We didn't take no as an answer; we took no as a question. We went to the nurses and the midwives, who were also women, and did a fantastic job at explaining how to use the pill. That was wonderful, but it covered only 20 percent of the country.What do we do for the other 80 percent \u2014 leave them alone and say, \"Well, they're not medical personnel.\" No, we decided to do a bit more. So we went to the ordinary people that you saw. Actually, below that yellow sign \u2014 I wish they hadn't wiped that, because there was \"Coca-Cola\" there. We were so much bigger than Coca-Cola in those days. And no difference, the people they chose were the people we chose. They were well-known in the community, they knew that customers were always right, and they were terrific, and they practiced their family planning themselves. So they could supply pills and condoms throughout the country, in every village of the country. So there we are. We went to the people who were seen as the cause of the problem to be the solution. Wherever there were people \u2014 and you can see boats with the women, selling things \u2014 here's the floating market selling bananas and crabs and also contraceptives \u2014 wherever you find people, you'll find contraceptives in Thailand.And then we decided, why not get to religion because in the Philippines, the Catholic Church was pretty strong, and Thai people were Buddhist. We went to them and they said, \"Look, could you help us?\" I'm there \u2014 the one in blue, not the yellow \u2014 holding a bowl of holy water for the monk to sprinkle holy water on pills and condoms for the sanctity of the family. And this picture was sent throughout the country. So some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves. And the women were saying, \"No wonder we have no side-effects. It's been blessed.\" That was their perception.And then we went to teachers. You need everybody to be involved in trying to provide whatever it is that make humanity a better place. So we went to the teachers. Over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning with a new alphabet \u2014 A, B for birth, C for condom, I for IUD, V for vasectomy. And then we had a snakes and ladders game, where you throw dice. If you land on anything pro-family planning, you move ahead. Like, \"Mother takes the pill every night. Very good, mother. Move ahead. Uncle buys a condom. Very good, uncle. Move ahead. Uncle gets drunk, doesn't use condom. Come back, start again.\" (Laughter) Again, education, class entertainment. And the kids were doing it in school too. We had relay races with condoms, we had children's condom-blowing championship. And before long, the condom was know as the girl's best friend. In Thailand, for poor people, diamonds don't make it \u2014 so the condom is the girl's best friend.We introduced our first microcredit program in 1975, and the women who organized it said, \"We only want to lend to women who practice family planning. If you're pregnant, take care of your pregnancy. If you're not pregnant, you can take a loan out from us.\" And that was run by them. And after 35/36 years, it's still going on. It's a part of the Village Development Bank; it's not a real bank, but it's a fund \u2014 microcredit. And we didn't need a big organization to run it \u2014 it was run by the villagers themselves. And you probably hardly see a Thai man there, it's always women, women, women, women. And then we thought we'd help America, because America's been helping everyone, whether they want help or not. (Laughter) And this is on the Fourth of July. We decided to provide vasectomy to all men, but in particular, American men to the front of the queue, right up to the Ambassador's residence during his [unclear]. And the hotel gave us the ballroom for it \u2014 very appropriate room. (Laughter) And since it was near lunch time, they said, \"All right, we'll give you some lunch. Of course, it must be American cola. You get two brands, Coke and Pepsi. And then the food is either hamburger or hotdog.\" And I thought a hotdog will be more symbolic. (Laughter) And here is this, then, young man called Willy Bohm who worked for the USAID. Obviously, he's had his vasectomy because his hotdog is half eaten, and he was very happy. It made a lot of news in America, and it angered some people also. I said, \"Don't worry. Come over and I'll do the whole lot of you.\"(Laughter)And what happened? In all this thing, from seven children to 1.5 children, population growth rate of 3.3 to 0.5. You could call it the Coca-Cola approach if you like \u2014 it was exactly the same thing. I'm not sure whether Coca-Cola followed us, or we followed Coca-Cola, but we're good friends. And so that's the case of everyone joining in. We didn't have a strong government. We didn't have lots of doctors. But it's everybody's job who can change attitude and behavior.Then AIDS came along and hit Thailand, and we had to stop doing a lot of good things to fight AIDS. But unfortunately, the government was in denial, denial, denial. So our work wasn't affected. So I thought, \"Well, if you can't go to the government, go to the military.\" So I went to the military and asked to borrow 300 radio stations. They have more than the government, and they've got more guns than the government. So I asked them, could they help us in our fight against HIV. And after I gave them statistics, they said, \"Yes. Okay. You can use all the radio stations, television stations.\" And that's when we went onto the airwaves. And then we got a new prime minister soon after that. And he said, \"Mechai, could you come and join?\" He asked me in because he liked my wife a lot. So I said, \"Okay.\" He became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee and increased the budget fifty-fold.Every ministry, even judges, had to be involved in AIDS education \u2014 everyone \u2014 and we said the public, institutions, religious institutions, schools \u2014 everyone was involved. And here, every media person had to be trained for HIV. And we gave every station half a minute extra for advertising to earn more money. So they were happy with that. And then AIDS education in all schools, starting from university. And these are high school kids teaching high school kids. And the best teachers were the girls, not the boys, and they were terrific. And these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV were known as Mother Theresa. And then we went down one more step. These are primary school kids \u2014 third, fourth grade \u2014 going to every household in the village, every household in the whole of Thailand, giving AIDS information and a condom to every household, given by these young kids. And no parents objected, because we were trying to save lives, and this was a lifesaver. And we said, \"Everyone needs to be involved.\"So you have the companies also realizing that sick staff don't work, and dead customers don't buy. So they all trained. And then we have this Captain Condom, with his Harvard MBA, going to schools and night spots. And they loved him. You need a symbol of something. In every country, every program, you need a symbol, and this is probably the best thing he's ever done with his MBA. (Laughter) And then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets \u2014 everywhere, everywhere. In taxis, you get condoms. And also, in traffic, the policemen give you condoms \u2014 our \"cops and rubbers\" programs. (Laughter) So, can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms? Of course I can. And they'd enjoy it immensely; I see them standing around right now, everywhere. Imagine if they had condoms, giving out to all sorts of people. And then, new change, we had hair bands, clothing and the condom for your mobile phone during the rainy season.(Laughter)And these were the condoms that we introduced. One says, \"Weapon of mass protection.\" We found \u2014 you know \u2014 somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction, but we have found the weapon of mass protection: the condom. And then it says here, with the American flag, \"Don't leave home without it.\" But I have some to give out afterward. But let me warn you, these are Thai-sized, so be very careful. (Laughter) And so you can see that condoms can do so many things. Look at this \u2014 I gave this to Al Gore and to Bill Senior also. Stop global warming; use condoms. And then this is the picture I mentioned to you \u2014 the weapon of mass protection. And let the next Olympics save some lives. Why just run around? (Laughter) And then finally, in Thailand we're Buddhist, we don't have a God, so instead, we say, \"In rubber we trust.\" (Laughter) So you can see that we added everything to our endeavor to make life better for the people. We had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools, because alcohol impairs judgment.And then what happened? After all this time, everybody joined in. According to the U.N., new cases of HIV declined by 90 percent, and according to the World Bank, 7.7 million lives were saved. Otherwise there wouldn't be many Thais walking around today. So it just showed you, you could do something about it. 90 percent of the funding came from Thailand. There was political commitment, some financial commitment, and everybody joined in the fight. So just don't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses. We all need to help.And then we decided to help people out of poverty, now that we got AIDS somewhat out of the way \u2014 this time, not with government alone, but in cooperation with the business community. Because poor people are business people who lack business skills and access to credit. Those are the things to be provided by the business community. We're trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs, little business people. The only way out of poverty is through business enterprise. So, that was done. The money goes from the company into the village via tree-planting. It's not a free gift. They plant the trees, and the money goes into their microcredit fund, which we call the Village Development Bank. Everybody joins in, and they feel they own the bank, because they have brought the money in.And before you can borrow the money, you need to be trained. And we believe if you want to help the poor, those who are living in poverty, access to credit must be a human right. Access to credit must be a human right. Otherwise they'll never get out of poverty. And then before getting a loan, you must be trained. Here's what we call a \"barefoot MBA,\" teaching people how to do business so that, when they borrow money, they'll succeed with the business. These are some of the businesses: mushrooms, crabs, vegetables, trees, fruits, and this is very interesting \u2014 Nike ice cream and Nike biscuits; this is a village sponsored by Nike. They said, \"They should stop making shoes and clothes. Make these better, because we can afford them.\" And then we have silk, Thai silk. Now we're making Scottish tartans, as you can see on the left, to sell to all people of Scottish ancestors. So anyone sitting in and watching TV, get in touch with me. And then this is our answer to Starbucks in Thailand \u2014 \"Coffee and Condoms.\" See, Starbucks you awake, we keep you awake and alive. That's the difference. Can you imagine, at every Starbucks that you can also get condoms? You can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino.And then now, finally in education, we want to change the school as being underutilized into a place where it's a lifelong learning center for everyone. We call this our School-Based Integrated Rural Development. And it's a center, a focal point for economic and social development. Re-do the school, make it serve the community needs. And here is a bamboo building \u2014 all of them are bamboo. This is a geodesic dome made of bamboo. And I'm sure Buckminster Fuller would be very, very proud to see a bamboo geodesic dome. And we use vegetables around the school ground, so they raise their own vegetables.And then, finally, I firmly believe, if we want the MDGs to work \u2014 the Millennium Development Goals \u2014 we need to add family planning to it. Of course, child mortality first and then family planning \u2014 everyone needs family planning service \u2014 it's underutilized. So we have now found the weapon of mass protection. And we also ask the next Olympics to be involved in saving lives. And then, finally, that is our network. And these are our Thai tulips.(Laughter)Thank you very much indeed.(Applause)", "id": 970, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nWelcome to Thailand.\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nNow, when I was a young man -- 40 years ago,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nthe country was very, very poor\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nwith lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nWe decided to do something about it,\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nbut we didn't begin with a welfare program\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nor a poverty reduction program.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nBut we began with a family-planning program,\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nfollowing a very successful\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nmaternal child health activity,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nsets of activities.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nSo basically, no one would accept family planning\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nif their children didn't survive.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nSo the first step: get to the children, get to the mothers,\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nand then follow up with family planning.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nNot just child mortality alone, you need also family planning.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nNow let me take you back\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nas to why we needed to do it.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nIn my country, that was the case in 1974.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nSeven children per family --\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\ntremendous growth at 3.3 percent.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nThere was just no future.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nWe needed to reduce the population growth rate.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nSo we said, \"Let's do it.\"\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nThe women said, \"We agree. We'll use pills,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nbut we need a doctor to prescribe the pills,\"\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nand we had very, very few doctors.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nWe didn't take no as an answer;\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nwe took no as a question.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nWe went to the nurses and the midwives, who were also women,\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nand did a fantastic job\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nat explaining how to use the pill.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nThat was wonderful,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nbut it covered only 20 percent of the country.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nWhat do we do for the other 80 percent --\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nleave them alone and say, \"Well, they're not medical personnel.\"\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nNo, we decided to do a bit more.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nSo we went to the ordinary people that you saw.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nActually, below that yellow sign --\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nI wish they hadn't wiped that,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nbecause there was \"Coca-Cola\" there.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nWe were so much bigger than Coca-Cola in those days.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nAnd no difference,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nthe people they chose were the people we chose.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nThey were well-known in the community,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nthey knew that customers were always right,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nand they were terrific, and they practiced their family planning themselves.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nSo they could supply pills and condoms\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nthroughout the country, in every village of the country.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nSo there we are. We went to the people\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nwho were seen as the cause of the problem\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nto be the solution.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nWherever there were people --\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nand you can see boats with the women, selling things --\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nhere's the floating market\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nselling bananas and crabs\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nand also contraceptives --\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nwherever you find people,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nyou'll find contraceptives in Thailand.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nAnd then we decided, why not get to religion\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nbecause in the Philippines,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nthe Catholic Church was pretty strong,\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nand Thai people were Buddhist.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nWe went to them and they said, \"Look, could you help us?\"\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nI'm there -- the one in blue, not the yellow --\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nholding a bowl of holy water\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nfor the monk to sprinkle holy water\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\non pills and condoms\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nfor the sanctity of the family.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nAnd this picture was sent throughout the country.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nSo some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nAnd the women were saying, \"No wonder we have no side-effects.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nIt's been blessed.\"\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nThat was their perception.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nAnd then we went to teachers.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nYou need everybody to be involved\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nin trying to provide whatever it is\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nthat make humanity a better place.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nSo we went to the teachers.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nOver a quarter of a million were taught about family planning\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nwith a new alphabet -- A, B for birth, C for condom,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nI for IUD, V for vasectomy.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd then we had a snakes and ladders game, where you throw dice.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nIf you land on anything pro-family planning, you move ahead.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nLike, \"Mother takes the pill every night.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nVery good, mother. Move ahead.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nUncle buys a condom. Very good, uncle. Move ahead.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nUncle gets drunk, doesn't use condom.

We didn't have lots of doctors.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nBut it's everybody's job\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nwho can change attitude and behavior.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nThen AIDS came along and hit Thailand,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nand we had to stop doing a lot of good things\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nto fight AIDS.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nBut unfortunately, the government was in denial, denial, denial.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nSo our work wasn't affected.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nSo I thought, \"Well, if you can't go to the government, go to the military.\"\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nSo I went to the military\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nand asked to borrow 300 radio stations.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nThey have more than the government,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nand they've got more guns than the government.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nSo I asked them, could they help us\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nin our fight against HIV.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nAnd after I gave them statistics,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nthey said, \"Yes. Okay. You can use all the radio stations, television stations.\"\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nAnd that's when we went onto the airwaves.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nAnd then we got a new prime minister soon after that.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nAnd he said, \"Mechai, could you come and join?\"\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nHe asked me in because he liked my wife a lot.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nSo I said, \"Okay.\"\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nHe became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand increased the budget fifty-fold.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nEvery ministry, even judges, had to be involved in AIDS education --\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\neveryone -- and we said the public, institutions,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nreligious institutions, schools --\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\neveryone was involved.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nAnd here, every media person\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nhad to be trained for HIV.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd we gave every station half a minute extra\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nfor advertising to earn more money.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nSo they were happy with that.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nAnd then AIDS education in all schools,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nstarting from university.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nAnd these are high school kids teaching high school kids.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nAnd the best teachers were the girls, not the boys,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nand they were terrific.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nAnd these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nwere known as Mother Theresa.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nAnd then we went down one more step.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nThese are primary school kids -- third, fourth grade --\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\ngoing to every household in the village,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nevery household in the whole of Thailand,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\ngiving AIDS information and a condom\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nto every household,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\ngiven by these young kids.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nAnd no parents objected, because we were trying to save lives,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nand this was a lifesaver.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd we said, \"Everyone needs to be involved.\"\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nSo you have the companies also realizing\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nthat sick staff don't work, and dead customers don't buy.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nSo they all trained.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nAnd then we have this Captain Condom,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nwith his Harvard MBA,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\ngoing to schools and night spots.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nAnd they loved him.

And they'd enjoy it immensely;\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nI see them standing around right now, everywhere.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nImagine if they had condoms,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\ngiving out to all sorts of people.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nAnd then, new change,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nwe had hair bands, clothing\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nand the condom for your mobile phone\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nduring the rainy season.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nAnd these were the condoms that we introduced.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nOne says, \"Weapon of mass protection.\"\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nWe found --\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nyou know -- somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nbut we have found the weapon of mass protection: the condom.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nAnd then it says here, with the American flag,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\n\"Don't leave home without it.\"\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nBut I have some to give out afterward.\n\n00:09:08.958

you can see\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nthat condoms can do so many things.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nLook at this --\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nI gave this to Al Gore and to Bill

00:09:34.958\nthe weapon of mass protection.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nAnd let the next Olympics save some lives.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nWhy just run around?\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nAnd then finally,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nin Thailand we're Buddhist, we don't have a God,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nso instead, we say, \"In rubber we trust.\"\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nSo you can see that we added everything to our endeavor\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nto make life better for the people.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nWe had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nbecause alcohol impairs judgment.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nAnd then what happened?\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nAfter all this time, everybody joined in.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nAccording to the U.N.,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nnew cases of HIV\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\ndeclined by 90 percent,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nand according to the World Bank,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\n7.7 million lives were saved.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nOtherwise there wouldn't be many Thais walking around today.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nSo it just showed you, you could do something about it.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\n90 percent of the funding came from Thailand.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nThere was political commitment, some financial commitment,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nand everybody joined in the fight.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nSo just don't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nWe all need to help.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nAnd then we decided to help people out of poverty,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nnow that we got AIDS somewhat out of the way --\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nthis time, not with government alone,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nbut in cooperation with the business community.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nBecause poor people are business people\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nwho lack business skills and access to credit.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nThose are the things to be provided by the business community.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nWe're trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nlittle business people.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nThe only way out of poverty is through business enterprise.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nSo, that was done.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nThe money goes from the company into the village\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nvia tree-planting.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nIt's not a free gift.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nThey plant the trees, and the money goes into their microcredit fund,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nwhich we call the Village Development Bank.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nEverybody joins in,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nand they feel they own the bank,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nbecause they have brought the money in.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nAnd before you can borrow the money, you need to be trained.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nAnd we believe if you want to help the poor,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nthose who are living in poverty,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\naccess to credit must be a human right.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nAccess to credit must be a human right.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nOtherwise they'll never get out of poverty.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nAnd then before getting a loan, you must be trained.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nHere's what we call a \"barefoot MBA,\"\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nteaching people how to do business\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nso that, when they borrow money, they'll succeed with the business.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nThese are some of the businesses:\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nmushrooms, crabs, vegetables,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\ntrees, fruits,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nand this is very interesting -- Nike ice cream and Nike biscuits;\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nthis is a village sponsored by Nike.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nThey said, \"They should stop making shoes and clothes.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nMake these better, because we can afford them.\"\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nAnd then we have silk, Thai silk.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nNow we're making Scottish tartans, as you can see on the left,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nto sell to all people of Scottish ancestors.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nSo anyone sitting in and watching TV,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nget in touch with me.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nAnd then this is our answer to Starbucks in Thailand --\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\n\"Coffee and Condoms.\"\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nSee, Starbucks you awake, we keep you awake and alive.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nThat's the difference.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nCan you imagine, at every Starbucks\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nthat you can also get condoms?\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nYou can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nAnd then now, finally in education,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nwe want to change the school as being underutilized\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:36.958\ninto a place where it's a lifelong learning center for everyone.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nWe call this our School-Based Integrated Rural Development.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nAnd it's a center, a focal point\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nfor economic and social development.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nRe-do the school,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nmake it serve the community needs.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nAnd here is a bamboo building --\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nall of them are bamboo.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nThis is a geodesic dome made of bamboo.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nAnd I'm sure Buckminster Fuller would be very, very proud\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nto see a bamboo geodesic dome.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nAnd we use vegetables around the school ground,\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nso they raise their own vegetables.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nAnd then, finally, I firmly believe,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nif we want the MDGs to work --\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nthe Millennium Development Goals --\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nwe need to add family planning to it.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nOf course, child mortality first and then family planning --\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\neveryone needs family planning service --\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nit's underutilized.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nSo we have now found the weapon of mass protection.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nAnd we also ask the next Olympics\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nto be involved in saving lives.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nAnd then, finally, that is our network.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nAnd these are our Thai tulips.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nThank you very much indeed.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Are mushrooms the new plastic?", "duration": "545", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/eben_bayer_are_mushrooms_the_new_plastic", "transcript": "So, I'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years. But before I do that, I need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics, which require huge amounts of energy to create and, because of their disposal issues, are slowly poisoning our planet. I also want to tell you and share with you how my team and I have been using mushrooms over the last three years. Not like that. (Laughter) We're using mushrooms to create an entirely new class of materials, which perform a lot like plastics during their use, but are made from crop waste and are totally compostable at the end of their lives.(Cheering)But first, I need to talk to you about what I consider one of the most egregious offenders in the disposable plastics category. This is a material you all know is Styrofoam, but I like to think of it as toxic white stuff. In a single cubic foot of this material \u2014 about what would come around your computer or large television \u2014 you have the same energy content of about a liter and a half of petrol. Yet, after just a few weeks of use, you'll throw this material in the trash. And this isn't just found in packaging. 20 billion dollars of this material is produced every year, in everything from building materials to surfboards to coffee cups to table tops. And that's not the only place it's found. The EPA estimates, in the United States, by volume, this material occupies 25 percent of our landfills. Even worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment \u2014 on the side of the road or next to a river. If it's not picked up by a human, like me and you, it'll stay there for thousands and thousands of years. Perhaps even worse is when it finds its way into our oceans, like in the great plastic gyre, where these materials are being mechanically broken into smaller and smaller bits, but they're not really going away. They're not biologically compatible. They're basically fouling up Earth's respiratory and circulatory systems. And because these materials are so prolific, because they're found in so many places, there's one other place you'll find this material, styrene, which is made from benzene, a known carcinogen. You'll find it inside of you.So, for all these reasons, I think we need better materials, and there are three key principles we can use to guide these materials. The first is feedstocks. Today, we use a single feedstock, petroleum, to heat our homes, power our cars and make most of the materials you see around you. We recognize this is a finite resource, and it's simply crazy to do this, to put a liter and a half of petrol in the trash every time you get a package. Second of all, we should really strive to use far less energy in creating these materials. I say far less, because 10 percent isn't going to cut it. We should be talking about half, a quarter, one-tenth the energy content. And lastly, and I think perhaps most importantly, we should be creating materials that fit into what I call nature's recycling system. This recycling system has been in place for the last billion years. I fit into it, you fit into it, and a hundred years tops, my body can return to the Earth with no preprocessing. Yet that packaging I got in the mail yesterday is going to last for thousands of years. This is crazy.But nature provides us with a really good model here. When a tree's done using its leaves \u2014 its solar collectors, these amazing molecular photon capturing devices \u2014 at the end of a season, it doesn't pack them up, take them to the leaf reprocessing center and have them melted down to form new leaves. It just drops them, the shortest distance possible, to the forest floor, where they're actually upcycled into next year's topsoil. And this gets us back to the mushrooms. Because in nature, mushrooms are the recycling system. And what we've discovered is, by using a part of the mushroom you've probably never seen \u2014 analogous to its root structure; it's called mycelium \u2014 we can actually grow materials with many of the same properties of conventional synthetics.Now, mycelium is an amazing material, because it's a self-assembling material. It actually takes things we would consider waste \u2014 things like seed husks or woody biomass \u2014 and can transform them into a chitinous polymer, which you can form into almost any shape. In our process, we basically use it as a glue. And by using mycelium as a glue, you can mold things just like you do in the plastic industry, and you can create materials with many different properties, materials that are insulating, fire-resistant, moisture-resistant, vapor-resistant \u2014 materials that can absorb impacts, that can absorb acoustical impacts. But these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts, not petroleum. And because they're made of natural materials, they are 100 percent compostable in you own backyard.So I'd like to share with you the four basic steps required to make these materials. The first is selecting a feedstock, preferably something that's regional, that's in your area, right \u2014 local manufacturing. The next is actually taking this feedstock and putting in a tool, physically filling an enclosure, a mold, in whatever shape you want to get. Then you actually grow the mycelium through these particles, and that's where the magic happens, because the organism is doing the work in this process, not the equipment. The final step is, of course, the product, whether it's a packaging material, a table top, or building block. Our vision is local manufacturing, like the local food movement, for production. So we've created formulations for all around the world using regional byproducts. If you're in China, you might use a rice husk or a cottonseed hull. If you're in Northern Europe or North America, you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls. We then process these husks with some basic equipment.And I want to share with you a quick video from our facility that gives you a sense of how this looks at scale. So what you're seeing here is actually cotton hulls from Texas, in this case. It's a waste product. And what they're doing in our equipment is going through a continuous system, which cleans, cooks, cools and pasteurizes these materials, while also continuously inoculating them with our mycelium. This gives us a continuous stream of material that we can put into almost any shape, though today we're making corner blocks. And it's when this lid goes on the part, that the magic really starts. Because the manufacturing process is our organism. It'll actually begin to digest these wastes and, over the next five days, assemble them into biocomposites. Our entire facility is comprised of thousands and thousands and thousands of these tools sitting indoors in the dark, quietly self-assembling materials \u2014 and everything from building materials to, in this case, a packaging corner block.So I've said a number of times that we grow materials. And it's kind of hard to picture how that happens. So my team has taken five days-worth of growth, a typical growth cycle for us, and condensed it into a 15-second time lapse. And I want you to really watch closely these little white dots on the screen, because, over the five-day period, what they do is extend out and through this material, using the energy that's contained in these seed husks to build this chitinous polymer matrix. This matrix self-assembles, growing through and around the particles, making millions and millions of tiny fibers. And what parts of the seed husk we don't digest, actually become part of the final, physical composite. So in front of your eyes, this part just self-assembled. It actually takes a little longer. It takes five days. But it's much faster than conventional farming.The last step, of course, is application. In this case, we've grown a corner block. A major Fortune 500 furniture maker uses these corner blocks to protect their tables in shipment. They used to use a plastic packaging buffer, but we were able to give them the exact same physical performance with our grown material. Best of all, when it gets to the customer, it's not trash. They can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing, and it's going to improve the local soil.So, why mycelium? The first reason is local open feedstocks. You want to be able to do this anywhere in the world and not worry about peak rice hull or peak cottonseed hulls, because you have multiple choices. The next is self-assembly, because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process. You don't need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility. So you can have lots of small facilities spread all across the world. Biological yield is really important. And because 100 percent of what we put in the tool become the final product, even the parts that aren't digested become part of the structure, we're getting incredible yield rates.Natural polymers, well ... I think that's what's most important, because these polymers have been tried and tested in our ecosystem for the last billion years, in everything from mushrooms to crustaceans. They're not going to clog up Earth's ecosystems. They work great. And while, today, we can practically guarantee that yesterday's packaging is going to be here in 10,000 years, what I want to guarantee is that in 10,000 years, our descendants, our children's children, will be living happily and in harmony with a healthy Earth. And I think that can be some really good news.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 971, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nSo, I'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nimagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years.\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nBut before I do that,\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nI need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics,\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nwhich require huge amounts of energy to create\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nand, because of their disposal issues,\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nare slowly poisoning our planet.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nI also want to tell you and share with you\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nhow my team and I\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nhave been using mushrooms over the last three years.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nNot like that.

away.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nThey're not biologically compatible.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nThey're basically fouling up\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nEarth's respiratory and circulatory systems.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nAnd because these materials are so prolific,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nbecause they're found in so many places,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nthere's one other place you'll find this material, styrene,\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nwhich is made from benzene, a known carcinogen.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nYou'll find it inside of you.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nSo, for all these reasons,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nI think we need better materials,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nand there are three key principles we can use to guide these materials.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nThe first is feedstocks.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nToday, we use a single feedstock, petroleum,\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nto heat our homes, power our cars\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nand make most of the materials you see around you.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nWe recognize this is a finite resource,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nand it's simply crazy to do this, to put a liter and a half of petrol in the trash\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nevery time you get a package.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nSecond of all, we should really strive to use far less energy\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nin creating these materials.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nI say far less, because 10 percent isn't going to cut it.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nWe should be talking about half, a quarter,\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\none-tenth the energy content.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nAnd lastly, and I think perhaps most importantly,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nwe should be creating materials\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nthat fit into what I call nature's recycling system.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nThis recycling system has been in place for the last billion years.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nI fit into it, you fit into it,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nand a hundred years tops, my body can return to the Earth with no preprocessing.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nYet that packaging I got in the mail yesterday\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nis going to last for thousands of years.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nThis is crazy.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nBut nature provides us with a really good model here.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nWhen a tree's done using its leaves --\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nits solar collectors, these amazing molecular photon capturing devices --\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nat the end of a season,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nit doesn't pack them up, take them to the leaf reprocessing center\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nand have them melted down to form new leaves.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nIt just drops them, the shortest distance possible,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nto the forest floor,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nwhere they're actually upcycled into next year's topsoil.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nAnd this gets us back to the mushrooms.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nBecause in nature,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nmushrooms are the recycling system.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nAnd what we've discovered\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nis, by using a part of the mushroom you've probably never seen --\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nanalogous to its root structure; it's called mycelium --\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nwe can actually grow materials\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nwith many of the same properties of conventional synthetics.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nNow, mycelium is an amazing material,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nbecause it's a self-assembling material.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nIt actually takes things we would consider waste --\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nthings like seed husks or woody biomass --\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nand can transform them into a chitinous polymer,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nwhich you can form into almost any shape.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nIn our process,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nwe basically use it as a glue.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nAnd by using mycelium as a glue,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nyou can mold things just like you do in the plastic industry,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nand you can create materials with many different properties,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nmaterials that are insulating, fire-resistant,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nmoisture-resistant, vapor-resistant --\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nmaterials that can absorb impacts, that can absorb acoustical impacts.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nBut these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nnot petroleum.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nAnd because they're made of natural materials,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nthey are 100 percent compostable\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nin you own backyard.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nSo I'd like to share with you the four basic steps\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nrequired to make these materials.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nThe first is selecting a feedstock,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\npreferably something that's regional, that's in your area, right --\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nlocal manufacturing.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nThe next is actually taking this feedstock and putting in a tool,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nphysically filling an enclosure, a mold,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nin whatever shape you want to get.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nThen you actually grow the mycelium through these particles,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nand that's where the magic happens,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nbecause the organism is doing the work in this process,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nnot the equipment.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nThe final step is, of course, the product,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nwhether it's a packaging material, a table top, or building block.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nOur vision is local manufacturing,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nlike the local food movement, for production.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nSo we've created formulations for all around the world\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nusing regional byproducts.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nIf you're in China, you might use a rice husk\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nor a cottonseed hull.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nIf you're in Northern Europe or North America,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nyou can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nWe then process these husks with some basic equipment.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nAnd I want to share with you a quick video from our facility\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nthat gives you a sense of how this looks at scale.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nSo what you're seeing here is actually cotton hulls from Texas, in this case.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nIt's a waste product.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nAnd what they're doing in our equipment\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nis going through a continuous system,\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nwhich cleans, cooks, cools\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nand pasteurizes these materials,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nwhile also continuously inoculating them with our mycelium.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nThis gives us a continuous stream of material\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nthat we can put into almost any shape,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nthough today we're making corner blocks.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nAnd it's when this lid goes on the part,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthat the magic really starts.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nBecause the manufacturing process is our organism.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nIt'll actually begin to digest these wastes\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nand, over the next five days,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nassemble them into biocomposites.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nOur entire facility\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nis comprised of thousands and thousands and thousands of these tools\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nsitting indoors in the dark, quietly self-assembling materials --\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nand everything from building materials\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nto, in this case,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\na packaging corner block.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nSo I've said a number of times that we grow materials.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nAnd it's kind of hard to picture how that happens.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nSo my team has taken five days-worth of growth,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\na typical growth cycle for us,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand condensed it into a 15-second time lapse.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nAnd I want you to really watch closely\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nthese little white dots on the screen,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nbecause, over the five-day period,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nwhat they do is extend out and through this material,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nusing the energy that's contained in these seed husks\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nto build this chitinous polymer matrix.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nThis matrix self-assembles,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\ngrowing through and around the particles,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nmaking millions and millions of tiny fibers.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nAnd what parts of the seed husk we don't digest,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nactually become part of the final, physical composite.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nSo in front of your eyes, this part just self-assembled.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nIt actually takes a little longer. It takes five days.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nBut it's much faster than conventional farming.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nThe last step, of course, is application.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nIn this case, we've grown a corner block.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nA major Fortune 500 furniture maker\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nuses these corner blocks to protect their tables in shipment.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nThey used to use a plastic packaging buffer,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nbut we were able to give them the exact same physical performance\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nwith our grown material.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nBest of all, when it gets to the customer,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nit's not trash.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nThey can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nand it's going to improve the local soil.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nSo, why mycelium?\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nThe first reason is local open feedstocks.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nYou want to be able to do this anywhere in the world\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nand not worry about peak rice hull or peak cottonseed hulls,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nbecause you have multiple choices.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nThe next is self-assembly,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nbecause the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nYou don't need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nSo you can have lots of small facilities\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nspread all across the world.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nBiological yield is really important.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nAnd because 100 percent of what we put in the tool become the final product,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\neven the parts that aren't digested\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nbecome part of the structure,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nwe're getting incredible yield rates.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nNatural polymers, well ... I think that's what's most important,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nbecause these polymers have been tried and tested\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nin our ecosystem for the last billion years,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nin everything from mushrooms to crustaceans.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nThey're not going to clog up Earth's ecosystems. They work great.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nAnd while, today,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nwe can practically guarantee that yesterday's packaging\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nis going to be here in 10,000 years,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nwhat I want to guarantee\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nis that in 10,000 years,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nour descendants, our children's children,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nwill be living happily and in harmony\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nwith a healthy Earth.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nAnd I think that can be some really good news.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nThank you.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "An economic reality check", "duration": "1223", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_jackson_s_economic_reality_check", "transcript": "I want to talk to you today about prosperity, about our hopes for a shared and lasting prosperity. And not just us, but the two billion people worldwide who are still chronically undernourished. And hope actually is at the heart of this. In fact, the Latin word for hope is at the heart of the word prosperity. \"Pro-speras,\" \"speras,\" hope \u2014 in accordance with our hopes and expectations. The irony is, though, that we have cashed-out prosperity almost literally in terms of money and economic growth. And we've grown our economies so much that we now stand in a real danger of undermining hope \u2014 running down resources, cutting down rainforests, spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico, changing the climate \u2014 and the only thing that has actually remotely slowed down the relentless rise of carbon emissions over the last two to three decades is recession. And recession, of course, isn't exactly a recipe for hope either, as we're busy finding out. So we're caught in a kind of trap. It's a dilemma, a dilemma of growth. We can't live with it; we can't live without it. Trash the system or crash the planet \u2014 it's a tough choice; it isn't much of a choice. And our best avenue of escape from this actually is a kind of blind faith in our own cleverness and technology and efficiency and doing things more efficiently. Now I haven't got anything against efficiency. And I think we are a clever species sometimes. But I think we should also just check the numbers, take a reality check here.So I want you to imagine a world, in 2050, of around nine billion people, all aspiring to Western incomes, Western lifestyles. And I want to ask the question \u2014 and we'll give them that two percent hike in income, in salary each year as well, because we believe in growth. And I want to ask the question: how far and how fast would be have to move? How clever would we have to be? How much technology would we need in this world to deliver our carbon targets? And here in my chart \u2014 on the left-hand side is where we are now. This is the carbon intensity of economic growth in the economy at the moment. It's around about 770 grams of carbon. In the world I describe to you, we have to be right over here at the right-hand side at six grams of carbon. It's a 130-fold improvement, and that is 10 times further and faster than anything we've ever achieved in industrial history. Maybe we can do it, maybe it's possible \u2014 who knows? Maybe we can even go further and get an economy that pulls carbon out of the atmosphere, which is what we're going to need to be doing by the end of the century. But shouldn't we just check first that the economic system that we have is remotely capable of delivering this kind of improvement?So I want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics. It's a bit complex, and I apologize for that. What I'll try and do, is I'll try and paraphrase it is sort of human terms. So it looks a little bit like this. Firms produce goods for households \u2014 that's us \u2014 and provide us with incomes, and that's even better, because we can spend those incomes on more goods and services. That's called the circular flow of the economy. It looks harmless enough. I just want to highlight one key feature of this system, which is the role of investment. Now investment constitutes only about a fifth of the national income in most modern economies, but it plays an absolutely vital role. And what it does essentially is to stimulate further consumption growth. It does this in a couple of ways \u2014 chasing productivity, which drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff. But I want to concentrate on the role of investment in seeking out novelty, the production and consumption of novelty. Joseph Schumpeter called this \"the process of creative destruction.\" It's a process of the production and reproduction of novelty, continually chasing expanding consumer markets, consumer goods, new consumer goods.And this, this is where it gets interesting, because it turns out that human beings have something of an appetite for novelty. We love new stuff \u2014 new material stuff for sure \u2014 but also new ideas, new adventures, new experiences. But the materiality matters too, because in every society that anthropologists have looked at, material stuff operates as a kind of language \u2014 a language of goods, a symbolic language that we use to tell each other stories \u2014 stories, for example, about how important we are. Status-driven, conspicuous consumption thrives from the language of novelty. And here, all of a sudden, we have a system that is locking economic structure with social logic \u2014 the economic institutions, and who we are as people, locked together to drive an engine of growth. And this engine is not just economic value; it is pulling material resources relentlessly through the system, driven by our own insatiable appetites, driven in fact by a sense of anxiety. Adam Smith, 200 years ago, spoke about our desire for a life without shame. A life without shame: in his day, what that meant was a linen shirt, and today, well, you still need the shirt, but you need the hybrid car, the HDTV, two holidays a year in the sun, the netbook and iPad, the list goes on \u2014 an almost inexhaustible supply of goods, driven by this anxiety. And even if we don't want them, we need to buy them, because, if we don't buy them, the system crashes. And to stop it crashing over the last two to three decades, we've expanded the money supply, expanded credit and debt, so that people can keep buying stuff. And of course, that expansion was deeply implicated in the crisis.But this \u2014 I just want to show you some data here. This is what it looks like, essentially, this credit and debt system, just for the U.K. This was the last 15 years before the crash, and you can see there, consumer debt rose dramatically. It was above the GDP for three years in a row just before the crisis. And in the mean time, personal savings absolutely plummeted. The savings ratio, net savings, were below zero in the middle of 2008, just before the crash. This is people expanding debt, drawing down their savings, just to stay in the game. This is a strange, rather perverse, story, just to put it in very simple terms. It's a story about us, people, being persuaded to spend money we don't have on things we don't need to create impressions that won't last on people we don't care about.(Laughter)(Applause)But before we consign ourselves to despair, maybe we should just go back and say, \"Did we get this right? Is this really how people are? Is this really how economies behave?\" And almost straightaway we actually run up against a couple of anomalies. The first one is in the crisis itself. In the crisis, in the recession, what do people want to do? They want to hunker down, they want to look to the future. They want to spend less and save more. But saving is exactly the wrong thing to do from the system point of view. Keynes called this the \"paradox of thrift\" \u2014 saving slows down recovery. And politicians call on us continually to draw down more debt, to draw down our own savings even further, just so that we can get the show back on the road, so we can keep this growth-based economy going. It's an anomaly, it's a place where the system actually is at odds with who we are as people.Here's another one \u2014 completely different one: Why is it that we don't do the blindingly obvious things we should do to combat climate change, very, very simple things like buying energy-efficient appliances, putting in efficient lights, turning the lights off occasionally, insulating our homes? These things save carbon, they save energy, they save us money. So is it that, though they make perfect economic sense, we don't do them? Well, I had my own personal insight into this a few years ago. It was a Sunday evening, Sunday afternoon, and it was just after \u2014 actually, to be honest, too long after \u2014 we had moved into a new house. And I had finally got around to doing some draft stripping, installing insulation around the windows and doors to keep out the drafts. And my, then, five year-old daughter was helping me in the way that five year-olds do. And we'd been doing this for a while, when she turned to me very solemnly and said, \"Will this really keep out the giraffes?\" (Laughter) \"Here they are, the giraffes.\" You can hear the five-year-old mind working. These ones, interestingly, are 400 miles north of here outside Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria. Goodness knows what they make of the Lake District weather. But actually that childish misrepresentation stuck with me, because it suddenly became clear to me why we don't do the blindingly obvious things. We're too busy keeping out the giraffes \u2014 putting the kids on the bus in the morning, getting ourselves to work on time, surviving email overload and shop floor politics, foraging for groceries, throwing together meals, escaping for a couple of precious hours in the evening into prime-time TV or TED online, getting from one end of the day to the other, keeping out the giraffes.(Laughter)What is the objective? \"What is the objective of the consumer?\" Mary Douglas asked in an essay on poverty written 35 years ago. \"It is,\" she said, \"to help create the social world and find a credible place in it.\" That is a deeply humanizing vision of our lives, and it's a completely different vision than the one that lies at the heart of this economic model. So who are we? Who are these people? Are we these novelty-seeking, hedonistic, selfish individuals? Or might we actually occasionally be something like the selfless altruist depicted in Rembrandt's lovely, lovely sketch here? Well psychology actually says there is a tension \u2014 a tension between self-regarding behaviors and other regarding behaviors. And these tensions have deep evolutionary roots, so selfish behavior is adaptive in certain circumstances \u2014 fight or flight.But other regarding behaviors are essential to our evolution as social beings. And perhaps even more interesting from our point of view, another tension between novelty-seeking behaviors and tradition or conservation. Novelty is adaptive when things are changing and you need to adapt yourself. Tradition is essential to lay down the stability to raise families and form cohesive social groups. So here, all of a sudden, we're looking at a map of the human heart. And it reveals to us, suddenly, the crux of the matter. What we've done is we've created economies. We've created systems, which systematically privilege, encourage, one narrow quadrant of the human soul and left the others unregarded. And in the same token, the solution becomes clear, because this isn't, therefore, about changing human nature. It isn't, in fact, about curtailing possibilities. It is about opening up. It is about allowing ourselves the freedom to become fully human, recognizing the depth and the breadth of the human psyche and building institutions to protect Rembrandt's fragile altruist within.What does all this mean for economics? What would economies look like if we took that vision of human nature at their heart and stretched them along these orthogonal dimensions of the human psyche? Well, it might look a little bit like the 4,000 community-interest companies that have sprung up in the U.K. over the last five years and a similar rise in B corporations in the United States, enterprises that have ecological and social goals written into their constitution at their heart \u2014 companies, in fact, like this one, Ecosia. And I just want to, very quickly, show you this. Ecosia is an Internet search engine. Internet search engines work by drawing revenues from sponsored links that appear when you do a search. And Ecosia works in pretty much the same way. So we can do that here \u2014 we can just put in a little search term. There you go, Oxford, that's where we are. See what comes up. The difference with Ecosia though is that, in Ecosia's case, it draws the revenues in the same way, but it allocates 80 percent of those revenues to a rainforest protection project in the Amazon. And we're going to do it. We're just going to click on Naturejobs.uk. In case anyone out there is looking for a job in a recession, that's the page to go to. And what happened then was the sponsor gave revenues to Ecosia, and Ecosia is giving 80 percent of those revenues to a rainforest protection project. It's taking profits from one place and allocating them into the protection of ecological resources.It's a different kind of enterprise for a new economy. It's a form, if you like, of ecological altruism \u2014 perhaps something along those lines. Maybe it's that. Whatever it is, whatever this new economy is, what we need the economy to do, in fact, is to put investment back into the heart of the model, to re-conceive investment. Only now, investment isn't going to be about the relentless and mindless pursuit of consumption growth. Investment has to be a different beast. Investment has to be, in the new economy, protecting and nurturing the ecological assets on which our future depends. It has to be about transition. It has to be investing in low-carbon technologies and infrastructures. We have to invest, in fact, in the idea of a meaningful prosperity, providing capabilities for people to flourish.And of course, this task has material dimensions. It would be nonsense to talk about people flourishing if they didn't have food, clothing and shelter. But it's also clear that prosperity goes beyond this. It has social and psychological aims \u2014 family, friendship, commitments, society, participating in the life of that society. And this too requires investment, investment \u2014 for example, in places \u2014 places where we can connect, places where we can participate, shared spaces, concert halls, gardens, public parks, libraries, museums, quiet centers, places of joy and celebration, places of tranquility and contemplation, sites for the \"cultivation of a common citizenship,\" in Michael Sandel's lovely phrase. An investment \u2014 investment, after all, is just such a basic economic concept \u2014 is nothing more nor less than a relationship between the present and the future, a shared present and a common future. And we need that relationship to reflect, to reclaim hope.So let me come back, with this sense of hope, to the two billion people still trying to live each day on less than the price of a skinny latte from the cafe next door. What can we offer those people? It's clear that we have a responsibility to help lift them out of poverty. It's clear that we have a responsibility to make room for growth where growth really matters in those poorest nations. And it's also clear that we will never achieve that unless we're capable of redefining a meaningful sense of prosperity in the richer nations, a prosperity that is more meaningful and less materialistic than the growth-based model. So this is not just a Western post-materialist fantasy. In fact, an African philosopher wrote to me, when \"Prosperity Without Growth\" was published, pointing out the similarities between this view of prosperity and the traditional African concept of ubuntu. Ubuntu says, \"I am because we are.\" Prosperity is a shared endeavor. Its roots are long and deep \u2014 its foundations, I've tried to show, exist already, inside each of us. So this is not about standing in the way of development. It's not about overthrowing capitalism. It's not about trying to change human nature. What we're doing here is we're taking a few simple steps towards an economics fit for purpose. And at the heart of that economics, we're placing a more credible, more robust, and more realistic vision of what it means to be human.Thank you very much.(Applause)Chris Anderson: While they're taking the podium away, just a quick question. First of all, economists aren't supposed to be inspiring, so you may need to work on the tone a little. (Laughter) Can you picture the politicians ever buying into this? I mean, can you picture a politician standing up in Britain and saying, \"GDP fell two percent this year. Good news! We're actually all happier, and a country's more beautiful, and our lives are better.\"Tim Jackson: Well that's clearly not what you're doing. You're not making news out of things falling down. You're making news out of the things that tell you that we're flourishing. Can I picture politicians doing it? Actually, I already am seeing a little bit of it. When we first started this kind of work, politicians would stand up, treasury spokesmen would stand up, and accuse us of wanting to go back and live in caves. And actually in the period through which we've been working over the last 18 years \u2014 partly because of the financial crisis and a little bit of humility in the profession of economics \u2014 actually people are engaging in this issue in all sorts of countries around the world.CA: But is it mainly politicians who are going to have to get their act together, or is it going to be more just civil society and companies?TJ: It has to be companies. It has to be civil society. But it has to have political leadership. This is a kind of agenda, which actually politicians themselves are kind of caught in that dilemma, because they're hooked on the growth model themselves. But actually opening up the space to think about different ways of governing, different kinds of politics, and creating the space for civil society and businesses to operate differently \u2014 absolutely vital.CA: And if someone could convince you that we actually can make the \u2014 what was it? \u2014 the 130-fold improvement in efficiency, of reduction of carbon footprint, would you then actually like that picture of economic growth into more knowledge-based goods?TJ: I would still want to know that you could do that and get below zero by the end of the century, in terms of taking carbon out of the atmosphere, and solve the problem of biodiversity and reduce the impact on land use and do something about the erosion of topsoils and the quality of water. If you can convince me we can do all that, then, yes, I would take the two percent.CA: Tim, thank you for a very important talk.

numbers,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\ntake a reality check here.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nSo I want you to imagine a world,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nin 2050, of around nine billion people,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nall aspiring to Western incomes,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nWestern lifestyles.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nAnd I want to ask the question --\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nand we'll give them that two percent hike in income, in salary each year as well,\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nbecause we believe in growth.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nAnd I want to ask the question:\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nhow far and how fast would be have to move?\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nHow clever would we have to be?\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nHow much technology would we need in this world\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nto deliver our carbon targets?\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nAnd here in my chart --\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\non the left-hand side is where we are now.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nThis is the carbon intensity of economic growth\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nin the economy at the moment.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nIt's around about 770 grams of carbon.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nIn the world I describe to you,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nwe have to be right over here at the right-hand side\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nat six grams of carbon.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nIt's a 130-fold improvement,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nand that is 10 times further and faster\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nthan anything we've ever achieved in industrial history.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nMaybe we can do it, maybe it's possible -- who knows?\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nMaybe we can even go further\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nand get an economy that pulls carbon out of the atmosphere,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nwhich is what we're going to need to be doing\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nby the end of the century.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nBut shouldn't we just check first\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nthat the economic system that we have\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nis remotely capable of delivering\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nthis kind of improvement?\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nSo I want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nIt's a bit complex, and I apologize for that.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nWhat I'll try and do, is I'll try and paraphrase it\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nis sort of human terms.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nSo it looks a little bit like this.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nFirms produce goods for households -- that's us --\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nand provide us with incomes,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nand that's even better, because we can spend those incomes\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\non more goods and services.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nThat's called the circular flow of the economy.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nIt looks harmless enough.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nI just want to highlight one key feature of this system,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nwhich is the role of investment.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nNow investment constitutes\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nonly about a fifth of the national income\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nin most modern economies,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nbut it plays an absolutely vital role.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nAnd what it does essentially\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nis to stimulate further consumption growth.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nIt does this in a couple of ways --\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nchasing productivity,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nwhich drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nBut I want to concentrate\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\non the role of investment\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nin seeking out novelty,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nthe production and consumption of novelty.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nJoseph Schumpeter called this\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\n\"the process of creative destruction.\"\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nIt's a process of the production and reproduction of novelty,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\ncontinually chasing expanding consumer markets,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nconsumer goods, new consumer goods.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nAnd this, this is where it gets interesting,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nbecause it turns out that human beings\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nhave something of an appetite for novelty.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nWe love new stuff --\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nnew material stuff for sure --\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nbut also new ideas, new adventures,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nnew experiences.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nBut the materiality matters too,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nbecause in every society\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nthat anthropologists have looked at,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nmaterial stuff\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\noperates as a kind of language --\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\na language of goods,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\na symbolic language\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nthat we use to tell each other stories --\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nstories, for example,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nabout how important we are.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nStatus-driven, conspicuous consumption\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nthrives from the language\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nof novelty.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nAnd here, all of a sudden,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nwe have a system\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nthat is locking economic structure with social logic --\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nthe economic institutions, and who we are as people, locked together\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nto drive an engine of growth.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nAnd this engine is not just economic value;\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nit is pulling material resources\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nrelentlessly through the system,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\ndriven by our own insatiable appetites,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\ndriven in fact by a sense of anxiety.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nAdam Smith, 200 years ago,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nspoke about our desire\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nfor a life without shame.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nA life without shame:\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nin his day, what that meant was a linen shirt,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nand today, well, you still need the shirt,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nbut you need the hybrid car,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nthe HDTV, two holidays a year in the sun,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nthe netbook and iPad, the list goes on --\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nan almost inexhaustible supply of goods,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\ndriven by this anxiety.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nAnd even if we don't want them,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nwe need to buy them,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nbecause, if we don't buy them, the system crashes.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nAnd to stop it crashing\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nover the last two to three decades,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nwe've expanded the money supply,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nexpanded credit and debt,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nso that people can keep buying stuff.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd of course, that expansion was deeply implicated in the crisis.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nBut this -- I just want to show you some data here.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nThis is what it looks like, essentially,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nthis credit and debt system, just for the U.K.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nThis was the last 15 years before the crash,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nand you can see there, consumer debt rose dramatically.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nIt was above the GDP for three years in a row\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\njust before the crisis.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nAnd in the mean time, personal savings absolutely plummeted.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nThe savings ratio, net savings,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nwere below zero in the middle of 2008,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\njust before the crash.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nThis is people expanding debt, drawing down their savings,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\njust to stay in the game.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nThis is a strange, rather perverse, story,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\njust to put it in very simple terms.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nIt's a story about us, people,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nbeing persuaded\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nto spend money we don't have\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\non things we don't need\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nto create impressions that won't last\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\non people we don't care about.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:11.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nBut before we consign ourselves to despair,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nmaybe we should just go back and say, \"Did we get this right?\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nIs this really how people are?\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nIs this really how economies behave?\"\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd almost straightaway\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nwe actually run up against a couple of anomalies.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nThe first one is in the crisis itself.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nIn the crisis, in the recession, what do people want to do?\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nThey want to hunker down, they want to look to the future.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nThey want to spend less and save more.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nBut saving is exactly the wrong thing to do\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nfrom the system point of view.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nKeynes called this the \"paradox of thrift\" --\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nsaving slows down recovery.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nAnd politicians call on us continually\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nto draw down more debt,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nto draw down our own savings even further,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\njust so that we can get the show back on the road,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nso we can keep this growth-based economy going.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nIt's an anomaly,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nit's a place where the system actually is at odds\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nwith who we are as people.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nHere's another one -- completely different one:\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nWhy is it\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nthat we don't do the blindingly obvious things we should do\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nto combat climate change,\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nvery, very simple things\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nlike buying energy-efficient appliances,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nputting in efficient lights, turning the lights off occasionally,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\ninsulating our homes?\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nThese things save carbon, they save energy,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nthey save us money.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nSo is it that, though they make perfect economic sense,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nwe don't do them?\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nWell, I had my own personal insight into this\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\na few years ago.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nIt was a Sunday evening, Sunday afternoon,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nand it was just after --\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nactually, to be honest, too long after --\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nwe had moved into a new house.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nAnd I had finally got around to doing some draft stripping,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\ninstalling insulation around the windows and doors\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nto keep out the drafts.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nAnd my, then, five year-old daughter\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nwas helping me in the way that five year-olds do.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nAnd we'd been doing this for a while,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nwhen she turned to me very solemnly and said,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\n\"Will this really keep out the giraffes?\"\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\n\"Here they are, the giraffes.\"\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nYou can hear the five-year-old mind working.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nThese ones, interestingly, are 400 miles north of here\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\noutside Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nGoodness knows what they make of the Lake District weather.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nBut actually that childish misrepresentation\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nstuck with me,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nbecause it suddenly became clear to me\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nwhy we don't do the blindingly obvious things.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nWe're too busy keeping out the giraffes --\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nputting the kids on the bus in the morning,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\ngetting ourselves to work on time,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nsurviving email overload\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nand shop floor politics,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nforaging for groceries, throwing together meals,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nescaping for a couple of precious hours in the evening\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\ninto prime-time TV\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nor TED online,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\ngetting from one end of the day to the other,\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nkeeping out the giraffes.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nWhat is the objective?\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\n\"What is the objective of the consumer?\"\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nMary Douglas asked in an essay on poverty\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nwritten 35 years ago.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\n\"It is,\" she said,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\n\"to help create the social world\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nand find a credible place in it.\"\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nThat is a deeply humanizing\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nvision of our lives,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nand it's a completely different vision\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nthan the one that lies at the heart\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nof this economic model.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nSo who are we?\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nWho are these people?\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nAre we these novelty-seeking, hedonistic,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nselfish individuals?\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nOr might we actually occasionally be\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nsomething like the selfless altruist\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\ndepicted in Rembrandt's lovely, lovely sketch here?\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nWell psychology actually says\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nthere is a tension --\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\na tension between self-regarding behaviors\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nand other regarding behaviors.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nAnd these tensions have deep evolutionary roots,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nso selfish behavior\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nis adaptive in certain circumstances --\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nfight or flight.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nBut other regarding behaviors\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nare essential to our evolution\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nas social beings.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nAnd perhaps even more interesting from our point of view,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nanother tension between novelty-seeking behaviors\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nand tradition or conservation.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nNovelty is adaptive when things are changing\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nand you need to adapt yourself.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nTradition is essential to lay down the stability\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nto raise families and form cohesive social groups.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nSo here, all of a sudden,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nwe're looking at a map of the human heart.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nAnd it reveals to us, suddenly,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nthe crux of the matter.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nWhat we've done is we've created economies.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nWe've created systems,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nwhich systematically privilege, encourage,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\none narrow quadrant\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nof the human soul\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nand left the others unregarded.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nAnd in the same token, the solution becomes clear,\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nbecause this isn't, therefore,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nabout changing human nature.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nIt isn't, in fact, about curtailing possibilities.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nIt is about opening up.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nIt is about allowing ourselves the freedom\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nto become fully human,\n\n00:12:11.958 -->

hope,\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nto the two billion people\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nstill trying to live each day\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\non less than the price of a skinny

responsibility\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nto help lift them out of poverty.\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nIt's clear that we have a responsibility\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nto make room for growth\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nwhere growth really matters in those poorest nations.\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nAnd it's also clear that we will never achieve that\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nunless we're capable of redefining\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\na meaningful sense of prosperity in the richer nations,\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.958\na

not just\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.958\na Western post-materialist fantasy.\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nIn fact, an African philosopher wrote to me,\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nwhen \"Prosperity Without Growth\" was published,\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.958\npointing out the similarities\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nbetween this view of prosperity\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nand the traditional African concept of ubuntu.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nUbuntu says, \"I am\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nbecause we are.\"\n\n00:17:13.958 -->

--> 00:17:23.958\nexist already, inside each of us.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nSo this is not about\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nstanding in the way of development.\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nIt's not about\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:31.958\noverthrowing capitalism.\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nIt's not about\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.958\ntrying to change human

It's actually got a naked skin for most of its body, so it reduces friction with the water. This is what one of nature's finest machines.Now, bluefin were revered by Man for all of human history. For 4,000 years, we fished sustainably for this animal, and it's evidenced in the art that we see from thousands of years ago. Bluefin are in cave paintings in France. They're on coins that date back 3,000 years. This fish was revered by humankind. It was fished sustainably till all of time, except for our generation. Bluefin are pursued wherever they go \u2014 there is a gold rush on Earth, and this is a gold rush for bluefin. There are traps that fish sustainably up until recently. And yet, the type of fishing going on today, with pens, with enormous stakes, is really wiping bluefin ecologically off the planet. Now bluefin, in general, goes to one place: Japan. Some of you may be guilty of having contributed to the demise of bluefin. They're delectable muscle, rich in fat \u2014 absolutely taste delicious. And that's their problem; we're eating them to death. Now in the Atlantic, the story is pretty simple. Bluefin have two populations: one large, one small. The North American population is fished at about 2,000 ton. The European population and North African \u2014 the Eastern bluefin tuna \u2014 is fished at tremendous levels: 50,000 tons over the last decade almost every year.The result is whether you're looking at the West or the Eastern bluefin population, there's been tremendous decline on both sides, as much as 90 percent if you go back with your baseline to 1950. For that, bluefin have been given a status equivalent to tigers, to lions, to certain African elephants and to pandas. These fish have been proposed for an endangered species listing in the past two months. They were voted on and rejected just two weeks ago, despite outstanding science that shows from two committees this fish meets the criteria of CITES I. And if it's tunas you don't care about, perhaps you might be interested that international long lines and pursing chase down tunas and bycatch animals such as leatherbacks, sharks, marlin, albatross. These animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries. The challenge we face is that we know very little about tuna, and everyone in the room knows what it looks like when an African lion takes down its prey. I doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed. This tuna symbolizes what's the problem for all of us in the room.It's the 21st century, but we really have only just begun to really study our oceans in a deep way. Technology has come of age that's allowing us to see the Earth from space and go deep into the seas remotely. And we've got to use these technologies immediately to get a better understanding of how our ocean realm works. Most of us from the ship \u2014 even I \u2014 look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea. We don't know where the structure is. We can't tell where are the watering holes like we can on an African plain. We can't see the corridors, and we can't see what it is that brings together a tuna, a leatherback and an albatross. We're only just beginning to understand how the physical oceanography and the biological oceanography come together to create a seasonal force that actually causes the upwelling that might make a hot spot a hope spot. The reasons these challenges are great is that technically it's difficult to go to sea. It's hard to study a bluefin on its turf, the entire Pacific realm. It's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it. And then imagine being Bruce Mate's team from OSU, getting up close to a blue whale and fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays, an engineering challenge we've yet to really overcome.So the story of our team, a dedicated team, is fish and chips. We basically are taking the same satellite phone parts, or the same parts that are in your computer, chips. We're putting them together in unusual ways, and this is taking us into the ocean realm like never before. And for the first time, we're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean using light and photons to measure sunrise and sunset. Now, I've been working with tunas for over 15 years. I have the privilege of being a partner with the Monterey Bay Aquarium. We've actually taken a sliver of the ocean, put it behind glass, and we together have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display. When the veil of bubbles lifts every morning, we can actually see a community from the Pelagic ocean, one of the only places on Earth you can see giant bluefin swim by. We can see in their beauty of form and function, their ceaseless activity. They're flying through their space, ocean space. And we can bring two million people a year into contact with this fish and show them its beauty.Behind the scenes is a working lab at Stanford University partnered with the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Here, for over 14 or 15 years, we've actually brought in both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity. We'd been studying these fish, but first we had to learn how to husbandry them. What do they like to eat? What is it that they're happy with? We go in the tanks with the tuna \u2014 we touch their naked skin \u2014 it's pretty amazing. It feels wonderful. And then, better yet, we've got our own version of tuna whisperers, our own Chuck Farwell, Alex Norton, who can take a big tuna and in one motion, put it into an envelope of water, so that we can actually work with the tuna and learn the techniques it takes to not injure this fish who never sees a boundary in the open sea. Jeff and Jason there, are scientists who are going to take a tuna and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill, a flume. And that tuna thinks it's going to Japan, but it's staying in place. We're actually measuring its oxygen consumption, its energy consumption. We're taking this data and building better models. And when I see that tuna \u2014 this is my favorite view \u2014 I begin to wonder: how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did? So take a look at that animal. That's the closest you'll probably ever get. Now, the activities from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean.So in a program called Tag-A-Giant we've actually gone from Ireland to Canada, from Corsica to Spain. We've fished with many nations around the world in an effort to basically put electronic computers inside giant tunas. We've actually tagged 1,100 tunas. And I'm going to show you three clips, because I tagged 1,100 tunas. It's a very hard process, but it's a ballet. We bring the tuna out, we measure it. A team of fishers, captains, scientists and technicians work together to keep this animal out of the ocean for about four to five minutes. We put water over its gills, give it oxygen. And then with a lot of effort, after tagging, putting in the computer, making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment, we send this fish back into the sea. And when it goes, we're always happy. We see a flick of the tail. And from our data that gets collected, when that tag comes back, because a fisher returns it for a thousand-dollar reward, we can get tracks beneath the sea for up to five years now, on a backboned animal.Now sometimes the tunas are really large, such as this fish off Nantucket. But that's about half the size of the biggest tuna we've ever tagged. It takes a human effort, a team effort, to bring the fish in. In this case, what we're going to do is put a pop-up satellite archival tag on the tuna. This tag rides on the tuna, senses the environment around the tuna and actually will come off the fish, detach, float to the surface and send back to Earth-orbiting satellites position data estimated by math on the tag, pressure data and temperature data. And so what we get then from the pop-up satellite tag is we get away from having to have a human interaction to recapture the tag. Both the electronic tags I'm talking about are expensive. These tags have been engineered by a variety of teams in North America. They are some of our finest instruments, our new technology in the ocean today. One community in general has given more to help us than any other community. And that's the fisheries off the state of North Carolina. There are two villages, Harris and Morehead City, every winter for over a decade, held a party called Tag-A-Giant, and together, fishers worked with us to tag 800 to 900 fish. In this case, we're actually going to measure the fish. We're going to do something that in recent years we've started: take a mucus sample. Watch how shiny the skin is; you can see my reflection there. And from that mucus, we can get gene profiles, we can get information on gender, checking the pop-up tag one more time, and then it's out in the ocean. And this is my favorite.With the help of my former postdoc, Gareth Lawson, this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna. This tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean. The warm is the Gulf Stream, the cold up there in the Gulf of Maine. That's where the tuna wants to go \u2014 it wants to forage on schools of herring \u2014 but it can't get there. It's too cold. But then it warms up, and the tuna pops in, gets some fish, maybe comes back to home base, goes in again and then comes back to winter down there in North Carolina and then on to the Bahamas. And my favorite scene, three tunas going into the Gulf of Mexico. Three tunas tagged. Astronomically, we're calculating positions. They're coming together. That could be tuna sex \u2014 and there it is. That is where the tuna spawn. So from data like this, we're able now to put the map up, and in this map you see thousands of positions generated by this decade and a half of tagging. And now we're showing that tunas on the western side go to the eastern side. So two populations of tunas \u2014 that is, we have a Gulf population, one that we can tag \u2014 they go to the Gulf of Mexico, I showed you that \u2014 and a second population. Living amongst our tunas \u2014 our North American tunas \u2014 are European tunas that go back to the Med. On the hot spots \u2014 the hope spots \u2014 they're mixed populations.And so what we've done with the science is we're showing the International Commission, building new models, showing them that a two-stock no-mixing model \u2014 to this day, used to reject the CITES treaty \u2014 that model isn't the right model. This model, a model of overlap, is the way to move forward. So we can then predict where management places should be. Places like the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean are places where the single species, the single population, can be captured. These become forthright in places we need to protect. The center of the Atlantic where the mixing is, I could imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish, because they manage their fisheries well, they're doing a good job. But in the international realm, where fishing and overfishing has really gone wild, these are the places that we have to make hope spots in. That's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna.Now in a second project called Tagging of Pacific Pelagics, we took on the planet as a team, those of us in the Census of Marine Life. And, funded primarily through Sloan Foundation and others, we were able to actually go in, in our project \u2014 we're one of 17 field programs and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators, not just tunas. So what we've done is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska, met salmon shark on their home territory, followed them catching salmon and then went in and figured out that, if we take a salmon and put it on a line, we can actually take up a salmon shark \u2014 This is the cousin of the white shark \u2014 and very carefully \u2014 note, I say \"very carefully,\" \u2014 we can actually keep it calm, put a hose in its mouth, keep it off the deck and then tag it with a satellite tag. That satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and send in a message. And that shark leaping there, if you look carefully, has an antenna. It's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon, sending home its data. Salmon sharks aren't the only sharks we tag. But there goes salmon sharks with this meter-level resolution on an ocean of temperature \u2014 warm colors are warmer. Salmon sharks go down to the tropics to pup and come into Monterey.Now right next door in Monterey and up at the Farallones are a white shark team led by Scott Anderson \u2014 there \u2014 and Sal Jorgensen. They can throw out a target \u2014 it's a carpet shaped like a seal \u2014 and in will come a white shark, a curious critter that will come right up to our 16-ft. boat. It's a several thousand-pound animal. And we'll wind in the target. And we'll place an acoustic tag that says, \"OMSHARK 10165,\" or something like that, acoustically with a ping. And then we'll put on a satellite tag that will give us the long-distance journeys with the light-based geolocation algorithms solved on the computer that's on the fish. So in this case, Sal's looking at two tags there, and there they are: the white sharks of California going off to the white shark cafe and coming back. We also tag makos with our NOAA colleagues, blue sharks. And now, together, what we can see on this ocean of color that's temperature, we can see ten-day worms of makos and salmon sharks. We have white sharks and blue sharks. For the first time, an ecoscape as large as ocean-scale, showing where the sharks go.The tuna team from TOPP has done the unthinkable: three teams tagged 1,700 tunas, bluefin, yellowfin and albacore all at the same time \u2014 carefully rehearsed tagging programs in which we go out, pick up juvenile tunas, put in the tags that actually have the sensors, stick out the tuna and then let them go. They get returned, and when they get returned, here on a NASA numerical ocean you can see bluefin in blue go across their corridor, returning to the Western Pacific.Our team from UCSC has tagged elephant seals with tags that are glued on their heads, that come off when they slough. These elephant seals cover half an ocean, take data down to 1,800 feet \u2014 amazing data. And then there's Scott Shaffer and our shearwaters wearing tuna tags, light-based tags, that now are going to take you from New Zealand to Monterey and back, journeys of 35,000 nautical miles we had never seen before. But now with light-based geolocation tags that are very small, we can actually see these journeys. Same thing with Laysan albatross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes, up to the same zone the tunas use. You can see why they might be caught. Then there's George Schillinger and our leatherback team out of Playa Grande tagging leatherbacks that go right past where we are. And Scott Benson's team that showed that leatherbacks go from Indonesia all the way to Monterey. So what we can see on this moving ocean is we can finally see where the predators are. We can actually see how they're using ecospaces as large as an ocean.And from this information, we can begin to map the hope spots. So this is just three years of data right here \u2014 and there's a decade of this data. We see the pulse and the seasonal activities that these animals are going on. So what we're able to do with this information is boil it down to hot spots, 4,000 deployments, a huge herculean task, 2,000 tags in an area, shown here for the first time, off the California coast, that appears to be a gathering place. And then for sort of an encore from these animals, they're helping us. They're carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters. They're taking information from our planet at very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles. Those are seals from many countries being released who are sampling underneath the ice sheets and giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality on both poles.This data, when visualized, is captivating to watch. We still haven't figured out best how to visualize the data. And then, as these animals swim and give us the information that's important to climate issues, we also think it's critical to get this information to the public, to engage the public with this kind of data. We did this with the Great Turtle Race \u2014 tagged turtles, brought in four million hits. And now with Google's Oceans, we can actually put a white shark in that ocean. And when we do and it swims, we see this magnificent bathymetry that the shark knows is there on its path as it goes from California to Hawaii. But maybe Mission Blue can fill in that ocean that we can't see. We've got the capacity, NASA has the ocean. We just need to put it together.So in conclusion, we know where Yellowstone is for North America; it's off our coast. We have the technology that's shown us where it is. What we need to think about perhaps for Mission Blue is increasing the biologging capacity. How is it that we can actually take this type of activity elsewhere? And then finally \u2014 to basically get the message home \u2014 maybe use live links from animals such as blue whales and white sharks. Make killer apps, if you will. A lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone. That way we do away with a few internet myths.So we can save the bluefin tuna. We can save the white shark. We have the science and technology. Hope is here. Yes we can. We need just to apply this capacity further in the oceans.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 973, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nI've

way.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nTechnology has come of age\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nthat's allowing us to see the Earth from space\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nand go deep into the seas remotely.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nAnd we've got to use these technologies immediately\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nto get a better understanding\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nof how our ocean realm works.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nMost of us from the ship -- even I --\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nlook out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nWe don't know where the structure is.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nWe can't tell where are the watering holes\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nlike we can on an African plain.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nWe can't see the corridors,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nand we can't see what it is\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nthat brings together a tuna,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\na leatherback and an albatross.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nWe're only just beginning to understand\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nhow the physical oceanography\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nand the biological oceanography\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\ncome together\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nto create a seasonal force\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nthat actually causes the upwelling\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nthat might make a hot spot a hope spot.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nThe reasons these challenges are great\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nis that technically it's difficult to go to sea.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nIt's hard to study a bluefin on its turf,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nthe entire Pacific realm.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nIt's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nand try to put a tag on it.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nAnd then imagine being Bruce Mate's team from OSU,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\ngetting up close to a blue whale\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nand fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nan engineering challenge\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nwe've yet to really overcome.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nSo the story of our team, a dedicated team,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nis fish and chips.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nWe basically are taking\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nthe same satellite phone parts,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nor the same parts that are in your computer, chips.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nWe're putting them together in unusual ways,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nand this is taking us into the ocean realm\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nlike never before.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nAnd for the first time,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nwe're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nusing light and photons\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nto measure sunrise and sunset.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nNow, I've been working with tunas for over 15 years.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nI have the privilege of being a partner\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nwith the Monterey Bay Aquarium.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nWe've actually taken a sliver of the ocean,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nput it behind glass,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nand we together\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nhave put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nWhen the veil of bubbles lifts every morning,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nwe can actually see a community from the Pelagic ocean,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\none of the only places on Earth\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nyou can see giant bluefin swim by.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nWe can see in their beauty of form and function,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\ntheir ceaseless activity.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nThey're flying through their space, ocean space.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nAnd we can bring two million people a year\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\ninto contact with this fish\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nand show them its beauty.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nBehind the scenes is a working lab at Stanford University\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\npartnered with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nHere, for over 14 or 15 years,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nwe've actually brought in\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nboth bluefin and yellowfin in captivity.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nWe'd been studying these fish,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nbut first we had to learn how to husbandry them.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nWhat do they like to eat?\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nWhat is it that they're happy with?\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nWe go in the tanks with the tuna -- we touch their naked skin --\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nit's pretty amazing. It feels wonderful.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nAnd then, better yet,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nwe've got our own version of tuna whisperers,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nour own Chuck Farwell, Alex Norton,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nwho can take a big tuna\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nand in one motion,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nput it into an envelope of water,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nso that we can actually work with the tuna\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nand learn the techniques it takes\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nto not injure this fish\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nwho never sees a boundary in the open sea.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nJeff and Jason there, are scientists\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nwho are going to take a tuna\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nand put it in the equivalent of a treadmill, a flume.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nAnd that tuna thinks it's going to Japan, but it's staying in place.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nWe're actually measuring its oxygen consumption,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nits energy consumption.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nWe're taking this data and building better models.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nAnd when I see that tuna -- this is my favorite view --\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nI begin to wonder:\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nhow did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did?\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nSo take a look at that animal.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nThat's the closest you'll probably ever get.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nNow, the activities from the lab\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nhave taught us now how to go out in the open ocean.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nSo in a program called Tag-A-Giant\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nwe've actually gone from Ireland to Canada,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nfrom Corsica to Spain.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nWe've fished with many nations around the world\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nin an effort to basically\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nput electronic computers\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\ninside giant tunas.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nWe've actually tagged 1,100 tunas.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nAnd I'm going to show you three clips,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nbecause I tagged 1,100 tunas.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nIt's a very hard process, but it's a ballet.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nWe bring the tuna out, we measure it.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nA team of fishers, captains, scientists and technicians\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nwork together to keep this animal out of the ocean\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nfor about four to five minutes.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nWe put water over its gills, give it oxygen.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nAnd then with a lot of effort, after tagging,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nputting in the computer,\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nmaking sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nwe send this fish back into the sea.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nAnd when it goes, we're always happy.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nWe see a flick of the tail.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nAnd from our data that gets collected,\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nwhen that tag comes back,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nbecause a fisher returns it\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nfor a thousand-dollar reward,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nwe can get tracks beneath the sea\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nfor up to five years now,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\non a backboned animal.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nNow sometimes the tunas are really large,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nsuch as this fish off Nantucket.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nBut that's about half the size\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nof the biggest tuna we've ever tagged.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nIt takes a human effort,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\na team effort, to bring the fish in.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nIn this case, what we're going to do\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nis put a pop-up satellite archival tag on the tuna.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nThis tag rides on the tuna,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nsenses the environment around the tuna\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nand actually will come off the fish,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\ndetach, float to the surface\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nand send back to Earth-orbiting satellites\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nposition data estimated by math on the tag,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\npressure data and temperature data.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nAnd so what we get then from the pop-up satellite tag\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nis we get away from having to have a human interaction\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nto recapture the tag.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nBoth the electronic tags I'm talking about are expensive.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nThese tags have been engineered\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nby a variety of teams in North America.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nThey are some of our finest instruments,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nour new technology in the ocean today.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nOne community in general\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nhas given more to help us than any other community.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nAnd that's the fisheries off the state of North Carolina.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nThere are two villages, Harris and Morehead City,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nevery winter for over a decade,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nheld a party called Tag-A-Giant,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nand together, fishers worked with us\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nto tag 800 to 900 fish.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nIn this case, we're actually going to measure the fish.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nWe're going to do something that in recent years we've started:\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\ntake a mucus sample.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nWatch how shiny the skin is; you can see my reflection there.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nAnd from that mucus, we can get gene profiles,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nwe can get information on gender,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nchecking the pop-up tag one more time,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nand then it's out in the ocean.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nAnd this is my favorite.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nWith the help of my former postdoc, Gareth Lawson,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nthis is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nThis tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nThe warm is the Gulf Stream,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nthe cold up there in the Gulf of Maine.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nThat's where the tuna wants to go -- it wants to forage on schools of herring --\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nbut it can't get there. It's too cold.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nBut then it warms up, and the tuna pops in, gets some fish,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nmaybe comes back to home base,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\ngoes in again\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nand then comes back to winter down there in North Carolina\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nand then on to the Bahamas.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nAnd my favorite scene, three tunas going into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nThree tunas tagged.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nAstronomically, we're calculating positions.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nThey're coming together. That could be tuna sex --\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nand there it is.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nThat is where the tuna spawn.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nSo from data like this,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nwe're able now to put the map up,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nand in this map\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nyou see thousands of positions\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\ngenerated by this decade and a half of tagging.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nAnd now we're showing that tunas on the western side\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\ngo to the eastern side.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nSo two populations of tunas --\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nthat is, we have a Gulf population, one that we can tag --\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nthey go to the Gulf of Mexico, I showed you that --\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nand a second population.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nLiving amongst our tunas -- our North American tunas --\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nare European tunas that go back to the Med.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nOn the hot spots -- the hope spots --\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nthey're mixed populations.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nAnd so what we've done with the science\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nis we're showing the International Commission,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nbuilding new models,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nshowing them that a two-stock no-mixing model --\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nto this day, used to reject\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nthe CITES treaty --\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nthat model isn't the right model.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nThis model, a model of overlap,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nis the way to move forward.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nSo we can then predict\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nwhere management places should be.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nPlaces like the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nare places where the single species,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nthe single population, can be captured.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nThese become forthright in places we need to protect.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nThe center of the Atlantic where the mixing is,\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nI could imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nbecause they manage their fisheries well,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nthey're doing a good job.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nBut in the international realm,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nwhere fishing and overfishing has really gone wild,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nthese are the places that we have to make hope spots in.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nThat's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nNow in a second project\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\ncalled Tagging of Pacific Pelagics,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nwe took on the planet as a team,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nthose of us in the Census of Marine Life.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nAnd, funded primarily through Sloan Foundation and others,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nwe were able to actually go in, in our project --\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nwe're one of 17 field programs\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nand begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nnot just tunas.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nSo what we've done\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nis actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nmet salmon shark on their home territory,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nfollowed them catching salmon\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nand then went in and figured out\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nthat, if we take a salmon and put it on a line,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nwe can actually take up a salmon shark --\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nThis is the cousin of the white shark --\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nand very carefully --\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nnote, I say \"very carefully,\" --\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nwe can actually keep it calm,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nput a hose in its mouth, keep it off the deck\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nand then tag it with a satellite tag.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nThat satellite tag will now have your shark phone home\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nand send in a message.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nAnd that shark leaping there, if you look carefully, has an antenna.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nIt's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\njumping after salmon,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nsending home its data.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nSalmon sharks aren't the only sharks we tag.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nBut there goes salmon sharks with this meter-level resolution\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\non an ocean of temperature -- warm colors are warmer.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nSalmon sharks go down\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nto the tropics to pup\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nand come into Monterey.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nNow right next door in Monterey and up at the Farallones\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nare a white shark team led by Scott Anderson -- there --\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nand Sal Jorgensen.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nThey can throw out a target --\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nit's a carpet shaped like a seal --\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nand in will come a white shark, a curious critter\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nthat will come right up to our 16-ft. boat.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nIt's a several thousand-pound animal.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nAnd we'll wind in the target.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nAnd we'll place an acoustic tag\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nthat says, \"OMSHARK 10165,\"\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nor something like that, acoustically with a ping.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nAnd then we'll put on a satellite tag\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nthat will give us the long-distance journeys\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nwith the light-based geolocation algorithms\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nsolved on the computer that's on the fish.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nSo in this case, Sal's looking at two tags there,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nand there they are: the white sharks of California\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\ngoing off to the white shark cafe and coming back.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nWe also tag makos with our NOAA colleagues,\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nblue sharks.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nAnd now, together, what we can see\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\non this ocean of color that's temperature,\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nwe can see ten-day worms of makos and salmon sharks.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nWe have white sharks and blue sharks.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nFor the first time,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nan ecoscape as large as ocean-scale,\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nshowing where the sharks go.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nThe tuna team from TOPP has done the unthinkable:\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nthree teams tagged 1,700 tunas,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nbluefin, yellowfin and albacore\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nall at the same time --\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\ncarefully rehearsed tagging programs\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nin which we go out, pick up juvenile tunas,\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nput in the tags that actually have the sensors,\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nstick out the tuna\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nand then let them go.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nThey get returned, and when they get returned,\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nhere on a NASA numerical ocean\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nyou can see bluefin in blue\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\ngo across their corridor,\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nreturning to the Western Pacific.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nOur team from UCSC has tagged elephant seals\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nwith tags that are glued on their heads, that come off when they slough.\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nThese elephant seals cover half an ocean,\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\ntake data down to 1,800 feet --\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\namazing data.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nAnd then there's Scott Shaffer and our shearwaters\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nwearing tuna tags, light-based tags,\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nthat now are going to take you from New Zealand to Monterey and back,\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\njourneys of 35,000 nautical miles\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nwe had never seen before.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nBut now with light-based geolocation tags that are very small,\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nwe can actually see these journeys.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nSame thing with Laysan albatross\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nwho travel an entire ocean\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\non a trip sometimes,\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nup to the same zone the tunas use.\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nYou can see why they might be caught.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nThen there's George Schillinger and our leatherback team out of Playa Grande\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.958\ntagging leatherbacks\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nthat go right past where we are.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nAnd Scott Benson's team\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nthat showed that leatherbacks go from Indonesia\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nall the way to Monterey.\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nSo what we can see on this moving ocean\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nis we can finally see where the predators are.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nWe can actually see how they're using ecospaces\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nas large as an ocean.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nAnd from this information,\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nwe can begin to map the hope spots.\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nSo this is just three years of data right here --\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nand there's a decade of this data.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nWe see the pulse and the seasonal activities\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nthat these animals are going on.\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nSo what we're able to do with this information\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nis boil it down to hot spots,\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:33.958\n4,000 deployments,\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:36.958\na huge herculean task,\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:38.958\n2,000 tags\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nin an area, shown here for the first time,\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:42.958\noff the California coast,\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nthat appears to be a gathering place.\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nAnd then for sort of an encore from these animals,\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nthey're helping us.\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nThey're carrying instruments\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nthat are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters.\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nThey're taking information from our planet\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nat very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles.\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nThose are seals from many countries\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nbeing released\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nwho are sampling underneath the ice sheets\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nand giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:12.958\non both poles.\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:15.958\nThis data, when visualized, is captivating to watch.\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nWe still haven't figured out best how to visualize the data.\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nAnd then, as these animals swim\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nand give us the information\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nthat's important to climate issues,\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nwe also think it's critical\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nto get this information to the public,\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:31.958\nto engage the public with this kind of data.\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nWe did this with the Great Turtle Race --\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:36.958\ntagged turtles, brought in four million hits.\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nAnd now with Google's Oceans,\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nwe can actually put a white shark in that ocean.\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nAnd when we do and it swims,\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nwe see this magnificent bathymetry\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nthat the shark knows is there on its path\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nas it goes from California to Hawaii.\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nBut maybe Mission Blue\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:54.958\ncan fill in that ocean that we can't see.\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nWe've got the capacity, NASA has the ocean.\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:18:59.958\nWe just need to put it together.\n\n00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nSo in conclusion,\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:04.958\nwe know where Yellowstone is for North America;\n\n00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nit's off our coast.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nWe have the technology that's shown us where it is.\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nWhat we need to think about perhaps for Mission Blue\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nis increasing the biologging capacity.\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:16.958\nHow is it that we can actually\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:19.958\ntake this type of activity elsewhere?\n\n00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:22.958\nAnd then finally -- to basically get the message home --\n\n00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nmaybe use live links\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nfrom animals such as blue whales and white sharks.\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nMake killer apps, if you will.\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:30.958\nA lot of people are excited\n\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:33.958\nwhen sharks actually went under the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\n00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:36.958\nLet's connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone.\n\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:39.958\nThat way we do away with a few internet

We're winning the war against child mortality", "duration": "934", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_good_news_of_the_decade", "transcript": "We are here today because [the] United Nations have defined goals for the progress of countries. They're called Millennium Development Goals. And the reason I really like these goals is that there are eight of them. And by specifying eight different goals, the United Nations has said that there are so many things needed to change in a country in order to get the good life for people. Look here \u2014 you have to end poverty, education, gender, child and maternal health, control infections, protect the environment and get the good global links between nations in every aspect from aid to trade.There's a second reason I like these development goals, and that is because each and every one is measured. Take child mortality; the aim here is to reduce child mortality by two-thirds, from 1990 to 2015. That's a four percent reduction per year \u2014 and this, with measuring. That's what makes the difference between political talking like this and really going for the important thing, a better life for people. And what I'm so happy about with this is that we have already documented that there are many countries in Asia, in the Middle East, in Latin America and East Europe that [are] reducing with this rate. And even mighty Brazil is going down with five percent per year, and Turkey with seven percent per year. So there's good news. But then I hear people saying, \"There is no progress in Africa. And there's not even statistics on Africa to know what is happening.\" I'll prove them wrong on both points.Come with me to the wonderful world of statistics. I bring you to the webpage, ChildMortality.org, where you can take deaths in children below five years of age for all countries \u2014 it's done by U.N. specialists. And I will take Kenya as an example. Here you see the data. Don't panic \u2014 don't panic now, I'll help you through this. It looks nasty, like in college when you didn't like statistics. But first thing, when you see dots like this, you have to ask yourself: from where do the data come? What is the origin of the data? Is it so that in Kenya, there are doctors and other specialists who write the death certificate at the death of the child and it's sent to the statistical office? No \u2014 low-income countries like Kenya still don't have that level of organization. It exists, but it's not complete because so many deaths occur in the home with the family, and it's not registered. What we rely on is not an incomplete system. We have interviews, we have surveys. And this is highly professional female interviewers who sit down for one hour with a woman and ask her about [her] birth history. How many children did you have? Are they alive? If they died, at what age and what year? And then this is done in a representative sample of thousands of women in the country and put together in what used to be called a demographic health survey report. But these surveys are costly, so they can only be done [in] three- to five-year intervals. But they have good quality. So this is a limitation. And all these colored lines here are results; each color is one survey. But that's too complicated for today, so I'll simplify it for you, and I give you one average point for each survey.This was 1977, 1988, 1992, '97 and 2002. And when the experts in the U.N. have got these surveys in place in their database, then they use advanced mathematical formulas to produce a trend line, and the trend line looks like this. See here \u2014 it's the best fit they can get of this point. But watch out \u2014 they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing. And they estimated that in 2008, Kenya had per child mortality of 128. And I was sad, because we could see this reversal in Kenya with an increased child mortality in the 90s. It was so tragic. But in June, I got a mail in my inbox from Demographic Health Surveys, and it showed good news from Kenya. I was so happy. This was the estimate of the new survey. Then it just took another three months for [the] U.N. to get it into their server, and on Friday we got the new trend line \u2014 it was down here. Isn't it nice \u2014 isn't it nice, yeah? I was actually, on Friday, sitting in front of my computer, and I saw the death rate fall from 128 to 84 just that morning. So we celebrated.But now, when you have this trend line, how do we measure progress? I'm going into some details here, because [the] U.N. do it like this. They start [in] 1990 \u2014 they measure to 2009. They say, \"0.9 percent, no progress.\" That's unfair. As a professor, I think I have the right to propose something differently. I would say, at least do this \u2014 10 years is enough to follow the trend. It's two surveys, and you can see what's happening now. They have 2.4 percent. Had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya, I may have joined these two points. So what I'm telling you is that we know the child mortality. We have a decent trend. It's coming into some tricky things then when we are measuring MDGs. And the reason here for Africa is especially important, because '90s was a bad decade, not only in Kenya, but across Africa. The HIV epidemic peaked. There was resistance for the old malaria drugs, until we got the new drugs. We got, later, the mosquito netting. And there was socio-economic problems, which are now being solved at a much better scale. So look at the average here \u2014 this is the average for all of sub-Saharan Africa. And [the] U.N. says it's a reduction with 1.8 percent.Now this sounds a little theoretical, but it's not so theoretical. You know, these economists, they love money, they want more and more of it, they want it to grow. So they calculate the percent annual growth rate of [the] economy. We in public health, we hate child death, so we want less and less and less of child deaths. So we calculate the percent reduction per year, but it's sort of the same percentage. If your economy grows with four percent, you ought to reduce child mortality four percent; if it's used well and people are really involved and can get the use of the resources in the way they want it. So is this fair now to measure this over 19 years? An economist would never do that. I have just divided it into two periods. In the 90s, only 1.2 percent, only 1.2 percent. Whereas now, second gear \u2014 it's like Africa had first gear, now they go into second gear. But even this is not a fair representation of Africa, because it's an average, it's an average speed of reduction in Africa.And look here when I take you into my bubble graphs. Still here, child death per 1,000 on that axis. Here we have [the] year. And I'm now giving you a wider picture than the MDG. I start 50 years ago when Africa celebrated independence in most countries. I give you Congo, which was high, Ghana \u2014 lower. And Kenya \u2014 even lower. And what has happened over the years since then? Here we go. You can see, with independence, literacy improved and vaccinations started, smallpox was eradicated, hygiene was improved, and things got better. But then, in the '80s, watch out here. Congo got into civil war, and they leveled off here. Ghana got very ahead, fast. This was the backlash in Kenya, and Ghana bypassed, but then Kenya and Ghana go down together \u2014 still a standstill in Congo. That's where we are today. You can see it doesn't make sense to make an average of this zero improvement and this very fast improvement. Time has come to stop thinking about sub-Saharan Africa as one place. Their countries are so different, and they merit to be recognized in the same way, as we don't talk about Europe as one place. I can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different \u2014 everyone knows that. And they are judged, each country, on how they are doing.So let me show the wider picture. My country, Sweden: 1800, we were up there. What a strange personality disorder we must have, counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate. It's very strange. It's sort of embarrassing. But we had that habit in Sweden, you know, that we counted all the child deaths, even if we didn't do anything about it. And then, you see, these were famine years. These were bad years, and people got fed up with Sweden. My ancestors moved to the United States. And eventually, soon they started to get better and better here. And here we got better education, and we got health service, and child mortality came down. We never had a war; Sweden was in peace all this time. But look, the rate of lowering in Sweden was not fast. Sweden achieved a low child mortality because we started early. We had primary school actually started in 1842. And then you get that wonderful effect when we got female literacy one generation later. You have to realize that the investments we do in progress are long-term investments. It's not about just five years \u2014 it's long-term investments. And Sweden never reached [the] Millennium Development Goal rate, 3.1 percent when I calculated. So we are off track \u2014 that's what Sweden is. But you don't talk about it so much. We want others to be better than we were, and indeed, others have been better.Let me show you Thailand, see what a success story, Thailand from the 1960s \u2014 how they went down here and reached almost the same child mortality levels as Sweden. And I'll give you another story \u2014 Egypt, the most hidden, glorious success in public health. Egypt was up here in 1960, higher than Congo. The Nile Delta was a misery for children with diarrheal disease and malaria and a lot of problems. And then they got the Aswan Dam. They got electricity in their homes, they increased education and they got primary health care. And down they went, you know. And they got safer water, they eradicated malaria. And isn't it a success story. Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality is fully possible. And the good thing is that Ghana today is going with the same rate as Egypt did at its fastest. Kenya is now speeding up. Here we have a problem. We have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill.Now, let me now bring you to a wider picture, a wider picture of child mortality. I'm going to show you the relationship between child mortality on this axis here \u2014 this axis here is child mortality \u2014 and here I have the family size. The relationship between child mortality and family size. One, two, three, four children per woman: six, seven, eight children per woman. This is, once again, 1960 \u2014 50 years ago. Each bubble is a country \u2014 the color, you can see, a continent. The dark blue here is sub-Saharan Africa. And the size of the bubble is the population. And these are the so-called \"developing\" countries. They had high, or very high, child mortality and family size, six to eight. And the ones over there, they were so-called Western countries. They had low child mortality and small families. What has happened? What I want you [to do] now is to see with your own eyes the relation between fall in child mortality and decrease in family size. I just want not to have any room for doubt \u2014 you have to see that for yourself. This is what happened. Now I start the world. Here we come down with the eradication of smallpox, better education, health service. It got down there \u2014 China comes into the Western box here. And here Brazil is in the Western Box. India is approaching. The first African countries coming into the Western box, and we get a lot a new neighbors. Welcome to a decent life. Come on. We want everyone down there. This is the vision we have, isn't it. And look now, the first African countries here are coming in. There we are today.There is no such thing as a \"Western world\" and \"developing world.\" This is the report from [the] U.N., which came out on Friday. It's very good \u2014 \"Levels and Trends in Child Mortality\" \u2014 except this page. This page is very bad; it's a categorization of countries. It labels \"developing countries,\" \u2014 I can read from the list here \u2014 developing countries: Republic of Korea \u2014 South Korea. Huh? They get Samsung, how can they be [a] developing country? They have here Singapore. They have the lowest child mortality in the world, Singapore. They bypassed Sweden five years ago, and they are labeled a developing country. They have here Qatar. It's the richest country in the world with Al Jazeera. How the heck could they be [a] developing country? This is crap. (Applause) The rest here is good \u2014 the rest is good.We have to have a modern concept, which fits to the data. And we have to realize that we are all going to into this, down to here. What is the importance now with the relations here. Look \u2014 even if we look in Africa \u2014 these are the African countries. You can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality and decreasing family size, even within Africa. It's very clear that this is what happens. And a very important piece of research came out on Friday from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle showing that almost 50 percent of the fall in child mortality can be attributed to female education. That is, when we get girls in school, we'll get an impact 15 to 20 years later, which is a secular trend which is very strong. That's why we must have that long-term perspective, but we must measure the impact over 10-year periods. It's fully possible to get child mortality down in all of these countries and to get them down in the corner where we all would like to live together.And of course, lowering child mortality is a matter of utmost importance from humanitarian aspects. It's a decent life for children, we are talking about. But it is also a strategic investment in the future of all mankind, because it's about the environment. We will not be able to manage the environment and avoid the terrible climate crisis if we don't stabilize the world population. Let's be clear about that. And the way to do that, that is to get child mortality down, get access to family planning and behind that drive female education. And that is fully possible. Let's do it.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 974, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nWe are here today\n\n00:00:13.958 -->

sad,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nbecause we could see\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nthis reversal in Kenya\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nwith an increased child mortality in the 90s.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nIt was so tragic.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nBut in June, I got a mail in my inbox\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nfrom Demographic Health Surveys,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nand it showed good news from Kenya.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nI was so happy.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nThis was the estimate of the new survey.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nThen it just took another three months\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nfor [the] U.N. to get it into their server,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nand on Friday we got the new trend line --\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nit was down here.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nIsn't it nice -- isn't it nice, yeah?\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nI was actually, on Friday, sitting in front of my computer,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nand I saw the death rate fall\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nfrom 128 to 84 just that morning.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nSo we celebrated.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nBut now, when you have this trend line,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nhow do we measure progress?\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nI'm going into some details here,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nbecause [the] U.N. do it like this.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nThey start [in] 1990 -- they measure to 2009.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nThey say, \"0.9 percent, no progress.\"\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nThat's unfair.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nAs a professor, I think I have the right to propose something differently.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nI would say, at least do this --\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\n10 years is enough to follow the trend.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nIt's two surveys, and you can see what's happening now.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nThey have 2.4 percent.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nHad I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nI may have joined these two points.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nSo what I'm telling you\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nis that we know the child mortality.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nWe have a decent trend.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nIt's coming into some tricky things then\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nwhen we are measuring MDGs.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAnd the reason here for Africa is especially important,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nbecause '90s was a bad decade,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nnot only in Kenya, but across Africa.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nThe HIV epidemic peaked.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nThere was resistance for the old malaria drugs, until we got the new drugs.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nWe got, later, the mosquito netting.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nAnd there was socio-economic problems,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nwhich are now being solved at a much better scale.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nSo look at the average here --\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nthis is the average for all of sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nAnd [the] U.N. says\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nit's a reduction with 1.8 percent.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nNow this sounds a little theoretical,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nbut it's not so theoretical.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nYou know, these economists,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nthey love money, they want more and more of it, they want it to grow.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nSo they calculate the percent annual growth rate of [the] economy.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nWe in public health, we hate child death,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nso we want less and less and less of child deaths.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nSo we calculate the percent reduction per year,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nbut it's sort of the same percentage.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nIf your economy grows with four percent,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nyou ought to reduce child mortality four percent;\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nif it's used well and people are really involved\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nand can get the use of the resources in the way they want it.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nSo is this fair now to measure this over 19 years?\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nAn economist would never do that.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nI have just divided it into two periods.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nIn the 90s, only 1.2 percent,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nonly 1.2 percent.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nWhereas now, second gear --\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nit's like Africa had first gear,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nnow they go into second gear.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nBut even this\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nis not a fair representation of Africa,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nbecause it's an average,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nit's an average speed of reduction in Africa.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nAnd look here when I take you into my bubble graphs.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nStill here,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nchild death per 1,000 on that axis.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nHere we have [the] year.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nAnd I'm now giving you a wider picture than the MDG.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nI start 50 years ago\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nwhen Africa celebrated independence in most countries.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nI give you Congo, which was high,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nGhana -- lower. And Kenya -- even lower.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nAnd what has happened over the years since then? Here we go.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nYou can see, with independence, literacy improved\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nand vaccinations started, smallpox was eradicated,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nhygiene was improved, and things got better.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nBut then, in the '80s, watch out here.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nCongo got into civil war,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nand they leveled off here.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nGhana got very ahead, fast.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nThis was the backlash in Kenya, and Ghana bypassed,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nbut then Kenya and Ghana go down together --\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nstill a standstill in Congo.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nThat's where we are today.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nYou can see it doesn't make sense\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nto make an average of this zero improvement\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nand this very fast improvement.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nTime has come\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nto stop thinking about sub-Saharan Africa as one place.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nTheir countries are so different,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nand they merit to be recognized in the same way,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nas we don't talk about Europe as one place.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nI can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different --\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\neveryone knows that.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nAnd they are judged, each country, on how they are doing.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nSo let me show the wider picture.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nMy country, Sweden:\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\n1800, we were up there.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nWhat a strange personality disorder we must have,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\ncounting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nIt's very strange.

I found this observation test about the story of the ark. And the artist that drew this observation test did some errors, had some mistakes \u2014 there are more or less 12 mistakes. Some of them are very easy. There is a funnel, an aerial part, a lamp and clockwork key on the ark. Some of them are about the animals, the number. But there is a much more fundamental mistake in the overall story of the ark that's not reported here. And this problem is: where are the plants? So now we have God that is going to submerge Earth permanently or at least for a very long period, and no one is taking care of plants. Noah needed to take two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal, of every kind of creature that moves, but no mention about plants. Why? In another part of the same story, all the living creatures are just the living creatures that came out from the ark, so birds, livestock and wild animals. Plants are not living creatures \u2014 this is the point. That is a point that is not coming out from the Bible, but it's something that really accompanied humanity.Let's have a look at this nice code that is coming from a Renaissance book. Here we have the description of the order of nature. It's a nice description because it's starting from left \u2014 you have the stones \u2014 immediately after the stones, the plants that are just able to live. We have the animals that are able to live and to sense, and on the top of the pyramid, there is the man. This is not the common man. The \"Homo studiosus\" \u2014 the studying man. This is quite comforting for people like me \u2014 I'm a professor \u2014 this to be over there on the top of creation. But it's something completely wrong. You know very well about professors. But it's also wrong about plants, because plants are not just able to live; they are able to sense. They are much more sophisticated in sensing than animals. Just to give you an example, every single root apex is able to detect and to monitor concurrently and continuously at least 15 different chemical and physical parameters. And they also are able to show and to exhibit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence. Well, but this is something \u2014 this underestimation of plants is something that is always with us.Let's have a look at this short movie now. We have David Attenborough. Now David Attenborough is really a plant lover; he did some of the most beautiful movies about plant behavior. Now, when he speaks about plants, everything is correct. When he speaks about animals, [he] tends to remove the fact that plants exist. The blue whale, the biggest creature that exists on the planet \u2014 that is wrong, completely wrong. The blue whale, it's a dwarf if compared with the real biggest creature that exists on the planet \u2014 that is, this wonderful, magnificent Sequoiadendron giganteum. (Applause) And this is a living organism that has a mass of at least 2,000 tons. Now, the story that plants are some low-level organisms has been formalized many times ago by Aristotle, that in \"De Anima\" \u2014 that is a very influential book for the Western civilization \u2014 wrote that the plants are on the edge between living and not living. They have just a kind of very low-level soul. It's called the vegetative soul, because they lack movement, and so they don't need to sense. Let's see.Okay, some of the movements of the plants are very well-known. This is a very fast movement. This is a Dionaea, a Venus fly trap hunting snails \u2014 sorry for the snail. This has been something that has been refused for centuries, despite the evidence. No one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal, because it was against the order of nature. But plants are also able to show a lot of movement. Some of them are very well known, like the flowering. It's just a question to use some techniques like the time lapse. Some of them are much more sophisticated. Look at this young bean that is moving to catch the light every time. And it's really so graceful; it's like a dancing angel. They are also able to play \u2014 they are really playing. These are young sunflowers, and what they are doing cannot be described with any other terms than playing. They are training themselves, as many young animals do, to the adult life where they will be called to track the sun all the day. They are able to respond to gravity, of course, so the shoots are growing against the vector of gravity and the roots toward the vector of gravity. But they are also able to sleep. This is one, Mimosa pudica. So during the night, they curl the leaves and reduce the movement, and during the day, you have the opening of the leaves \u2014 there is much more movement. This is interesting because this sleeping machinery, it's perfectly conserved. It's the same in plants, in insects and in animals. And so if you need to study this sleeping problem, it's easy to study on plants, for example, than in animals and it's much more easy even ethically. It's a kind of vegetarian experimentation.Plants are even able to communicate \u2014 they are extraordinary communicators. They communicate with other plants. They are able to distinguish kin and non-kin. They communicate with plants of other species and they communicate with animals by producing chemical volatiles, for example, during the pollination. Now with the pollination, it's a very serious issue for plants, because they move the pollen from one flower to the other, yet they cannot move from one flower to the other. So they need a vector \u2014 and this vector, it's normally an animal. Many insects have been used by plants as vectors for the transport of the pollination, but not just insects; even birds, reptiles, and mammals like bats rats are normally used for the transportation of the pollen. This is a serious business. We have the plants that are giving to the animals a kind of sweet substance \u2014 very energizing \u2014 having in change this transportation of the pollen. But some plants are manipulating animals, like in the case of orchids that promise sex and nectar and give in change nothing for the transportation of the pollen.Now, there is a big problem behind all this behavior that we have seen. How is it possible to do this without a brain? We need to wait until 1880, when this big man, Charles Darwin, publishes a wonderful, astonishing book that starts a revolution. The title is \"The Power of Movement in Plants.\" No one was allowed to speak about movement in plants before Charles Darwin. In his book, assisted by his son, Francis \u2014 who was the first professor of plant physiology in the world, in Cambridge \u2014 they took into consideration every single movement for 500 pages. And in the last paragraph of the book, it's a kind of stylistic mark, because normally Charles Darwin stored, in the last paragraph of a book, the most important message. He wrote that, \"It's hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radical acts like the brain of one of the lower animals.\" This is not a metaphor. He wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends who was J.D. Hooker, or at that time, president of the Royal Society, so the maximum scientific authority in Britain speaking about the brain in the plants.Now, this is a root apex growing against a slope. So you can recognize this kind of movement, the same movement that worms, snakes and every animal that are moving on the ground without legs is able to display. And it's not an easy movement because, to have this kind of movement, you need to move different regions of the root and to synchronize these different regions without having a brain. So we studied the root apex and we found that there is a specific region that is here, depicted in blue \u2014 that is called the \"transition zone.\" And this region, it's a very small region \u2014 it's less than one millimeter. And in this small region you have the highest consumption of oxygen in the plants and more important, you have these kinds of signals here. The signals that you are seeing here are action potential, are the same signals that the neurons of my brain, of our brain, use to exchange information. Now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature, but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant, like a plant of rye. We have almost 14 million roots. We have 11 and a half million root apex and a total length of 600 or more kilometers and a very high surface area.Now let's imagine that each single root apex is working in network with all the others. Here were have on the left, the Internet and on the right, the root apparatus. They work in the same way. They are a network of small computing machines, working in networks. And why are they so similar? Because they evolved for the same reason: to survive predation. They work in the same way. So you can remove 90 percent of the root apparatus and the plants [continue] to work. You can remove 90 percent of the Internet and it is [continuing] to work. So, a suggestion for the people working with networks: plants are able to give you good suggestions about how to evolve networks.And another possibility is a technological possibility. Let's imagine that we can build robots and robots that are inspired by plants. Until now, the man was inspired just by man or the animals in producing a robot. We have the animaloid \u2014 and the normal robots inspired by animals, insectoid, so on. We have the androids that are inspired by man. But why have we not any plantoid? Well, if you want to fly, it's good that you look at birds \u2014 to be inspired by birds. But if you want to explore soils, or if you want to colonize new territory, to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this. We have another possibility we are working [on] in our lab, [which] is to build hybrids. It's much more easy to build hybrids. Hybrid means it's something that's half living and half machine. It's much more easy to work with plants than with animals. They have computing power, they have electrical signals. The connection with the machine is much more easy, much more even ethically possible. And these are three possibilities that we are working on to build hybrids, driven by algae or by the leaves at the end, by the most, most powerful parts of the plants, by the roots.Well, thank you for your attention. And before I finish, I would like to reassure that no snails were harmed in making this presentation.

at this short movie now.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nWe have David Attenborough.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nNow David Attenborough is really a plant lover;\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nhe did some of the most beautiful movies\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nabout plant behavior.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nNow, when he speaks about plants,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\neverything is correct.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nWhen he speaks about animals,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\n[he] tends to remove the fact\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nthat plants exist.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nThe blue whale,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nthe biggest creature that exists on the planet --\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nthat is wrong, completely wrong.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nThe blue whale, it's a dwarf\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nif compared with the real biggest creature\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nthat exists on the planet --\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nthat is, this wonderful,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nmagnificent Sequoiadendron giganteum.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nAnd this is a living organism\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthat has a mass of at least 2,000 tons.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nNow, the story\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nthat plants are some low-level organisms\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nhas been formalized\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nmany times ago by Aristotle,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nthat in \"De Anima\" --\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nthat is a very influential book for the Western civilization --\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nwrote that the plants are on the edge\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nbetween living and not living.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nThey have just a kind of very low-level soul.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nIt's called the vegetative soul,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nbecause they lack movement,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nand so they don't need to sense.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nLet's see.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nOkay, some of the movements of the plants are very well-known.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nThis is a very fast movement.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nThis is a Dionaea, a Venus fly trap\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nhunting snails --\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nsorry for the snail.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nThis has been something that has been refused for centuries,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\ndespite the evidence.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nNo one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nbecause it was against the order of nature.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nBut plants are also able\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nto show a lot of movement.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nSome of them are very well known, like the flowering.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nIt's just a question to use some techniques\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nlike the time lapse.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nSome of them are much more sophisticated.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nLook at this young bean\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nthat is moving to catch the light every time.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAnd it's really so graceful;\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nit's like a dancing angel.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nThey are also able to play --\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nthey are really playing.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nThese are young sunflowers,\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nand what they are doing\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\ncannot be described\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nwith any other terms than playing.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nThey are training themselves,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nas many young animals do,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nto the adult life\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nwhere they will be called to track the sun\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nall the day.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nThey are able to respond to gravity, of course,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nso the shoots are growing\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nagainst the vector of gravity\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nand the roots toward the vector of gravity.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nBut they are also able to sleep.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nThis is one, Mimosa pudica.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nSo during the night,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nthey curl the leaves\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nand reduce the movement,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nand during the day, you have the opening of the leaves --\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nthere is much more movement.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nThis is interesting\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nbecause this sleeping machinery,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nit's perfectly conserved.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nIt's the same in plants, in insects\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nand in animals.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nAnd so if you need to study this sleeping problem,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nit's easy to study on plants, for example,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nthan in animals\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nand it's much more easy even ethically.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nIt's a kind of vegetarian\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nexperimentation.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nPlants are even able to communicate --\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nthey are extraordinary communicators.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nThey communicate with other plants.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nThey are able to distinguish kin and non-kin.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nThey communicate\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nwith plants of other species\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nand they communicate with animals\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nby producing chemical volatiles,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nfor example, during the pollination.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nNow with the pollination, it's a very serious issue for plants,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nbecause they move the pollen from one flower to the other,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nyet they cannot move from one flower to the other.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nSo they need a vector --\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nand this vector,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nit's normally an animal.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nMany insects\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nhave been used by plants as vectors\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nfor the transport of the pollination,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nbut not just insects; even birds, reptiles,\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nand mammals like bats rats\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nare normally used for the transportation of the pollen.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nThis is a serious business.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nWe have the plants that are giving to the animals\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\na kind of sweet substance --\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nvery energizing --\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nhaving in change this transportation of the pollen.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nBut some plants are manipulating animals,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nlike in the case of orchids\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nthat promise sex and nectar\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nand give in change nothing\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nfor the transportation of the pollen.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nNow, there is a big problem\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nbehind all this behavior that we have seen.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nHow is it possible to do this without a brain?\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nWe need to wait until 1880,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nwhen this big man,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nCharles Darwin,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\npublishes a wonderful, astonishing book\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nthat starts a revolution.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nThe title is \"The Power of Movement in Plants.\"\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nNo one was allowed to speak about movement in plants\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nbefore Charles Darwin.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nIn his book,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nassisted by his son, Francis --\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nwho was the first professor of plant physiology in the world, in Cambridge --\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nthey took into consideration every single movement\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nfor 500 pages.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nAnd in the last paragraph of the book,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nit's a kind of stylistic mark,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nbecause normally Charles Darwin stored,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nin the last paragraph of a book,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nthe most important message.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nHe wrote that,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\n\"It's hardly an exaggeration\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nto say that the tip of the radical\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nacts like the brain\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nof one of the lower animals.\"\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nThis is not a metaphor.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nHe wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nwho was J.D. Hooker, or at that time, president of the Royal Society,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nso the maximum scientific authority in Britain\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nspeaking about the brain in the plants.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nNow, this is a root apex\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\ngrowing against a slope.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nSo you can recognize this kind of movement,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nthe same movement that worms, snakes\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nand every animal\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nthat are moving on the ground without legs\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nis able to display.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nAnd it's not an easy movement\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nbecause, to have this kind of movement,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nyou need to move different regions of the root\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nand to synchronize these different regions\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nwithout having a brain.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nSo we studied the root apex\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nand we found that there is a specific region\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nthat is here, depicted in blue --\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nthat is called the \"transition zone.\"\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nAnd this region, it's a very small region --\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nit's less than one millimeter.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nAnd in this small region\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nyou have the highest consumption\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nof oxygen in the plants\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nand more important,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nyou have these kinds of signals here.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nThe signals that you are seeing here are action potential,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nare the same signals\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nthat the neurons of my brain, of our brain,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nuse to exchange information.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nNow we know that a root apex\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nhas just a few hundred cells\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nthat show this kind of feature,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nbut we know how big\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nthe root apparatus of a small plant, like a plant of rye.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nWe have almost\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\n14 million roots.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nWe have 11 and a half million\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nroot apex\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nand a total length of 600 or more kilometers\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nand a very high surface area.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nNow let's imagine\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nthat each single root apex\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nis working in network with all the others.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nHere were have on the left, the Internet\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nand on the right, the root apparatus.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nThey work in the same way.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nThey are a network\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nof small computing machines,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nworking in networks.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nAnd why are they so similar?\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nBecause they evolved\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nfor the same reason:\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nto survive predation.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nThey work in the same way.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nSo you can remove 90 percent of the root apparatus\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nand the plants [continue] to work.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nYou can remove 90 percent of the Internet\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nand it is [continuing] to work.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nSo, a suggestion\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nfor the people working with networks:\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nplants are able\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nto give you good suggestions\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nabout how to evolve networks.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nAnd another possibility\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nis a technological possibility.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nLet's imagine\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nthat we can build robots\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nand robots that are inspired by plants.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nUntil now,\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nthe man was inspired\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\njust by man or the animals\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nin producing a robot.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nWe have the animaloid --\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nand the normal robots inspired by animals,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\ninsectoid, so on.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nWe have the androids\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nthat are inspired by man.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nBut why have we not any plantoid?\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nWell, if you want to fly,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nit's good that you look at birds --\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nto be inspired by birds.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nBut if you want to explore soils,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nor if you want to colonize\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nnew territory,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nto best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nthat are masters in doing this.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nWe have another possibility\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nwe are working [on] in our lab,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\n[which] is to build hybrids.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nIt's much more easy to build hybrids.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nHybrid means it's something\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nthat's half living and half machine.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nIt's much more easy to work with plants\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nthan with animals.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nThey have computing power,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nthey have electrical signals.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nThe connection with the machine is much more easy,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nmuch more even ethically possible.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nAnd these are three possibilities\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nthat we are working on\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nto build

"transcript": "One of my favorite parts of my job at the Gates Foundation is that I get to travel to the developing world, and I do that quite regularly. And when I meet the mothers in so many of these remote places, I'm really struck by the things that we have in common. They want what we want for our children and that is for their children to grow up successful, to be healthy, and to have a successful life. But I also see lots of poverty, and it's quite jarring, both in the scale and the scope of it. My first trip in India, I was in a person's home where they had dirt floors, no running water, no electricity, and that's really what I see all over the world. So in short, I'm startled by all the things that they don't have. But I am surprised by one thing that they do have: Coca-Cola.Coke is everywhere. In fact, when I travel to the developing world, Coke feels ubiquitous. And so when I come back from these trips, and I'm thinking about development, and I'm flying home and I'm thinking, \"We're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations,\" you know, Coke's success kind of stops and makes you wonder: how is it that they can get Coke to these far-flung places? If they can do that, why can't governments and NGOs do the same thing? And I'm not the first person to ask this question. But I think, as a community, we still have a lot to learn. It's staggering, if you think about Coca-Cola. They sell 1.5 billion servings every single day. That's like every man, woman and child on the planet having a serving of Coke every week. So why does this matter? Well, if we're going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of Millennium Development Goals that we're set as a world, we need to learn from the innovators, and those innovators come from every single sector. I feel that, if we can understand what makes something like Coca-Cola ubiquitous, we can apply those lessons then for the public good.Coke's success is relevant, because if we can analyze it, learn from it, then we can save lives. So that's why I took a bit of time to study Coke. And I think there are really three things we can take away from Coca-Cola. They take real-time data and immediately feed it back into the product. They tap into local entrepreneurial talent, and they do incredible marketing. So let's start with the data. Now Coke has a very clear bottom line \u2014 they report to a set of shareholders, they have to turn a profit. So they take the data, and they use it to measure progress. They have this very continuous feedback loop. They learn something, they put it back into the product, they put it back into the market. They have a whole team called \"Knowledge and Insight.\" It's a lot like other consumer companies. So if you're running Namibia for Coca-Cola, and you have a 107 constituencies, you know where every can versus bottle of Sprite, Fanta or Coke was sold, whether it was a corner store, a supermarket or a pushcart. So if sales start to drop, then the person can identify the problem and address the issue.Let's contrast that for a minute to development. In development, the evaluation comes at the very end of the project. I've sat in a lot of those meetings, and by then, it is way too late to use the data. I had somebody from an NGO once describe it to me as bowling in the dark. They said, \"You roll the ball, you hear some pins go down. It's dark, you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on, and then you an see your impact.\" Real-time data turns on the lights.So what's the second thing that Coke's good at? They're good at tapping into that local entrepreneurial talent. Coke's been in Africa since 1928, but most of the time they couldn't reach the distant markets, because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world, which was a large truck rolling down the street. And in Africa, the remote places, it's hard to find a good road. But Coke noticed something \u2014 they noticed that local people were taking the product, buying it in bulk and then reselling it in these hard-to-reach places. And so they took a bit of time to learn about that. And they decided in 1990 that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs, giving them small loans. They set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers, and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people, who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product. There are now some 3,000 of these centers employing about 15,000 people in Africa. In Tanzania and Uganda, they represent 90 percent of Coke's sales. Let's look at the development side.What is it that governments and NGOs can learn from Coke? Governments and NGOs need to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well, because the locals know how to reach the very hard-to-serve places, their neighbors, and they know what motivates them to make change. I think a great example of this is Ethiopia's new health extension program. The government noticed in Ethiopia that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic, they were over a day's travel away from a health clinic. So if you're in an emergency situation \u2014 or if you're a mom about to deliver a baby \u2014 forget it, to get to the health care center. They decided that wasn't good enough, so they went to India and studied the Indian state of Kerala that also had a system like this, and they adapted it for Ethiopia. And in 2003, the government of Ethiopia started this new system in their own country. They trained 35,000 health extension workers to deliver care directly to the people. In just five years, their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people to one worker for every 2,500 people.Now, think about how this can change people's lives. Health extension workers can help with so many things, whether it's family planning, prenatal care, immunizations for the children, or advising the woman to get to the facility on time for an on-time delivery. That is having real impact in a country like Ethiopia, and it's why you see their child mortality numbers coming down 25 percent from 2000 to 2008. In Ethiopia, there are hundreds of thousands of children living because of this health extension worker program. So what's the next step for Ethiopia? Well, they're already starting talk about this. They're starting to talk about, \"How do you have the health community workers generate their own ideas? How do you incent them based on the impact that they're getting out in those remote villages?\" That's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent and you unlock people's potential.The third component of Coke's success is marketing. Ultimately, Coke's success depends on one crucial fact and that is that people want a Coca-Cola. Now the reason these micro-entrepreneurs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow. So, they rely on Coca-Cola in terms of its marketing, and what's the secret to their marketing? Well, it's aspirational. It is associated that product with a kind of life that people want to live. So even though it's a global company, they take a very local approach. Coke's global campaign slogan is \"Open Happiness.\" But they localize it. And they don't just guess what makes people happy; they go to places like Latin America and they realize that happiness there is associated with family life. And in South Africa, they associate happiness with seriti or community respect. Now, that played itself out in the World Cup campaign. Let's listen to this song that Coke created for it, \"Wavin' Flag\" by a Somali hip hop artist.(Video) K'Naan: \u266b Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh \u266b \u266b Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh \u266b \u266b Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh \u266b \u266b Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-oh \u266b \u266bGive you freedom, give you fire\u266b \u266b Give you reason, take you higher \u266b \u266b See the champions take the field now \u266b \u266b You define us, make us feel proud \u266b \u266b In the streets our heads are lifted \u266b \u266b As we lose our inhibition \u266b \u266b Celebration, it's around us \u266b \u266b Every nation, all around us \u266bMelinda French Gates: It feels pretty good, right? Well, they didn't stop there \u2014 they localized it into 18 different languages. And it went number one on the pop chart in 17 countries. It reminds me of a song that I remember from my childhood, \"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing,\" that also went number one on the pop charts. Both songs have something in common: that same appeal of celebration and unity. So how does health and development market? Well, it's based on avoidance, not aspirations. I'm sure you've heard some of these messages. \"Use a condom, don't get AIDS.\" \"Wash you hands, you might not get diarrhea.\" It doesn't sound anything like \"Wavin' Flag\" to me.And I think we make a fundamental mistake \u2014 we make an assumption, that we think that, if people need something, we don't have to make them want that. And I think that's a mistake. And there's some indications around the world that this is starting to change. One example is sanitation. We know that a million and a half children die a year from diarrhea and a lot of it is because of open defecation. But there's a solution: you build a toilet. But what we're finding around the world, over and over again, is, if you build a toilet and you leave it there, it doesn't get used. People reuse it for a slab for their home. They sometimes store grain in it. I've even seen it used for a chicken coop. (Laughter) But what does marketing really entail that would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea? Well, you work with the community. You start to talk to them about why open defecation is something that shouldn't be done in the village, and they agree to that. But then you take the toilet and you position it as a modern, trendy convenience. One state in Northern India has gone so far as to link toilets to courtship. And it works \u2014 look at these headlines. (Laughter) I'm not kidding. Women are refusing to marry men without toilets. No loo, no \"I do.\"(Laughter)Now, it's not just a funny headline \u2014 it's innovative. It's an innovative marketing campaign. But more importantly, it saves lives. Take a look at this \u2014 this is a room full of young men and my husband, Bill. And can you guess what the young men are waiting for? They're waiting to be circumcised. Can you you believe that? We know that circumcision reduces HIV infection by 60 percent in men. And when we first heard this result inside the Foundation, I have to admit, Bill and I were scratching our heads a little bit and we were saying, \"But who's going to volunteer for this procedure?\" But it turns out the men do, because they're hearing from their girlfriends that they prefer it, and the men also believe it improves their sex life. So if we can start to understand what people really want in health and development, we can change communities and we can change whole nations.Well, why is all of this so important? So let's talk about what happens when this all comes together, when you tie the three things together. And polio, I think, is one of the most powerful examples. We've seen a 99 percent reduction in polio in 20 years. So if you look back to 1988, there are about 350,000 cases of polio on the planet that year. In 2009, we're down to 1,600 cases. Well how did that happen? Let's look at a country like India. They have over a billion people in this country, but they have 35,000 local doctors who report paralysis, and clinicians, a huge reporting system in chemists. They have two and a half million vaccinators. But let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you. Let me tell you the story of Shriram, an 18 month boy in Bihar, a northern state in India. This year on August 8th, he felt paralysis and on the 13th, his parents took him to the doctor. On August 14th and 15th, they took a stool sample, and by the 25th of August, it was confirmed he had Type 1 polio. By August 30th, a genetic test was done, and we knew what strain of polio Shriram had.Now it could have come from one of two places. It could have come from Nepal, just to the north, across the border, or from Jharkhand, a state just to the south. Luckily, the genetic testing proved that, in fact, this strand came north, because, had it come from the south, it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission. So many more people would have been affected. So what's the endgame? Well on September 4th, there was a huge mop-up campaign, which is what you do in polio. They went out and where Shriram lives, they vaccinated two million people. So in less than a month, we went from one case of paralysis to a targeted vaccination program. And I'm happy to say only one other person in that area got polio. That's how you keep a huge outbreak from spreading, and it shows what can happen when local people have the data in their hands; they can save lives.Now one of the challenges in polio, still, is marketing, but it might not be what you think. It's not the marketing on the ground. It's not telling the parents, \"If you see paralysis, take your child to the doctor or get your child vaccinated.\" We have a problem with marketing in the donor community. The G8 nations have been incredibly generous on polio over the last 20 years, but we're starting to have something called polio fatigue and that is that the donor nations aren't willing to fund polio any longer. So by next summer, we're sighted to run out of money on polio. So we are 99 percent of the way there on this goal and we're about to run short of money. And I think that if the marketing were more aspirational, if we could focus as a community on how far we've come and how amazing it would be to eradicate this disease, we could put polio fatigue and polio behind us. And if we could do that, we could stop vaccinating everybody, worldwide, in all of our countries for polio. And it would only be the second disease ever wiped off the face of the planet. And we are so close. And this victory is so possible.So if Coke's marketers came to me and asked me to define happiness, I'd say my vision of happiness is a mother holding healthy baby in her arms. To me, that is deep happiness. And so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector, then in the future we make together, that happiness can be just as ubiquitous as Coca-Cola.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 977,

apply those lessons then for the public good.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nCoke's success is relevant,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nbecause if we can analyze it, learn from it,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nthen we can save lives.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nSo that's why I took a bit of time to study Coke.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nAnd I think there are really three things\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nwe can take away from Coca-Cola.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nThey take real-time data\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nand immediately feed it back into the product.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nThey tap into local entrepreneurial talent,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nand they do incredible marketing.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nSo let's start with the data.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nNow Coke has a very clear bottom line --\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nthey report to a set of shareholders, they have to turn a profit.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nSo they take the data,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nand they use it to measure progress.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nThey have this very continuous feedback loop.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nThey learn something, they put it back into the product,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nthey put it back into the market.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nThey have a whole team called \"Knowledge and Insight.\"\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nIt's a lot like other consumer companies.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nSo if you're running Namibia for Coca-Cola,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nand you have a 107 constituencies,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nyou know where every can versus bottle\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nof Sprite, Fanta or Coke was sold,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nwhether it was a corner store,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\na supermarket or a pushcart.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nSo if sales start to drop,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nthen the person can identify the problem\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nand address the issue.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nLet's contrast that for a minute to development.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nIn development, the evaluation comes\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nat the very end of the project.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nI've sat in a lot of those meetings,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nand by then,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nit is way too late to use the data.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nI had somebody from an NGO\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nonce describe it to me as bowling in the dark.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nThey said, \"You roll the ball, you hear some pins go down.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nIt's dark, you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nand then you an see your impact.\"\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nReal-time data\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nturns on the lights.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nSo what's the second thing that Coke's good at?\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nThey're good at tapping into\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nthat local entrepreneurial talent.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nCoke's been in Africa since 1928,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nbut most of the time they couldn't reach the distant markets,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nbecause they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nwhich was a large truck rolling down the street.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nAnd in Africa, the remote places,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nit's hard to find a good road.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nBut Coke noticed something --\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nthey noticed that local people were taking the product, buying it in bulk\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand then reselling it in these hard-to-reach places.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nAnd so they took a bit of time to learn about that.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nAnd they decided in 1990\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nthat they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\ngiving them small loans.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nThey set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nand those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nwho go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nto sell the product.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nThere are now some 3,000 of these centers\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nemploying about 15,000 people in Africa.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nIn Tanzania and Uganda,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nthey represent 90 percent\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nof Coke's sales.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nLet's look at the development side.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nWhat is it that governments and NGOs\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\ncan learn from Coke?\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nGovernments and NGOs\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nneed to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nbecause the locals know how to reach\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nthe very hard-to-serve places, their neighbors,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nand they know what motivates them to make change.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nI think a great example of this\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nis Ethiopia's new health extension program.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nThe government noticed in Ethiopia\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nthat many of the people were so far away from a health clinic,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nthey were over a day's travel away from a health clinic.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nSo if you're in an emergency situation -- or if you're a mom about to deliver a baby --\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nforget it, to get to the health care center.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nThey decided that wasn't good enough,\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nso they went to India and studied the Indian state of Kerala\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nthat also had a system like this,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nand they adapted it for Ethiopia.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nAnd in 2003, the government of Ethiopia\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nstarted this new system in their own country.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nThey trained 35,000 health extension workers\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nto deliver care directly to the people.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nIn just five years,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:13.958\ntheir ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nto one worker for every 2,500 people.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nNow, think about\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nhow this can change people's lives.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nHealth extension workers can help with so many things,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nwhether it's family planning, prenatal care,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nimmunizations for the children,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nor advising the woman to get to the facility on time\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nfor an on-time delivery.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nThat is having real impact\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nin a country like Ethiopia,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nand it's why you see their child mortality numbers\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\ncoming down 25 percent\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nfrom 2000 to 2008.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nIn Ethiopia, there are hundreds of thousands of children living\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nbecause of this health extension worker program.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nSo what's the next step for Ethiopia?\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nWell, they're already starting talk about this.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nThey're starting to talk about, \"How do you have the health community workers\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\ngenerate their own ideas?\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nHow do you incent them based on the impact that they're getting\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nout in those remote villages?\"\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nThat's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nand you unlock people's potential.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nThe third component of Coke's success\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nis marketing.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nUltimately, Coke's success\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\ndepends on one crucial fact\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nand that is that people want\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\na Coca-Cola.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nNow the reason these micro-entrepreneurs\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\ncan sell or make a profit\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nis they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nSo, they rely on Coca-Cola\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nin terms of its marketing,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nand what's the secret to their marketing?\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nWell, it's aspirational.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nIt is associated that product\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nwith a kind of life that people want to live.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nSo even though it's a global company,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nthey take a very local approach.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nCoke's global campaign slogan\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nis \"Open Happiness.\"\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nBut they localize it.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nAnd they don't just guess what makes people happy;\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nthey go to places like Latin America\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nand they realize that happiness there\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nis associated with family life.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nAnd in South Africa,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nthey associate happiness\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nwith seriti or community respect.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nNow, that played itself out in the World Cup campaign.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nLet's listen to this song that Coke created for it,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\n\"Wavin' Flag\" by a Somali hip hop artist.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\n(Video) K'Naan: \u266b Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh \u266b\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:35.958\n\u266b Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh \u266b\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\n\u266b Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh \u266b\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:41.958\n\u266b Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-oh \u266b\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\n\u266bGive you freedom, give you fire\u266b\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\n\u266b Give you reason, take you higher \u266b\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\n\u266b See the champions take the field now \u266b\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:54.958\n\u266b You define us, make us feel proud \u266b\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\n\u266b In the streets our heads are lifted \u266b\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\n\u266b As we lose our inhibition \u266b\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\n\u266b Celebration, it's around us \u266b\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\n\u266b Every nation, all around us \u266b\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nMelinda French Gates: It feels pretty good, right?\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nWell, they didn't stop there --\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nthey localized it into 18 different languages.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nAnd it went number one on the pop chart\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nin 17 countries.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nIt reminds me of a song that I remember from my childhood,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\n\"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing,\"\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nthat also went number one on the pop charts.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nBoth songs have something in common:\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nthat same appeal\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nof celebration and unity.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nSo how does health and development market?\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nWell, it's based on avoidance,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nnot aspirations.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nI'm sure you've heard some of these messages.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\n\"Use a condom, don't get AIDS.\"\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\n\"Wash you hands, you might not get diarrhea.\"\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nIt doesn't sound anything like \"Wavin' Flag\" to me.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nAnd I think we make a fundamental mistake --\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nwe make an assumption,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nthat we think that, if people need something,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nwe don't have to make them want that.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nAnd I think that's a mistake.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nAnd there's some indications around the world that this is starting to change.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nOne example is sanitation.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nWe know that a million and a half children\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\ndie a year from diarrhea\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nand a lot of it is because of open defecation.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nBut there's a solution: you build a toilet.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nBut what we're finding around the world, over and over again,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nis, if you build a toilet and you leave it there,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nit doesn't get used.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nPeople reuse it for a slab for their home.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nThey sometimes store grain in it.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nI've even seen it used for a chicken coop.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nBut what does marketing really entail\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nthat would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea?\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nWell, you work with the community.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nYou start to talk to them about why open defecation\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nis something that shouldn't be done in the village,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nand they agree to that.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nBut then you take the toilet and you position it\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nas a modern, trendy convenience.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nOne state in Northern India has gone so far\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nas to link toilets to courtship.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nAnd it works -- look at these headlines.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:11.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nI'm not kidding.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nWomen are refusing to marry men without toilets.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nNo loo, no \"I do.\"\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nNow, it's not just a funny headline --\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nit's innovative. It's an innovative marketing campaign.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nBut more importantly,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nit saves lives.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nTake a look at this --\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nthis is a room full of young men\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand my husband, Bill.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nAnd can you guess what the young men are waiting for?\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nThey're waiting to be circumcised.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nCan you you believe that?\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nWe know that circumcision reduces HIV infection\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nby 60 percent in men.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nAnd when we first heard this result inside the Foundation,\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nI have to admit, Bill and I were scratching our heads a little bit\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nand we were saying, \"But who's going to volunteer for this procedure?\"\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nBut it turns out the men do,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nbecause they're hearing from their girlfriends\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nthat they prefer it,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand the men also believe it improves their sex life.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nSo if we can start to understand\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nwhat people really want\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nin health and development,\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nwe can change communities\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nand we can change whole nations.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nWell, why is all of this so important?\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nSo let's talk about what happens when this all comes together,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nwhen you tie the three things together.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nAnd polio, I think, is one of the most powerful examples.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nWe've seen a 99 percent reduction in polio in 20 years.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nSo if you look back to 1988,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nthere are about 350,000 cases of polio\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\non the planet that year.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nIn 2009, we're down to 1,600 cases.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nWell how did that happen?\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nLet's look at a country like India.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nThey have over a billion people in this country,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nbut they have 35,000 local doctors\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nwho report paralysis,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nand clinicians, a huge reporting system in chemists.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nThey have two and a half million vaccinators.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nBut let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nLet me tell you the story of Shriram,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nan 18 month boy in Bihar,\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\na northern state in India.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nThis year on August 8th, he felt paralysis\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nand on the 13th, his parents took him to the doctor.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nOn August 14th and 15th, they took a stool sample,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nand by the 25th of August,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nit was confirmed he had Type 1 polio.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nBy August 30th, a genetic test was done,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nand we knew what strain of polio Shriram had.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nNow it could have come from one of two places.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nIt could have come from Nepal, just to the north, across the border,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nor from Jharkhand, a state just to the south.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nLuckily, the genetic testing proved\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nthat, in fact, this strand came north,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nbecause, had it come from the south,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nit would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nSo many more people would have been affected.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nSo what's the endgame?\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nWell on September 4th, there was a huge mop-up campaign,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nwhich is what you do in polio.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nThey went out and where Shriram lives,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nthey vaccinated two million people.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nSo in less than a month,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nwe went from one case of paralysis\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nto a targeted vaccination program.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nAnd I'm happy to say only one other person in that area got polio.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nThat's how you keep\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\na huge outbreak from spreading,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nand it shows what can happen\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nwhen local people have the data in their hands;\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nthey can save lives.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nNow one of the challenges in polio, still, is marketing,\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nbut it might not be what you think.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nIt's not the marketing on the ground.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nIt's not telling the parents,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\n\"If you see paralysis, take your child to the doctor\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nor get your child vaccinated.\"\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nWe have a problem with marketing in the donor community.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nThe G8 nations have been incredibly generous on polio\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nover the last 20 years,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nbut we're starting to have something called polio fatigue\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nand that is that the donor nations\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\naren't willing to fund polio any longer.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nSo by next summer, we're sighted to run out of money on polio.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nSo we are 99 percent\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nof the way there on this goal\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nand we're about to run short of money.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nAnd I think that if the marketing were more aspirational,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nif we could focus as a community\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\non how far we've come\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nand how amazing it would be\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nto eradicate this disease,\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nwe could put polio fatigue\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nand polio behind us.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nAnd if we could do that,\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nwe could stop vaccinating everybody, worldwide,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nin all of our countries for polio.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nAnd it would only be the second disease ever\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nwiped off the face of the planet.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nAnd we are so close.\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nAnd this victory is so possible.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nSo if Coke's marketers came to me\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nand asked me to define happiness,\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nI'd say my vision of happiness\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nis a mother holding healthy baby\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nin her arms.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nTo me, that is deep happiness.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nAnd so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector,\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nthen in the future we make together,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nthat happiness\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\ncan be just as ubiquitous\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nas Coca-Cola.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nThank you.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:18.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Haiti's disaster of engineering", "duration": "510", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_haas_haiti_s_disaster_of_engineering", "transcript": "I learned about the Haiti earthquake by Skype. My wife sent me a message, \"Whoa, earthquake,\" and then disappeared for 25 minutes. It was 25 minutes of absolute terror that thousands of people across the U.S. felt. I was afraid of a tsunami; what I didn't realize was there was a greater terror in Haiti, and that was building collapse. We've all seen the photos of the collapsed buildings in Haiti. These are shots my wife took a couple days after the quake, while I was making my way through the D.R. into the country. This is the national palace \u2014 the equivalent of the White House. This is the largest supermarket in the Caribbean at peak shopping time. This is a nurses' college \u2014 there are 300 nurses studying. The general hospital right next door emerged largely unscathed. This is the Ministry of Economics and Finance.We have all heard about the tremendous human loss in the earthquake in Haiti, but we haven't heard enough about why all those lives were lost. We haven't heard about why the buildings failed. After all, it was the buildings, not the earthquake, that killed 220,000 people, that injured 330,000, that displaced 1.3 million people, that cut off food and water and supplies for an entire nation. This is the largest metropolitan-area disaster in decades, and it was not a natural disaster \u2014 it was a disaster of engineering.AIDG has worked in Haiti since 2007, providing engineering and business support to small businesses. And after the quake, we started bringing in earthquake engineers to figure out why the buildings collapsed, to examine what was safe and what wasn't. Working with MINUSTAH, which is the U.N. mission in Haiti, with the Ministry of Public Works, with different NGOs, we inspected over 1,500 buildings. We inspected schools and private residencies. We inspected medical centers and food warehouses. We inspected government buildings.This is the Ministry of Justice. Behind that door is the National Judicial Archives. The fellow in the door, Andre Filitrault \u2014 who's the director of the Center for Interdisciplinary Earthquake Engineering Research at the University of Buffalo \u2014 was examining it to see if it was safe to recover the archives. Andre told me, after seeing these buildings fail again and again in the same way, that there is no new research here. There is nothing here that we don't know. The failure points were the same: walls and slabs not tied properly into columns \u2014 that's a roof slab hanging off the building \u2014 cantilevered structures, or structures that were asymmetric, that shook violently and came down, poor building materials, not enough concrete, not enough compression in the blocks, rebar that was smooth, rebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away.Now there's a solution to all these problems. And we know how to build properly. The proof of this came in Chile, almost a month later, when 8.8 magnitude earthquake hit Chile. That is 500 times the power of the 7.0 that hit Port-au-Prince \u2014 500 times the power, yet only under a thousand casualties. Adjusted for population density, that is less than one percent of the impact of the Haitian quake. What was the difference between Chile and Haiti? Seismic standards and confined masonry, where the building acts as a whole \u2014 walls and columns and roofs and slabs tied together to support each other \u2014 instead of breaking off into separate members and failing. If you look at this building in Chile, it's ripped in half, but it's not a pile of rubble. Chileans have been building with confined masonry for decades.Right now, AIDG is working with KPFF Consulting Engineers, Architecture for Humanity, to bring more confined masonry training into Haiti. This is Xantus Daniel; he's a mason, just a general construction worker, not a foreman, who took one of our trainings. On his last job he was working with his boss, and they started pouring the columns wrong. He took his boss aside, and he showed him the materials on confined masonry. He showed him, \"You know, we don't have to do this wrong. It won't cost us any more to do it the right way.\" And they redid that building. They tied the rebar right, they poured the columns right, and that building will be safe. And every building that they build going forward will be safe.To make sure these buildings are safe, it's not going to take policy \u2014 it's going to take reaching out to the masons on the ground and helping them learn the proper techniques. Now there are many groups doing this. And the fellow in the vest there, Craig Toten, he has pushed forward to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this. Through Haiti Rewired, through Build Change, Architecture for Humanity, AIDG, there is the possibility to reach out to 30,000 \u2014 40,000 masons across the country and create a movement of proper building. If you reach out to the people on the ground in this collaborative way it's extremely affordable. For the billions spent on reconstruction, you can train masons for dollars on every house that they end up building over their lifetime.Ultimately, there are two ways that you can rebuild Haiti; the way at the top is the way that Haiti's been building for decades. The way at the top is a poorly constructed building that will fail. The way at the bottom is a confined masonry building, where the walls are tied together, the building is symmetric, and it will stand up to an earthquake. For all the disaster, there is an opportunity here to build better houses for the next generation, so that when the next earthquake hits, it is a disaster \u2014 but not a tragedy.(Applause)", "id":

heard\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nabout the tremendous human loss\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nin the earthquake in Haiti,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nbut we haven't heard enough\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nabout why all those lives were lost.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nWe haven't heard about\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nwhy the buildings failed.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nAfter all, it was the buildings,\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nnot the earthquake,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nthat killed 220,000 people,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nthat injured 330,000,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nthat displaced 1.3 million people,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nthat cut off food\n\n00:02:02.958

00:02:15.958\nin decades,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nand it was not a natural disaster --\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nit was a disaster of engineering.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nAIDG has worked in Haiti\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nsince 2007,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nproviding engineering and business support\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nto small businesses.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nAnd after the quake, we started bringing in earthquake engineers\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nto figure out why the buildings collapsed,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nto examine what was safe and what wasn't.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nWorking with MINUSTAH,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nwhich is the U.N.

00:03:25.958\nAndre told me,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nafter seeing these buildings fail\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nagain and again in the same way,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nthat there is no new research here.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nThere is nothing here that we don't know.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nThe failure points were the same:\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nwalls and slabs not tied properly into columns --\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nthat's a roof slab hanging off the building --\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\ncantilevered structures,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nor structures that were asymmetric,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nthat shook violently and came down,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\npoor building materials,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nnot enough concrete,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nnot enough compression in the blocks,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nrebar that was smooth,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nrebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nNow there's a solution\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nto all these problems.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nAnd we know how to build properly.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nThe proof of this came in Chile,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nalmost a month later,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nwhen 8.8 magnitude earthquake\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nhit Chile.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nThat is 500 times\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nthe power of the 7.0\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nthat hit Port-au-Prince --\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\n500 times the

one percent\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nof the impact of the Haitian quake.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nWhat was the difference\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nbetween Chile and Haiti?\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nSeismic standards\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nand confined masonry,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nwhere the building acts as a whole --\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nwalls and columns\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nand roofs and slabs\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\ntied together to support each other --\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:13.958\ninstead of breaking off into separate members and failing.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nIf you look at this building in Chile,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nit's ripped in half,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nbut it's not a pile of rubble.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nChileans have been building with confined masonry\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nfor decades.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nRight now, AIDG is working with KPFF Consulting Engineers,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nArchitecture for Humanity,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nto bring more confined masonry training\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\ninto Haiti.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nThis is Xantus Daniel;\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nhe's a mason,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\njust a general construction worker, not a foreman,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nwho took one of our trainings.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nOn his last job he was working with his boss,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nand they started pouring the columns wrong.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nHe took his boss aside,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nand he showed him the materials on confined masonry.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nHe showed him, \"You know, we don't have to do this wrong.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nIt won't cost us any more\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nto do it the right way.\"\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nAnd they redid that building.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nThey tied the rebar right,\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nthey poured the columns right,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nand that building will be safe.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nAnd every building\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nthat they build going forward\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nwill be safe.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nTo make sure these buildings are safe,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nit's not going to take policy --\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nit's going to take reaching out\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nto the masons on the ground\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nand helping them learn the proper techniques.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nNow there are many groups doing this.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nAnd the fellow in the vest there,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nCraig Toten,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nhe has pushed forward\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nto get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nThrough Haiti Rewired,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nthrough Build Change, Architecture for Humanity,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nAIDG,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nthere is the possibility\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nto reach out\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nto 30,000 -- 40,000 masons\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nacross the country\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nand create a movement of proper building.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nIf you reach out to the people on the ground\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nin this collaborative way\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nit's extremely affordable.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nFor the billions spent on reconstruction,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nyou can train masons\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nfor dollars on every house\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nthat they end up building over their lifetime.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nUltimately, there are two ways\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nthat you can rebuild Haiti;\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nthe way at the top\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nis the way that Haiti's been building for decades.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nThe way at the top\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nis a poorly constructed building\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nthat will fail.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nThe way at the bottom is a confined masonry building,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nwhere the walls are tied together,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nthe building is symmetric,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nand it will stand up to an earthquake.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nFor all the disaster,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nthere is an opportunity here\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nto build better houses\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nfor the next generation,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nso that when the next earthquake hits,\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nit is a disaster --\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nbut not a tragedy.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:19.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The art of the eco-mindshift", "duration": "1190", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/natalie_jeremijenko_the_art_of_the_eco_mindshift", "transcript": "I was informed by this kind of unoriginal and trite idea that new technologies were an opportunity for social transformation, which is what drove me then, and still, it's a delusion that drives me now. I wanted to update what I've been doing since then \u2014 but it's still the same theme song \u2014 and introduce you to my lab and current work, which is the Environmental Health Clinic that I run at NYU. And what it is \u2014 it's a twist on health. Because, really, what I'm trying to do now is redefine what counts as health. It's a clinic like a health clinic at any other university, except people come to the clinic with environmental health concerns, and they walk out with prescriptions for things they can do to improve environmental health, as opposed to coming to a clinic with medical concerns and walking out with prescriptions for pharmaceuticals.It's a handy-dandy quote from Hippocrates of the Hippocratic oath that says, \"The greater part of the soul lays outside the body, treatment of the inner requires treatment of the outer.\" But that suggests the issue that I'm trying to get at here, that we have an opportunity to redefine what is health. Because this idea that health is internal and atomized and individual and pharmaceutical is largely an error. And I would use this study, a recent study by Philip Landrigan, to motivate a different view of health, where he went to most of the pediatricians in Manhattan and the New York area and logged what they spent their patient hours on. 80 to 90 percent of their time was spent on five things. Number one was asthma, number two was developmental delays, number three was 400-fold increases in rare childhood cancers in the last eight to 10, 15 years. Number four and five were childhood obesity and diabetes-related issues. So all of those \u2014 what's common about all of those? The environment is implicated, radically implicated, right. This is not the germs that medicos were trained to deal with; this is a different definition of health, health that has a great advantage because it's external, it's shared, we can do something about it, as opposed to internal, genetically predetermined or individualized.People who come to the clinic are called, not patients, but impatients, because they're too impatient to wait for legislative change to address local and environmental health issues. And I meet them at the University, I also have a few field offices that I set up in various places that provide an immersion in some of the environmental challenges we face. I like this one from the Belgian field office, where we met in a roundabout, precisely because the roundabout iconified the headless social movement that informs much social transformation, as opposed to the top-down control of red light traffic intersections. In this case, of course, the roundabout with that micro-decisions being made in situ by people not being told what to do. But, of course, affords greater throughput, fewer accidents, and an interesting model of social movement.Some of the things that the monitoring protocols have developed: this is the tadpole bureaucrat protocol, or keeping tabs, if you will. What they are is an addition of tadpoles that are named after a local bureaucrat whose decisions affect your water quality. So an impatient concerned for water quality would raise a tadpole bureaucrat in a sample of water in which they're interested. And we give them a couple of things to do that, to help them do companion animal devices while they're blogging and doing their email. This is a tadpole walker to take your tadpole walking in the evening. And the interesting thing that happens \u2014 because we're using tadpoles, of course, because they have the most exquisite biosenses that we have, several orders of magnitude more sensitive than some of our senses for sensing, responding in a biologically meaningful way, to that whole class of industrial contaminants we call endocrine disruptors or hormone emulators.But by taking your tadpole out for a walk in the evening \u2014 there's a few action shots \u2014 your neighbors are likely to say, \"What are you doing?\" And then you have to introduce your tadpole and who it's named after. You have to explain what you're doing and how the developmental events of a tadpole are, of course, very observable and they use the same T3-mediated hormones that we do. And so next time your neighbor sees you they'll say, \"How is that tadpole doing?\" And you can let them social network with your tadpole, because the Environmental Health Clinic has a social networking site for, not only impatients, humans, but non-humans, social networking for humans and non-humans. And of course, these endocrine disruptors are things that are implicated in the breast cancer epidemic, the obesity epidemic, the two and a half year drop in the average age of onset of puberty in young girls and other related things. The culmination of this is if you've successfully raised your tadpole, observing the behavioral and developmental events, you will then go and introduce your tadpole to its namesake and discuss the evidence that you've seen.Another quick protocol \u2014 and I'm going to go through these quickly, but just to give you the material sense of what we're doing here \u2014 instead of asking you for urine samples, I'll ask you for a mouse sample. Anyone here lucky enough to share, to cohabit with a mouse \u2014 a domestic partnership with mice? Very lucky. Mice, of course, are the quintessential model organism. They're even better models of environmental health, because not only the same mammalian biology, but they share your diet, largely. They share your environmental stressors, the asbestos levels and lead levels, whatever you're exposed to. And they're geographically more limited than you are, because we don't know if you've been exposed to persistent organic pollutants in your home, or occupationally or as a child. Mice are a very good representation. So it starts by building a better mousetrap, of course. This is one of them.Coping with environmental stressors is tricky. Is anybody here on antidepressants? (Laughter) There's a lot of people in Manhattan are. And we were testing if the mice would also self-administer SSRIs. So this was Prozac, this was Zoloft, this was a black jellybean and this was muscle relaxant, all of which were the medications that the impatient was taking. So do you think the mice self-administered antidepressants? What's the \u2014 (Audience: Sure. Yes.) How did you know that? They did. This was vodka and solution, gin and solution. This guy also liked plain water and the muscle relaxant. Where's our expert? Vodka, gin \u2014 (Audience: [unclear]) Yes. Yes. You know your mice well. They did, yes. So they drank as much vodka as they did plain water, which was interesting. Then of course, it goes into the entrapment device. There's an old cellphone in there \u2014 a good use for old cellphones \u2014 which dials the clinic, we go and pick up the mouse. We take the blood sample and do the blood work and hair work on the mice.And I want to sort of point out the big advantage of framing health in this external way. But we do have a few prescription products through this. It's very different from the medical model. Anything you do to improve your water quality or air quality, or to understand it or to change it, the benefits are enjoyed by anyone you share that water quality or air quality with. And that aggregating effect, that collective action effect, is actually something we can use to our advantage. So I want to show you one prescription product in the clinic called the No Park. This is a prescription to improve water quality. Many impatients are very concerned for water quality and air quality. What we do is we take a fire hydrant, a \"no parking\" space associated with a fire hydrant, and we prescribe the removal of the asphalt to create an engineered micro landscape, to create an infiltration opportunity.Because, many of you will know, that the biggest pollution burden that we have on the New York, New Jersey harbor right now is no longer the point sources, no longer the big polluters, no longer the GEs, but that massive network of roads, [those] impervious surfaces, that collect all that cadmium neurotoxin that comes from your brake liners or the oily hydrocarbon waste in every single storm event and medieval infrastructure washes it straight into the estuary system. That doesn't do a lot of good. These are little opportunities to intercept those pollutants before they enter the harbor, and they're produced by impatients on various city blocks in some very interesting ways. I just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though, there's about two or three fire hydrants on every city block. By creating engineered micro landscapes to infiltrate in them, we don't prevent them from being used as emergency vehicle parking spaces, because, of course, a firetruck can come and park there. They flatten a few plants. No big deal, they'll regenerate. But if we did this in every single \u2014 every fire hydrant we could redefine the emergency. That 99 percent of the time when a firetruck is not parking there, it's infiltrating pollutants. It's also increasing fixing CO2s, sequestering some of the airborne pollutants. And aggregated, these smaller interceptions could actually infiltrate all the roadborne pollution that now runs into the estuary system, up to a seven inch rain event, up to a hundred-year storm.So these are small actions that can amount to a significant effect to improve local environmental health. This is one of the more ambitious ones. What the climate crisis has revealed to us is a secondary, more insidious and more pervasive crisis, which is the crisis of agency, which is what to do. Somehow buying a local lettuce, changing a light bulb, driving the speed limit, changing your tires regularly, doesn't seem sufficient in the face of climate crisis. And this is an interesting icon that happened \u2014 you remember these: fallout shelters. What is the fallout shelter for the climate crisis? This was civic mobilization. Churches, school groups, hospitals, private residents \u2014 everyone built one of these in a matter of months. And they still remain as icons of civic response in the face of shared, uncertain, collective threat.Fallout shelter for the climate crisis, I would say, looks something like this, or this, which is an intensive urban agriculture facility that's due to go on my lab building at NYU. What it does is a very simple idea of taking \u2014 80 to 90 percent of the CO2 produced in Manhattan is building related \u2014 we take, just like a commercial greenhouse, we take the CO2 from the building \u2014 CO2-enriched air \u2014 we force it through the urban agriculture facility, and then we resupply oxygen-enriched air. You can't actually build much on a roof, they're not designed for that. So it's on legs, so it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns. It's built as a barn raising, using open source hardware. This is the quarter-scale prototype that was functioning in Spain. This is what it will look like, fingers crossed, NYU willing.And what I want to show you is \u2014 actually this is one of the components of it that we've just recently been testing \u2014 which is a solar chimney \u2014 we have got 17 of them now put around New York at the moment \u2014 that passively draws air up. You understand a solar chimney. Hot air rises. You put a bit of black plastic on the side of a building, it'll heat up, and you'll get passive airflow. What we do is actually put a standard HVAC filter on the top of that. That actually removes about 95 percent of the carbon black, that stuff that, with ozone, is responsible for about half of global warming's effects, because it changes, it settles on the snow, it changes the reflectors, it changes the transmission qualities of the atmosphere. Carbon black is that grime that otherwise lodges in your pretty pink lungs, and it's associated with. It's not good stuff, and it's from inefficient combustion, not from combustion itself. When we put it through our solar chimney, we remove actually about 95 percent of that. And then I swap it out with the students and actually re-release that carbon black. And we make pencils the length of which measures the grime that we've pulled out of the air. Here's one of them that we have up now. Here's who put them up and who are avid pencil users.Okay, so I want to show you just two more interfaces, because I think one of our big challenges is re-imagining our relationship to natural systems, not only through this model of twisted personalized health, but through the animals with whom we cohabit. We are not alone; the animals are moving in. In fact, urban migration now describes the movement of animals formerly known as wild into urban centers. You know, coyote in Central Park, a whale in the Gowanus Canal, elk in Westchester County. It's happening all over the Developed World, probably for loss of habitat, but also because our cities are a little bit more livable than they have been. And every green space we create is an invitation for non-humans to cohabit with us. But we've kind of lacked imagination in how we could do that well or interestingly. And I want to show you a few of the technological interfaces that have been developed under the moniker of OOZ \u2014 which is zoo backwards and without cages \u2014 to try and reform that relationship. This is communication technology for birds. It looks like this. When a bird lands on it, they trigger a sound file. This is actually in the Whitney Museum, where there were six of them, each of which had a different argument on it, different sound file. They said things like this.(Whistling)Recorded Voice: Here's what you need to do. Go down there and buy some of those health food bars, the ones you call bird food, and bring it here and scatter it around. There's a good person.Natalie Jeremijenko: Okay. (Laugher) So there was several of these. The birds were able to jump from one to the other. These are just your average urban pigeon. And an early test which argument elicited cooperative behavior from the people below \u2014 about a hundred to one decided that this was the argument that worked best on us.Recorded Voice: Tick, tick, tick. That's the sound of genetic mutations of the avian flu becoming a deadly human flu. Do you know what slows it down? Healthy sub-populations of birds, increasing biodiversity generally. It is in your interests that I'm healthy, happy, well-fed. Hence, you could share some of your nutritional resources instead of monopolizing them. That is, share your lunch.(Laughter)NJ: It worked, and it's true. The final project I'd like to show you is a new interface for fish that has just been launched \u2014 it's actually officially launched next week \u2014 with a wonderful commission from the Architectural League. You may not have known that you need to communicate with fish, but there is now a device for you to do so. It looks like this: buoys that float on the water, project three foot up, three foot down. When a fish swims underneath, a light goes on. This is what it looks like. So there's another function on here. This top light is \u2014 I'm sorry if I'm making you seasick \u2014 this top light is actually a water quality display that shifts from red, when the dissolved oxygen is low, to a blue/green, when its dissolved oxygen is high. And then you can also text the fish. So there's business cards down there that'll give you contact details. And they text back. When the buoys get your text, they wink at you twice to say, we've got your message. But perhaps the most popular has been that we've got another array of these boys in the Bronx River, where the first beaver \u2014 crazy as he is \u2014 to have moved in and built a lodge in New York in 250 years, hangs out. So updates from a beaver. You can subscribe to updates from him. You can talk to him.And what I like to think of is this is an interface that re-scripts how we interact with natural systems, specifically by changing who has information, where they have it, who can make sense of that information, and what you can do about it. In this case, instead of throwing chewing gum, or Doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish \u2014 There's a body of water in Iceland that I've been dealing with that's in the middle of the city, and the largest pollution burden on it is not the roadborne pollution, it's actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds. Instead of doing that actually, we've developed some fish sticks that you can feed the fish. They're delicious. They're cross-species delicious that is, delicious for humans and non-humans. But they also have a chelating agent in them. They're nutritionally appropriate, not like Doritos. And so every time that desire to interact with the animals, which is at least as ubiquitous as that sign: \"Do not feed the animals.\" And there's about three of them on every New York City park. And Yellowstone National Park, there's more \"do not feed the animals\" signs than there are animals you might wish to feed. But in that action, that interaction, by re-scripting that, by changing it into an opportunity to offer food that is nutritionally appropriate, that could augment the nutritional resources that we ourselves have depleted for augmenting the fish population and also adding chelating agent, which, like any chelating agent that we use medicinally, binds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and PCBs that are in the fish living in this particular habitat and allows them to pass it out as a harmless salt where it's complexed by a reactive, effectively removing it from bioavailability.But I wanted to say that interaction, re-scripting that interaction, into collective action, collective remediative action, very different from the approach that's being used on the other side on the Hudson River, where we're dredging the PCBs \u2014 after 30 years of legislative and legal struggle, GE's paying for the dredging of the largest Superfund site in the world \u2014 we're dredging it, and it'll probably get shipped off to Pennsylvania or the nearest Third World country, where it will continue to be toxic sludge. Displacement is not the way to deal with environmental issues. And that's typically the paradigm under which we've operated.By actually taking the opportunity that new technologies, new interactive technologies, present to re-script our interactions, to script them, not just as isolated, individuated interactions, but as collective aggregating actions that can amount to something, we can really begin to address some of our important environmental challenges.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 980, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nI was informed by this kind of\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nunoriginal and trite idea\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nthat new technologies were an opportunity\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nfor social transformation,\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nwhich is what drove me then,\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nand still, it's a delusion that drives me now.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nI wanted to update what I've been doing since then --\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nbut it's still the same theme song --\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nand introduce you to my lab and current work,\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nwhich is the Environmental Health Clinic\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nthat I run at NYU.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nAnd what it is -- it's a twist on health.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nBecause, really, what I'm trying to do now\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nis redefine what counts as health.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nIt's a clinic like a health clinic at any other university,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nexcept people come to the clinic\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nwith environmental health concerns,\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nand they walk out with prescriptions\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nfor things they can do to improve environmental health,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nas opposed to coming to a clinic with medical concerns\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nand walking out with prescriptions for pharmaceuticals.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nIt's a handy-dandy quote from Hippocrates of the Hippocratic oath\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nthat says, \"The greater part of the soul lays outside the body,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\ntreatment of the inner requires treatment of the outer.\"\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nBut that suggests the issue\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nthat I'm trying to get at here,\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nthat we have an opportunity to redefine what is health.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nBecause this idea that health is internal\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nand atomized and individual\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nand pharmaceutical\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nis largely an error.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nAnd I would use this study,\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\na recent study by Philip Landrigan,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nto motivate a different view of health,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nwhere he went to most of the pediatricians in Manhattan\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nand the New York area\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nand logged what they spent their patient hours on.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\n80 to 90 percent of their time\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nwas spent on five things.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nNumber one was asthma,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nnumber two was developmental delays,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nnumber three was 400-fold increases\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nin rare childhood cancers\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nin the last eight to 10, 15 years.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nNumber four and five were childhood obesity\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nand diabetes-related issues.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nSo all of those -- what's common about all of those?\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nThe environment is implicated, radically implicated, right.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nThis is not the germs\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nthat medicos were trained to deal with;\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nthis is a different definition of health,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nhealth that has a great advantage\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nbecause it's external, it's shared,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nwe can do something about it,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nas opposed to internal, genetically predetermined\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nor individualized.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nPeople who come to the clinic are called, not patients,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nbut impatients,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nbecause they're too impatient to wait for legislative change\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nto address local and environmental health issues.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nAnd I meet them at the University, I also have a few field offices\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nthat I set up in various places\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nthat provide an immersion\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nin some of the environmental challenges we face.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nI like this one from the Belgian field office,\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nwhere we met in a roundabout,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nprecisely because the roundabout iconified\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nthe headless social movement\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nthat informs much social transformation,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nas opposed to the top-down control\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nof red light traffic intersections.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nIn this case, of course, the roundabout\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nwith that micro-decisions being made in situ\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nby people not being told what to do.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nBut, of course, affords greater throughput,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nfewer accidents,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nand an interesting model of social movement.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nSome of the things that the monitoring protocols have developed:\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nthis is the tadpole bureaucrat protocol,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nor keeping tabs, if you will.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nWhat they are is an addition of tadpoles\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nthat are named after a local bureaucrat\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nwhose decisions affect your water quality.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nSo an impatient concerned for water quality\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nwould raise a tadpole bureaucrat\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nin a sample of water in which they're interested.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nAnd we give them a couple of things to do that,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nto help them do companion animal devices\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nwhile they're blogging and doing their email.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nThis is a tadpole walker\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nto take your tadpole walking in the evening.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nAnd the interesting thing that happens --\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nbecause we're using tadpoles, of course,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nbecause they have the most exquisite biosenses that we have,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nseveral orders of magnitude more sensitive\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nthan some of our senses\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nfor sensing,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nresponding in a biologically meaningful way,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nto that whole class of industrial contaminants\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nwe call endocrine disruptors\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nor hormone emulators.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nBut by taking your tadpole out for a walk in the evening --\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nthere's a few action shots --\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nyour neighbors are likely to say, \"What are you doing?\"\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nAnd then you have to introduce your tadpole\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nand who it's named after.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nYou have to explain what you're doing\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nand how the developmental events of a tadpole\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nare, of course, very observable\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nand they use the same T3-mediated hormones that we do.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nAnd so next time your neighbor sees you\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nthey'll say, \"How is that tadpole doing?\"\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nAnd you can let them social network with your tadpole,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nbecause the Environmental Health Clinic has a social networking site\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nfor, not only impatients, humans,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nbut non-humans,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nsocial networking for humans and non-humans.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nAnd of course, these endocrine disruptors\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nare things that are implicated in the breast cancer epidemic,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nthe obesity epidemic,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nthe two and a half year drop in the average age of onset of puberty in young girls\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nand other related things.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nThe culmination of this is if you've successfully raised your tadpole,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nobserving the behavioral\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nand developmental events,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nyou will then go and introduce your tadpole\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nto its namesake\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nand discuss the evidence that you've seen.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nAnother quick protocol -- and I'm going to go through these quickly,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nbut just to give you the material sense of what we're doing here --\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\ninstead of asking you for urine samples,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nI'll ask you for a mouse sample.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nAnyone here lucky enough to share, to cohabit with a mouse --\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\na domestic partnership with mice?\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nVery lucky.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nMice, of course, are the quintessential\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nmodel organism.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nThey're even better models of environmental health,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nbecause not only the same mammalian biology,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nbut they share your diet, largely.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nThey share your environmental stressors,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nthe asbestos levels and lead levels,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nwhatever you're exposed to.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nAnd they're geographically more limited than you are,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nbecause we don't know if you've been exposed\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nto persistent organic pollutants\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nin your home, or occupationally\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nor as a child.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nMice are a very good representation.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nSo it starts by building a better mousetrap, of course.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nThis is one of them.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nCoping with environmental stressors is tricky.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nIs anybody here on antidepressants?\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nThere's a lot of people in Manhattan are.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nAnd we were testing if the mice\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nwould also self-administer SSRIs.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nSo this was Prozac, this was Zoloft,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nthis was a black jellybean and this was muscle relaxant,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nall of which were the medications that the impatient was taking.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nSo do you think the mice\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nself-administered antidepressants?\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nWhat's the -- (Audience: Sure. Yes.)\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nHow did you know that? They did.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nThis was vodka and solution, gin and solution.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nThis guy also liked plain water and the muscle relaxant.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nWhere's our expert?\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nVodka, gin --\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\n(Audience: [unclear])\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nYes. Yes. You know your mice well.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nThey did, yes.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nSo they drank as much vodka as they did plain water,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nwhich was interesting.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nThen of course, it goes into the entrapment device.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nThere's an old cellphone in there -- a good use for old cellphones --\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nwhich dials the clinic, we go and pick up the mouse.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nWe take the blood sample\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nand do the blood work and hair work on the mice.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nAnd I want to sort of point out the big advantage\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nof framing health in this external way.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nBut we do have a few prescription products through this.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nIt's very different from the medical model.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nAnything you do to improve your water quality or air quality,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nor to understand it or to change it,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nthe benefits are enjoyed by anyone\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nyou share that water quality or air quality with.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd that aggregating effect,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nthat collective action effect,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nis actually something we can use to our advantage.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nSo I want to show you one prescription product in the clinic\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\ncalled the No Park.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nThis is a prescription to improve water quality.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nMany impatients are very concerned for water quality and air quality.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nWhat we do is we take a fire hydrant,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\na \"no parking\" space associated with a fire hydrant,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nand we prescribe the removal of the asphalt\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nto create an engineered micro landscape,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nto create an infiltration opportunity.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nBecause, many of you will know,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nthat the biggest pollution burden\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nthat we have on the New York, New Jersey harbor right now\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nis no longer the point sources,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nno longer the big polluters,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nno longer the GEs,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nbut that massive network of roads,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\n[those] impervious surfaces,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nthat collect all that cadmium neurotoxin that comes from your brake liners\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nor the oily hydrocarbon waste\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nin every single storm event and medieval infrastructure\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nwashes it straight into the estuary system.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nThat doesn't do a lot of good.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nThese are little opportunities to intercept those pollutants\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nbefore they enter the harbor,\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nand they're produced by impatients\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\non various city blocks\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nin some very interesting ways.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nI just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nthere's about two or three fire hydrants\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\non every city block.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nBy creating engineered micro landscapes to infiltrate in them,\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nwe don't prevent them from being used\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nas emergency vehicle parking spaces,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nbecause, of course, a firetruck can come and park there.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nThey flatten a few plants. No big deal, they'll regenerate.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nBut if we did this\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nin every single --\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nevery fire

of the airborne pollutants.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nAnd aggregated,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nthese smaller interceptions\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\ncould actually infiltrate

storm.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nSo these are small actions\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nthat can amount to a significant effect\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nto improve local environmental health.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nThis is one of the more ambitious ones.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nWhat the climate crisis has revealed to us\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nis a secondary, more insidious\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nand more pervasive crisis,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nwhich is the crisis of agency,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nwhich is what to do.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nSomehow buying a local lettuce, changing a light bulb,\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\ndriving the speed limit, changing your

climate crisis?\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nThis was civic mobilization.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nChurches, school groups,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nhospitals, private residents

00:10:52.958\nI would say, looks something like this, or this,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nwhich is an intensive urban agriculture facility\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nthat's due to go on my lab building at NYU.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nWhat it does\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nis a very simple idea\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nof taking --\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\n80 to 90 percent of the CO2 produced in Manhattan\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nis building related --\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nwe take, just like a commercial greenhouse,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nwe take the CO2 from the building --\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nCO2-enriched air --\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nwe force it through the urban agriculture facility,\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nand then we resupply oxygen-enriched air.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nYou can't actually build much on a roof, they're not designed for that.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nSo it's on legs,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nso it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nIt's built as a barn raising,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nusing open source hardware.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nThis is the quarter-scale prototype\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nthat was functioning in Spain.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nThis is what it will look like, fingers crossed,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nNYU willing.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nAnd what I want to show you is --\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nactually this is one of the components of it that we've just recently been testing --\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nwhich is a solar chimney --\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nwe have got 17 of them now put around New York at the moment --\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nthat passively draws air up.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nYou understand a solar chimney.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nHot air rises.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nYou put a bit of black plastic on the side of a building,\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nit'll heat up, and you'll get passive airflow.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nWhat we do is actually\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nput a standard HVAC filter on the top of that.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nThat actually removes about 95 percent\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nof the carbon black,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nthat

snow,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nit changes the reflectors,\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nit changes\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nthe transmission qualities of the atmosphere.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nCarbon black is that grime\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nthat otherwise lodges in your pretty pink lungs,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nand it's associated with.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nIt's not good stuff, and it's from inefficient combustion,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nnot from combustion itself.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nWhen we put it through our solar chimney,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nwe remove actually about 95 percent of that.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nAnd then I swap it out\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nwith the students\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nand actually re-release that carbon black.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nAnd we make pencils the length of which measures the grime\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nthat we've pulled out of the air.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nHere's one of them that we have up now.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nHere's who put them up and who are avid pencil users.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nOkay, so I want to show you\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\njust two more interfaces,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nbecause I think one of our big challenges\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nis re-imagining our relationship to natural systems,\n\n00:13:04.958 -->

--> 00:13:31.958\nprobably for loss of habitat,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nbut also because our cities are a little bit more livable\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nthan they have been.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nAnd every green space we create\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nis an invitation for non-humans to cohabit with us.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nBut we've kind of lacked imagination\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nin how we could do that well or interestingly.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nAnd I want to show you a few of the technological interfaces\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nthat have been developed under the moniker of OOZ --\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nwhich is zoo backwards and without cages --\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nto try and reform\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nthat relationship.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nThis is communication technology for birds. It looks like this.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nWhen a bird lands on it, they trigger a sound file.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nThis is actually in the Whitney Museum, where there were six of them,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\neach of which had a different argument on it,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\ndifferent sound file.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nThey said things like this.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\n(Whistling)\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nRecorded Voice: Here's what you need to do.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nGo down there and buy some of those health food bars,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nthe ones you call bird food,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nand bring it here and scatter it around.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nThere's a good person.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nNatalie Jeremijenko: Okay. (Laugher)\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nSo there was several of these.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nThe birds were able to jump from one to the other.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nThese are just your average urban pigeon.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nAnd an early test\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nwhich argument elicited cooperative behavior\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nfrom the people below --\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nabout a hundred to one\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\ndecided that this was the argument\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nthat worked best on us.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nRecorded Voice: Tick, tick, tick.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nThat's the sound of genetic mutations\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nof the avian flu\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nbecoming a deadly human flu.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nDo you know what slows it down?\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nHealthy sub-populations of birds,\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nincreasing biodiversity generally.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nIt is in your interests that I'm healthy,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nhappy, well-fed.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nHence, you could share some of your nutritional resources\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\ninstead of monopolizing them.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nThat is, share your lunch.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nNJ: It worked, and it's true.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nThe final project I'd like to show you\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nis a new interface for fish\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nthat has just been launched --\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nit's actually officially launched next week --\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nwith a wonderful commission from the Architectural League.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nYou may not have known that you need to communicate with fish,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nbut there is now a device for you to do so.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nIt looks like this: buoys that float on the water,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nproject three foot up, three foot down.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nWhen a fish swims underneath, a light goes on.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nThis is what it looks like.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nSo there's another function on here.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nThis top light is -- I'm sorry if I'm making you seasick --\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nthis top light is actually a water quality display\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nthat shifts from red, when the dissolved oxygen is low,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nto a blue/green, when its dissolved oxygen is high.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nAnd then you can also text the fish.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nSo there's business cards down there\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nthat'll give you contact details.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nAnd they text back.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nWhen the buoys get your text, they wink at you twice to say, we've got your message.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nBut perhaps the most popular has been\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nthat we've got another array of these boys in the Bronx River,\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nwhere the first beaver --\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\ncrazy as he is --\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nto have moved in and built a lodge in New York\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nin 250 years, hangs out.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nSo updates from a beaver.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nYou can subscribe to updates from him. You can talk to him.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nAnd what I like to think of\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nis this is an interface\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nthat re-scripts how we interact with natural systems,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nspecifically by changing who has information,\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nwhere they have it,\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nwho can make sense of that information,\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nand what you can do about it.\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nIn this case, instead of throwing chewing gum,\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nor Doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish --\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nThere's a body of water in Iceland that I've been dealing with\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nthat's in the middle of the city,\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nand the largest pollution burden on it\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nis not the roadborne pollution,\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nit's actually white bread\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nfrom people feeding the fish and the birds.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nInstead of doing that actually, we've developed some fish sticks\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nthat you can feed the fish.\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nThey're delicious.\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nThey're cross-species delicious that is,\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:26.958\ndelicious for humans and non-humans.\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nBut they also have a chelating agent in them.\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:30.958\nThey're nutritionally appropriate,\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nnot like Doritos.\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nAnd so every time\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nthat desire to interact with the animals,\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nwhich is at least as ubiquitous\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nas that sign: \"Do not feed the animals.\"\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nAnd there's about three of them on every New York City park.\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nAnd Yellowstone National Park,\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nthere's more \"do not feed the animals\" signs\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nthan there are animals you might wish to feed.\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nBut in that action, that interaction,\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nby re-scripting that,\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nby changing it into an opportunity\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nto offer food that is nutritionally appropriate,\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nthat could augment the nutritional resources\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nthat we ourselves have depleted\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nfor augmenting the fish population\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:12.958\nand also adding chelating agent,\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nwhich, like any chelating agent that we use medicinally,\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nbinds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and PCBs\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nthat are in the fish\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nliving in this particular habitat\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nand allows them to pass it out as a harmless salt\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nwhere it's complexed by a reactive,\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:32.958\neffectively removing it from bioavailability.\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nBut I wanted to say that interaction,\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nre-scripting that interaction,\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:39.958\ninto collective action, collective remediative action,\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nvery different from the approach\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nthat's being used on the other side on the Hudson River,\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.958\nwhere we're dredging the PCBs --\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:52.958\nafter 30 years of legislative and legal struggle,\n\n00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nGE's paying for the dredging\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nof the largest Superfund site in the world --\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nwe're dredging it, and it'll probably get shipped off to Pennsylvania\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nor the nearest Third World country,\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nwhere it will continue to be toxic sludge.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nDisplacement is not the way to deal with environmental issues.\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:12.958\nAnd that's typically the paradigm\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nunder which we've operated.\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:16.958\nBy actually taking the opportunity\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nthat new technologies,\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:20.958\nnew interactive technologies, present\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:22.958\nto re-script our interactions,\n\n00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nto script them,\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:27.958\nnot just as isolated, individuated interactions,\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:31.958\nbut as collective aggregating actions\n\n00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:33.958\nthat can amount to something,\n\n00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:35.958\nwe can really begin to address\n\n00:19:35.958 --> 00:19:37.958\nsome of our important environmental challenges.\n\n00:19:37.958 --> 00:19:39.958\nThank you.\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:41.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "My web playroom", "duration": "1080", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ze_frank_s_web_playroom", "transcript": "Every presentation needs this slide in it. (Laughter) It's beautiful, isn't it? Do you see? All the points, all the lines \u2014 it's incredible. It is the network; and in my case, the network has been important in media, because I get to connect to people. Isn't it amazing? Through that, I connect to people. And the way that I've been doing it has been multifaceted. For example, I get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners. (Laughter) I put together projects like Earth Sandwich, where I ask people to try and simultaneously place two pieces of bread perfectly opposite each other on the Earth. And people started laying bread in tribute, and eventually a team was able to do it between New Zealand and Spain. It's pretty incredible \u2014 the video's online. Connecting to people in projects like YoungmeNowme for example. In YoungmeNowme, the audience was asked to find a childhood photograph of themselves and restage it as an adult. (Laughter) This is the same person \u2014 top photo, James, bottom photo, [Jennifer]. Poignant. This was a Mother's Day gift. (Laughter) Particularly creepy. (Applause) (Laughter) My favorite of these photos, which I couldn't find, is there's a picture of a 30 year-old woman or so with a little baby on her lap, and the next photo is a 220-lb man with a tiny, little old lady peaking over his shoulder.But this project changed the way that I thought about connecting to people. This is project called Ray. And what happened was I was sent this piece of audio and had no idea who generated the audio. Somebody said, \"You have to listen to this.\" And this is what came to me.Recording: Hi, my name is Ray, and on yesterday my daughter called me because she was stressed out because of things that were going on on her job that she felt was quite unfair. Being quite disturbed, she called for comfort, and I didn't really know what to tell her, because we have to deal with so much mess in our society. So I was led to write this song just for her, just to give her some encouragement while dealing with stress and pressures on her job. And I figured I'd put it on the Internet for all employees under stress to help you better deal with what you're going through on your job. Here's how the song goes.\u266b I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266b\u266b Oh, I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266b\u266b Oh, if you don't leave me alone, \u266b\u266b you gonna have to send me home \u266b\u266b 'Cause I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266bNow you might not be able to sing that out loud, but you can hum it to yourself, and you know what the words are. And let it give you some strength to get the next few moments on your job. All right. Stay strong. Peace.Ze Frank: So \u2014 yeah. No, no, no, shush. We've got to go quickly. So I was so moved by this \u2014 this is incredible. This was connecting, right. This was, at a distance, realizing that someone was feeling something, wanting to affect them in a particular way, using media to do it, putting it online and realizing that there was a greater impact. This was incredible; this is what I wanted to do. So the first thing I thought of is we have to thank him. And I asked my audience, I said, \"Listen to this piece of audio. We have to remix it. He's got a great voice. It's actually in the key of B flat. And have to do something with it.\" Hundreds of remixes came back \u2014 lots of different attempts. One stood out in particular. It was done by a guy named Goose.Remix: \u266b I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266b\u266b Oh, I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266b\u266b Oh, if you don't leave me alone, \u266b\u266b You gonna have to send me home \u266b\u266b Cuz I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266b\u266b I'm about to whip some \u266b \u2014ZF: Great, so it was incredible. That song \u2014 (Applause) Thank you. So that song, somebody told me that it was at a baseball game in Kansas City. In the end, it was one of the top downloads on a whole bunch of music streaming services. And so I said, \"Let's put this together in an album.\" And the audience came together, and they designed an album cover. And I said, \"If you put it all on this, I'm going to deliver it to him, if you can figure out who this person is,\" because all I had was his name \u2014 Ray \u2014 and this little piece of audio and the fact that his daughter was upset. In two weeks, they found him. I received and email and it said, \"Hi, I'm Ray. I heard you were looking for me.\" (Laughter) And I was like, \"Yeah, Ray. It's been an interesting two weeks.\" And so I flew to St. Louis and met Ray, and he's a preacher \u2014 (Laughter) among other things.So but anyways, here's the thing \u2014 is it reminds me of this, which is a sign that you see in Amsterdam on every street corner. And it's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world. I look at this photo, and he seems really interested in what's going on with that button, but it doesn't seem like he is really that interested in crossing the street. (Laughter) And it makes me think of this. On street corners everywhere, people are looking at their cell phones, and it's easy to dismiss this as some sort of bad trend in human culture. But the truth is life is being lived there. When they smile \u2014 right, you've seen people stop \u2014 all of a sudden, life is being lived there, somewhere up in that weird, dense network. And this is it, right, to feel and be felt. It's the fundamental force that we're all after. We can build all sorts of environments to make it a little bit easier, but ultimately, what we're trying to do is really connect with one other person. And that's not always going to happen in physical spaces. It's also going to now happen in virtual spaces, and we have to get better at figuring that out. I think, of the people that build all this technology in the network, a lot of them aren't very good at connecting with people. This is kind of like something I used to do in third grade.(Laughter)So here's a series of projects over the last few years where I've been inspired by trying to figure out how to really facilitate close connection. Sometimes they're very, very simple things. A Childhood Walk, which is a project where I ask people to remember a walk that they used to take as a child over and over again that was sort of meaningless \u2014 like on the route to the bus stop, to a neighbor's house, and take it inside of Google Streetview. And I promise you, if you take that walk inside Google Streetview, you come to a moment where something comes back and hits you in the face. And I collected those moments \u2014 the photos inside Google Streetview and the memories, specifically. \"Our conversation started with me saying, 'I'm bored,' and her replying, 'When I'm bored I eat pretzels.' I remember this distinctly because it came up a lot.\" \"Right after he told me and my brother he was going to be separating from my mom, I remember walking to a convenience store and getting a cherry cola.\" \"They used some of the morbidly artist footage, a close-up of Chad's shoes in the middle of the highway. I guess the shoes came off when he was hit. He slept over at my house once, and he left his pillow. It had 'Chad' written in magic marker on it. He died long after he left the pillow at my house, but we never got around to returning it.\"Sometimes they're a little bit more abstract. This is Pain Pack. Right after September 11th, last year, I was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it, the way that we excise it from our bodies. So what I did is I opened up a hotline \u2014 a hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain, not necessarily related to that event. And people called in and left messages like this.Recording: Okay, here's something. I'm not alone, and I am loved. I'm really fortunate. But sometimes I feel really lonely. And when I feel that way even the smallest act of kindness can make me cry. Like even people in convenience stores saying, \"Have a nice day,\" when they're accidentally looking me in the eye.ZF: So what I did was I took those voicemails, and with their permission, converted them to MP3s and distributed them to sound editors who created short sounds using just those voicemails. And those were then distributed to DJs who have made hundreds of songs using that source material. (Music) We don't have time to play much of it. You can look at it online.\"From 52 to 48 with love\" was a project around the time of the last election cycle, where McCain and Obama both, in their speeches after the election, talked about reconciliation, and I was like, \"What the hell does that look like?\" So I thought, \"Well let's just give it a try. Let's have people hold up signs about reconciliation.\" And so some really nice things came together. \"I voted blue. I voted red. Together, for our future.\" These are very, very cute little things right. Some came from the winning party. \"Dear 48, I promise to listen to you, to fight for you, to respect you always.\" Some came from the party who had just lost. \"From a 48 to a 52, may your party's leadership be as classy as you, but I doubt it.\" But the truth was that as this start becoming popular, a couple rightwing blogs and some message boards apparently found it to be a little patronizing, which I could also see. And so I started getting amazing amounts of hate mail, death threats even. And one guy in particular kept on writing me these pretty awful messages, and he was dressed as Batman. And he said, \"I'm dressed as Batman to hide my identity.\" Just in case I thought the real Batman was coming after me; which actually made me feel a little better \u2014 like, \"Phew, it's not him.\"So what I did \u2014 unfortunately, I was harboring all this kind of awful experience and this pain inside of me, and it started to eat away at my psyche. And I was protecting the project from it, I realized. I was protecting it \u2014 I didn't want this special, little group of photographs to get sullied in some way. So what I did, I took all those emails, and I put them together into something called Angrigami, which was an origami template made out of this sort of vile stuff. And I asked people to send me beautiful things made out of the Angrigami. (Laughter) But this was the emotional moment. One of my viewer's uncles died on a particular day and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate. It's amazing.The last thing I'm going to tell you about is a series of projects called Songs You Already Know, where the idea was, I was trying to figure out to address particular kinds of emotions with group projects. So one of them was fairly straightforward. A guy said that his daughter got scared at night and could I write a song for her, his daughter. And I said, \"Oh yeah, I'll try to write a mantra that she can sing to herself to help herself go to sleep.\" And this was \"Scared.\"(Video) \u266b This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something \u266b\u266b I don't know why but it helps me get over it \u266b\u266b The words of the song just move me along \u266b\u266b And somehow I get over it \u266b\u266b At least I don't suck at life \u266b\u266b I keep on trying despite \u266b\u266b At least I don't suck at life \u266b\u266b I keep on trying despite \u266b\u266b This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something \u266bOkay, so I wrote that song, right. Thank you. So the nice thing was is he walked by his daughter's room at some point, and she actually was singing that song to herself. So I was like, \"Awesome. This is great.\"And then I got this email. And there's a little bit of a back story to this. And I don't have much time. But the idea was that at one point I did a project called Facebook Me Equals You, where I wanted to experience what it was like to live as another person. So I asked for people's usernames and passwords to be sent to me. And I got a lot, like 30 in a half an hour. And I shut that part down. And I chose two people to be, and I asked them to send me descriptions of how to act as them on Facebook. One person sent me a very detailed description; the other person didn't. And the person who didn't, it turned out, had just moved to a new city and taken on a new job. So, you know, people were writing me and saying, \"How's your new job?\" I was like, \"I don't know. Didn't know I had one.\"But anyway, this same person, Laura, ended up emailing me a little bit after that project. And I felt badly for not having done a good job. And she said, \"I'm really anxious, I just moved to a new town, I have this new job, and I've just had this incredible amount of anxiety.\" So she had seen the \"Scared\" song and wondered if I could do something. So I asked her, \"What does it feel like when you feel this way?\" And she wrote a sort of descriptive set of what it felt like to have had this anxiety. And so what I decided to do. I said, \"Okay, I'll think about it.\" And so quietly in the background, I started sending people this.(Audio) \u266b Hey \u266b\u266b You're okay \u266b\u266b You'll be fine \u266bSo I asked people whether they had basic audio capabilities, just so they could sing along to the song with headphones on, so I could just get their voices back. And this is the kind of thing that I got back.Recording: \u266b Hey \u266b\u266b You're okay \u266b\u266b You'll be fine \u266bZF: So that's one of the better ones, really. But what's awesome is, as I started getting more and more and more of them, all of a sudden I had 30, 40 voices from around the world. And when you put them together, something magical happens, something absolutely incredible happens, and all of a sudden I get a chorus from around the world. And what was really great is, I'm putting all this work together in the background, and Laura sent me a follow-up email because a good month had passed by. And she said, \"I know you've forgotten about me. I just want to say thanks for even considering it.\" And then a few days later I sent her this.(Audio) \u266b Right now, it feels like I forgot to turn the light on \u266b\u266b And things that looked so good yesterday \u266b\u266b are now shades of gray \u266b\u266b And it seems like the world is spinning \u266b\u266b while I'm standing still \u266b\u266b Or maybe I am spinning I can't tell \u266b\u266b And then you say \u266b\u266b Hey \u266b\u266b You're okay \u266b\u266b You'll be fine \u266b\u266b Just breathe \u266b\u266b And now the words sing \u266b\u266b Hey \u266b\u266b You're okay \u266b\u266b You'll be fine \u266b\u266b Just breathe \u266b\u266b Now everybody sings \u266b\u266b Hey \u266b\u266b You're okay \u266b\u266b You'll be fine \u266b\u266b Just breathe \u266b\u266b Hey \u266b\u266b You're okay \u266b\u266b You'll be fine \u266b\u266b Just breathe \u266b\u266b Hey \u266b\u266b You're okay \u266b\u266b You'll be fine \u266b\u266b Just breathe \u266bThank you.(Applause)", "id": 981, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nEvery presentation needs this slide in it.\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nIt's beautiful, isn't it?\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nDo you see?\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nAll the points, all the lines --\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nit's incredible.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nIt is the network;\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nand in my case, the network has been important in media,\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nbecause I get to connect to people.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nIsn't it amazing?\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nThrough that, I connect to people.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nAnd the way that I've been doing it\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nhas been multifaceted.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nFor example, I get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:48.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nI put together projects like Earth Sandwich,\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nwhere I ask people\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nto try and simultaneously place\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\ntwo pieces of bread\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nperfectly opposite each other on the Earth.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nAnd people started laying bread in tribute,\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nand eventually a team was able to do it\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nbetween New Zealand and Spain.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nIt's pretty incredible -- the video's online.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nConnecting to people in projects\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nlike YoungmeNowme for example.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nIn YoungmeNowme, the audience was asked\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nto find a childhood photograph of themselves\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nand restage it as an adult.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nThis is the same person --\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\ntop photo, James, bottom photo, [Jennifer].\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nPoignant.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nThis was a Mother's Day gift.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nParticularly creepy.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nMy favorite of these photos, which I couldn't find,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nis there's a picture of a 30 year-old woman or so\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nwith a little baby on her lap,\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nand the next photo is a 220-lb man\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nwith a tiny, little old lady peaking over his shoulder.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nBut this project changed the way\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nthat I thought about connecting to people.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nThis is project called Ray.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nAnd what happened was I was sent this piece of audio\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nand had no idea who generated the audio.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nSomebody said, \"You have to listen to this.\"\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nAnd this is what came to me.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nRecording: Hi, my name is Ray,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nand on yesterday my daughter called me\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nbecause she was stressed out\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nbecause of things that were going on on her job\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nthat she felt was quite unfair.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nBeing quite disturbed, she called for comfort,\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nand I didn't really know what to tell her,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nbecause we have to deal with so much mess in our society.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nSo I was led to write this song just for her,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\njust to give her some encouragement\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nwhile dealing with stress and pressures on her job.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nAnd I figured I'd put it on the Internet\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nfor all employees under stress\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nto help you better deal with what you're going through on your job.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nHere's how the song goes.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:02.958\n\u266b I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266b\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:09.958\n\u266b Oh, I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266b\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:14.958\n\u266b Oh, if you don't leave me alone, \u266b\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\n\u266b you gonna have to send me home \u266b\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:22.958\n\u266b 'Cause I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266b\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nNow you might not be able to sing that out loud,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nbut you can hum it to yourself, and you know what the words are.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nAnd let it give you some strength to get the next few moments on your job.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nAll right. Stay strong. Peace.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nZe Frank: So -- yeah.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nNo, no, no, shush. We've got to go quickly.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nSo I was so moved by this --\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nthis is incredible. This was connecting, right.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nThis was, at a distance,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nrealizing that someone was feeling something,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nwanting to affect them in a particular way,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nusing media to do it, putting it online\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nand realizing that there was a greater impact.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nThis was incredible; this is what I wanted to do.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nSo the first thing I thought of is we have to thank him.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nAnd I asked my audience, I said, \"Listen to this piece of audio.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nWe have to remix it. He's got a great voice.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nIt's actually in the key of B flat.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nAnd have to do something with it.\"\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nHundreds of remixes came back -- lots of different attempts.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nOne stood out in particular.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nIt was done by a guy named Goose.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nRemix: \u266b I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266b\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:31.958\n\u266b Oh, I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266b\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:36.958\n\u266b Oh, if you don't leave me alone, \u266b\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:40.958\n\u266b You gonna have to send me home \u266b\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:46.958\n\u266b Cuz I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266b\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:59.958\n\u266b I'm about to whip some \u266b --\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nZF: Great, so it was incredible.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nThat song -- (Applause) Thank you.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nSo that song, somebody told me that it was at a baseball game\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nin Kansas City.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nIn the end,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nit was one of the top downloads\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\non a whole bunch of music streaming services.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nAnd so I said, \"Let's put this together in an album.\"\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nAnd the audience came together, and they designed an album cover.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nAnd I said, \"If you put it all on this, I'm going to deliver it to him,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nif you can figure out who this person is,\"\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nbecause all I had was his name -- Ray --\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nand this little piece of audio\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nand the fact that his daughter was upset.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nIn two weeks, they found him.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nI received and email and it said,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\n\"Hi, I'm Ray.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nI heard you were looking for me.\"\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAnd I was like, \"Yeah, Ray.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nIt's been an interesting two weeks.\"\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nAnd so I flew to St. Louis\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nand met Ray,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nand he's a preacher --\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\namong other things.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nSo but anyways, here's the thing --\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nis it reminds me of this,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nwhich is a sign that you see in Amsterdam on every street corner.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nAnd it's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nI look at this photo, and he seems really interested\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nin what's going on with that button,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nbut it doesn't seem like he is really that interested in crossing the street.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nAnd it makes me think of this.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nOn street corners everywhere, people are looking at their cell phones,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nand it's easy to dismiss this\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nas some sort of bad trend\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nin human culture.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nBut the truth is\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nlife is being lived there.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nWhen they smile --\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nright, you've seen people stop --\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nall of a sudden, life is being lived there,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nsomewhere up in that weird, dense network.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nAnd this is it, right, to feel and be felt.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nIt's the fundamental force\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nthat we're all after.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nWe can build all sorts of environments\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nto make it a little bit easier,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nbut ultimately, what we're trying to do\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nis really connect with one other person.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nAnd that's not always going to happen in physical spaces.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nIt's also going to now happen in virtual spaces,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nand we have to get better at figuring that out.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nI think, of the people that build all this technology in the network,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\na lot of them aren't very good\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nat connecting with people.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nThis is kind of like something I used to do\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nin third grade.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nSo here's a series of projects\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nover the last few years\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nwhere I've been inspired by trying to figure out\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nhow to really facilitate close connection.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nSometimes they're very, very simple things.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nA Childhood Walk, which is a project\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nwhere I ask people to remember a walk\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nthat they used to take as a child over and over again\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nthat was sort of meaningless --\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nlike on the route to the bus stop, to a neighbor's house,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nand take it inside of Google Streetview.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nAnd I promise you,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nif you take that walk inside Google Streetview,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nyou come to a moment\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nwhere something comes back\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nand hits you in the face.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd I collected those moments --\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nthe photos inside Google Streetview\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nand the memories, specifically.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\n\"Our conversation started with me saying, 'I'm bored,'\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nand her replying, 'When I'm bored I eat pretzels.'\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nI remember this distinctly because it came up a lot.\"\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\n\"Right after he told me and my brother\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nhe was going to be separating from my mom,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nI remember walking to a convenience store\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nand getting a cherry cola.\"\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\n\"They used some of the morbidly artist footage,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\na close-up of Chad's shoes in the middle of the highway.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nI guess the shoes came off when he was hit.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nHe slept over at my house once, and he left his pillow.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nIt had 'Chad' written in magic marker on it.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nHe died long after he left the pillow at my house,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nbut we never got around to returning it.\"\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nSometimes they're a little bit more abstract.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nThis is Pain Pack.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nRight after September 11th, last year,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nI was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nthe way that we excise it from our bodies.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nSo what I did is I opened up a hotline --\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\na hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain,\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nnot necessarily related to that event.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nAnd people called in and left messages like this.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nRecording: Okay, here's something.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nI'm not alone,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nand I am loved.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nI'm really fortunate.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nBut sometimes I feel really lonely.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd when I feel that way\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\neven the smallest act of kindness\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\ncan make me cry.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nLike even people in convenience stores\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nsaying, \"Have a nice day,\"\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nwhen they're accidentally looking me in the eye.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nZF: So what I did was I took those voicemails,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nand with their permission, converted them to MP3s\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nand distributed them to sound editors\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nwho created short sounds\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nusing just those voicemails.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nAnd those were then distributed to DJs\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nwho have made hundreds of songs\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nusing that source material.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\n(Music)\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nWe don't have time to play much of it.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nYou can look at it online.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\n\"From 52 to 48 with love\"\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nwas a project around the time of the last election cycle,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nwhere McCain and Obama both,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nin their speeches after the election, talked about reconciliation,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nand I was like, \"What the hell\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\ndoes that look like?\"\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nSo I thought, \"Well let's just give it a try.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nLet's have people hold up signs about reconciliation.\"\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nAnd so some really nice things came together.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\n\"I voted blue. I voted red.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nTogether, for our future.\"\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nThese are very, very cute little things right.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nSome came from the winning party.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\n\"Dear 48, I promise to listen to you, to fight for you, to respect you always.\"\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nSome came from the party who had just lost.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\n\"From a 48 to a 52, may your party's leadership be as classy as you,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nbut I doubt it.\"\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nBut the truth was that as this start becoming popular,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\na couple rightwing blogs and some message boards\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\napparently found it to be a little patronizing,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nwhich I could also see.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nAnd so I started getting amazing amounts of hate mail,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\ndeath threats even.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nAnd one guy in particular kept on writing me these pretty awful messages,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nand he was dressed as Batman.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nAnd he said, \"I'm dressed as Batman to hide my identity.\"\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nJust in case I thought the real Batman\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nwas coming after me;\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nwhich actually made me feel a little better --\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nlike, \"Phew, it's not him.\"\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nSo what I did --\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nunfortunately, I was harboring all this kind of\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nawful experience and this pain inside of me,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nand it started to eat away at my psyche.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nAnd I was protecting the project from it, I realized. I was protecting it --\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nI didn't want this special, little group of photographs\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nto get sullied in some way.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nSo what I did, I took all those emails,\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nand I put them together into something called Angrigami,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nwhich was an origami template\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nmade out of this sort of vile stuff.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nAnd I asked people to send me beautiful things\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nmade out of the Angrigami.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nBut this was the emotional moment.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nOne of my viewer's uncles died on a particular day\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nand he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nIt's amazing.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nThe last thing I'm going to tell you about is a series of projects\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\ncalled Songs You Already Know,\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nwhere the idea was,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nI was trying to figure out to address\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nparticular kinds of emotions with group projects.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nSo one of them was fairly straightforward.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nA guy said that his daughter got scared at night\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nand could I write a song for her, his daughter.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nAnd I said, \"Oh yeah,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nI'll try to write a mantra that she can sing to herself\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nto help herself go to sleep.\"\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nAnd this was \"Scared.\"\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:54.958\n(Video) \u266b This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something \u266b\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:58.958\n\u266b I don't know why but it helps me get over it \u266b\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:02.958\n\u266b The words of the song just move me along \u266b\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\n\u266b And somehow I get over it \u266b\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\n\u266b At least I don't suck at life \u266b\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:13.958\n\u266b I keep on trying despite \u266b\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\n\u266b At least I don't suck at life \u266b\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\n\u266b I keep on trying despite \u266b\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.958\n\u266b This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something \u266b\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nOkay, so I wrote that song, right. Thank you.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nSo the nice thing was is he walked by his daughter's room at some point,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nand she actually was singing that song to herself.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nSo I was like, \"Awesome. This is great.\"\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nAnd then I got this email. And there's a little bit of a back story to this.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nAnd I don't have much time.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nBut the idea was that at one point\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nI did a project called Facebook Me Equals You,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nwhere I wanted to experience what it was like\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nto live as another person.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nSo I asked for people's usernames and passwords to be sent to me.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nAnd I got a lot, like 30 in a half an hour.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nAnd I shut that part down.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nAnd I chose two people to be,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nand I asked them to send me descriptions\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nof how to act as them on Facebook.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nOne person sent me a very detailed description;\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nthe other person didn't.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nAnd the person who didn't, it turned out,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nhad just moved to a new city and taken on a new job.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nSo, you know, people were writing me and saying, \"How's your new job?\"\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nI was like, \"I don't know.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nDidn't know I had one.\"\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nBut anyway, this same person, Laura,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nended up emailing me a little bit after that project.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nAnd I felt badly for not having done a good job.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nAnd she said, \"I'm really anxious, I just moved to a new town, I have this new job,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nand I've just had this incredible amount of anxiety.\"\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nSo she had seen the \"Scared\" song and wondered if I could do something.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nSo I asked her, \"What does it feel like when you feel this way?\"\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nAnd she wrote a sort of descriptive set\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nof what it felt like to have had this anxiety.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nAnd so what I decided to do.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nI said, \"Okay, I'll think about it.\"\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nAnd so quietly in the background, I started sending people this.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\n(Audio) \u266b Hey \u266b\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\n\u266b You're okay \u266b\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\n\u266b You'll be fine \u266b\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nSo I asked people\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nwhether they had basic audio capabilities,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\njust so they could sing along to the song with headphones on,\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nso I could just get their voices back.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nAnd this is the kind of thing that I got back.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nRecording: \u266b Hey \u266b\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\n\u266b You're okay \u266b\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\n\u266b You'll be fine \u266b\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nZF: So that's one of the better ones, really.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nBut what's awesome is, as I started getting more and more and more of them,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nall of a sudden I had 30, 40 voices from around the world.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nAnd when you put them together, something magical happens,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nsomething absolutely incredible happens,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nand all of a sudden I get a chorus from around the world.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nAnd what was really great is, I'm putting all this work together in the background,\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nand Laura sent me a follow-up email because a good month had passed by.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nAnd she said, \"I know you've forgotten about me.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nI just want to say thanks for even considering it.\"\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nAnd then a few days later I sent her this.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:09.958\n(Audio) \u266b Right now, it feels like I forgot to turn the light on \u266b\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:14.958\n\u266b And things that looked so good yesterday \u266b\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.958\n\u266b are now shades of gray \u266b\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:21.958\n\u266b And it seems like the world is spinning \u266b\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\n\u266b while I'm standing still \u266b\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:29.958\n\u266b Or maybe I am spinning I can't tell \u266b\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:31.958\n\u266b And then you say \u266b\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.958\n\u266b Hey \u266b\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:37.958\n\u266b You're okay \u266b\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:41.958\n\u266b You'll be fine \u266b\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\n\u266b Just breathe \u266b\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.958\n\u266b And now the words sing \u266b\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:49.958\n\u266b Hey \u266b\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:52.958\n\u266b You're okay \u266b\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:55.958\n\u266b You'll be fine \u266b\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:59.958\n\u266b Just breathe \u266b\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\n\u266b Now everybody sings \u266b\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\n\u266b Hey \u266b\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.958\n\u266b You're okay \u266b\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:11.958\n\u266b You'll be fine \u266b\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:15.958\n\u266b Just breathe \u266b\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.958\n\u266b Hey \u266b\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:22.958\n\u266b You're okay \u266b\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:26.958\n\u266b You'll be fine \u266b\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.958\n\u266b Just breathe \u266b\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:33.958\n\u266b Hey \u266b\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:36.958\n\u266b You're okay \u266b\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:40.958\n\u266b You'll be fine

"duration": "1113", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jessica_jackley_poverty_money_and_love", "transcript": "The stories we tell about each other matter very much. The stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter. And most of all, I think the way that we participate in each other's stories is of deep importance. I was six years old when I first heard stories about the poor. Now I didn't hear those stories from the poor themselves, I heard them from my Sunday school teacher and Jesus, kind of via my Sunday school teacher. I remember learning that people who were poor needed something material \u2014 food, clothing, shelter \u2014 that they didn't have. And I also was taught, coupled with that, that it was my job \u2014 this classroom full of five and six year-old children \u2014 it was our job, apparently, to help. This is what Jesus asked of us. And then he said, \"What you do for the least of these, you do for me.\" Now I was pretty psyched. I was very eager to be useful in the world \u2014 I think we all have that feeling. And also, it was kind of interesting that God needed help. That was news to me, and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in.But I also learned very soon thereafter that Jesus also said, and I'm paraphrasing, the poor would always be with us. This frustrated and confused me; I felt like I had been just given a homework assignment that I had to do, and I was excited to do, but no matter what I would do, I would fail. So I felt confused, a little bit frustrated and angry, like maybe I'd misunderstood something here. And I felt overwhelmed. And for the first time, I began to fear this group of people and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people. I imagined in my head, a kind of long line of individuals that were never going away, that would always be with us. They were always going to ask me to help them and give them things, which I was excited to do, but I didn't know how it was going to work. And I didn't know what would happen when I ran out of things to give, especially if the problem was never going away. In the years following, the other stories I heard about the poor growing up were no more positive. For example, I saw pictures and images frequently of sadness and suffering. I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor. I heard about disease, I heard about war \u2014 they always seemed to be kind of related. And in general, I got this sort of idea that the poor in the world lived lives that were wrought with suffering and sadness, devastation, hopelessness.And after a while, I developed what I think many of us do, is this predictable response, where I started to feel bad every time I heard about them. I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth, because I wasn't doing more, apparently, to make things better. And I even felt a sense of shame because of that. And so naturally, I started to distance myself. I stopped listening to their stories quite as closely as I had before. And I stopped expecting things to really change. Now I still gave \u2014 on the outside it looked like I was still quite involved. I gave of my time and my money, I gave when solutions were on sale. The cost of a cup of coffee can save a child's life, right. I mean who can argue with that? I gave when I was cornered, when it was difficult to avoid and I gave, in general, when the negative emotions built up enough that I gave to relieve my own suffering, not someone else's. The truth be told, I was giving out of that place, not out of a genuine place of hope and excitement to help and of generosity. It became a transaction for me, became sort of a trade. I was purchasing something \u2014 I was buying my right to go on with my day and not necessarily be bothered by this bad news. And I think the way that we go through that sometimes can, first of all, disembody a group of people, individuals out there in the world. And it can also turn into a commodity, which is a very scary thing. So as I did this, and as I think many of us do this, we kind of buy our distance, we kind of buy our right to go on with our day. I think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most. It can get in the way of our desire to really be meaningful and useful in another person's life and, in short to love.Thankfully, a few years ago, things shifted for me because I heard this gentleman speak, Dr. Muhammad Yunus. I know many in the room probably know exactly who he is, but to give the shorthand version for any who have not heard him speak, Dr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago for his work pioneering modern microfinance. When I heard him speak, it was three years before that. But basically, microfinance \u2014 if this is new to you as well \u2014 think of that as financial services for the poor. Think of all the things you get at your bank and imagine those products and services tailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day. Dr. Yunus shared his story, explaining what that was, and what he had done with his Grameen Bank. He also talked about, in particular, microlending, which is a tiny loan that could help someone start or grow a business. Now, when I heard him speak, it was exciting for a number of reasons. First and foremost, I learned about this new method of change in the world that, for once, showed me, maybe, a way to interact with someone and to give, to share of a resource in a way that wasn't weird and didn't make me feel bad \u2014 that was exciting. But more importantly, he told stories about the poor that were different than any stories I had heard before. In fact, those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note. He was talking about strong, smart, hardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day and were doing things to make their lives and their family's lives better. All they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better was a little bit of capital. It was an amazing sort of insight for me.And I, in fact, was so deeply moved by this \u2014 it's hard to express now how much that affected me \u2014 but I was so moved that I actually quit my job a few weeks later, and I moved to East Africa to try to see for myself what this was about. For the first time, actually, in a long time I wanted to meet those individuals, I wanted to meet these entrepreneurs, and see for myself what their lives were actually about. So I spent three months in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania interviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollars to start or grow a business. And in fact, through those interactions, for the first time, I was starting to get to be friends with some of those people in that big amorphous group out there that was supposed to be far away. I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories. And over and over again, as I interviewed them and spent my days with them, I did hear stories of life change and amazing little details of change.So I would hear from goat herders who had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats. Their business trajectory would change. They would make a little bit more money; their standard of living would shift and would get better. And they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives, like they would start to send their children to school. They might be able to buy mosquito nets. Maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure. Maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea and offer that to me when I came as their guest and that made them feel proud. But there were these beautiful details, even if I talked to 20 goat herders in a row, and some days that's what happened \u2014 these beautiful details of life change that were meaningful to them. That was another thing that really touched me. It was really humbling to see for the first time, to really understand that even if I could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything, I probably would have gotten a lot wrong. Because the best way for people to change their lives is for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them. So I saw that and it was very humbling.Anyway, another interesting thing happened while I was there. I never once was asked for a donation, which had kind of been my mode, right. There's poverty, you give money to help \u2014 no one asked me for a donation. In fact, no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all. If anything, they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already and to build on their own capabilities. So what I did hear, once in a while, was that people wanted a loan \u2014 I thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting. And by the way, I was a philosophy and poetry major in school, so I didn't know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa. I just got this impression that the money would work. And my introduction to business was in these $100 little infuses of capital. And I learned about profit and revenue, about leverage, all sorts of things, from farmers, from seamstresses, from goat herders. So this idea that these new stories of business and hope might be shared with my friends and family, and through that, maybe we could get some of the money that they needed to be able to continue their businesses as loans, that's this little idea that turned into Kiva.A few months later, I went back to Uganda with a digital camera and a basic website that my partner, Matthew, and I had kind of built, and took pictures of seven of my new friends, posted their stories, these stories of entrepreneurship, up on the website, spammed friends and family and said, \"We think this is legal. Haven't heard back yet from SEC on all the details, but do you say, do you want to help participate in this, provide the money that they need?\" The money came in basically overnight. We sent it over to Uganda. And over the next six months, a beautiful thing happened; the entrepreneurs received the money, they were paid, and their businesses, in fact, grew, and they were able to support themselves and change the trajectory of their lives. In October of '05, after those first seven loans were paid, Matt and I took the word beta off of the site. We said, \"Our little experiment has been a success. Let's start for real.\" That was our official launch. And then that first year, October '05 through '06, Kiva facilitated $500,000 in loans. The second year, it was a total of 15 million. The third year, the total was up to around 40. The fourth year, we were just short of 100. And today, less than five years in, Kiva's facilitated more than 150 million dollars, in little 25-dollar bits, from lenders and entrepreneurs \u2014 more than a million of those, collectively in 200 countries.So that's where Kiva is today, just to bring you right up to the present. And while those numbers and those statistics are really fun to talk about and they're interesting, to me, Kiva's really about stories. It's about retelling the story of the poor, and it's about giving ourselves an opportunity to engage that validates their dignity, validates a partnership relationship, not a relationship that's based on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary weirdness that can happen. But instead a relationship that can promote respect and hope and this optimism that together we can move forward. So what I hope is that, not only can the money keep flowing forth through Kiva \u2014 that's a very positive and meaningful thing \u2014 but I hope Kiva can blur those lines, like I said, between the traditional rich and poor categories that we're taught to see in the world, this false dichotomy of us and them, have and have not. I hope that Kiva can blur those lines. Because as that happens, I think we can feel free to interact in a way that's more open, more just and more creative, to engage with each other and to help each other.Imagine how you feel when you see somebody on street who is begging and you're about to approach them. Imagine how you feel; and then imagine the difference when you might see somebody who has a story of entrepreneurship and hard work who wants to tell you about their business. Maybe they're smiling, and they want to talk to you about what they've done. Imagine if you're speaking with somebody who's growing things and making them flourish, somebody who's using their talents to do something productive, somebody who's built their own business from scratch, someone who is surrounded by abundance, not scarcity, who's in fact creating abundance, somebody with full hands with something to offer, not empty hands asking for you to give them something. Imagine if you could hear a story you didn't expect of somebody who wakes up every day and works very, very hard to make their life better. These stories can really change the way that we think about each other. And if we can catalyze a supportive community to come around these individuals and to participate in their story by lending a little bit of money, I think that can change the way we believe in each other and each other's potential.Now for me, Kiva is just the beginning. And as I look forward to what is next, it's been helpful to reflect on the things I've learned so far. The first one is, as I mentioned, entrepreneurship was a new idea to me. Kiva borrowers, as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years, have taught me what entrepreneurship is. And I think, at its core, it's deciding that you want your life to be better. You see an opportunity and you decide what you're going to do to try to seize that. In short, it's deciding that tomorrow can better than today and going after that. Second thing that I've learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity. So they're not a donation. Yeah, maybe it doesn't sound that much different. But in fact, when you give something to someone and they say, \"Thanks,\" and let you know how things go, that's one thing. When you lend them money, and they slowly pay you back over time, you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue. This continued attention \u2014 this ongoing attention \u2014 is a really big deal to build different kinds of relationships among us. And then third, from what I've heard from the entrepreneurs I've gotten to know, when all else is equal, given the option to have just money to do what you need to do, or money plus the support and encouragement of a global community, people choose the community plus the money. That's a much more meaningful combination, a more powerful combination.So with that in mind, this particular incident has led to the things that I'm working on now. I see entrepreneurs everywhere now, now that I'm tuned into this. And one thing that I've seen is there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world. With social networks, it's an amazing way, growing the number of people that we all have around us in our own supportive communities, rapidly. And so, as I have been thinking about this, I've been wondering: how can we engage these supportive communities to catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideas and to catalyze all of us to make tomorrow better than today? As I've researched what's going on in the United States, a few interesting little insights have come up. So one is that, of course, as we all might expect, many small businesses in the U.S. and all over the world still need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do or they might need money during a hard month. But there's always a need for resources close by. Another thing is, it turns out, those resources don't usually come from the places you might expect \u2014 banks, venture capitalists, other organizations and support structures \u2014 they come from friends and family. Some statistics say 85 percent or more of funding for small businesses comes from friends and family. That's around 130 billion dollars a year \u2014 it's a lot. And third, so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process, it's very awkward, people don't know exactly what to ask for, how to ask, what to promise in return, even though they have the best of intentions and want to thank those people that are supporting them.So to harness the power of these supportive communities in a new way and to allow entrepreneurs to decide for themselves exactly what that financial exchange should look like, exactly what fits them and the people around them, this week actually, we're quietly doing a launch of Profounder, which is a crowd funding platform for small businesses to raise what they need through investments from their friends and family. And it's investments, not donations, not loans, but investments that have a dynamic return. So the mapping of participating in the story, it actually flows with the up and down. So in short, it's a do-it-yourself tool for small businesses to raise these funds. And what you can do is go onto the site, create a profile, create investment terms in a really easy way. We make it really, really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site. And we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues. They can raise up to a million dollars from an unlimited number of unaccredited, unsophisticated investors \u2014 everyday people, heaven forbid \u2014 and they can share those returns over time \u2014 again, whatever terms they set. As investors choose to become involved based on those terms, they can either take their rewards back as cash, or they can decide in advance to give those returns away to a non-profit. So they can be a cash, or a cause, investor. It's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea a path to go do what they want to do in the world and to gather the people around them that they already have, the people that know them best and that love them and want to support them, to gather them to make this happen.So that's what I'm working on now. And to close, I just want to say, look these are tools. Right now, Profounder's right at the very beginning, and it's very palpable; it's very clear to me, that it's just a vessel, it's just a tool. What we need are for people to care, to actually go use it, just like they've cared enough to use Kiva to make those connections. But the good news is I don't think I need to stand here and convince you to care \u2014 I'm not even going to try. I don't think, even though we often hear, you know, hear the ethical and moral reasons, the religious reasons, \"Here's why caring and giving will make you happier.\" I don't think we need to be convinced of that. I think we know; in fact, I think we know so much, and it's such a reality that we care so deeply, that in fact, what usually stops us is that we're afraid to try and to mess up, because we care so very much about helping each other and being meaningful in each other's lives.So what I think I can do today, that best thing I can give you \u2014 I've given you my story, which is the best I can do. And I think I can remind us that we do care. I think we all already know that. And I think we know that love is resilient enough for us to get out there and try. Just a sec.(Applause)Thanks.(Applause)Thanks.(Applause)For me, the best way to be inspired to try is to stop and to listen to someone else's story. And I'm grateful that I've gotten to do that here at TED. And I'm grateful that whenever I do that, guaranteed, I am inspired \u2014 I am inspired by the person I am listening to. And I believe more and more every time I listen in that that person's potential to do great things in the world and in my own potential to maybe help. And that \u2014 forget the tools, forget the moving around of resources \u2014 that stuff's easy. Believing in each other, really being sure when push comes to shove that each one of us can do amazing things in the world, that is what can make our stories into love stories and our collective story into one that continually perpetuates hope and good things for all of us. So that, this belief in each other, knowing that without a doubt and practicing that every day in whatever you do, that's what I believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 983, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nThe stories we tell about each other\n\n00:00:14.958 -->

--> 00:00:31.958\nwhen I first heard stories about the poor.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nNow I didn't hear those stories from the poor themselves,\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nI heard them from my Sunday school teacher\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nand Jesus, kind of via my Sunday school teacher.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nI remember learning that people who were poor\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nneeded something material --\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nfood, clothing, shelter -- that they didn't have.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nAnd I also was taught, coupled with that,\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nthat it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children --\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nit was our job, apparently, to help.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nThis is what Jesus asked of us.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nAnd then he said, \"What you do for the least of these, you do for me.\"\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nNow I was pretty psyched.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nI was very eager to be useful in the world --\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nI think we all have that feeling.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nAnd also, it was kind of interesting that God needed help.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nThat was news to me,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nand it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nBut I also learned very soon thereafter\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nthat Jesus also said, and I'm paraphrasing,\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nthe poor would always be with us.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nThis frustrated and confused me;\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nI felt like I had been just given a homework assignment\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nthat I had to do, and I was excited to do,\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nbut no matter what I would do, I would fail.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nSo I felt confused, a little bit frustrated and angry,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nlike maybe I'd misunderstood something here.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nAnd I felt overwhelmed.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nAnd for the first time,\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nI began to fear this group of people\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nand to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nI imagined in my head, a kind of long line of individuals\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nthat were never going away, that would always be with us.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nThey were always going to ask me to help them and give them things,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nwhich I was excited to do,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nbut I didn't know how it was going to work.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nAnd I didn't know what would happen when I ran out of things to give,\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nespecially if the problem was never going away.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nIn the years following,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nthe other stories I heard about the poor growing up\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nwere no more positive.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nFor example, I saw pictures and images\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nfrequently of sadness and suffering.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nI heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nI heard about disease, I heard about war --\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nthey always seemed to be kind of related.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nAnd in general,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nI got this sort of idea\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nthat the poor in the world lived lives\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nthat were wrought with suffering and sadness,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.958\ndevastation, hopelessness.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nAnd after a while, I developed what I think many of us do,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nis this predictable response,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nwhere I started to feel bad every time I heard about them.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nI started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nbecause I wasn't doing more, apparently, to make things better.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nAnd I even felt a sense of shame because of that.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nAnd so naturally,\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nI started to distance myself.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nI stopped listening to their stories\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nquite as closely as I had before.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nAnd I stopped expecting things to really change.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nNow I still gave -- on the outside it looked like I was still quite involved.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nI gave of my time and my money,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nI gave when solutions were on sale.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nThe cost of a cup of coffee can save a child's life, right.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nI mean who can argue with that?\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nI gave when I was cornered, when it was difficult to avoid\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nand I gave, in general, when the negative emotions built up enough\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nthat I gave to relieve my own suffering,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nnot someone else's.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nThe truth be told, I was giving out of that place,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nnot out of a genuine place of hope\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nand excitement to help and of generosity.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nIt became a transaction for me,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nbecame sort of a trade.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nI was purchasing something --\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nI was buying my right to go on with my day\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nand not necessarily be bothered by this bad news.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nAnd I think the way that we go through that sometimes\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\ncan, first of all,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\ndisembody a group of people, individuals out there in the world.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nAnd it can also turn into a commodity,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nwhich is a very scary thing.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nSo as I did this, and as I think many of us do this,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nwe kind of buy our distance,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nwe kind of buy our right to go on with our day.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nI think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nIt can get in the way of our desire\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nto really be meaningful and useful in another person's life\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nand, in short to love.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nThankfully, a few years ago, things shifted for me\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nbecause I heard this gentleman speak, Dr. Muhammad Yunus.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nI know many in the room probably know exactly who he is,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nbut to give the shorthand version\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nfor any who have not heard him speak,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nDr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nfor his work pioneering modern microfinance.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nWhen I heard him speak, it was three years before that.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nBut basically, microfinance -- if this is new to you as well --\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nthink of that as financial services for the poor.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nThink of all the things you get at your bank\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand imagine those products and services\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\ntailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nDr. Yunus shared his story,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nexplaining what that was,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nand what he had done with his Grameen Bank.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nHe also talked about, in particular, microlending,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nwhich is a tiny loan\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nthat could help someone start or grow a business.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nNow, when I heard him speak, it was exciting for a number of reasons.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nFirst and foremost, I learned about this new method of change in the world\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nthat, for once, showed me, maybe,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\na way to interact with someone\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nand to give, to share of a resource in a way that wasn't weird\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nand didn't make me feel bad --\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nthat was exciting.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nBut more importantly, he told stories about the poor\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nthat were different than any stories I had heard before.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nIn fact, those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nHe was talking about strong, smart,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nhardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nand were doing things to make their lives and their family's lives better.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAll they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nwas a little bit of capital.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nIt was an amazing sort of insight for me.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nAnd I, in fact, was so deeply moved by this --\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nit's hard to express now how much that affected me --\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nbut I was so moved that I actually quit my job a few weeks later,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nand I moved to East Africa\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nto try to see for myself what this was about.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nFor the first time, actually, in a long time\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nI wanted to meet those individuals, I wanted to meet these entrepreneurs,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nand see for myself what their lives were actually about.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nSo I spent three months in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\ninterviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollars\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nto start or grow a business.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nAnd in fact, through those interactions,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nfor the first time, I was starting to get to be friends\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nwith some of those people in that big amorphous group out there\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nthat was supposed to be far away.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nI was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nAnd over and over again,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nas I interviewed them and spent my days with them,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nI did hear stories of life change\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nand amazing little details of change.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nSo I would hear from goat herders\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nwho had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nTheir business trajectory would change.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nThey would make a little bit more money;\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\ntheir standard of living\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nwould shift and would get better.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nAnd they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nlike they would start to send their children to school.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nThey might be able to buy mosquito nets.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nMaybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nMaybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand offer that to me when I came as their guest\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nand that made them feel proud.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nBut there were these beautiful details, even if I talked to 20 goat herders in a row,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nand some days that's what happened --\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nthese beautiful details of life change\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nthat were meaningful to them.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nThat was another thing that really touched me.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nIt was really humbling to see for the first time,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nto really understand\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nthat even if I could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nI probably would have gotten a lot wrong.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nBecause the best way for people to change their lives\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nis for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nSo I saw that and it was very humbling.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nAnyway, another interesting thing happened while I was there.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nI never once was asked for a donation,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nwhich had kind of been my mode, right.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nThere's poverty, you give money to help --\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nno one asked me for a donation.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nIn fact, no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nIf anything, they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nand to build on their own capabilities.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nSo what I did hear, once in a while,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nwas that people wanted a loan --\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nI thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nAnd by the way, I was a philosophy and poetry major in school,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nso I didn't know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nI just got this impression that the money would work.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nAnd my introduction to business\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nwas in these $100 little infuses of capital.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nAnd I learned about profit and revenue, about leverage, all sorts of things,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nfrom farmers, from seamstresses, from goat herders.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nSo this idea\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nthat these new stories of business and hope\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nmight be shared with my friends and family,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nand through that, maybe we could get some of the money that they needed\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nto be able to continue their businesses as loans,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nthat's this little idea that turned into Kiva.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nA few months later, I went back to Uganda\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nwith a digital camera and a basic website\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nthat my partner, Matthew, and I had kind of built,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nand took pictures of seven of my new friends,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nposted their stories, these stories of entrepreneurship, up on the website,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nspammed friends and family and said, \"We think this is legal.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nHaven't heard back yet from SEC on all the details,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nbut do you say, do you want to help participate in this,\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nprovide the money that they need?\"\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nThe money came in basically overnight.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nWe sent it over to Uganda.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nAnd over the next six months, a beautiful thing happened;\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nthe entrepreneurs received the money,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nthey were paid, and their businesses, in fact, grew,\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nand they were able to support themselves\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nand change the trajectory of their lives.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nIn October of '05,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nafter those first seven loans were paid,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nMatt and I took the word beta off of the site.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nWe said, \"Our little experiment has been a success.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nLet's start for real.\" That was our official launch.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nAnd then that first year, October '05 through '06,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nKiva facilitated $500,000 in loans.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nThe second year, it was a total of 15 million.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nThe third year, the total was up to around 40.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nThe fourth year, we were just short of 100.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nAnd today, less than five years in,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nKiva's facilitated\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nmore than 150 million dollars, in little 25-dollar bits,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nfrom lenders and entrepreneurs --\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nmore than a million of those, collectively in 200 countries.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nSo that's where Kiva is today, just to bring you right up to the present.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nAnd while those numbers and those statistics\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nare really fun to talk about and they're interesting,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nto me, Kiva's really about stories.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nIt's about retelling\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nthe story of the poor,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nand it's about giving ourselves\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nan opportunity to engage\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nthat validates their dignity,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nvalidates a partnership relationship,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nnot a relationship that's based\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\non the traditional sort of donor beneficiary\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nweirdness that can happen.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nBut instead a relationship that can promote respect\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nand hope\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nand this optimism\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nthat together we can move forward.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nSo what I hope is that,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nnot only can the money keep flowing forth through Kiva --\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nthat's a very positive and meaningful thing --\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nbut I hope Kiva can blur those lines, like I said,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nbetween the traditional rich and poor categories\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nthat we're taught to see in the world,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nthis false dichotomy of us and them, have and have not.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nI hope that Kiva can blur those lines.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nBecause as that happens,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nI think we can feel free to interact\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nin a way that's more open, more just and more creative,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nto engage with each other and to help each other.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nImagine how you feel\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nwhen you see somebody on street who is begging\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nand you're about to approach them.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nImagine how you feel;\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nand then imagine the difference when you might see somebody\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nwho has a story of entrepreneurship and hard work\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nwho wants to tell you about their business.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nMaybe they're smiling, and they want to talk to you about what they've done.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nImagine if you're speaking with somebody\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nwho's growing things and making them flourish,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nsomebody who's using their talents\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nto do something productive,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nsomebody who's built their own business from scratch,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nsomeone who is surrounded by abundance,\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nnot scarcity,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nwho's in fact creating abundance,\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nsomebody with full hands with something to offer,\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nnot empty hands\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nasking for you to give them something.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nImagine if you could hear a story you didn't expect\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nof somebody who wakes up every day\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nand works very, very hard to make their life better.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nThese stories can really change the way that we think about each other.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nAnd if we can catalyze\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\na supportive community to come around these individuals\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nand to participate in their story\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nby lending a little bit of money,\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nI think that can change the way we believe in each other\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nand each other's potential.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nNow for me, Kiva is just the beginning.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nAnd as I look forward to what is next,\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nit's been helpful to reflect on the things I've learned so far.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nThe first one is, as I mentioned, entrepreneurship was a new idea to me.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nKiva borrowers, as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nhave taught me what entrepreneurship is.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nAnd I think, at its core, it's deciding that you want your life to be better.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nYou see an opportunity\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nand you decide what you're going to do to try to seize that.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nIn short, it's deciding that tomorrow can better than today\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nand going after that.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nSecond thing that I've learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nSo they're not a donation.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nYeah, maybe it doesn't sound that much different.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nBut in fact, when you give something to someone\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nand they say, \"Thanks,\" and let you know how things go,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nthat's one thing.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nWhen you lend them money, and they slowly pay you back over time,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nyou have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nThis continued attention -- this ongoing attention --\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nis a really big deal\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nto build different kinds of relationships among us.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nAnd then third, from what I've heard from the entrepreneurs I've gotten to know,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nwhen all else is equal,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\ngiven the option to have just money to do what you need to do,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nor money plus the support and encouragement\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nof a global community,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\npeople choose the community plus the money.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nThat's a much more meaningful combination, a more powerful combination.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nSo with that in mind, this particular incident\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nhas led to the things that I'm working on now.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nI see entrepreneurs everywhere now, now that I'm tuned into this.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nAnd one thing that I've seen\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nis there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nWith social networks,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nit's an amazing way, growing the number of people that we all have around us\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nin our own supportive communities, rapidly.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nAnd so, as I have been thinking about this,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nI've been wondering: how can we engage these supportive communities\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nto catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideas\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nand to catalyze all of us\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nto make tomorrow better than today?\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nAs I've researched what's going on in the United States,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\na few interesting little insights have come up.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nSo one is that, of course, as we all might expect,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nmany small businesses in the U.S. and all over the world\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nstill need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nor they might need money during a hard month.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nBut there's always a need for resources close by.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nAnother thing is, it turns out,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nthose resources don't usually come from the places you might expect --\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nbanks, venture capitalists,\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nother organizations and support structures --\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nthey come from friends and family.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nSome statistics say 85 percent or more of funding for small businesses\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\ncomes from friends and family.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nThat's around 130 billion dollars a year --\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nit's a lot.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nAnd third, so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nit's very awkward, people don't know exactly what to ask for,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nhow to ask, what to promise in return,\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\neven though they have the best of intentions\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nand want to thank those people that are supporting them.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nSo to harness the power of these supportive communities in a new way\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nand to allow entrepreneurs to decide for themselves\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nexactly what that financial exchange should look like,\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nexactly what fits them and the people around them,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nthis week actually,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nwe're quietly doing a launch of Profounder,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nwhich is a crowd funding platform for small businesses to raise what they need\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nthrough investments from their friends and family.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nAnd it's investments, not donations, not loans,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nbut investments that have a dynamic return.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nSo the mapping of participating in the story,\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nit actually flows with the up and down.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nSo in short, it's a do-it-yourself tool\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nfor small businesses to raise these funds.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nAnd what you can do is go onto the site, create a profile,\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\ncreate investment terms in a really easy way.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nWe make it really, really simple for me\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nas well as anyone else who wants to use the site.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nAnd we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nThey can raise up to a million dollars\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nfrom an unlimited number of unaccredited, unsophisticated investors --\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\neveryday people, heaven forbid --\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nand they can share those returns over time --\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nagain, whatever terms they set.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nAs investors choose to become involved\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nbased on those terms,\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nthey can either take their rewards back as cash,\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nor they can decide in advance\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nto give those returns away to a non-profit.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nSo they can be a cash, or a cause, investor.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nIt's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\na path to go do what they want to do in the world\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nand to gather the people around them that they already have,\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nthe people that know them best\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nand that love them and want to support them,\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nto gather them to make this happen.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nSo that's what I'm working on now.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nAnd to close, I just want to say, look these are tools.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nRight now, Profounder's right at the very beginning,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nand it's very palpable; it's very clear to me, that it's just a vessel, it's just a tool.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nWhat we need are for people to care, to actually go use it,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\njust like they've cared enough to use Kiva\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nto make those connections.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nBut the good news is I don't think I need to stand here and convince you to care --\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nI'm not even going to try.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nI don't think, even though we often hear,\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nyou know, hear the ethical and moral reasons,\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nthe religious reasons,\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\n\"Here's why caring and giving will make you happier.\"\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nI don't think we need to be convinced of that. I think we know;\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nin fact, I think we know so much,\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nand it's such a reality\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nthat we care so deeply,\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nthat in fact, what usually stops us\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nis that we're afraid to try and to mess up,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nbecause we care so very much about helping each other\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nand being meaningful in each other's lives.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nSo what I think I can do today,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nthat best thing I can give you --\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nI've given you my story, which is the best I can do.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nAnd I think I can remind us that we do care.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nI think we all already know that.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nAnd I think we know that love is resilient enough\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nfor us to get out there and try.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nJust a sec.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:49.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nThanks.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:17:01.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nThanks.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nFor me, the best way to be inspired to try\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nis to stop and to listen\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nto someone else's story.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nAnd I'm grateful that I've gotten to do that here at TED.\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nAnd I'm grateful that whenever I do that,\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nguaranteed, I am inspired --\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nI am inspired by the person I am listening to.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nAnd I believe more and more every time I listen\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nin that that person's potential to do great things in the world\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nand in my own potential to maybe help.\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nAnd that --\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nforget the tools, forget the moving around of resources --\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nthat stuff's easy.\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nBelieving in each other,\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nreally being sure when push comes to shove\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nthat each one of us can do amazing things in the world,\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:48.958\nthat is what can make our stories into love stories\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nand our collective story\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:52.958\ninto one that continually perpetuates hope\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nand good things for all of us.\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nSo that, this belief in each other,\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nknowing that without a doubt\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nand practicing that every day in whatever you do,\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nthat's what I believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today.\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nThank you.\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:22.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The brain in your gut", "duration": "914", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/heribert_watzke_the_brain_in_your_gut", "transcript": "This technology made a very important impact on us. It changed the way our history developed. But it's a technology so pervasive, so invisible, that we, for a long time, forgot to take it into account when we talked about human evolution. But we see the results of this technology, still. So let's make a little test. So everyone of you turns to their neighbor please. Turn and face your neighbors. Please, also on the balcony. Smile. Smile. Open the mouths. Smile, friendly. (Laughter) Do you \u2014 Do you see any Canine teeth? (Laughter) Count Dracula teeth in the mouths of your neighbors? Of course not. Because our dental anatomy is actually made, not for tearing down raw meat from bones or chewing fibrous leaves for hours. It is made for a diet which is soft, mushy, which is reduced in fibers, which is very easily chewable and digestible. Sounds like fast food, doesn't it.(Laughter)It's for cooked food. We carry in our face the proof that cooking, food transformation, made us what we are. So I would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves. We talk about ourselves as omnivores. I would say, we should call ourselves coctivors \u2014 (Laughter) from coquere, to cook. We are the animals who eat cooked food. No, no, no, no. Better \u2014 to live of cooked food. So cooking is a very important technology. It's technology. I don't know how you feel, but I like to cook for entertainment. And you need some design to be successful. So, cooking is a very important technology, because it allowed us to acquire what brought you all here: the big brain, this wonderful cerebral cortex we have. Because brains are expensive. Those have to pay tuition fees know. (Laughter) But it's also, metabolically speaking, expensive. You now, our brain is two to three percent of the body mass, but actually it uses 25 percent of the total energy we use. It's very expensive. Where does the energy come from. Of course, from food. If we eat raw food, we cannot release really the energy. So this ingenuity of our ancestors, to invent this most marvelous technology. Invisible \u2014 everyone of us does it every day, so to speak. Cooking made it possible that mutations, natural selections, our environment, could develop us.So if we think about this unleashing human potential, which was possible by cooking and food, why do we talk so badly about food? Why is it always do and don'ts and it's good for you, it's not good for you? I think the good news for me would be if we could go back and talk about the unleashing, the continuation of the unleashing of human potential. Now, cooking allowed also that we became a migrant species. We walked out of Africa two times. We populated all the ecologies. If you can cook, nothing can happen to you, because whatever you find, you will try to transform it. It keeps also your brain working. Now the very easy and simple technology which was developed actually runs after this formula. Take something which looks like food, transform it, and it gives you a good, very easy, accessible energy.This technology affected two organs, the brain and the gut, which it actually affected. The brain could grow, but the gut actually shrunk. Okay, it's not obvious to be honest. (Laughter) But it shrunk to 60 percent of primate gut of my body mass. So because of having cooked food, it's easier to digest. Now having a large brain, as you know, is a big advantage, because you can actually influence your environment. You can influence your own technologies you have invented. You can continue to innovate and invent. Now the big brain did this also with cooking. But how did it actually run this show? How did it actually interfere? What kind of criteria did it use? And this is actually taste reward and energy. You know we have up to five tastes, three of them sustain us. Sweet \u2014 energy. Umami \u2014 this is a meaty taste. You need proteins for muscles, recovery. Salty, because you need salt, otherwise your electric body will not work. And two tastes which protect you \u2014 bitter and sour, which are against poisonous and rotten material. But of course, they are hard-wired but we use them still in a sophisticated way. Think about bittersweet chocolate; or think about the acidity of yogurt \u2014 wonderful \u2014 mixed with strawberry fruits.So we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing because we know that, in cooking, we can transform it to the form. Reward: this is a more complex and especially integrative form of our brain with various different elements \u2014 the external states, our internal states, how do we feel, and so on are put together. And something which maybe you don't like but you are so hungry that you really will be satisfied to eat. So satisfaction was a very important part. And as I say, energy was necessary.Now how did the gut actually participate in this development? And the gut is a silent voice \u2014 it's going more for feelings. I use the euphemism digestive comfort \u2014 actually \u2014 it's a digestive discomfort, which the gut is concerned with. If you get a stomach ache, if you get a little bit bloated, was not the right food, was not the right cooking manipulation or maybe other things went wrong. So my story is a tale of two brains, because it might surprise you, our gut has a full-fledged brain. All the managers in the room say, \"You don't tell me something new, because we know, gut feeling. This is what we are using.\" (Laughter) And actually you use it and it's actually useful. Because our gut is connected to our emotional limbic system, they do speak with each other and make decisions. But what it means to have a brain there is that, not only the big brain has to talk with the food, the food has to talk with the brain, because we have to learn actually how to talk to the brains.Now if there's a gut brain, we should also learn to talk with this brain. Now 150 years ago, anatomists described very, very carefully \u2014 here is a model of a wall of a gut. I took the three elements \u2014 stomach, small intestine and colon. And within this structure, you see these two pinkish layers, which are actually the muscle. And between this muscle, they found nervous tissues, a lot of nervous tissues, which penetrate actually the muscle \u2014 penetrate the submucosa, where you have all the elements for the immune system. The gut is actually the largest immune system, defending your body. It penetrates the mucosa. This is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you digest, which is actually the lumen. Now if you think about the gut, the gut is \u2014 if you could stretch it \u2014 40 meters long, the length of a tennis court. If we could unroll it, get out all the folds and so on, it would have 400 sq. meters of surface.And now this brain takes care over this, to move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface and, of course, digest our food we cook. So if we give you a specification, this brain, which is autonomous, have 500 million nerve cells, 100 million neurons \u2014 so around the size of a cat brain, so there sleeps a little cat \u2014 thinks for itself, optimizes whatever it digests. It has 20 different neuron types. It's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain, where you have 100 billion neurons. It has autonomous organized microcircuits, has these programs which run. It senses the food; it knows exactly what to do. It senses it by chemical means and very importantly by mechanical means, because it has to move the food \u2014 it has to mix all the various elements which we need for digestion. This control of muscle is very, very important, because, you know, there can be reflexes. If you don't like a food, especially if you're a child, you gag. It's this brain which makes this reflex. And then finally, it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery, which actually digests the food we cook.Now how do the two brains work with each other? I took here a model from robotics \u2014 it's called the Subsumption Architecture. What it means is that we have a layered control system. The lower layer, our gut brain, has its own goals \u2014 digestion defense \u2014 and we have the higher brain with the goal of integration and generating behaviors. Now both look \u2014 and this is the blue arrows \u2014 both look to the same food, which is in the lumen and in the area of your intestine. The big brain integrates signals, which come from the running programs of the lower brain, But subsumption means that the higher brain can interfere with the lower. It can replace, or it can inhibit actually, signals. So if we take two types of signals \u2014 a hunger signal for example. If you have an empty stomach, your stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin. It's a very big signal; it's sent to the brain says, \"Go and eat.\" You have stop signals \u2014 we have up to eight stop signals. At least in my case, they are not listened to. (Laughter)So what happens if the big brain in the integration overrides the signal? So if you override the hunger signal, you can have a disorder, which is called anorexia. Despite generating a healthy hunger signal, the big brain ignores it and activates different programs in the gut. The more usual case is overeating. It actually takes the signal and changes it, and we continue, even [though] our eight signals would say, \"Stop, enough. We have transferred enough energy.\" Now the interesting thing is that, along this lower layer \u2014 this gut \u2014 the signal becomes stronger and stronger if undigested, but digestible, material could penetrate. This we found from bariatric surgery. That then the signal would be very, very high.So now back to the cooking question and back to the design. We have learned to talk to the big brain \u2014 taste and reward, as you know. Now what would be the language we have to talk to the gut brain that its signals are so strong that the big brain cannot ignore it? Then we would generate something all of us would like to have \u2014 a balance between the hunger and the satiation. Now I give you, from our research, a very short claim. This is fat digestion. You have on your left an olive oil droplet, and this olive oil droplet gets attacked by enzymes. This is an in vitro experiment. It's very difficult to work in the intestine. Now everyone would expect that when the degradation of the oil happens, when the constituents are liberated, they disappear, they go away because they [were] absorbed. Actually, what happens is that a very intricate structure appears. And I hope you can see that there are some ring-like structures in the middle image, which is water. This whole system generates a huge surface to allow more enzymes to attack the remaining oil. And finally, on your right side, you see a bubbly, cell-like structure appearing, from which the body will absorb the fat. Now if we could take this language \u2014 and this is a language of structures \u2014 and make it longer-lasting, that it can go through the passage of the intestine, it would generate stronger signals.So our research \u2014 and I think the research also at the universities \u2014 are now fixing on these points to say: how can we actually \u2014 and this might sound trivial now to you \u2014 how can we change cooking? How can we cook that we have this language developed? So what we have actually, it's not an omnivore's dilemma. We have a coctivor's opportunity, because we have learned over the last two million years which taste and reward \u2014 quite sophisticated to cook \u2014 to please ourselves, to satisfy ourselves. If we add the matrix, if we add the structure language, which we have to learn, when we learn it, then we can put it back; and around energy, we could generate a balance, which comes out from our really primordial operation: cooking. So, to make cooking really a very important element, I would say even philosophers have to change and have to finally recognize that cooking is what made us.So I would say, coquo ergo sum: I cook, therefore I am.

Better --\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nto live of cooked food.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nSo cooking is a very important technology.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nIt's technology.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nI don't know how you feel,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nbut I like to cook for entertainment.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nAnd you need some design\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nto be successful.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nSo, cooking is a very important technology,\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nbecause it allowed us to acquire\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nwhat brought you all here:\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nthe big brain,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nthis wonderful cerebral cortex we have.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nBecause brains are expensive.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nThose have to pay tuition fees know.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nBut it's also, metabolically speaking, expensive.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nYou now, our brain is two to three percent of the body mass,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nbut actually it uses 25 percent of the total energy we use.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nIt's very expensive.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nWhere does the energy come from. Of course, from food.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nIf we eat raw food,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nwe cannot release really the energy.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nSo this ingenuity of our ancestors,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nto invent this most marvelous technology.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nInvisible -- everyone of us does it every day, so to speak.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nCooking made it possible\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nthat mutations,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nnatural selections, our environment,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\ncould develop us.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nSo if we think about\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nthis unleashing human potential,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nwhich was possible by cooking and food,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nwhy do we talk so badly about food?\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nWhy is it always do and don'ts\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nand it's good for you, it's not good for you?\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nI think the good news for me\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nwould be if we could go back\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nand talk about the unleashing,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nthe continuation of the unleashing of human potential.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nNow, cooking allowed also\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nthat we became a migrant species.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nWe walked out of Africa two times.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nWe populated all the ecologies.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nIf you can cook, nothing can happen to you,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nbecause whatever you find,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nyou will try to transform it.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nIt keeps also your brain working.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nNow the very easy and simple technology\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nwhich was developed\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nactually runs after this formula.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nTake something which looks like food, transform it,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nand it gives you a good, very easy, accessible energy.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nThis technology affected two organs,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nthe brain and the gut, which it actually affected.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nThe brain could grow, but the gut actually shrunk.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nOkay, it's not obvious to be honest.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nBut it shrunk to 60 percent\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nof primate gut\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nof my body mass.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nSo because of having cooked food,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nit's easier to digest.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nNow having a large brain, as you know,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nis a big advantage,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nbecause you can actually influence your environment.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nYou can influence your own technologies you have invented.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nYou can continue to innovate and invent.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nNow the big brain did this also with cooking.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nBut how did it actually run this show?\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nHow did it actually interfere?\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nWhat kind of criteria did it use?\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nAnd this is actually taste reward and energy.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nYou know we have up to five tastes,\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nthree of them sustain us.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nSweet -- energy.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nUmami -- this is a meaty taste.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nYou need proteins for muscles, recovery.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nSalty,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nbecause you need salt, otherwise your electric body will not work.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nAnd two tastes which protect you --\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nbitter and sour,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nwhich are against\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\npoisonous and rotten material.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nBut of course, they are hard-wired\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nbut we use them still in a sophisticated way.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nThink about bittersweet chocolate;\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nor think about the acidity\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nof yogurt -- wonderful --\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nmixed with strawberry fruits.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nSo we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nbecause we know\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthat, in cooking, we can transform it\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nto the form.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nReward: this is a more complex\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nand especially integrative\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nform of our brain\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nwith various different elements --\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nthe external states, our internal states,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nhow do we feel, and so on are put together.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nAnd something which maybe you don't like\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nbut you are so hungry that you really will be satisfied to eat.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nSo satisfaction was a very important part.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nAnd as I say, energy was necessary.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nNow how did the gut actually\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nparticipate in this development?\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nAnd the gut is a silent voice --\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nit's going more for feelings.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nI use the euphemism digestive comfort --\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nactually -- it's a digestive discomfort,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nwhich the gut is concerned with.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nIf you get a stomach ache, if you get a little bit bloated,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nwas not the right food, was not the right cooking manipulation\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nor maybe other things went wrong.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nSo my story is a tale of two brains,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nbecause it might surprise you,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nour gut has a full-fledged brain.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nAll the managers in the room say,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\n\"You don't tell me something new, because we know, gut feeling.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nThis is what we are using.\"\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nAnd actually you use it and it's actually useful.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nBecause our gut is connected to our emotional limbic system,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nthey do speak with each other\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nand make decisions.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nBut what it means\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nto have a brain there\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nis that, not only the big brain\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nhas to talk with the food,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nthe food has to talk with the brain,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nbecause we have to learn actually\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nhow to talk to the brains.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nNow if there's a gut brain,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nwe should also learn to talk with this brain.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nNow 150 years ago,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nanatomists described very, very carefully --\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nhere is a model of a wall of a gut.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nI took the three elements --\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nstomach, small intestine and colon.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nAnd within this structure,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nyou see these two pinkish layers,\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nwhich are actually the muscle.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nAnd between this muscle, they found nervous tissues,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\na lot of nervous tissues,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nwhich penetrate actually the muscle --\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\npenetrate the submucosa,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nwhere you have all the elements for the immune system.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nThe gut is actually the largest immune system,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\ndefending your body.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nIt penetrates the mucosa.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nThis is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nand you digest,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nwhich is actually the lumen.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nNow if you think about the gut,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nthe gut is -- if you could stretch it --\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\n40 meters long,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nthe length of a tennis court.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nIf we could unroll it,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nget out all the folds and so on,\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nit would have 400 sq. meters of surface.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nAnd now this brain takes care over this,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nto move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nand, of course, digest our food we cook.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nSo if we give you a specification,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nthis brain, which is autonomous,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nhave 500 million nerve cells,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\n100 million neurons --\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nso around the size of a cat brain,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nso there sleeps a little cat --\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nthinks for itself,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\noptimizes whatever it digests.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nIt has 20 different neuron types.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nIt's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nwhere you have 100 billion neurons.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nIt has autonomous organized microcircuits,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nhas these programs which run.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nIt senses the food; it knows exactly what to do.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nIt senses it by chemical means\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nand very importantly by mechanical means,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nbecause it has to move the food --\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nit has to mix all the various elements\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nwhich we need for digestion.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nThis control of muscle is very, very important,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nbecause, you know, there can be reflexes.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nIf you don't like a food, especially if you're a child, you gag.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nIt's this brain which makes this reflex.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nAnd then finally,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nit controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nwhich actually digests the food we cook.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nNow how do the two brains work with each other?\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nI took here a model from robotics --\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nit's called the Subsumption Architecture.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nWhat it means is that we have a layered control system.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nThe lower layer, our gut brain,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nhas its own goals -- digestion defense --\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nand we have the higher brain\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nwith the goal of integration\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nand generating behaviors.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nNow both look -- and this is the blue arrows --\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nboth look to the same food, which is in the lumen\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nand in the area of your intestine.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nThe big brain integrates signals,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nwhich come from the running programs\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nof the lower brain,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nBut subsumption means\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nthat the higher brain can interfere with the lower.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nIt can replace,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nor it can inhibit actually, signals.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nSo if we take two types of signals --\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\na hunger signal for example.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nIf you have an empty stomach,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nyour stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nIt's a very big signal;\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nit's sent to the brain says,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\n\"Go and eat.\"\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nYou have stop signals --\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nwe have up to eight stop signals.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nAt least in my case,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nthey are not listened to.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nSo what happens\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nif the big brain in the integration\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\noverrides the signal?\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nSo if you override the hunger signal,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nyou can have a disorder, which is called anorexia.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nDespite generating\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\na healthy hunger signal,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nthe big brain ignores it\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand activates different programs in the gut.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nThe more usual case\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nis overeating.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nIt actually takes the signal\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nand changes it,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nand we continue,\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\neven [though] our eight signals would say, \"Stop, enough.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nWe have transferred enough energy.\"\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nNow the interesting thing is that,\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nalong this lower layer -- this gut --\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nthe signal becomes stronger and stronger\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nif undigested, but digestible, material\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\ncould penetrate.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nThis we found from bariatric surgery.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nThat then the signal would be very, very high.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nSo now back to the cooking question\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nand back to the design.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nWe have learned to talk to the big brain --\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\ntaste and reward, as you know.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nNow what would be the language\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nwe have to talk to the gut brain\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nthat its signals are so strong\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nthat the big brain cannot ignore it?\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nThen we would generate something\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nall of us would like to have --\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\na balance between the hunger\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nand the satiation.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nNow I give you, from our research, a very short claim.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nThis is fat digestion.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nYou have on your left\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nan olive oil droplet,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nand this olive oil droplet gets attacked by enzymes.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nThis is an in vitro experiment.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nIt's very difficult to work in the intestine.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nNow everyone would expect\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nthat when the degradation of the oil happens,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nwhen the constituents are liberated,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nthey disappear, they go away\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nbecause they [were] absorbed.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nActually, what happens is that a very intricate structure appears.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nAnd I hope you can see\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nthat there are some ring-like structures in the middle image,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nwhich is water.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nThis whole system generates a huge surface\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nto allow more enzymes\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nto attack the remaining oil.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nAnd finally, on your right side,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nyou see a bubbly,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\ncell-like structure appearing,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nfrom which the body will absorb the fat.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nNow if we could take this language --\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nand this is a language of structures --\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nand make it longer-lasting,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nthat it can go through\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nthe passage of the intestine,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nit would generate stronger signals.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nSo our research --\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nand I think the research also at the universities --\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nare now fixing on these points\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nto say: how can we actually --\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nand this might sound trivial now to you --\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nhow can we change cooking?\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nHow can we cook\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nthat we have this language developed?\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nSo what we have actually, it's not an omnivore's dilemma.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nWe have a coctivor's opportunity,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nbecause we have learned over the last two million years\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nwhich taste and reward --\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nquite sophisticated to cook --\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nto please ourselves, to satisfy ourselves.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nIf we add the matrix,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nif we add the structure language, which we have to learn,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nwhen we learn it, then we can put it back;\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nand around energy,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nwe could generate a balance,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nwhich comes out\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nfrom our really primordial operation: cooking.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nSo, to make cooking really\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\na very important element,\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nI would say even philosophers have to change\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nand have to finally recognize\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nthat cooking is what made us.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nSo I would say, coquo ergo sum:\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nI cook, therefore I am.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Tough truths about plastic pollution", "duration": "318", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/dianna_cohen_tough_truths_about_plastic_pollution", "transcript": "I'm a visual artist, and I'm also one of the co-founders of the Plastic Pollution Coalition. I've been working with plastic bags, which I cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork for the last 20 years. I turn them into two and three-dimensional pieces and sculptures and installations. Upon working with the plastic, after about the first eight years, some of my work started to fissure and break down into smaller little bits of plastic. And I thought, \"Great. It's ephemeral just like us.\"Upon educating myself a little further about plastics, I actually realized this was a bad thing. It's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits, because it's always still plastic. And what we're finding is that a lot of it is in the marine environment. I then, in the last few years, learned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre. And my initial reaction \u2014 and I think this is a lot of people's first reaction to learning about it \u2014 is, \"Oh my God! We've got to go out there and clean this thing up.\" So I actually developed a proposal to go out with a cargo ship and two decommissioned fishing trawlers, a crane, a chipping machine and a cold-molding machine. And my intention was to go out to the gyre, raise awareness about this issue and begin to pick up the plastic, chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks that could potentially be used as building materials in underdeveloped communities.I began talking with people who actually had been out to the gyre and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment and upon doing so, I realized actually that cleaning it up would be a very small drop in the bucket relative to how much is being generated every day around the world, and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture. And the bigger picture is: we need to find a way to turn off the faucet. We need to cut the spigot of single-use and disposable plastics, which are entering the marine environment every day on a global scale.So in looking at that, I also realized that I was really angry. I wasn't just concerned about plastic that you're trying to imagine out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean \u2014 of which I have learned there are now 11 gyres, potentially, of plastic in five major oceans in the world. It's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about \u2014 it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket. I'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic. All of my beverages are packaged in plastic, even at the health food market. I'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator, and I'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic into us and into our bodies.So I came together with a group of other people who were all looking at this issue, and we created the Plastic Pollution Coalition. We have many initiatives that we're working on, but some of them are very basic. One is: if 80 to 90 percent of what we're finding in the ocean \u2014 of the marine debris that we're finding in the ocean \u2014 is plastic, then why don't we call it what it is. It's plastic pollution. Recycling \u2014 everybody kind of ends their books about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling. You put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again. What is the reality of that? In the United States, less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled. And if you really look into it, particularly when it comes to plastic bottles, most of it is only down-cycled, or incinerated, or shipped to China. It is down-cycled and turned into lesser things, while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again or can be used again \u2014 a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again.So this is a big issue for us. Another thing that we're looking at and asking people to think about is we've added a fourth R onto the front of the \"Reduce, Reuse, Recycle,\" three R's, and that is refuse. Whenever possible, refuse single-use and disposable plastics. Alternatives exist; some of them are very old-school. I myself am now collecting these cool Pyrex containers and using those instead of Glad and Tupperware containers to store food in. And I know that I am doing a service to myself and my family. It's very easy to pick up a stainless-steel bottle or a glass bottle, if you're traveling and you've forgotten to bring your stainless-steel bottle and fill that up with water or filtered water, versus purchasing plastic bottled water.I guess what I want to say to everybody here \u2014 and I know that you guys know a lot about this issue \u2014 is that this is a huge problem in the oceans, but this is a problem that we've created as consumers and we can solve. We can solve this by raising awareness of the issue and teaching people to choose alternatives. So whenever possible, to choose alternatives to single-use plastics. We can cut the stem \u2014 tide the stem of this into our oceans and in doing so, save our oceans, save our planet, save ourselves.Thank you.

00:01:27.958\nAnd my intention was to go out to the gyre,\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nraise awareness about this issue\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nand begin to pick up the plastic,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nchip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nthat could potentially be used as building materials\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nin underdeveloped communities.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nI began talking with people\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nwho actually had been out to the gyre\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nand were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nand upon doing so,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nI realized actually that cleaning it up\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nwould be a very small drop in the bucket\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nrelative to how much is being generated\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nevery day around the world,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nand that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nAnd the bigger picture is:\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nwe need to find a way to turn off the faucet.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nWe need to cut the spigot\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nof single-use and disposable plastics,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nwhich are entering the marine environment every day\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\non a global scale.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nSo in looking at that, I also realized that I was really angry.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nI wasn't just concerned about plastic\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nthat you're trying to imagine out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean --\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nof which I have learned there are now\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\n11 gyres, potentially, of plastic\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nin five major oceans in the world.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nIt's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about --\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nit's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nI'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nAll of my beverages are packaged in plastic,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\neven at the health food market.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nI'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nand I'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\ninto us and into our bodies.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nSo I came together with a group of other people\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nwho were all looking at this issue,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nand we created the Plastic Pollution Coalition.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nWe have many initiatives that we're working on,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nbut some of them are very basic.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nOne is: if 80 to 90 percent\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nof what we're finding in the ocean --\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nof the marine debris that we're finding in the ocean -- is plastic,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nthen why don't we call it what it is.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nIt's plastic pollution.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nRecycling -- everybody kind of ends their books\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nabout being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nYou put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nWhat is the reality of that?\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nIn the United States, less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nAnd if you really look into it,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nparticularly when it comes to plastic bottles,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nmost of it is only down-cycled,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nor incinerated, or shipped to China.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nIt is down-cycled and turned into lesser things,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nwhile a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nor can be used again --\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\na plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nSo this is a big issue for us.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nAnother thing that we're looking at and asking people to think about\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nis we've added a fourth R\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nonto the front\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nof the \"Reduce, Reuse, Recycle,\" three R's,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nand that is refuse.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nWhenever possible, refuse single-use and disposable plastics.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nAlternatives exist;\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nsome of them are very old-school.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nI myself am now collecting these cool Pyrex containers\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nand using those instead of Glad and Tupperware containers\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nto store food in.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nAnd I know that I am doing a service\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nto myself and my family.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nIt's very easy to pick up a stainless-steel bottle\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nor a glass bottle,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nif you're traveling and you've forgotten to bring your stainless-steel bottle\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nand fill that up with water or filtered water,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nversus purchasing plastic bottled water.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nI guess what I want to say to everybody here --\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nand I know that you guys know a lot about this issue --\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nis that this is a huge problem in the oceans,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nbut this is a problem that we've created as consumers\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nand we can solve.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nWe can solve this by raising awareness of the issue\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nand teaching people to choose alternatives.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nSo whenever possible, to choose alternatives\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nto single-use plastics.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nWe can cut the stem -- tide the stem of this\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\ninto our oceans\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nand in doing so,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nsave our oceans, save our planet, save ourselves.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nThank you.

I don't know if you've heard about it \u2014 newspapers? It's a sort of paper-based reader. (Laughter) It's lighter than an iPad, it's a bit cheaper. You know what they say? They say the print media is dying \u2014 who says that? Well, the media. But this is no news, right? You've read about it already.(Laughter)Ladies and gentlemen, the world has gotten smaller. I know it's a cliche, but look, look how small, how tiny it has gotten. And you know the reason why, of course. This is because of technology \u2014 yeah. (Laughter) Any computer designers in the room? Yeah well, you guys are making my life miserable because track pads used to be round, a nice round shape. That makes a good cartoon. But what are you going to do with a flat track pad, those square things? There's nothing I can do as a cartoonist. Well, I know the world is flat now. That's true. And the Internet has reached every corner of the world, the poorest, the remotest places. Every village in Africa now has a cyber cafe. (Laughter) Don't go asking for a Frappuccino there. So we are bridging the digital divide. The Third World is connected, we are connected. And what happens next? Well, you've got mail. Yeah. Well, the Internet has empowered us. It has empowered you, it has empowered me and it has empowered some other guys as well.(Laughter)You know, these last two cartoons \u2014 I did them live during a conference in Hanoi. And they were not used to that in communist 2.0 Vietnam. (Laughter) So I was cartooning live on a wide screen \u2014 it was quite a sensation \u2014 and then this guy came to me. He was taking pictures of me and of my sketches, and I thought, \"This is great, a Vietnamese fan.\" And as he came the second day, I thought, \"Wow, that's really a cartoon lover.\" And on the third day, I finally understood, the guy was actually on duty. So by now, there must be a hundred pictures of me smiling with my sketches in the files of the Vietnamese police.(Laughter)No, but it's true: the Internet has changed the world. It has rocked the music industry; it has changed the way we consume music. For those of you old enough to remember, we used to have to go to the store to steal it. (Laughter) And it has changed the way your future employer will look at your application. So be careful with that Facebook account \u2014 your momma told you, be careful. And technology has set us free \u2014 this is free WiFi. But yeah, it has liberated us from the office desk. This is your life, enjoy it. (Laughter) In short, technology, the internet, they have changed our lifestyle. Tech guru, like this man \u2014 that a German magazine called the philosopher of the 21st century \u2014 they are shaping the way we do things. They are shaping the way we consume. They are shaping our very desires. (Laughter) (Applause) You will not like it. And technology has even changed our relationship to God.(Laughter)Now I shouldn't get into this. Religion and political cartoons, as you may have heard, make a difficult couple, ever since that day of 2005, when a bunch of cartoonists in Denmark drew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world \u2014 demonstrations, fatwa, they provoked violence. People died in the violence. This was so sickening; people died because of cartoons. I mean \u2014 I had the feeling at the time that cartoons had been used by both sides, actually. They were used first by a Danish newspaper, which wanted to make a point on Islam. A Danish cartoonist told me he was one of the 24 who received the assignment to draw the prophet \u2014 12 of them refused. Did you know that? He told me, \"Nobody has to tell me what I should draw. This is not how it works.\" And then, of course, they were used by extremists and politicians on the other side. They wanted to stir up controversy. You know the story. We know that cartoons can be used as weapons. History tells us, they've been used by the Nazis to attack the Jews. And here we are now. In the United Nations, half of the world is pushing to penalize the offense to religion \u2014 they call it the defamation of religion \u2014 while the other half of the world is fighting back in defense of freedom of speech. So the clash of civilizations is here, and cartoons are at the middle of it? This got me thinking. Now you see me thinking at my kitchen table, and since you're in my kitchen, please meet my wife.(Laughter)In 2006, a few months after, I went Ivory Coast \u2014 Western Africa. Now, talk of a divided place \u2014 the country was cut in two. You had a rebellion in the North, the government in the South \u2014 the capital, Abidjan \u2014 and in the middle, the French army. This looks like a giant hamburger. You don't want to be the ham in the middle. I was there to report on that story in cartoons. I've been doing this for the last 15 years; it's my side job, if you want. So you see the style is different. This is more serious than maybe editorial cartooning. I went to places like Gaza during the war in 2009. So this is really journalism in cartoons. You'll hear more and more about it. This is the future of journalism, I think.And of course, I went to see the rebels in the north. Those were poor guys fighting for their rights. There was an ethnic side to this conflict as very often in Africa. And I went to see the Dozo. The Dozo, they are the traditional hunters of West Africa. People fear them \u2014 they help the rebellion a lot. They are believed to have magical powers. They can disappear and escape bullets. I went to see a Dozo chief; he told me about his magical powers. He said, \"I can chop your head off right away and bring you back to life.\" I said, \"Well, maybe we don't have time for this right now.\" (Laughter) \"Another time.\"So back in Abidjan, I was given a chance to lead a workshop with local cartoonists there and I thought, yes, in a context like this, cartoons can really be used as weapons against the other side. I mean, the press in Ivory Coast was bitterly divided \u2014 it was compared to the media in Rwanda before the genocide \u2014 so imagine. And what can a cartoonist do? Sometimes editors would tell their cartoonists to draw what they wanted to see, and the guy has to feed his family, right? So the idea was pretty simple. We brought together cartoonists from all sides in Ivory Coast. We took them away from their newspaper for three days. And I asked them to do a project together, tackle the issues affecting their country in cartoons, yes, in cartoons. Show the positive power of cartoons. It's a great tool of communication for bad or for good. And cartoons can cross boundaries, as you have seen. And humor is a good way, I think, to address serious issues. And I'm very proud of what they did. I mean, they didn't agree with each other \u2014 that was not the point. And I didn't ask them to do nice cartoons. The first day, they were even shouting at each other. But they came up with a book, looking back at 13 years of political crisis in Ivory Coast.So the idea was there. And I've been doing projects like this, in 2009 in Lebanon, this year in Kenya, back in January. In Lebanon, it was not a book. The idea was to have \u2014 the same principal, a divided country \u2014 take cartoonists from all sides and let them do something together. So in Lebanon, we enrolled the newspaper editors, and we got them to publish eight cartoonists from all sides all together on the same page, addressing the issue affecting Lebanon, like religion in politics and everyday life. And it worked. For three days, almost all the newspapers of Beirut published all those cartoonists together \u2014 anti-government, pro-government, Christian, Muslim, of course, English-speaking, well, you name it. So this was a great project. And then in Kenya, what we did was addressing the issue of ethnicity, which is a poison in a lot of places in Africa. And we did video clips \u2014 you can see them if you go to YouTube/Kenyatoons.So, preaching for freedom of speech is easy here, but as you have seen in contexts of repression or division, again, what can a cartoonist do? He has to keep his job. Well I believe that in any context anywhere, he always has the choice at least not to do a cartoon that will feed hatred. And that's the message I try to convey to them. I think we all always have the choice in the end not to do the bad thing. But we need to support these [unclear], critical and responsible voices in Africa, in Lebanon, in your local newspaper, in the Apple store. Today, tech companies are the world's largest editors. They decide what is too offensive or too provocative for you to see. So really, it's not about the freedom of cartoonists; it's about your freedoms. And for dictators all over the world, the good news is when cartoonists, journalists and activists shut up.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 987, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nSo yeah, I'm a newspaper cartoonist --\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\npolitical cartoonist.\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nI don't know if you've heard about it -- newspapers?\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nIt's a sort of paper-based reader.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nIt's lighter than an iPad,\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nit's a bit cheaper.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nYou know what they say?\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nThey say the print media is dying --\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nwho says that?

me\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nand it has empowered some other guys as well.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:27.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nYou know, these last two cartoons --\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nI did them live\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nduring a conference in Hanoi.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nAnd they were not used to that\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nin communist 2.0 Vietnam.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nSo I was cartooning live on a wide screen --\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nit was quite a sensation --\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nand then this guy came to me.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nHe was taking pictures of me and of my sketches,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nand I thought, \"This is great, a Vietnamese fan.\"\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nAnd as he came the second day,\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nI thought, \"Wow, that's really a cartoon lover.\"\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nAnd on the third day, I finally understood,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nthe guy was actually on duty.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nSo by now, there must be a hundred pictures of me\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nsmiling with my sketches\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nin the files of the Vietnamese police.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nNo, but it's true: the Internet has changed the world.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nIt has rocked the music industry;\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nit has changed the way we consume music.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nFor those of you old enough to remember,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nwe used to have to go to the store\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nto steal it.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nAnd it has changed the way\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nyour future employer\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nwill look at your application.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nSo be careful\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nwith that Facebook account --\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nyour momma told you, be careful.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nAnd technology has set us free --\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nthis is free WiFi.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nBut yeah, it has liberated us\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nfrom the office desk.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nThis is your life,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nenjoy it.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nIn short, technology, the internet,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nthey have changed our lifestyle.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nTech guru, like this man --\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nthat a German magazine called the philosopher of the 21st century --\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nthey are shaping the way we do things.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nThey are shaping the way we consume.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nThey are shaping our very desires.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:27.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:33.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nYou will not like it.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nAnd technology has even changed\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nour relationship to God.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:49.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nNow I shouldn't get into this.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nReligion and political cartoons,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nas you may have heard,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nmake a difficult couple,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\never since that day of 2005,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nwhen a bunch of cartoonists in Denmark\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\ndrew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world --\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\ndemonstrations, fatwa,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nthey provoked violence. People died in the violence.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nThis was so sickening;\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\npeople died because of cartoons.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nI mean --\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nI had the feeling at the time\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nthat cartoons had been used by both sides, actually.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nThey were used first by a Danish newspaper,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nwhich wanted to make a point on Islam.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nA Danish cartoonist told me he was one of the 24\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nwho received the assignment to draw the prophet --\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\n12 of them refused. Did you know that?\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nHe told me, \"Nobody has to tell me what I should draw.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nThis is not how it works.\"\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nAnd then, of course, they were used\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nby extremists and politicians on the other side.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nThey wanted to stir up controversy.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nYou know the story.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nWe know that cartoons can be used as weapons.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nHistory tells us,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nthey've been used by the Nazis\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nto attack the Jews.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nAnd here we are now.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nIn the United Nations,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nhalf of the world is pushing\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nto penalize the offense to religion --\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nthey call it the defamation of religion --\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nwhile the other half of the world is fighting back\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nin defense of freedom of speech.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nSo the clash of civilizations is here,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nand cartoons are at the middle of it?\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nThis got me thinking.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nNow you see me thinking\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nat my kitchen table,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nand since you're in my kitchen,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nplease meet my wife.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nIn 2006, a few months after,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nI went Ivory Coast --\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nWestern Africa.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nNow, talk of a divided place -- the country was cut in two.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nYou had a rebellion in the North,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nthe government in the South -- the capital, Abidjan --\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nand in the middle, the French army.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nThis looks like a giant hamburger.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nYou don't want to be the ham in the middle.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nI was there to report on that story\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nin cartoons.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nI've been doing this for the last 15 years;\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nit's my side job, if you want.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nSo you see the style is different.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nThis is more serious than maybe editorial cartooning.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nI went to places like Gaza\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nduring the war in 2009.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nSo this is really journalism in cartoons.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nYou'll hear more and more about it.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nThis is the future of journalism, I think.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nAnd of course, I went to see the rebels in the north.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nThose were poor guys fighting for their rights.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nThere was an ethnic side to this conflict\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nas very often in Africa.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nAnd I went to see the Dozo.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nThe Dozo, they are the traditional hunters\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nof West Africa.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nPeople fear them --\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nthey help the rebellion a lot.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nThey are believed to have magical powers.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nThey can disappear and escape bullets.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nI went to see a Dozo chief;\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nhe told me about his magical powers.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nHe said, \"I can chop your head off right away\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nand bring you back to life.\"\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nI said, \"Well, maybe we don't have time for this right now.\"\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\n\"Another time.\"\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nSo back in Abidjan,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nI was given a chance to lead a workshop\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nwith local cartoonists there\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nand I thought, yes,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nin a context like this, cartoons can really be used as weapons\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nagainst the other side.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nI mean, the press in Ivory Coast was bitterly divided --\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nit was compared to the media in Rwanda\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nbefore the genocide --\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nso imagine.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nAnd what can a cartoonist do?\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nSometimes editors would tell their cartoonists\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nto draw what they wanted to see,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nand the guy has to feed his family, right?\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nSo the idea was pretty simple.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nWe brought together cartoonists\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nfrom all sides in Ivory Coast.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nWe took them away from their newspaper for three days.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nAnd I asked them to do a project together,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\ntackle the issues affecting their country\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nin cartoons, yes, in cartoons.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nShow the positive power of cartoons.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nIt's a great tool of communication\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nfor bad or for good.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nAnd cartoons can cross boundaries,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nas you have seen.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nAnd humor is a good way, I think,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nto address serious issues.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nAnd I'm very proud of what they did.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nI mean, they didn't agree with each other -- that was not the point.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nAnd I didn't ask them to do nice cartoons.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nThe first day, they were even shouting at each other.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nBut they came up with a book,\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nlooking back at 13 years\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nof political crisis in Ivory Coast.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nSo the idea was there.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nAnd I've been doing projects like this,\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nin 2009 in Lebanon,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nthis year in Kenya, back in January.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nIn Lebanon, it was not a book.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nThe idea was to have --\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nthe same principal, a divided country --\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\ntake cartoonists from all sides\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nand let them do something together.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nSo in Lebanon,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nwe enrolled the newspaper editors,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nand we got them to publish\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\neight cartoonists from all sides all together on the same page,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\naddressing the issue affecting Lebanon,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nlike religion in politics and everyday life.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nAnd it worked.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nFor three days, almost all the newspapers of Beirut\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\npublished all those cartoonists together --\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nanti-government,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\npro-government,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nChristian,\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nMuslim, of course,\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nEnglish-speaking, well, you name it.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nSo this was a great project.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nAnd then in Kenya, what we did\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nwas addressing the issue of ethnicity,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nwhich is a poison in a lot of places in Africa.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nAnd we did video clips --\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nyou can see them if you go to YouTube/Kenyatoons.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nSo, preaching for freedom of speech\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nis easy here,\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nbut as you have seen\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nin contexts of repression or division,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nagain, what can a cartoonist do?\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nHe has to keep his job.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nWell I believe that in any context anywhere,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nhe always has the choice at least\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nnot to do a cartoon\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nthat will feed hatred.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nAnd that's the message I try to convey to them.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nI think we all always have the choice in the end\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nnot to do the bad thing.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nBut we need to support\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nthese [unclear], critical\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nand responsible voices\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nin Africa, in Lebanon,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nin your local newspaper,\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nin the Apple store.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nToday, tech companies\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nare the world's largest editors.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nThey decide what is too offensive\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nor too provocative for you to see.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nSo really, it's not about the freedom of cartoonists;\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nit's about your freedoms.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAnd for dictators all over the world,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nthe good news\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nis when cartoonists,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\njournalists and activists shut up.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nThank

All the time we are trying to get value for money. What we don't look for is value for many, while we are generating value for money. Do we care about those four billion people whose income levels are less than two dollars a day, the so-called bottom of the pyramid? What are the challenges in getting value for money as well as value for many? We have described here in terms of the performance and the price. If you have money, of course, you can get the value. You can get a Mercedes for a very high price, very high performance. But if you don't have money, what happens? Well, you are to ride a bicycle, carrying your own weight and also some other weight, so that you can earn the bread for the day. Well, poor do not remain poor; they become lower-middle-class. And if they do so, then, of course, the conditions improve, and they start riding on scooters. But the challenge is, again, they don't get much value, because they can't afford anything more than the scooter. The issue is, at that price, can you give them some extra value? A super value, in terms of their ability to ride in a car, to get that dignity, to get that safety, looks practically impossible, isn't it.Now, this is something that we see on Indian streets all the time. But many people see the same thing and think things differently, and one of them is here, Ratan Tata. The great thing about our leaders is that, should they not only have passion in their belly, which practically all of them have, they're also very innovative. An innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done. They believe that things can be done. But great leaders like Ratan have compassion. And what you said, Lakshmi, is absolutely true: it's not just Ratan Tata, it's the house of Tatas over time. Let me confirm what she said. Yes, I went barefoot until I was 12. I struggled to [unclear] day was a huge issue. And when I finished my SSC, the eleventh standard, I stood eleventh among 125,000 students. But I was about to leave the school, because my poor mother couldn't afford schooling. And it was [unclear] Tata Trust, which gave me six rupees per month, almost a dollar per month for six years. That's how I'm standing before you. So that is the House of Tata. (Applause) Innovation, compassion and passion. They combine all that.And it was that compassion which bothered them, because when he saw \u2014 in fact, he told me about eight or nine years ago how he was driving his own car \u2014 he drives his own car by the way \u2014 and he saw in the rain, a family like the one that I showed to you getting drenched with an infant. And then he said, \"Well, I must give them a car that they can afford, one lakh car, $2,000 car.\" Of course, as soon as you say something like this people say it is impossible, and that's what was said by Suzuki. He said, oh, probably he is going to build a three-wheeler with stepney. And you can see the cartoon here. Well they didn't build that. They built a proper car. Nano. And mind you, I'm six feet half an inch, Ratan is taller than me, and we have ample space in the front and ample space in the back in this particular car. And incredible car. And of course, nothing succeeds like success; the cynics then turned around, and one after the other they also started saying, \"Yes, we also want to make a car in the Nano Segment. We'll manufacture a car in the Nano Segment.\"How did this great story unfold, the making of Nano? Let me tell you a bit about it. For example, how we started: Ratan just began with a five-engineer team, young people in their mid-twenties. And he said, \"Well, I won't define the vehicle for you, but I will define the cost for you. It is one lakh, 100,000 rupees, and you are to make it within that.\" And he told them, \"Question the unquestionable. Stretch the envelope.\" And at a point in time, he got so engrossed in the whole challenge, that he himself became a member of the team. Can you believe it? I still am told about this story of that single wiper design in which he participated. Until midnight, he'd be thinking. Early morning he'll be coming back with sort of solutions. But who was the team leader? The team leader was Girish Wagh, a 34 year-old boy in [unclear]. And the Nano team average age was just 27 years.And they did innovation in design and beyond. Broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time. For example, that a two-cylinder gas engine was used in a car with a single balancer shaft. Adhesives were replacing the rivets. There was a co-creation, a huge co-creation, with vendors and suppliers. All ideas on board were welcome. 100 vendors were co-located adjacent to the plant, and innovative business models for automobile dealerships were developed. Imagine that a fellow who sells cloth, for example, will be selling Nano. I mean, it was incredible innovation. Seeking solutions for non-auto sectors. It was an open innovation, ideas from all over were welcome. The mechanism of helicopters seats and windows was used, by the way, as well as a dashboard that was inspired by two-wheelers. The fuel lines and lamps were as in two-wheelers.And the crux of the matter was, however, getting more from less. All the time, you have been given an envelope. You can't cross that envelope, which is 100,000 rupees, 2,000 dollars. And therefore, each component had to have a dual functionality. And the seat riser, for example, serving as a mounting for the seat as well as a structural part of the functional rigidity. Half the number of parts are contained in Nano in comparison to a typical passenger car. The length is smaller by eight percent by the way. But the current entry-level cars in comparison to that is eight percent less, but 21 percent more inside space.And what happened was that \u2014 more from less \u2014 you can see how much more for how much less. When the Model T was launched \u2014 and this is, by the way, all the figures that are adjusted to 2007 dollar prices \u2014 Model T was 19,700 by Ford. Volkswagon was 11,333. And British Motor was around 11,000. And Nano was, bang, 2,000 dollars. This is why you started actually a new paradigm shift, where the same people who could not dream of sitting in a car, who were carrying their entire family in a scooter, started dreaming of being in a car. And those dreams are getting fulfilled. This is a photograph of a house and a driver and a car near my own home. The driver's name is Naran. He has bought his own Nano. And you can see, there is a physical space that has been created for him, parking that car, along with the owner's car, but more importantly, they've created a space in their mind that \"Yes, my chauffeur is going to come in his own car and park it.\" And that's why I call it a transformational innovation. It is not just technological, it is social innovation that we talk about.And that is where, ladies and gentlemen, this famous theme of getting more from less for more becomes important. I remember talking about this for the first time in Australia, about one and a half years ago, when their academy honored me with a fellowship. And unbelievably, in 40 years, I was the first Indian to be honored. And the title of my talk was therefore \"Indian innovation from Gandhi to Gandhian engineering.\" And I titled this more from less for more and more people as Gandhian engineering. And Gandhian engineering, in my judgment, is the one which is going to take the world forward, is going to make a difference, not just for a few, but for everyone. Let me move from mobility in a car to individual mobility for those unfortunates who have lost their legs. Here is an American citizen and his son having an artificial foot. What is its price? 20,000 dollars. And of course, these feet are so designed that they can walk only on such perfect pavement or roads.Unfortunately, that's not the case in India. You can see him walk barefoot on an awkward land, sometimes in a marshy land, and so on and so forth. More importantly, they not only walk far to work, and not only do they cycle to work, but they cycle for work, as you can see here. And they climb up for their work. You have to design an artificial foot for such conditions. A challenge, of course. Four billion people, their incomes are less then two dollars a day. And if you talk about a 20,000-dollar shoe, you're talking about 10,000 days of income. You just don't have it. And therefore, you ought to look at alternatives.And that is how Jaipur Foot was created in India. It had a revolutionary prosthetic fitment and delivery system, a quick molding and modular components, enabling custom-made, on-the-spot limb fitments. You could feel it actually in an hour, by the way, whereas the equivalent other feet took something like a day, as so on. Outer socket made by using heated high-density polyethylene pipes, rather than using heated sheets. And unique high-ankle design and human-like looks, [unclear] and functions. And I like to show how it looks and how it works. (Music) See, he jumps. You can see what stress it must have.(Text: ... any person with a below the knee limb could do this. ... above the limb, yes, it would be difficult ... \"Did it hurt?\" \"No ... not at all.\" ... he can run a kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds ...)One kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds. (Applause) So that's what it is all about. And therefore Time took notice of this 28-dollar foot, basically. (Applause) An incredible story.Let's move on to something else. I've been talking about getting more from less for more. Let's move to health. We've talked about mobility and the rest of it, let's talk about health. What's happening in the area of health? You know, you have new diseases that require new drugs. And if you look at the drug development 10 years ago and now, what has happened? 10 years ago, it used to cost about a quarter billion. Today it costs 1.5 billion dollars. Time taken for moving a molecule to marketplace, after all the human and animal testing, was 10 years, now it is 15 years. Are you getting more drugs because you are spending more time and more money? No, I'm sorry. We used to have 40, now they have come down to 30. So actually we are getting less from more for less and less people. Why less and less people? Because it is so expensive, so very few will be able to basically afford that.Let us just take an example. Psoriasis is very dreadful disease of the skin. The cost of treatment, 20,000 dollars. 1,000-dollar antibody injections under the skin, by the way, and 20 of them. Time for development \u2014 it took around 10 years and 700 million dollars. Let's start in the spirit of more from less and more for more and start putting some targets. For example, we don't want 20,000 dollars; we don't have it. Can we do it [for] 100 dollars? Time for development, not 10 years. We are in a hurry. Five years. Cost of development \u2014 300 million dollars. Sorry. I can't spend more than 10 million dollars. Looks absolutely audacious. Looks absolutely ridiculous.You know something? This has been achieved in India. These targets have been achieved in India. And how they have been achieved ... Sir Francis Bacon once said, \"When you wish to achieve results that have not been achieved before, it is an unwise fancy to think that they can be achieved by using methods that have been used before.\" And therefore, the standard process, where you develop a molecule, put it into mice, into men, are not yielding those results \u2014 the billions of dollars that have been spent. The Indian cleverness was using its traditional knowledge, however, scientifically validating it and making that journey from men to mice to men, not molecule to mice to men, you know. And that is how this difference has come. And you can see this blending of traditional medicine, modern medicine, modern science. I launched a big program [unclear] CSIR about nine years ago. He is giving us not just for Psoriasis, for cancer and a whole range of things, changing the whole paradigm. And you can see this Indian Psoriasis breakthrough obtained by this reverse form of [unclear] by doing things differently. You can see before treatment and after treatment. This is really getting more from less for more and more people, because these are all affordable treatments now.Let me just remind you of what Mahatma Gandhi had said. He had said, \"Earth provides enough to satisfy every man's need, but not every man's greed.\" So the message he was giving us was you must get more from less and less and less so that you can share it for more and more people, not only the current generation, but the future generations. And he also said, \"I would prize every invention of science made for the benefit for all.\" So he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people, not just a few people. And therefore, ladies and gentlemen, this is the theme, getting more from less for more. And mind you, it is not getting just a little more for just a little less. It's not about low cost. It's about ultra-low cost. You cannot say it's a mere treatment 10,000 dollars, but because you are poor I'll give it for 9,000. Sorry, it doesn't work. You have to give it for 100 dollars, 200 dollars. Is it possible? It has been made possible, by the way, for certain other different reasons. So you are not talking about low cost, you are talking about ultra-low cost. You are not talking about affordability, you are talking about extreme affordability. Because of the four billion people whose income is under two dollars a day. You're not talking exclusive innovation. You're talking about inclusive innovation. And therefore, you're not talking about incremental innovation, you're talking about disruptive innovation. The ideas have to be such that you think in completely different terms. And I would also add, it is not only getting more from less for more by more and more people, the whole world working for it.I was very touched when I saw a breakthrough the other day. You know, incubators for infants, for example. They're not available in Africa. They're not available in Indian villages. And infants die. And incubator costs 2,000 dollars. And there's a 25-dollar incubator giving that performance that had been created. And by whom? By young students from Standford University on an extreme affordability project that they had, basically. Their heart is in the right place, like Ratan Tata. It's not just innovation, compassion and passion \u2014 compassion in the heart and passion in the belly. That's the new world that we want to create. And that is why the message is that of Gandhian engineering.Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to end before time. I was also afraid of those 18 minutes. I've still one and a half to go. The message, the final message, is this: India gave a great gift to the world. What was that? [In the] 20th century, we gave Gandhi to the world. The 21st century gift, which is very, very important for the whole world, whether it is global economic meltdown, whether it is climate change \u2014 any problem that you talk about is gaining more from less for more and more \u2014 not only the current generations, for the future generations. And that can come only from Gandhian engineering. So ladies and gentlemen, I'm very happy to announce, this gift of the 21st century to the world from India, Gandhian engineering.(Applause)Lakshmi Pratury: Thank you, Dr. Mashelkar. (R.A. Mashelkar: Thank you very much.)LP: A quick question for you. Now, when you were a young boy in this school, what were your thoughts, like what did you think you could become? What do you think that drove you? Was there a vision you had? What is it that drove you?RAM: I'll tell you a story that drove me, that transformed my life. I remember, I went to a poor school, because my mother could not gather the 21 rupees, that half a dollar that was required within the stipulated time. It was [unclear] high school. But it was a poor school with rich teachers, honestly. And one of them was [unclear] who taught us physics. One day he took us out into the sun and tried to show us how to find the focal length of a convex lens. The lens was here. The piece of paper was there. He moved it up and down. And there was a bright spot up there. And then he said, \"This is the focal length.\" But then he held it for a little while, Lakshmi. And then the paper burned. When the paper burned, for some reason he turned to me, and he said, \"Mashelkar, like this, if you do not diffuse your energies, if you focus your energies, you can achieve anything in the world.\" That gave me a great message: focus and you can achieve. I said, \"Whoa, science is so wonderful, I have to become a scientist.\" But more importantly, focus and you can achieve. And that message, very frankly, is valuable for society today.What does that focal length do? It has parallel lines, which are sun rays. And the property of parallel lines is that they never meet. What does that convex lens do? It makes them meet. This is convex lens leadership. You know what today's leadership is doing? Concave length. They divide them farther. So I learned the lesson of convex lens leadership from that. And when I was at National Chemical Laboratory [unclear]. When I was at Council of Scientific Industry Research \u2014 40 laboratories \u2014 when two laboratories were not talking to each other, I would [unclear]. And currently I'm president of Global Research Alliance, 60,000 scientists in nine counties, right from India to the U.S. I'm trying to build a global team, which will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing. That was the lesson. That was the inspirational moment.LP: Thank you very much.

always value for money.\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nAll the time we are trying to get value for money.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nWhat we don't look for\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nis value for many,\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nwhile we are generating value for money.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nDo we care about those four billion people\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nwhose income levels are less than two dollars a day,\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nthe so-called bottom of the pyramid?\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nWhat are the challenges in getting value for money\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nas well as value for many?\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nWe have described here\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nin terms of the performance\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nand the price.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nIf you have money, of course, you can get the value.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nYou can get a Mercedes\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nfor a very high price,\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nvery high performance.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nBut if you don't have money, what happens?\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nWell, you are to ride a bicycle,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\ncarrying your own weight and also some other weight,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nso that you can earn the bread for the day.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nWell, poor do not remain poor;\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nthey become lower-middle-class.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nAnd if they do so,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nthen, of course, the conditions improve,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nand they start riding on scooters.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nBut the challenge is, again, they don't get much value,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nbecause they can't afford anything more than the scooter.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nThe issue is, at that price,\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.958\ncan you give them some extra value?\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nA super value,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nin terms of their ability to ride in a car,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nto get that dignity, to get that safety,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nlooks practically impossible, isn't it.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nNow, this is something\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nthat we see on Indian streets\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nall the time.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nBut many people see the same thing\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nand think things differently,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nand one of them is here, Ratan Tata.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nThe great thing about our leaders\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nis that, should they not only have passion in their belly,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nwhich practically all of them have,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nthey're also very innovative.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nAn innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nThey believe that things can be done.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nBut great leaders like Ratan\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nhave compassion.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nAnd what you said, Lakshmi, is absolutely true:\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nit's not just Ratan Tata,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nit's the house of Tatas over time.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nLet me confirm what she said.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nYes, I went barefoot\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nuntil I was 12.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nI struggled to [unclear] day\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nwas a huge issue.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nAnd when I finished my SSC, the eleventh standard,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nI stood eleventh among 125,000 students.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nBut I was about to leave the school,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nbecause my poor mother couldn't afford schooling.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nAnd it was [unclear] Tata Trust, which gave me six rupees per month,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nalmost a dollar per month for six years.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nThat's how I'm standing before you.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nSo that is the House of Tata.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nInnovation, compassion and passion.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nThey combine all that.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nAnd it was that compassion which bothered them,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nbecause when he saw -- in fact, he told me about eight or nine years ago\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nhow he was driving his own car --\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nhe drives his own car by the way --\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nand he saw in the rain,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\na family like the one that I showed to you\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\ngetting drenched with an infant.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nAnd then he said, \"Well, I must give them a car that they can afford,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\none lakh car, $2,000 car.\"\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nOf course, as soon as you say something like this\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\npeople say it is impossible,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nand that's what was said by Suzuki.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nHe said, oh, probably he is going to build a three-wheeler\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nwith stepney.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nAnd you can see the cartoon here.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nWell they didn't build that. They built a proper car. Nano.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nAnd mind you, I'm six feet half an inch,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nRatan is taller than me,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nand we have ample space in the front\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nand ample space in the back in this particular car.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nAnd incredible car.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nAnd of course, nothing succeeds like success;\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nthe cynics then turned around,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nand one after the other\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nthey also started saying, \"Yes, we also want to make a car in the Nano Segment.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nWe'll manufacture a car in the Nano Segment.\"\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nHow did this great story unfold,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nthe making of Nano?\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nLet me tell you a bit about it.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nFor example, how we started:\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nRatan just began with a five-engineer team,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nyoung people in their mid-twenties.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nAnd he said,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\n\"Well, I won't define the vehicle for you,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nbut I will define the cost for you.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nIt is one lakh, 100,000 rupees,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nand you are to make it within that.\"\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nAnd he told them,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\n\"Question the unquestionable.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nStretch the envelope.\"\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nAnd at a point in time,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nhe got so engrossed in the whole challenge,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nthat he himself became a member of the team.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nCan you believe it?\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nI still am told about this story\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nof that single wiper design in which he participated.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nUntil midnight, he'd be thinking.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nEarly morning he'll be coming back with sort of solutions.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nBut who was the team leader?\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nThe team leader was Girish Wagh,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\na 34 year-old boy in [unclear].\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nAnd the Nano team average age\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nwas just 27 years.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nAnd they did innovation in design and beyond.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nBroke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nFor example, that a two-cylinder gas engine\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nwas used in a car with a single balancer shaft.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nAdhesives were replacing the rivets.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nThere was a co-creation, a huge co-creation,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nwith vendors and suppliers.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nAll ideas on board were welcome.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\n100 vendors were co-located adjacent to the plant,\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nand innovative business models for automobile dealerships were developed.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nImagine that a fellow\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nwho sells cloth, for example, will be selling Nano.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nI mean, it was incredible innovation.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nSeeking solutions for non-auto sectors.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nIt was an open innovation,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nideas from all over were welcome.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nThe mechanism of helicopters seats and windows was used, by the way,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nas well as a dashboard\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nthat was inspired by two-wheelers.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nThe fuel lines and lamps\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nwere as in two-wheelers.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nAnd the crux of the matter was, however,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\ngetting more from less.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nAll the time, you have been given an envelope.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nYou can't cross that envelope,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nwhich is 100,000 rupees, 2,000 dollars.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nAnd therefore, each component\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nhad to have a dual functionality.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nAnd the seat riser, for example,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nserving as a mounting for the seat\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nas well as a structural part\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nof the functional rigidity.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nHalf the number of parts\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nare contained in Nano\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nin comparison to a typical passenger car.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nThe length is smaller by eight percent by the way.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nBut the current entry-level cars\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nin comparison to that is eight percent less,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nbut 21 percent more inside space.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nAnd what happened\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nwas that -- more from less --\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nyou can see how much more for how much less.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nWhen the Model T was launched --\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nand this is, by the way, all the figures\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nthat are adjusted to 2007 dollar prices --\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nModel T was 19,700 by Ford.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nVolkswagon was 11,333.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nAnd British Motor was around 11,000.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nAnd Nano was, bang, 2,000 dollars.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nThis is why\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nyou started\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nactually a new paradigm shift,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nwhere the same people\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nwho could not dream of sitting in a car,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nwho were carrying their entire family in a scooter,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nstarted dreaming of being in a car.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAnd those dreams are getting fulfilled.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nThis is a photograph\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nof a house and a driver and a car\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nnear my own home.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nThe driver's name is Naran.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nHe has bought his own Nano.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nAnd you can see, there is a physical space\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nthat has been created for him,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nparking that car, along with the owner's car,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nbut more importantly, they've created\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\na space in their mind that\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\n\"Yes, my chauffeur is going to come in his own car and park it.\"\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAnd that's why I call it a transformational innovation.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nIt is not just technological,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nit is social innovation that we talk about.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nAnd that is where, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nthis famous theme\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nof getting more from less for more\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nbecomes important.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nI remember talking about this for the first time in Australia,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nabout one and a half years ago,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nwhen their academy honored me with a fellowship.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nAnd unbelievably, in 40 years,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nI was the first Indian to be honored.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nAnd the title of my talk\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nwas therefore \"Indian innovation\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nfrom Gandhi to Gandhian engineering.\"\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nAnd I titled this more from less for more and more people\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nas Gandhian engineering.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nAnd Gandhian engineering, in my judgment,\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nis the one which is going to take the world forward,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nis going to make a difference,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nnot just for a few, but for everyone.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nLet me move from mobility in a car to individual mobility\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nfor those unfortunates\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nwho have lost their legs.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nHere is an American citizen and his son\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nhaving an artificial foot.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nWhat is its price? 20,000 dollars.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nAnd of course, these feet are so designed\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nthat they can walk only on\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nsuch perfect pavement or roads.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nUnfortunately, that's not the case in India.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nYou can see him walk barefoot\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\non an awkward land, sometimes in a marshy land,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nand so on and so forth.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nMore importantly,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nthey not only walk far to work,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nand not only do they cycle to work,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nbut they cycle for work, as you can see here.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nAnd they climb up for their work.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nYou have to design an artificial foot for such conditions.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nA challenge, of course.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nFour billion people, their incomes are less then two dollars a day.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nAnd if you talk about a 20,000-dollar shoe,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nyou're talking about 10,000 days of income.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nYou just don't have it.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nAnd therefore, you ought to look at alternatives.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nAnd that is how Jaipur Foot was created in India.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nIt had a revolutionary prosthetic fitment and delivery system,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\na quick molding and modular components,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nenabling custom-made, on-the-spot limb fitments.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nYou could feel it actually in an hour, by the way,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nwhereas the equivalent other feet\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\ntook something like a day, as so on.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nOuter socket made by using heated high-density polyethylene pipes,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nrather than using heated sheets.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nAnd unique high-ankle design and human-like looks,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\n[unclear] and functions.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nAnd I like to show how it looks\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nand how it works.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:33.958\n(Music)\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nSee, he jumps. You can see what stress it must have.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\n(Text: ... any person with a below the knee limb could do this.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\n... above the limb, yes, it would be difficult ...\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\n\"Did it hurt?\"\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\n\"No ... not at all.\"\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\n... he can run a kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds ...)\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nOne kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:06.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nSo that's what it is all about.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nAnd therefore Time took notice\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nof this 28-dollar foot, basically.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nAn incredible story.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nLet's move on to something else.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nI've been talking about getting more from less for more.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nLet's move to health.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nWe've talked about mobility and the rest of it, let's talk about health.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nWhat's happening in the area of health?\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nYou know, you have new diseases that require new drugs.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nAnd if you look at the drug development 10 years ago and now,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nwhat has happened?\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\n10 years ago, it used to cost about a quarter billion.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nToday it costs 1.5 billion dollars.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nTime taken for moving a molecule to marketplace,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nafter all the human and animal testing,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nwas 10 years, now it is 15 years.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nAre you getting more drugs because you are spending more time and more money?\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nNo, I'm sorry.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nWe used to have 40, now they have come down to 30.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nSo actually we are getting less from more\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nfor less and less people.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nWhy less and less people? Because it is so expensive,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nso very few will be able to basically afford that.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nLet us just take an example.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nPsoriasis is very dreadful\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\ndisease of the skin.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nThe cost of treatment, 20,000 dollars.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\n1,000-dollar antibody injections under the skin, by the way,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nand 20 of them.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nTime for development -- it took around 10 years\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nand 700 million dollars.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nLet's start in the spirit\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nof more from less and more for more\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nand start putting some targets.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nFor example, we don't want 20,000 dollars; we don't have it.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nCan we do it [for] 100 dollars?\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nTime for development, not 10 years.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nWe are in a hurry.

And basically, what I'd like to tell you is that power is changing, and there are two types of changes I want to discuss. One is power transition, which is change of power amongst states. And there the simple version of the message is it's moving from West to East. The other is power diffusion, the way power is moving from all states West or East to non-state actors. Those two things are the huge shifts of power in our century. And I want to tell you about them each separately and then how they interact and why, in the end, there may be some good news.When we talk about power transition, we often talk about the rise of Asia. It really should be called the recovery or return of Asia. If we looked at the world in 1800, you'd find that more than half of the world's people lived in Asia and they made more than half the world's product. Now fast forward to 1900: half the world's people \u2014 more than half \u2014 still live in Asia, but they're now making only a fifth of the world's product. What happened? The Industrial Revolution, which meant that all of a sudden, Europe and America became the dominant center of the world. What we're going to see in the 21st century is Asia gradually returning to being more than half of the world's population and more than half of the world's product. That's important and it's an important shift. But let me tell you a little bit about the other shift that I'm talking about, which is power diffusion.To understand power diffusion put this in your mind: computing and communications costs have fallen a thousandfold between 1970 and the beginning of this century. Now that's a big abstract number. But to make it more real, if the price of an automobile had fallen as rapidly as the price of computing power, you could buy a car today for five dollars. Now when the price of any technology declines that dramatically, the barriers to entry go down. Anybody can play in the game. So in 1970, if you wanted to communicate from Oxford to Johannesburg to New Delhi to Brasilia and anywhere simultaneously, you could do it. The technology was there. But to be able to do it, you had to be very rich \u2014 a government, a multinational corporation, maybe the Catholic Church \u2014 but you had to be pretty wealthy. Now, anybody has that capacity, which previously was restricted by price just to a few actors. If they have the price of entry into an Internet cafe \u2014 the last time I looked, it was something like a pound an hour \u2014 and if you have Skype, it's free. So capabilities that were once restricted are now available to everyone. And what that meansis not that the age of the State is over. The State still matters. But the stage is crowded. The State's not alone. There are many, many actors. Some of that's good: Oxfam, a great non-governmental actor. Some of it's bad: Al Qaeda, another non-governmental actor. But think of what it does to how we think in traditional terms and concepts. We think in terms of war and interstate war. And you can think back to 1941 when the government of Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor. It's worth noticing that a non-state actor attacking the United States in 2001 killed more Americans than the government of Japan did in 1941. You might think of that as the privatization of war. So we're seeing a great change in terms of diffusion of power.Now the problem is that we're not thinking about it in very innovative ways. So let me step back and ask: what's power? Power is simple the ability to affect others to get the outcomes you want, and you can do it in three ways. You can do it with threats of coercion, \"sticks,\" you can do it with payments, \"carrots,\" or you can do it by getting others to want what you want. And that ability to get others to want what you want, to get the outcomes you want without coercion or payment, is what I call soft power. And that soft power has been much neglected and much misunderstood, and yet it's tremendously important. Indeed, if you can learn to use more soft power, you can save a lot on carrots and sticks. Traditionally, the way people thought about power was primarily in terms of military power. For example, the great Oxford historian who taught here at this university, A.J.P. Taylor, defined a great power as a country able to prevail in war. But we need a new narrative if we're to understand power in the 21st century. It's not just prevailing at war, though war still persists. It's not whose army wins; it's also whose story wins. And we have to think much more in terms of narratives and whose narrative is going to be effective.Now let me go back to the question of power transition between states and what's happening there. the narratives that we use now tend to be the rise and fall of the great powers. And the current narrative is all about the rise of China and the decline of the United States. Indeed, with the 2008 financial crisis, many people said this was the beginning of the end of American power. The tectonic plates of world politics were shifting. And president Medvedev of Russia, for example, pronounced in 2008 this was the beginning of the end of United States power. But in fact, this metaphor of decline is often very misleading. If you look at history, in recent history, you'll see the cycles of belief in American decline come and go every 10 or 15 years or so. In 1958, after the Soviets put up Sputnik, it was \"That's the end of America.\" In 1973, with the oil embargo and the closing of the gold window, that was the end of America. In the 1980s, as America went through a transition in the Reagan period, between the rust belt economy of the midwest to the Silicon Valley economy of California, that was the end of America. But in fact, what we've seen is none of those were true. Indeed, people were over-enthusiastic in the early 2000s, thinking America could do anything, which led us into some disastrous foreign policy adventures, and now we're back to decline again.The moral of this story is all these narratives about rise and fall and decline tell us a lot more about psychology than they do about reality. If we try to focus on the reality, then what we need to focus on is what's really happening in terms of China and the United States. Goldman Sachs has projected that China, the Chinese economy, will surpass that of the U.S. by 2027. So we've got, what, 17 more years to go or so before China's bigger. Now someday, with a billion point three people getting richer, they are going to be bigger than the United States. But be very careful about these projections such as the Goldman Sachs projection as though that gives you an accurate picture of power transition in this century. Let me mention three reasons why it's too simple. First of all, it's a linear projection. You know, everything says, here's the growth rate of China, here's the growth rate of the U.S., here it goes \u2014 straight line. History is not linear. There are often bumps along the road, accidents along the way. The second thing is that the Chinese economy passes the U.S. economy in, let's say, 2030, which it may it, that will be a measure of total economic size, but not of per capita income \u2014 won't tell you about the composition of the economy. China still has large areas of underdevelopment and per capita income is a better measure of the sophistication of the economy. And that the Chinese won't catch up or pass the Americans until somewhere in the latter part, after 2050, of this century.The other point that's worth noticing is how one-dimensional this projection is. You know, it looks at economic power measured by GDP. Doesn't tell you much about military power, doesn't tell you very much about soft power. It's all very one-dimensional. And also, when we think about the rise of Asia, or return of Asia as I called it a little bit earlier, it's worth remembering Asia's not one thing. If you're sitting in Japan, or in New Delhi, or in Hanoi, your view of the rise of China is a little different than if you're sitting in Beijing. Indeed, one of the advantages that the Americans will have in terms of power in Asia is all those countries want an American insurance policy against the rise of China. It's as though Mexico and Canada were hostile neighbors to the United States, which they're not. So these simple projections of the Goldman Sachs type are not telling us what we need to know about power transition.But you might ask, well so what in any case? Why does it matter? Who cares? Is this just a game that diplomats and academics play? The answer is it matters quite a lot. Because, if you believe in decline and you get the answers wrong on this, the facts, not the myths, you may have policies which are very dangerous. Let me give you an example from history. The Peloponnesian War was the great conflict in which the Greek city state system tore itself apart two and a half millennia ago. What caused it? Thucydides, the great historian of the the Peloponnesian War, said it was the rise in the power of Athens and the fear it created in Sparta. Notice both halves of that explanation.Many people argue that the 21st century is going to repeat the 20th century, in which World War One, the great conflagration in which the European state system tore itself apart and destroyed its centrality in the world, that that was caused by the rise in the power of Germany and the fear it created in Britain. So there are people who are telling us this is going to be reproduced today, that what we're going to see is the same thing now in this century. No, I think that's wrong. It's bad history. For one thing, Germany had surpassed Britain in industrial strength by 1900. And as I said earlier, China has not passed the United States. But also, if you have this belief and it creates a sense of fear, it leads to overreaction. And the greatest danger we have of managing this power transition of the shift toward the East is fear. To paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt from a different context, the greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself. We don't have to fear the rise of China or the return of Asia. And if we have policies in which we take it in that larger historical perspective, we're going to be able to manage this process.Let me say a word now about the distribution of power and how it relates to power diffusion and then pull these two types together. If you ask how is power distributed in the world today, it's distributed much like a three-dimensional chess game. Top board: military power among states. The United States is the only superpower, and it's likely to remain that way for two or three decades. China's not going to replace the U.S. on this military board. Middle board of this three-dimensional chess game: economic power among states. Power is multi-polar. There are balancers \u2014 the U.S., Europe, China, Japan can balance each other. The bottom board of this three-dimensional, the board of transnational relations, things that cross borders outside the control of governments, things like climate change, drug trade, financial flows, pandemics, all these things that cross borders outside the control of governments, there nobody's in charge. It makes no sense to call this unipolar or multi-polar. Power is chaotically distributed. And the only way you can solve these problems \u2014 and this is where many greatest challenges are coming in this century \u2014 is through cooperation, through working together, which means that soft power becomes more important, that ability to organize networks to deal with these kinds of problems and to be able to get cooperation.Another way of putting it is that as we think of power in the 21st century, we want to get away from the idea that power's always zero sum \u2014 my gain is your loss and vice versa. Power can also be positive sum, where your gain can be my gain. If China develops greater energy security and greater capacity to deal with its problems of carbon emissions, that's good for us as well as good for China as well as good for everybody else. So empowering China to deal with its own problems of carbon is good for everybody, and it's not a zero sum, I win, you lose. It's one in which we can all gain. So as we think about power in this century, we want to get away from this view that it's all I win, you lose. Now I don't mean to be Pollyannaish about this. Wars persist. Power persists. Military power is important. Keeping balances is important. All this still persists. Hard power is there, and it will remain. But unless you learn how to mix hard power with soft power into strategies that I call smart power, you're not going to deal with the new kinds of problems that we're facing.So the key question that we need to think about as we look at this is how do we work together to produce global public goods, things from which all of us can benefit? How do we define our national interests so that it's not just zero sum, but positive sum. In that sense, if we define our interests, for example, for the United States the way Britain defined its interests in the 19th century, keeping an open trading system, keeping a monetary stability, keeping freedom of the seas \u2014 those were good for Britain, they were good for others as well. And in the 21st century, you have to do an analog to that. How do we produce global public goods, which are good for us, but good for everyone at the same time? And that's going to be the good news dimension of what we need to think about as we think of power in the 21st century.There are ways to define our interests in which, while protecting ourselves with hard power, we can organize with others in networks to produce, not only public goods, but ways that will enhance our soft power. So if one looks at the statements that have been made about this, I am impressed that when Hillary Clinton described the foreign policy of the Obama administration, she said that the foreign policy of the Obama administration was going to be smart power, as she put it, \"using all the tools in our foreign policy tool box.\" And if we're going to deal with these two great power shifts that I've described, the power shift represented by transition among states, the power shift represented by diffusion of power away from all states, we're going to have to develop a new narrative of power in which we combine hard and soft power into strategies of smart power. And that's the good news I have. We can do that.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 992, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nI'm going to talk to you\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nabout power in this 21st century.\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nAnd basically, what I'd like to tell you\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nis that power is changing,\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nand there are two types of changes\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nI want to discuss.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nOne is power transition,\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nwhich is change of power amongst states.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nAnd there the simple version of the message\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nis it's moving from West to East.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nThe other is power diffusion,\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nthe way power is moving\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nfrom all states West or East\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nto non-state actors.\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nThose two things\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nare the huge shifts of power\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nin our century.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nAnd I want to tell you about them each separately\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nand then how they interact\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nand why, in the end, there may be some good news.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nWhen we talk about power transition,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nwe often talk about the rise of Asia.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nIt really should be called\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nthe recovery or return of Asia.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nIf we looked at the world\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nin 1800,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nyou'd find that more than half of the world's people\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nlived in Asia\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nand they made more than half the world's product.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nNow fast forward to 1900:\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nhalf the world's people -- more than half -- still live in Asia,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nbut they're now making\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nonly a fifth of the world's product.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nWhat happened?

we have to think much more in terms of narratives\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nand whose narrative is going to be effective.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nNow let me go back\n\n00:06:21.958

powers.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nAnd the current narrative is all about\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nthe rise of China\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nand the decline of the United States.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nIndeed, with the 2008 financial crisis,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nmany people said this was\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nthe beginning of the end of American power.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nThe tectonic plates\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nof world politics were shifting.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nAnd president Medvedev of Russia, for example,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\npronounced in 2008\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nthis was the beginning of the end\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nof United States power.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nBut in fact,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nthis metaphor of decline\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nis often very misleading.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nIf you look at history, in recent history,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nyou'll see the cycles of belief\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nin American decline\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\ncome and go every 10 or 15 years or so.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nIn 1958,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nafter the Soviets put up Sputnik,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nit was \"That's the end of America.\"\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nIn 1973, with the oil embargo\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nand the closing of the gold window,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nthat was the end of America.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nIn the 1980s,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nas America went through a transition in the Reagan period,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nbetween the rust belt economy of the midwest\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nto the Silicon Valley economy of California,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nthat was the end of America.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nBut in fact, what we've seen\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nis none of those were true.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nIndeed, people were over-enthusiastic\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nin the early 2000s,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nthinking America could do anything,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nwhich led us into some disastrous\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nforeign policy adventures,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nand now we're back to decline again.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nThe moral of this story\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nis all these narratives about rise and fall and decline\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\ntell us a lot more about psychology\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nthan they do about reality.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nIf we try to focus on the reality,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nthen what we need to focus on\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nis what's really happening\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nin terms of China and the United States.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nGoldman Sachs has projected\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nthat China, the Chinese economy,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nwill surpass that of the U.S.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nby 2027.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nSo we've got, what,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\n17 more years to go or so\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nbefore China's bigger.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nNow someday,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nwith a billion point three people getting richer,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nthey are going to be bigger than the United States.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nBut be very careful about these projections\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nsuch as the Goldman Sachs projection\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nas though that gives you an accurate picture\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nof power transition in this century.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nLet me mention three reasons why it's too simple.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nFirst of all, it's a linear projection.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nYou know, everything says,\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nhere's the growth rate of China, here's the growth rate of the U.S.,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nhere it goes -- straight line.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nHistory is not linear.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nThere are often bumps along the road, accidents along the way.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nThe second thing is\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nthat the Chinese economy\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\npasses the U.S. economy in, let's say, 2030,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nwhich it may it,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nthat will be a measure of total economic size,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nbut not of per capita income --\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nwon't tell you about the composition of the economy.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nChina still has large areas\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nof underdevelopment\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nand per capita income is a better measure\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nof the sophistication of the economy.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nAnd that the Chinese won't catch up or pass the Americans\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nuntil somewhere in the latter part,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nafter 2050, of this century.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nThe other point that's worth noticing\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nis how one-dimensional\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nthis projection is.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nYou know, it looks at economic power\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nmeasured by GDP.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nDoesn't tell you much about military power,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\ndoesn't tell you very much about soft power.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nIt's all very one-dimensional.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nAnd also, when we think about the rise of Asia,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nor return of Asia\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nas I called it a little bit earlier,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nit's worth remembering Asia's not one thing.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nIf you're sitting in Japan,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nor in New Delhi,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nor in Hanoi,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nyour view of the rise of China\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nis a little different than if you're sitting in Beijing.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nIndeed, one of the advantages\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nthat the Americans will have\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nin terms of power in Asia\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nis all those countries\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nwant an American insurance policy\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nagainst the rise of China.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nIt's as though Mexico and Canada\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nwere hostile neighbors to the United States,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nwhich they're not.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nSo these simple projections\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nof the Goldman Sachs type\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nare not telling us what we need to know\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nabout power transition.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nBut you might ask, well so what in any case?\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nWhy does it matter? Who cares?\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nIs this just a game\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nthat diplomats and academics play?\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nThe answer is it matters quite a lot.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nBecause, if you believe in decline\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nand you get the answers wrong on this,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nthe facts, not the myths,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nyou may have policies which are very dangerous.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nLet me give you an example from history.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nThe Peloponnesian War\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nwas the great conflict\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nin which the Greek city state system\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\ntore itself apart\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\ntwo and a half millennia ago.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nWhat caused it?\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nThucydides, the great historian of the the Peloponnesian War,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nsaid it was the rise in the power of Athens\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nand the fear it created in Sparta.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nNotice both halves of that explanation.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nMany people argue\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nthat the 21st century\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nis going to repeat the 20th century,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nin which World War One,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nthe great conflagration\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nin which the European state system\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\ntore itself apart\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nand destroyed its centrality in the world,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nthat that was caused by\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nthe rise in the power of Germany\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand the fear it created in Britain.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nSo there are people who are telling us\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nthis is going to be reproduced today,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nthat what we're going to see\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nis the same thing now in this century.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nNo, I think that's wrong.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nIt's bad history.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nFor one thing, Germany had surpassed Britain\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nin industrial strength by 1900.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nAnd as I said earlier,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nChina has not passed the United States.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nBut also, if you have this belief\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nand it creates a sense of fear,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nit leads to overreaction.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nAnd the greatest danger we have\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nof managing this power transition\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nof the shift toward the East is fear.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nTo paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nfrom a different context,\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nthe greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nWe don't have to fear the rise of China\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nor the return of Asia.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nAnd if we have policies\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nin which we take it\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nin that larger historical perspective,\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nwe're going to be able\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nto manage this process.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nLet me say a word now\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nabout the distribution of power\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nand how it relates to power diffusion\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nand then pull these two types together.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nIf you ask how is power distributed in the world today,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nit's distributed much like\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\na three-dimensional chess game.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nTop board:\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nmilitary power among states.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nThe United States is the only superpower,\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nand it's likely to remain that way\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nfor two or three decades.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nChina's not going to replace the U.S. on this military board.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nMiddle board of this three-dimensional chess game:\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\neconomic power among states.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nPower is multi-polar.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nThere are balancers --\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nthe U.S., Europe,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nChina, Japan\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\ncan balance each other.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nThe bottom board of this three-dimensional,\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nthe board of transnational relations,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nthings that cross borders outside the control of governments,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nthings like climate change, drug trade,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nfinancial flows,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\npandemics,\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nall these things that cross borders\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\noutside the control of governments,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nthere nobody's in charge.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nIt makes no sense to call this unipolar\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nor multi-polar.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nPower is chaotically distributed.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nAnd the only way you can solve these problems --\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nand this is where many greatest challenges\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nare coming in this century --\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nis through cooperation,\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nthrough working together,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nwhich means that soft power becomes more important,\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nthat ability to organize networks\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nto deal with these kinds of problems\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nand to be able to get cooperation.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nAnother way of putting it\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nis that as we think of power in the 21st century,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nwe want to get away from the idea\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nthat power's always zero sum --\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nmy gain is your loss and vice versa.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nPower can also be positive sum,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nwhere your gain can be my gain.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nIf China develops greater energy security\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nand greater capacity\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nto deal with its problems of carbon emissions,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nthat's good for us\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nas well as good for China\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nas well as good for everybody else.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nSo empowering China\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nto deal with its own problems of carbon\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nis good for everybody,\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nand it's not a zero sum, I win, you lose.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nIt's one in which we can all gain.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nSo as we think about power\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nin this century,\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nwe want to get away from this view\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nthat it's all I win, you lose.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nNow I don't mean to be Pollyannaish about this.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nWars persist. Power persists.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nMilitary power is important.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nKeeping balances is important.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nAll this still persists.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nHard power is there,\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nand it will remain.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nBut unless you learn how to mix\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nhard power with soft power\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.958\ninto strategies that I call smart power,\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nyou're not going to deal with the new kinds of problems\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nthat we're facing.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nSo the key question that we need to think about as we look at this\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nis how do we work together\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nto produce global public goods,\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nthings from which all of us can benefit?\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nHow do we define our national interests\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nso that it's not just zero sum,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nbut positive sum.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nIn that sense, if we define our interests,\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nfor example, for the United States\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nthe way Britain defined its interests in the 19th century,\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nkeeping an open trading system,\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nkeeping a monetary stability, keeping freedom of the seas --\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nthose were good for Britain,\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nthey were good for others as well.\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nAnd in the 21st century, you have to do an analog to that.\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nHow do we produce global public goods,\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nwhich are good for us,\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nbut good for everyone at the same time?\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nAnd that's going to be the good news dimension\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nof what we need to think about\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nas we think of power in the 21st century.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nThere are ways to define our interests\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nin which, while protecting ourselves with hard power,\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nwe can organize with others in networks\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nto produce, not only public goods,\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nbut ways that will enhance our soft power.\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nSo if one looks at the statements\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nthat have been made about this,\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nI am impressed that when Hillary Clinton\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.958\ndescribed the foreign policy\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nof the Obama administration,\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nshe said that the foreign policy of the Obama administration\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nwas going to be smart power,\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nas she put it, \"using all the tools\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nin our foreign policy tool box.\"\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nAnd if we're going to deal\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nwith these two great power shifts that I've described,\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nthe power shift represented by transition among states,\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nthe power shift represented\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nby diffusion of power away from all states,\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:48.958\nwe're going to have to develop a new narrative of power\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nin which we combine hard and soft power\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:54.958\ninto strategies of smart power.\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nAnd that's the good news I have.

Let's get smart", "duration": "566", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/barton_seaver_sustainable_seafood_let_s_get_smart", "transcript": "Sustainability represents the what, the where and the how of what is caught. The who and the why are what's important to me. I want to know the people behind my dinner choices. I want to know how I impact them. I want to know how they impact me. I want to know why they fish. I want to know how they rely on the water's bounty for their living. Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem. It allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we're also so fortunate to eat.So what do we call this? I think we call it restorative seafood. Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain, restorative is the ability to replenish and progress. Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource, suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency. It is a more hopeful, it is a more human, and is a more useful way of understanding our environment.Wallet guides \u2014 standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world \u2014 are very handy; they're a wonderful tool. Green, yellow and red lists [of] seafood species. The association is very easy: buy green, don't buy red, think twice about yellow. But in my mind, it's really not enough to just eat green list. We can't sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red. But what if we eat only in the green list? You've got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here \u2014 comes from sustainable stocks. Pole caught \u2014 no bycatch. Great for fishermen. Lots of money. Supporting local economies. But it's a lion of the sea. It's a top predator.What's the context of this meal? Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this? Do I do this three times a week? I might still be in the green list, but I'm not doing myself, or you, or the oceans any favors. The point is that we have to have a context, a gauge for our actions in all this. Example: I've heard that red wine is great for my health \u2014 antioxidants and minerals \u2014 heart healthy. That's great! I love red wine! I'm going to drink so much of it. I'm going to be so healthy. Well, how many bottles is it before you tell me that I have a problem? Well folks, we have a protein problem. We have lost this sensibility when it regards our food, and we are paying a cost. The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves. We are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines. And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits.So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs. Restorative seafood might best be represented not by Jaws, or by Flipper, or the Gordon's fisherman, but rather, by the Jolly Green Giant. Vegetables: they might yet save the oceans. Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green. Well I'd like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue. We must continue to eat the best seafood possible, if at all. But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables. The best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half-shell with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges. It comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy, broiled breadcrumbs and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy, grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake. Whooo! This is an easy sell. And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart.Jamie Oliver is campaigning to save America from the way we eat. Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans from the way we eat. There's a pattern here. Forget nuclear holocaust; it's the fork that we have to worry about. We have ravaged our Earth and then used the food that we've sourced to handicap ourselves in more ways than one. So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong. And so I think it's time we change what we expect from our food. Sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand. So let's start there.There's been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems. Dan Barber and Alice Waters are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution. But green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters. Just because it comes from a green source doesn't mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate. We have eco-friendly shrimp. We can make them; we have that technology. But we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet. It doesn't work. Heart-healthy dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood. While we try to manage declining marine populations, the media's recommending increased consumption of seafood. Studies say that tens of thousands of American grandmothers, grandfathers, mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood. That's a reward I am not willing to pass up. But it's not all about the seafood. It's about the way that we look at our plates.As a chef, I realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate. A couple things happened. I made more money. People started buying appetizers and salads, because they knew they weren't going to fill up on the entrees alone. People spent more time engaging in their meals, engaging with each other over their meals. People got, in short, more of what they came there for even though they got less protein. They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal. They got healthier. I made more money. This is great. Environmental consideration was served with every plate, but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time.One of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served \u2014 small silverfish, anchovies, mackerel, sardines were uncommon. Shellfish, mussels, oysters, clams, tilapia, char \u2014 these were the common species. We were directing tastes towards more resilience, more restorative options. This is what we need to favor. This is what the green list says. But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment.But what of those big predators, those fashionable species, that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier? Well, if you must, I have a recipe for you. It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean, so here we go. Start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish. Get a knife. Cut it into four portions. Put it on four plates. Mound up those four plates with vegetables and then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have, light the candles and celebrate it. Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this. Invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year, maybe.I expect a lot from food. I expect health and joy and family and community. I expect that producing ingredients, preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests. I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook. And he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents. I remember well the meals of my childhood. They were reasonable portions of protein served with copious quantities of vegetables and small amounts of starch, usually rice. This is still how I largely eat today. I get sick when I go to steakhouses. I get the meat sweats. It's like a hangover from protein. It's disgusting. But of all the dire news that you'll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans, I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right. Eat your vegetables. It's pretty straightforward.So what are we looking for in a meal? Well for health, I'm looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body. For joy, I'm looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance. For family, I'm looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories. For community though, we start at the very beginning. There's no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact. So try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it. We've seen an image of our blue planet, our world bank. But it is more than just a repository of our resources; it's also the global geography of the communion we call dinner. So if we all take only what we need, then we can begin to share the rest, we can begin to celebrate, we can begin to restore. We need to savor vegetables. We need to savor smaller portions of seafood. And we need to save dinner.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 993, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nSustainability represents\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nthe what, the where and the how\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nof what is caught.\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nThe who and the why are what's important to me.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nI want to know the people behind my dinner choices.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nI want to know how I impact them.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nI want to know how they impact me.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nI want to know why they fish.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nI want to know how they rely on the water's bounty\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nfor their living.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nUnderstanding all of this enables us\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nto shift our perception of seafood\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\naway from a commodity\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nto an opportunity\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nto restore our ecosystem.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nIt allows for us to celebrate the seafood\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nthat we're also so fortunate to eat.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nSo what do we call this?\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nI think we call it restorative seafood.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nWhere sustainability is the capacity\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nto endure and maintain,\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nrestorative is the ability to replenish and progress.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nRestorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nand acknowledges our relationship with the ocean\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nas a resource,\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nsuggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nand to encourage its resiliency.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nIt is a more hopeful, it is a more human,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nand is a more useful way of understanding our environment.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nWallet guides -- standard issue\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nby lots in the marine conservation world --\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nare very handy; they're a wonderful tool.\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nGreen, yellow and red lists [of] seafood species.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nThe association is very easy: buy green, don't buy red,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nthink twice about yellow.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nBut in my mind, it's really not enough\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nto just eat green list.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nWe can't sustain this without the measure of our success\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nreally changing the fate of the species\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nin the yellow and the red.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nBut what if we eat only in the green list?\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nYou've got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here --\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\ncomes from sustainable stocks.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nPole caught -- no bycatch.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nGreat for fishermen.

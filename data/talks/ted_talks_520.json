Two years ago, I stood on the TED stage in Arusha, Tanzania. I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations. It was a simple machine that changed my life.Before that time, I had never been away from my home in Malawi. I had never used a computer. I had never seen an Internet. On the stage that day, I was so nervous. My English lost, I wanted to vomit. (Laughter) I had never been surrounded by so many azungu, white people. (Laughter)There was a story I wouldn't tell you then. But well, I'm feeling good right now. I would like to share that story today. We have seven children in my family. All sisters, excepting me. This is me with my dad when I was a little boy. Before I discovered the wonders of science, I was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers. Like everyone else, we grew maize.One year our fortune turned very bad. In 2001 we experienced an awful famine. Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death. My family ate one meal per day, at night. Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us. The food passes through our bodies. We drop down to nothing.In Malawi, the secondary school, you have to pay school fees. Because of the hunger, I was forced to drop out of school. I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields. It was the future I couldn't accept.I felt very happy to be at the secondary school, so I was determined to do anything possible to receive education. So I went to a library. I read books, science books, especially physics. I couldn't read English that well. I used diagrams and pictures to learn the words around them.Another book put that knowledge in my hands. It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity. Pump water meant irrigation, a defense against hunger, which we were experiencing by that time. So I decided I would build one windmill for myself. But I didn't have materials to use, so I went to a scrap yard where I found my materials. Many people, including my mother, said I was crazy. (Laughter)I found a tractor fan, shock absorber, PVC pipes. Using a bicycle frame and an old bicycle dynamo, I built my machine. It was one light at first. And then four lights, with switches, and even a circuit breaker, modeled after an electric bell. Another machine pumps water for irrigation.Queues of people start lining up at my house (Laughter) to charge their mobile phone. (Applause) I could not get rid of them. (Laughter) And the reporters came too, which lead to bloggers and which lead to a call from something called TED. I had never seen an airplane before. I had never slept in a hotel. So, on stage that day in Arusha, my English lost, I said something like, \"I tried. And I made it.\"So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans, and the poor who are struggling with your dreams. God bless. Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet. I say to you, trust yourself and believe. Whatever happens, don't give up. Thank you.

It involves a campaign of letter writing, research and phone calls to access my subjects, which can range from Hamas leaders in Gaza to a hibernating black bear in its cave in West Virginia. And oddly, the most notable letter of rejection I ever received came from Walt Disney World, a seemingly innocuous site.And it read \u2014 I'm just going to read a key sentence: \"Especially during these violent times, I personally believe that the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks is particularly important to protect and helps to provide them with an important fantasy they can escape to.\"Photography threatens fantasy. They didn't want to let my camera in because it confronts constructed realities, myths and beliefs, and provides what appears to be evidence of a truth. But there are multiple truths attached to every image, depending on the creator's intention, the viewer and the context in which it is presented.Over a five year period following September 11th, when the American media and government were seeking hidden and unknown sites beyond its borders, most notably weapons of mass destruction, I chose to look inward at that which was integral to America's foundation, mythology and daily functioning. I wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen, self-imposed and real, and confront the divide between privileged and public access to knowledge.It was a critical moment in American history and global history where one felt they didn't have access to accurate information. And I wanted to see the center with my own eyes, but what I came away with is a photograph. And it's just another place from which to observe, and the understanding that there are no absolute, all-knowing insiders. And the outsider can never really reach the core.I'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series. It's titled, \"An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar,\" and it's comprised of nearly 70 images. In this context I'll just show you a few. This is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility at Hanford site in Washington State, where there are over 1,900 stainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste submerged in water. A human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly. And I found one section amongst all of these that actually resembled the outline of the United States of America, which you can see here.And a big part of the work that is sort of absent in this context is text. So I create these two poles. Every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text. And what I'm most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its accompanying image, and how the image is transformed by the text and the text by the image. So, at best, the image is meant to float away into abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy. And then the text functions as this cruel anchor that kind of nails it to the ground. But in this context I'm just going to read an abridged version of those texts.This is a cryopreservation unit, and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother of cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger, who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life in good health, with advancements in science and technology, all for the cost of 35 thousand dollars, for forever.This is a 21-year-old Palestinian woman undergoing hymenoplasty. Hymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state, allowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations regarding virginity and marriage. So it essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen, allowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse, to simulate the loss of virginity.This is a jury simulation deliberation room, and you can see beyond that two-way mirror jury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror. And they observe deliberations after mock trial proceedings so that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy to have the outcome that they're hoping for. This process costs 60,000 dollars.This is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection room, a contraband room, at John F. Kennedy International Airport. On that table you can see 48 hours' worth of seized goods from passengers entering in to the United States. There is a pig's head and African cane rats. And part of my photographic work is I'm not just documenting what's there. I do take certain liberties and intervene. And in this I really wanted it to resemble an early still-life painting, so I spent some time with the smells and items.This is the exhibited art on the walls of the CIA in Langley, Virginia, their original headquarters building. And the CIA has had a long history with both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts. And it's speculated that some of their interest in the arts was designed to counter Soviet communism and promote what it considered to be pro-American thoughts and aesthetics. And one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency, and had thus come under question, is abstract expressionism.This is the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility, and on a six acre plot there are approximately 75 cadavers at any given time that are being studied by forensic anthropologists and researchers who are interested in monitoring a rate of corpse decomposition. And in this particular photograph the body of a young boy has been used to reenact a crime scene.This is the only federally funded site where it is legal to cultivate cannabis for scientific research in the United States. It's a research crop marijuana grow room.And part of the work that I hope for is that there is a sort of disorienting entropy where you can't find any discernible formula in how these things \u2014 they sort of awkwardly jump from government to science to religion to security \u2014 and you can't completely understand how information is being distributed.These are transatlantic submarine communication cables that travel across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, connecting North America to Europe. They carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations, and in a lot of the government and technology sites there was just this very apparent vulnerability. This one is almost humorous because it feels like I could just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut. But stuff did feel like it could have been taken 30 or 40 years ago, like it was locked in the Cold War era and hadn't necessarily progressed.This is a Braille edition of Playboy magazine. (Laughter) And this is ... a division of the Library of Congress produces a free national library service for the blind and visually impaired, and the publications they choose to publish are based on reader popularity. And Playboy is always in the top few. (Laughter) But you'd be surprised, they don't do the photographs. It's just the text. (Laughter)This is an avian quarantine facility where all imported birds coming into America are required to undergo a 30-day quarantine, where they are tested for diseases including Exotic Newcastle Disease and Avian Influenza. This film shows the testing of a new explosive fill on a warhead. And the Air Armament Center at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida is responsible for the deployment and testing of all air-delivered weaponry coming from the United States. And the film was shot on 72 millimeter, government-issue film. And that red dot is a marking on the government-issue film.All living white tigers in North America are the result of selective inbreeding \u2014 that would be mother to son, father to daughter, sister to brother \u2014 to allow for the genetic conditions that create a salable white tiger. Meaning white fur, ice blue eyes, a pink nose. And the majority of these white tigers are not born in a salable state and are killed at birth. It's a very violent process that is little known. And the white tiger is obviously celebrated in several forms of entertainment. Kenny was born. He actually made it to adulthood. He has since passed away, but was mentally retarded and suffers from severe bone abnormalities.This, on a lighter note, is at George Lucas' personal archive. This is the Death Star. And it's shown here in its true orientation. In the context of \"Star Wars: Return of the Jedi,\" its mirror image is presented. They flip the negative. And you can see the photoetched brass detailing, and the painted acrylic facade. In the context of the film, this is a deep-space battle station of the Galactic Empire, capable of annihilating planets and civilizations, and in reality it measures about four feet by two feet. (Laughter)This is at Fort Campbell in Kentucky. It's a Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain site. Essentially they've simulated a city for urban combat, and this is one of the structures that exists in that city. It's called the World Church of God. It's supposed to be a generic site of worship. And after I took this photograph, they constructed a wall around the World Church of God to mimic the set-up of mosques in Afghanistan or Iraq. And I worked with Mehta Vihar who creates virtual simulations for the army for tactical practice. And we put that wall around the World Church of God, and also used the characters and vehicles and explosions that are offered in the video games for the army. And I put them into my photograph.This is live HIV virus at Harvard Medical School, who is working with the U.S. Government to develop sterilizing immunity.And Alhurra is a U.S. Government- sponsored Arabic language television network that distributes news and information to over 22 countries in the Arab world. It runs 24 hours a day, commercial free. However, it's illegal to broadcast Alhurra within the United States. And in 2004, they developed a channel called Alhurra Iraq, which specifically deals with events occurring in Iraq and is broadcast to Iraq.Now I'm going to move on to another project I did. It's titled \"The Innocents.\" And for the men in these photographs, photography had been used to create a fantasy. Contradicting its function as evidence of a truth, in these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie. I traveled across the United States photographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not commit, violent crimes.I investigate photography's ability to blur truth and fiction, and its influence on memory, which can lead to severe, even lethal consequences. For the men in these photographs, the primary cause of their wrongful conviction was mistaken identification. A victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement's use of images. But through exposure to composite sketches, Polaroids, mug shots and line-ups, eyewitness testimony can change.I'll give you an example from a case. A woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs from which to identify her attacker. She saw some similarities in one of the photographs, but couldn't quite make a positive identification. Days later, she is presented with another photo array of all new photographs, except that one photograph that she had some draw to from the earlier array is repeated in the second array. And a positive identification is made because the photograph replaced the memory, if there ever was an actual memory.Photography offered the criminal justice system a tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals, and the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations of relying on photographic identifications.Frederick Daye, who is photographed at his alibi location, where 13 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime. He was convicted by an all-white jury of rape, kidnapping and vehicle theft. And he served 10 years of a life sentence. Now DNA exonerated Frederick and it also implicated another man who was serving time in prison. But the victim refused to press charges because she claimed that law enforcement had permanently altered her memory through the use of Frederick's photograph.Charles Fain was convicted of kidnapping, rape and murder of a young girl walking to school. He served 18 years of a death sentence. I photographed him at the scene of the crime at the Snake River in Idaho. And I photographed all of the wrongfully convicted at sites that came to particular significance in the history of their wrongful conviction. The scene of arrest, the scene of misidentification, the alibi location. And here, the scene of the crime, it's this place to which he's never been, but changed his life forever. So photographing there, I was hoping to highlight the tenuous relationship between truth and fiction, in both his life and in photography.Calvin Washington was convicted of capital murder. He served 13 years of a life sentence in Waco, Texas.Larry Mayes, I photographed at the scene of arrest, where he hid between two mattresses in Gary, Indiana, in this very room to hide from the police. He ended up serving 18 and a half years of an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery. The victim failed to identify Larry in two live lineups and then made a positive identification, days later, from a photo array.Larry Youngblood served eight years of a 10 and half year sentence in Arizona for the abduction and repeated sodomizing of a 10 year old boy at a carnival. He is photographed at his alibi location.Ron Williamson. Ron was convicted of the rape and murder of a barmaid at a club, and served 11 years of a death sentence. I photographed Ron at a baseball field because he had been drafted to the Oakland A's to play professional baseball just before his conviction. And the state's key witness in Ron's case was, in the end, the actual perpetrator.Ronald Jones served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman. I photographed him at the scene of arrest in Chicago.William Gregory was convicted of rape and burglary. He served seven years of a 70 year sentence in Kentucky.Timothy Durham, who I photographed at his alibi location where 11 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime, was convicted of 3.5 years of a 3220 year sentence, for several charges of rape and robbery. He had been misidentified by an 11-year-old victim.Troy Webb is photographed here at the scene of the crime in Virginia. He was convicted of rape, kidnapping and robbery, and served seven years of a 47 year sentence. Troy's picture was in a photo array that the victim tentatively had some draw toward, but said he looked too old. The police went and found a photograph of Troy Webb from four years earlier, which they entered into a photo array days later, and he was positively identified.Now I'm going to leave you with a self portrait. And it reiterates that distortion is a constant, and our eyes are easily deceived. That's it. Thank you.

phone calls\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nto access my subjects,\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nwhich can range from Hamas leaders in Gaza\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nto a hibernating black bear in its cave\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nin West Virginia.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nAnd oddly, the most notable\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nletter of rejection I ever received\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\ncame from Walt Disney World,\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\na seemingly innocuous site.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nAnd it read -- I'm just going to read a key sentence:\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\n\"Especially during these violent times,\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nI personally believe\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nthat the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nis particularly important to protect\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nand helps to provide them with an important fantasy\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nthey can escape to.\"\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nPhotography threatens fantasy.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nThey didn't want to let my camera in\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nbecause it confronts constructed realities, myths and beliefs,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nand provides what appears to be\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nevidence of a truth.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nBut there are multiple truths attached to every image,\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\ndepending on the creator's intention, the viewer\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nand the context in which it is presented.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nOver a five year period following September 11th,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nwhen the American media and government were seeking\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nhidden and unknown sites\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nbeyond its borders,\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nmost notably weapons of mass destruction,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nI chose to look inward at that which was integral\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nto America's foundation,\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nmythology and daily functioning.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nI wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nself-imposed and real,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nand confront the divide between privileged\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nand public access to knowledge.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nIt was a critical moment in American history\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nand global history\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nwhere one felt they didn't have access to accurate information.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nAnd I wanted to see the center with my own eyes,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nbut what I came away with is a photograph.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nAnd it's just another place from which to observe,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nand the understanding that\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nthere are no absolute, all-knowing insiders.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAnd the outsider can never really reach the core.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nI'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nIt's titled, \"An American Index\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nof the Hidden and Unfamiliar,\"\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nand it's comprised of nearly 70 images.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nIn this context I'll just show you a few.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nThis is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nat Hanford site in Washington State,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nwhere there are over 1,900\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nstainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nsubmerged in water.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nA human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nAnd I found one section amongst all of these\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nthat actually resembled the outline\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nof the United States of America,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nwhich you can see here.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nAnd a big part of the work that is\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nsort of absent in this context is text.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nSo I create these two poles.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nEvery image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nAnd what I'm most interested in\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nis the invisible space between a text\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nand its accompanying image,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nand how the image is transformed by the text\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nand the text by the image.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nSo, at best, the image is meant to float away\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.958\ninto abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd then the text functions as this cruel anchor\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nthat kind of nails it to the ground.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nBut in this context I'm just going to read\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nan abridged version of those texts.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nThis is a cryopreservation unit,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nand it holds the bodies of the wife and mother\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nof cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nwho hoped to be awoken one day to extended life\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nin good health, with advancements in science and technology,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nall for the cost of 35 thousand dollars, for forever.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nThis is a 21-year-old Palestinian woman\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nundergoing hymenoplasty.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nHymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nallowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nregarding virginity and marriage.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nSo it essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nallowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nto simulate the loss of virginity.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nThis is a jury simulation deliberation room,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nand you can see beyond that two-way mirror\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:36.958\njury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nAnd they observe deliberations\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nafter mock trial proceedings\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nso that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nto have the outcome that they're hoping for.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nThis process costs 60,000 dollars.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nThis is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection room,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\na contraband room, at John F. Kennedy International Airport.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nOn that table you can see 48 hours' worth\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nof seized goods from passengers entering in to the United States.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nThere is a pig's head and African cane rats.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nAnd part of my photographic work\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nis I'm not just documenting what's there.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nI do take certain liberties and intervene.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nAnd in this I really wanted it to resemble\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nan early still-life painting,\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nso I spent some time with the smells and items.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nThis is the exhibited art on the walls of the CIA\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nin Langley, Virginia, their original headquarters building.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nAnd the CIA has had a long history\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nwith both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nAnd it's speculated that some of their interest in the arts\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nwas designed to counter Soviet communism\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nand promote what it considered to be pro-American\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nthoughts and aesthetics.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nAnd one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nand had thus come under question, is abstract expressionism.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nThis is the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nand on a six acre plot\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthere are approximately 75 cadavers at any given time\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nthat are being studied by forensic anthropologists\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nand researchers who are interested in monitoring\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\na rate of corpse decomposition.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nAnd in this particular photograph the body of a young boy\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nhas been used to reenact a crime scene.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nThis is the only federally funded site\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nwhere it is legal to cultivate cannabis\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nfor scientific research in the United States.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nIt's a research crop marijuana grow room.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nAnd part of the work that I hope for\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nis that there is a sort of disorienting entropy\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nwhere you can't find any discernible formula in how these things --\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nthey sort of awkwardly jump from government to science\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nto religion to security --\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nand you can't completely understand\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nhow information is being distributed.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nThese are transatlantic submarine communication cables\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nthat travel across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nconnecting North America to Europe.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nThey carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nand in a lot of the government and technology sites\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nthere was just this very apparent vulnerability.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nThis one is almost humorous because it feels like I could\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\njust snip all of that conversation in one easy cut.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nBut stuff did feel like it could have been taken\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.958\n30 or 40 years ago, like it was locked in the Cold War era\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nand hadn't necessarily progressed.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nThis is a Braille edition of Playboy magazine.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nAnd this is ... a division of the Library of Congress\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nproduces a free national library service\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nfor the blind and visually impaired,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nand the publications they choose to publish\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nare based on reader popularity.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nAnd Playboy is always in the top few.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nBut you'd be surprised, they don't do the photographs.

brass detailing,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nand the painted acrylic facade.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nIn the context of the film,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nthis is a deep-space battle station of the Galactic Empire,\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:57.958\ncapable of annihilating planets and civilizations,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nand in reality it measures about four feet by two feet.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nThis is at Fort Campbell in Kentucky.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nIt's a Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain site.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nEssentially they've simulated a city\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nfor urban combat,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nand this is one of the structures that exists in that city.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nIt's called the World Church of God.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nIt's supposed to be a generic site of worship.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nAnd after I took this photograph,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nthey constructed a wall around the World Church of God\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nto mimic the set-up of mosques in Afghanistan or Iraq.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nAnd I worked with Mehta Vihar\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nwho creates virtual simulations for the army\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nfor tactical practice.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nAnd we put that wall around the World Church of God,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nand also used the characters and vehicles and explosions\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nthat are offered in the video games for the army.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nAnd I put them into my photograph.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nThis is live HIV virus\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nat Harvard Medical School, who is working with the U.S. Government\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nto develop sterilizing immunity.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nAnd Alhurra is a U.S. Government- sponsored\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nArabic language television

free.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nHowever, it's illegal to broadcast Alhurra within the United States.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nAnd in 2004, they developed a channel called Alhurra Iraq,\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nwhich specifically deals with events occurring in Iraq\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nand is broadcast to Iraq.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nNow I'm going to move on to another project I did.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nIt's titled \"The Innocents.\"\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nAnd for the men in these photographs,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nphotography had been used to create a fantasy.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nContradicting its function as evidence of a truth,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nin these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nI traveled across the United States\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nphotographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nof crimes they did not commit, violent crimes.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nI investigate photography's ability to blur truth and fiction,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nand its influence on memory,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nwhich can lead to severe, even lethal consequences.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nFor the men in these photographs,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nthe primary cause of their wrongful conviction\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nwas mistaken identification.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nA victim or eyewitness identifies\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\na suspected perpetrator\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nthrough law enforcement's use of images.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nBut through exposure to composite sketches,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nPolaroids, mug shots and line-ups,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\neyewitness testimony can change.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nI'll give you an example from a case.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nA woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nfrom which to identify her attacker.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nShe saw some similarities in one of the photographs,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nbut couldn't quite make a positive identification.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nDays later, she is presented with another photo array\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nof all new photographs,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nexcept that one photograph that she had some draw to\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nfrom the earlier array is repeated in the second array.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nAnd a positive identification is made\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nbecause the photograph replaced the memory,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nif there ever was an actual memory.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nPhotography offered the criminal justice system\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\na tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nand the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nof relying on photographic identifications.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nFrederick Daye, who is photographed at his alibi location,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nwhere 13 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nHe was convicted by an all-white jury\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nof rape, kidnapping and vehicle theft.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nAnd he served 10 years of a life sentence.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nNow DNA exonerated Frederick\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nand it also implicated another man\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nwho was serving time in prison.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nBut the victim refused to press charges\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nbecause she claimed that law enforcement\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nhad permanently altered her memory through the use of Frederick's photograph.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nCharles Fain was convicted of kidnapping, rape and murder\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nof a young girl walking to school.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nHe served 18 years of a death sentence.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nI photographed him at the scene of the crime\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nat the Snake River in Idaho.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nAnd I photographed all of the wrongfully convicted\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nat sites that came to particular significance\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nin the history of their wrongful conviction.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nThe scene of arrest, the scene of misidentification,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nthe alibi location.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nAnd here, the scene of the crime, it's this place\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nto which he's never been, but changed his life forever.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nSo photographing there, I was hoping to highlight\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nthe tenuous relationship between truth and fiction,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nin both his life and in photography.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nCalvin Washington was convicted of capital murder.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nHe served 13 years of a life sentence in Waco, Texas.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nLarry Mayes, I photographed at the scene of arrest,\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nwhere he hid between two mattresses in Gary, Indiana,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nin this very room to hide from the police.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nHe ended up serving 18 and a half years\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nof an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nThe victim failed to identify Larry\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nin two live lineups\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nand then made a positive identification, days later,\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nfrom a photo array.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nLarry Youngblood served eight years of a 10 and half year sentence\n\n00:15:05.958

Arguably the financial markets have failed us and the aid system is failing us, and yet I stand firmly with the optimists who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive. Because of some of technologies we've been talking about. Because of the resources, the skills, and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world, with the mindset to create change. And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen, who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower, but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world.And by definition, every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul, a global citizen. You work on the front lines. And you've seen the best and the worst that human beings can do for one another and to one another. And no matter what country you live or work in, you've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of, even in their most ordinariness.Today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty, how best we release their energies. On the one hand, we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out. And on the other we have people who say the problem is that we need more aid. And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems. We call it patient capital.The critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent in Africa since 1970 and say, and what do we have but environmental degradation and incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption? They use Mobutu as metaphor. And their policy prescription is to make government more accountable, focus on the capital markets, invest, don't give anything away.On the other side, as I said, there are those who say the problem is that we need more money. That when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out and we'll hand a lot of aid, but when it comes to our poor brethren, we want little to do with it. They point to the successes of aid: the eradication of smallpox, and the distribution of tens of millions of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals. Both sides are right. And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other. Even more problematic, they're not listening to poor people themselves.After 25 years of working on issues of poverty and innovation, it's true that there are probably no more market-oriented individuals on the planet than low-income people. They must navigate markets daily, making micro-decisions, dozens and dozens, to move their way through society, and yet if a single catastrophic health problem impacts their family, they could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations. And so we need both the market and we need aid.Patient capital works between, and tries to take the best of both. It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy, thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity, but as individual customers, consumers, clients, people who want to make decisions in their own lives.Patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk, a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment, to use the market as the best listening device that we have, and the expectation of below-market returns, but outsized social impact. It recognizes that the market has its limitation, and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people.Now, entrepreneurs need patient capital for three reasons. First, they tend to work in markets where people make one, two, three dollars a day and they are making all of their decisions within that income level. Second, the geographies in which they work have terrible infrastructure \u2014 no roads to speak of, sporadic electricity and high levels of corruption. Third, they are often creating markets.Even if you're bringing clean water for the first time into rural villages, it is something new. And so many low-income people have seen so many failed promises broken and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them that building trust takes a lot of time, takes a lot of patience. It also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance. Not only to build the systems, the business models that allow us to reach low income people in a sustainable way, but to connect those business to other markets, to governments, to corporations \u2014 real partnerships if we want to get to scale.I want to share one story about an innovation called drip irrigation. In 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur named Amitabha Sadangi from India, who'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet. And he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether, despite the fact that 200 million farmers alone in India make under a dollar a day. They were creating subsidies either for large farms, or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use, rather than that the farmers wanted to use.At the same time Amitabha was obsessed with this drip irrigation technology that had been invented in Israel. It was a way of bringing small amounts of water directly to the stalk of the plant. And it could transform swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green. But the market also had bypassed low income farmers, because these systems were both too expensive, and they were constructed for fields that were too large. The average small village farmer works on two acres or less.And so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation and he would redesign it from the perspective of the poor farmers themselves, because he spent so many years listening to what they needed not what he thought that they should have. And he used three fundamental principles.The first one was miniaturization. The drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre, even if he had two, because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake. Second, it had to be extremely affordable. In other words, that risk on the quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest, or else they wouldn't take the risk. And third, it had to be what Amitabha calls infinitely expandable. What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre, the farmers could buy a second and a third and a fourth.As of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization, has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems and has seen their yields and incomes double or triple on average, but this didn't happen overnight. In fact, when you go back to the beginning, there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day, that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.And so we needed grants. And he used significant grants to research, to experiment, to fail, to innovate and try again. And when he had a prototype and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers, that's when patient capital could come in. And we helped him build a company, for profit, that would build on IDE's knowledge, and start looking at sales and exports, and be able to tap into other kinds of capital.Secondarily, we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries. And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan. And while, again, you needed patience to move a technology for the poor in India into Pakistan, just to get the permits, over time we were able to start a company with Dr. Sono, who runs a large community development organization in the Thar Desert, which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country. And though that company has just started, our assumption is that there too we'll see the impact on millions.But drip irrigation isn't the only innovation. We're starting to see these happening all around the world. In Arusha, Tanzania, A to Z Textile Manufacturing has worked in partnership with us, with UNICEF, with the Global Fund, to create a factory that now employs 7,000 people, mostly women. And they produce 20 million lifesaving bednets for Africans around the world.Lifespring Hospital is a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India to bring quality, affordable maternal health care to low-income women, and it's been so successful that it's currently building a new hospital every 35 days.And 1298 Ambulances decided that it was going to reinvent a completely broken industry, building an ambulance service in Bombay that would use the technology of Google Earth, a sliding scale pricing system so that all people could have access, and a severe and public decision not to engage in any form of corruption. So that in the terrorist attacks of November they were the first responder, and are now beginning to scale, because of partnership. They've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances, and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies in India.This idea of scale is critical. Because we're starting to see these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussed have reached at least a quarter million people. But that's obviously not enough. And it's where the idea of partnership becomes so important. Whether it's by finding those innovations that can access the capital markets, government itself, or partner with major corporations, there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation.President Obama understands that. He recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund to focus on what works in this country, and look at how we can scale it. And I would submit that it's time to consider a global innovation fund that would find these entrepreneurs around the world who really have innovations, not only for their country, but ones that we can use in the developed world as well. Invest financial assistance, but also management assistance. And then measure the returns, both from a financial perspective and from a social impact perspective.When we think about new approaches to aid, it's impossible not to talk about Pakistan. We've had a rocky relationship with that country and, in all fairness, the United States has not always been a very reliable partner. But again I would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things to happen. And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund, we could use this time to invest not directly in government, though we would have government's blessing, nor in international experts, but in the many existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful innovations that are reaching people all across the country.People like Rashani Zafar, who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country, and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country. And Tasneem Siddiqui, who developed a way called incremental housing, where he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers into safe, affordable community housing. Educational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation that are building schools across the country. It's not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the Taliban.I've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now, and those of you who've also worked there can attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population, and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature.President Kennedy said that those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable. I would say that the converse is true. That these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and extending opportunity to the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day, provide real pathways to hope. And as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan, while we need to strengthen the judiciary, build greater stability, we also need to think about lifting those leaders who can be role models for the rest of the world.On one of my last visits to Pakistan, I asked Dr. Sono if he would take me to see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert. And we left Karachi one morning before dawn. It was about 115 degrees. And we drove for eight hours along this moonscape-like landscape with very little color, lots of heat, very little discussion, because we were exhausted.And finally, at the end of the journey, I could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon. And as we got closer, its significance became apparent. That there in the desert was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall. Because one of the poorest farmers on Earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him to change his own life. His name was Raja, and he had kind, twinkly hazel eyes and warm expressive hands that reminded me of my father.And he said it was the first dry season in his entire life that he hadn't taken his 12 children and 50 grandchildren on a two day journey across the desert to work as day laborers at a commercial farm for about 50 cents a day. Because he was building these crops. And with the money he earned he could stay this year. And for the first time ever in three generations, his children would go to school.We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons. And he said, \"Of course I will. Because I don't want them discriminated against anymore.\" When we think about solutions to poverty, we cannot deny individuals their fundamental dignity. Because at the end of the day, dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth. And what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity. Because that is where dignity really starts.Martin Luther King said that love without power is anemic and sentimental, and that power without love is reckless and abusive. Our generation has seen both approaches tried, and often fail. But I think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power. For that is what we'll need, as we move forward to dream and imagine what it will really take to build a global economy that includes all of us, and to finally extend that fundamental proposition that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet.The time for us to begin innovating and looking for new solutions, a cross sector, is now. I can only talk from my own experience, but in eight years of running Acumen fund, I've seen the power of patient capital. Not only to inspire innovation and risk taking, but to truly build systems that have created more than 25,000 jobs and delivered tens of millions of services and products to some of the poorest people on the planet. I know it works. But I know that many other kinds of innovation also work.And so I urge you, in whatever sector you work, in whatever job you do, to start thinking about how we might build solutions that start from the perspective of those we're trying to help. Rather than what we think that they might need. It will take embracing the world with both arms. And it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability, with a sense of integrity and perseverance. And yet these are the very qualities for which men and women have been honored throughout the generations. And there is so much good that we can do. Just think of all those sunflowers in the desert. Thank you.

And you've seen the best and the worst\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nthat human beings can do for one another and to one another.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nAnd no matter what country you live or work in,\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nyou've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of,\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:11.958\neven in their most ordinariness.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nToday there is a raging debate\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nas to how best we lift people out of poverty,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nhow best we release their energies.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nOn the one hand, we have people that say\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nthe aid system is so broken we need to throw it out.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nAnd on the other we have people who say\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nthe problem is that we need more aid.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nAnd what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nWe call it patient capital.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nThe critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nin Africa since 1970\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nand say, and what do we have but environmental degradation\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nand incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption?\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nThey use Mobutu as metaphor.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nAnd their policy prescription is to\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nmake government more accountable,\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nfocus on the capital markets,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\ninvest, don't give anything away.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nOn the other side, as I said, there are those who say\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nthe problem is that we need more money.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nThat when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nand we'll hand a lot of aid,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nbut when it comes to our poor brethren,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nwe want little to do with it.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nThey point to the successes of aid:\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nthe eradication of smallpox,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nand the distribution of tens of millions\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nof malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nBoth sides are right.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nAnd the problem is that neither side is listening to the other.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nEven more problematic, they're not listening to\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\npoor people themselves.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nAfter 25 years of working on issues of\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\npoverty and innovation,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nit's true that there are probably no more market-oriented\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nindividuals on the planet\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nthan low-income people.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThey must navigate markets daily,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nmaking micro-decisions, dozens and dozens,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nto move their way through society,\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nand yet if a single catastrophic health problem\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nimpacts their family,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nthey could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nAnd so we need both the market\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nand we need aid.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nPatient capital works between,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nand tries to take the best of both.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nIt's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nand are building solutions\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nto healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nthinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity,\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nbut as individual customers, consumers, clients,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\npeople who want to make decisions in their own lives.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nPatient capital requires that we have\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nincredible tolerance for risk,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\na long time horizon in terms of allowing those\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nentrepreneurs time to experiment,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nto use the market as the best listening device that we have,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nand the expectation of below-market returns,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nbut outsized social impact.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nIt recognizes that the market has its limitation,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nand so patient capital also works\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nwith smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nto include all people.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nNow, entrepreneurs need patient capital\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nfor three reasons.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nFirst, they tend to work in markets\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nwhere people make one, two, three dollars a day\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nand they are making all of their decisions within that income level.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nSecond, the geographies in which they work\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nhave terrible infrastructure --\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nno roads to speak of, sporadic electricity\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nand high levels of corruption.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nThird, they are often creating markets.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nEven if you're bringing clean water\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nfor the first time into rural villages, it is something new.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nAnd so many low-income people\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nhave seen so many failed promises broken\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nand seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nthat building trust takes a lot of time,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\ntakes a lot of patience.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nIt also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nNot only to build the systems,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nthe business models that allow us\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nto reach low income people in a sustainable way,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nbut to connect those business\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nto other markets, to governments, to corporations --\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nreal partnerships if we want to get to scale.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nI want to share one story\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nabout an innovation called drip irrigation.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nIn 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nnamed Amitabha Sadangi from India,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nwho'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nAnd he was expressing his frustration\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nthat the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\ndespite the fact that 200 million farmers\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nalone in India make under a dollar a day.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nThey were creating subsidies\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\neither for large farms,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nor they were giving inputs to the farmers\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nthat they thought they should use, rather than\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nthat the farmers wanted to use.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nAt the same time Amitabha was\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nobsessed with this drip irrigation technology\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nthat had been invented in Israel.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nIt was a way of bringing small amounts of water\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\ndirectly to the stalk of the plant.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nAnd it could transform\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nswaths of desert land into fields of emerald green.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nBut the market also had bypassed low income farmers,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nbecause these systems were both too expensive,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nand they were constructed for fields that were too large.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nThe average small village farmer\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nworks on two acres or less.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nAnd so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nand he would redesign it from the perspective\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nof the poor farmers themselves,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nbecause he spent so many years listening to what they needed\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nnot what he thought that they should have.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nAnd he used three fundamental principles.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nThe first one was miniaturization.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nThe drip irrigation system\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nhad to be small enough that a farmer only had\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nto risk a quarter acre,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\neven if he had two,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nbecause it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nSecond, it had to be extremely affordable.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nIn other words, that risk on the quarter acre\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nneeded to be repaid in a single harvest,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nor else they wouldn't take the risk.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nAnd third, it had to be what Amitabha calls\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\ninfinitely expandable.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nWhat I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nthe farmers could buy a second\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nand a third and a fourth.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nAs of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nhas sold over 300,000 farmers these systems\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nand has seen their yields and incomes\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\ndouble or triple on average,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nbut this didn't happen overnight.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nIn fact, when you go back to the beginning,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nthere were no private investors\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nwho would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nfor a market class that made under a dollar a day,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nthat were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nand that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nAnd so we needed grants. And he used significant grants\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nto research, to experiment, to fail,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nto innovate and try again.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd when he had a prototype\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nand had a better understanding of how to market to farmers,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nthat's when patient capital could come in.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nAnd we helped him build a company, for profit,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nthat would build on IDE's knowledge,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nand start looking at sales and exports,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nand be able to tap into other kinds of capital.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nSecondarily, we wanted to see if we could export\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nthis drip irrigation and bring it into other countries.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nAnd so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nAnd while, again, you needed patience\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nto move a technology for the poor\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nin India into Pakistan,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\njust to get the permits,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nover time we were able to start a company\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nwith Dr. Sono, who runs a large\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\ncommunity development organization in the Thar Desert,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nwhich is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nAnd though that company has just started,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nour assumption is that there too\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nwe'll see the impact on millions.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nBut drip irrigation isn't the only innovation.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nWe're starting to see these happening all around the world.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nIn Arusha, Tanzania, A to Z Textile Manufacturing\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nhas worked in partnership with us,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nwith UNICEF, with the Global Fund,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nto create a factory that now employs 7,000 people, mostly women.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nAnd they produce 20 million lifesaving bednets\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nfor Africans around the world.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nLifespring Hospital\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nis a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nto bring quality, affordable maternal health care\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nto low-income women,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nand it's been so successful that it's currently building\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:19.958\na new hospital every 35 days.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nAnd 1298 Ambulances decided that it was going to\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nreinvent a completely broken industry,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nbuilding an ambulance service in Bombay\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nthat would use the technology of Google Earth,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\na sliding scale pricing system\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nso that all people could have access,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nand a severe and public decision\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nnot to engage in any form of corruption.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nSo that in the terrorist attacks of November\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nthey were the first responder,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nand are now beginning to scale, because of partnership.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nThey've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nand are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nin India.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nThis idea of scale is critical.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nBecause we're starting to see these enterprises\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nreach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussed\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nhave reached at least a quarter million people.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nBut that's obviously not enough.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nAnd it's where the idea of partnership\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nbecomes so important.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nWhether it's by finding those innovations\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nthat can access the capital markets,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\ngovernment itself, or partner with major corporations,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nthere is unbelievable opportunity for innovation.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nPresident Obama understands that.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nHe recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nto focus on what works in this country,\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nand look at how we can scale it.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nAnd I would submit that it's time to consider\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\na global innovation fund\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nthat would find these entrepreneurs around the world\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nwho really have innovations, not only for their country,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nbut ones that we can use in the developed world as well.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nInvest financial assistance, but also management assistance.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nAnd then measure the returns,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nboth from a financial perspective\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nand from a social impact perspective.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nWhen we think about new approaches to aid,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nit's impossible not to talk about Pakistan.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nWe've had a rocky relationship with that country\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nand, in all fairness,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nthe United States has not always been a very reliable partner.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nBut again I would say that this is our moment\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nfor extraordinary things to happen.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nAnd if we take that notion of a global innovation fund,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nwe could use this time to invest\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nnot directly in government, though we would have government's blessing,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nnor in international experts,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nbut in the many existing entrepreneurs\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nand civil society leaders\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nwho already are building wonderful innovations\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nthat are reaching people all across the country.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nPeople like Rashani Zafar,\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nwho created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nand is a real role model for women inside and outside the country.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nAnd Tasneem Siddiqui, who developed a way\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\ncalled incremental housing,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nwhere he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\ninto safe, affordable community housing.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nEducational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nthat are building schools across the country.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nIt's not hyperbole\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nto say that these civil society institutions\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand these social entrepreneurs\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nare building real alternatives to the Taliban.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nI've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nand those of you who've also worked there\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:20.958\ncan attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nand there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nPresident Kennedy said that\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nthose who make peaceful revolution impossible\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nmake violent revolution inevitable.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nI would say that the converse is true.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nThat these social leaders\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nwho really are looking at innovation\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nand extending opportunity\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nto the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nprovide real pathways to hope.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nAnd as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nwhile we need to strengthen the judiciary,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nbuild greater stability,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nwe also need to think about lifting those leaders\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nwho can be role models for the rest of the world.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nOn one of my last visits to Pakistan,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nI asked Dr. Sono if he would take me\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nto see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nAnd we left Karachi one morning before dawn.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nIt was about 115 degrees.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nAnd we drove for eight hours\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nalong this moonscape-like landscape\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nwith very little color, lots of heat,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nvery little discussion, because we were exhausted.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nAnd finally, at the end of the journey,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nI could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nAnd as we got closer, its significance became apparent.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nThat there in the desert\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nwas a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nBecause one of the poorest farmers on Earth\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nhad gotten access to a technology\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nthat had allowed him to change his own life.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nHis name was Raja,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nand he had kind, twinkly hazel eyes\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nand warm expressive hands\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nthat reminded me of my father.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nAnd he said it was the first dry season\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nin his entire life that he hadn't taken\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nhis 12 children and 50 grandchildren\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\non a two day journey across the desert\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nto work as day laborers at a commercial farm\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nfor about 50 cents a day.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nBecause he was building these crops.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nAnd with the money he earned he could stay this year.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nAnd for the first time ever in three generations,\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nhis children would go to school.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nWe asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nAnd he said, \"Of course I will.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nBecause I don't want them discriminated against anymore.\"\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nWhen we think about solutions to poverty,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nwe cannot deny individuals\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\ntheir fundamental dignity.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nBecause at the end of the day,\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\ndignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nAnd what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nwho are building innovations that recognize\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nthat what people want is freedom\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nand choice and opportunity.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nBecause that is where dignity really starts.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nMartin Luther King said that\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nlove without power is anemic and sentimental,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nand that power without love\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nis reckless and abusive.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nOur generation has seen both approaches tried,\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nand often fail.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nBut I think our generation also might be the first\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nto have the courage to embrace both love and power.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nFor that is what we'll need, as we move forward\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nto dream and imagine what it will really take\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nto build a global economy that includes all of us,\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nand to finally extend that fundamental proposition\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nthat all men are created equal to every human being on the planet.\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nThe time for us to begin innovating\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nand looking for new solutions, a cross sector, is now.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nI can only talk from my own experience,\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nbut in eight years of running Acumen fund,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nI've seen the power of patient capital.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nNot only to inspire innovation and risk taking,\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nbut to truly build systems that have created\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nmore than 25,000 jobs\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nand delivered tens of millions of services and products\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nto some of the poorest people on the planet.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nI know it works.\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nBut I know that many other kinds of innovation also work.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nAnd so I urge you, in whatever sector you work,\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nin whatever job you do,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nto start thinking about how we might\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nbuild solutions that start\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nfrom the perspective of those we're trying to help.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nRather than what we think that they might need.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nIt will take embracing the world with both arms.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nAnd it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability,\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nwith a sense of integrity and perseverance.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nAnd yet these are the very qualities\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nfor which men and women have been honored\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nthroughout the generations.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nAnd there is so much good that we can do.\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nJust think of all those sunflowers in the desert.\n\n00:16:51.958 -->

Before you answer that, have a look at this map. Contemporary political map shows that we have over 200 countries in the world today. That's probably more than at any time in centuries. Now, many of you will object. For you this would be a more appropriate map. You could call it TEDistan. In TEDistan, there are no borders, just connected spaces and unconnected spaces. Most of you probably reside in one of the 40 dots on this screen, of the many more that represent 90 percent of the world economy.But let's talk about the 90 percent of the world population that will never leave the place in which they were born. For them, nations, countries, boundaries, borders still matter a great deal, and often violently. Now here at TED, we're solving some of the great riddles of science and mysteries of the universe. Well here is a fundamental problem we have not solved: our basic political geography. How do we distribute ourselves around the world?Now this is important, because border conflicts justify so much of the world's military-industrial complex. Border conflicts can derail so much of the progress that we hope to achieve here. So I think we need a deeper understanding of how people, money, power, religion, culture, technology interact to change the map of the world. And we can try to anticipate those changes, and shape them in a more constructive direction.So we're going to look at some maps of the past, the present and some maps you haven't seen in order to get a sense of where things are going. Let's start with the world of 1945. 1945 there were just 100 countries in the world. After World War II, Europe was devastated, but still held large overseas colonies: French West Africa, British East Africa, South Asia, and so forth. Then over the late '40s, '50s, '60s, '70s and '80s, waves of decolonization took place. Over 50 new countries were born. You can see that Africa has been fragmented. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, South East Asian nations created. Then came the end of the Cold War. The end of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union. You had the creation of new states in Eastern Europe, the former Yugoslav republics and the Balkans, and the 'stans of central Asia.Today we have 200 countries in the world. The entire planet is covered by sovereign, independent nation-states. Does that mean that someone's gain has to be someone else's loss? Let's zoom in on one of the most strategic areas of the world, Eastern Eurasia. As you can see on this map, Russia is still the largest country in the world. And as you know, China is the most populous. And they share a lengthy land border.What you don't see on this map is that most of Russia's 150 million people are concentrated in its western provinces and areas that are close to Europe. And only 30 million people are in its eastern areas. In fact, the World Bank predicts that Russia's population is declining towards about 120 million peopleAnd there is another thing that you don't see on this map. Stalin, Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders forced Russians out to the far east to be in gulags, labor camps, nuclear cities, whatever the case was. But as oil prices rose, Russian governments have invested in infrastructure to unite the country, east and west. But nothing has more perversely impacted Russia's demographic distribution, because the people in the east, who never wanted to be there anyway, have gotten on those trains and roads and gone back to the west. As a result, in the Russian far east today, which is twice the size of India, you have exactly six million Russians.So let's get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world. We can start with Mongolia, or as some call it, Mine-golia. Why do they call it that? Because in Mine-golia, Chinese firms operate and own most of the mines \u2014 copper, zinc, gold \u2014 and they truck the resources south and east into mainland China. China isn't conquering Mongolia. It's buying it. Colonies were once conquered. Today countries are bought.So let's apply this principle to Siberia. Siberia most of you probably think of as a cold, desolate, unlivable place. But in fact, with global warming and rising temperatures, all of a sudden you have vast wheat fields and agribusiness, and grain being produced in Siberia. But who is it going to feed? Well, just on the other side of the Amo River, in the Heilongjiang and Harbin provinces of China, you have over 100 million people. That's larger than the entire population of Russia.Every single year, for at least a decade or more, [60,000] of them have been voting with their feet, crossing, moving north and inhabiting this desolate terrain. They set up their own bazaars and medical clinics. They've taken over the timber industry and been shipping the lumber east, back into China. Again, like Mongolia, China isn't conquering Russia. It's just leasing it. That's what I call globalization Chinese style.Now maybe this is what the map of the region might look like in 10 to 20 years. But hold on. This map is 700 years old. This is the map of the Yuan Dynasty, led by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan. So history doesn't necessarily repeat itself, but it does rhyme.This is just to give you a taste of what's happening in this part of the world. Again, globalization Chinese style. Because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to undermine and change the way we think about political geography. So, the history of East Asia in fact, people don't think about nations and borders. They think more in terms of empires and hierarchies, usually Chinese or Japanese.Well it's China's turn again. So let's look at how China is re-establishing that hierarchy in the far East. It starts with the global hubs. Remember the 40 dots on the nighttime map that show the hubs of the global economy? East Asia today has more of those global hubs than any other region in the world. Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore and Sidney. These are the filters and funnels of global capital. Trillions of dollars a year are being brought into the region, so much of it being invested into China.Then there is trade. These vectors and arrows represent ever stronger trade relationships that China has with every country in the region. Specifically, it targets Japan and Korea and Australia, countries that are strong allies of the United States. Australia, for example, is heavily dependent on exporting iron ore and natural gas to China. For poorer countries, China reduces tariffs so that Laos and Cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply and become dependent on exporting to China as well.And now many of you have been reading in the news how people are looking to China to lead the rebound, the economic rebound, not just in Asia, but potentially for the world. The Asian free trade zone, almost free trade zone, that's emerging now has a greater trade volume than trade across the Pacific. So China is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region.Another pillar of this strategy is diplomacy. China has signed military agreements with many countries in the region. It has become the hub of diplomatic institutions such as the East Asian Community. Some of these organizations don't even have the United States as a member. There is a treaty of nonaggression between countries, such that if there were a conflict between China and the United States, most countries vow to just sit it out, including American allies like Korea and Australia.Another pillar of the strategy, like Russia, is demographic. China exports business people, nannies, students, teachers to teach Chinese around the region, to intermarry and to occupy ever greater commanding heights of the economies. Already ethnic Chinese people in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia are the real key factors and drivers in the economies there. Chinese pride is resurgent in the region as a result. Singapore, for example, used to ban Chinese language education. Now it encourages it.If you add it all up what do you get? Well, if you remember before World War II, Japan had a vision for a greater Japanese co-prosperity sphere. What's emerging today is what you might call a greater Chinese co-prosperity sphere. So no matter what the lines on the map tell you in terms of nations and borders, what you really have emerging in the far east are national cultures, but in a much more fluid, imperial zone. All of this is happening without firing a shot.That's most certainly not the case in the Middle East where countries are still very uncomfortable in the borders left behind by European colonialists. So what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world? What lines on the map should we focus on? What I want to present to you is what I call state building, day by day.Let's start with Iraq. Six years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality. Oil used to be one of the forces holding Iraq together; now it is the most significant cause of the country's disintegration. The reason is Kurdistan. The Kurds for 3,000 years have been waging a struggle for independence, and now is their chance to finally have it. These are pipeline routes, which emerge from Kurdistan, which is an oil-rich region.And today, if you go to Kurdistan, you'll see that Kurdish Peshmerga guerillas are squaring off against the Sunni Iraqi army. But what are they guarding? Is it really a border on the map? No. It's the pipelines. If the Kurds can control their pipelines, they can set the terms of their own statehood. Now should we be upset about this, about the potential disintegration of Iraq? I don't believe we should. Iraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world, behind Saudi Arabia. And we'll have a chance to solve a 3,000 year old dispute. Now remember Kurdistan is landlocked. It has no choice but to behave. In order to profit from its oil it has to export it through Turkey or Syria, and other countries, and Iraq itself. And therefore it has to have amicable relations with them.Now lets look at a perennial conflict in the region. That is, of course, in Palestine. Palestine is something of a cartographic anomaly because it's two parts Palestinian, one part Israel. 30 years of rose garden diplomacy have not delivered us peace in this conflict. What might? I believe that what might solve the problem is infrastructure. Today donors are spending billions of dollars on this. These two arrows are an arc, an arc of commuter railroads and other infrastructure that link the West Bank and Gaza.If Gaza can have a functioning port and be linked to the West Bank, you can have a viable Palestinian state, Palestinian economy. That, I believe, is going to bring peace to this particular conflict. The lesson from Kurdistan and from Palestine is that independence alone, without infrastructure, is futile.Now what might this entire region look like if in fact we focus on other lines on the map besides borders, when the insecurities might abate? The last time that was the case was actually a century ago, during the Ottoman Empire. This is the Hejaz Railway. The Hejaz Railway ran from Istanbul to Medina via Damascus. It even had an offshoot running to Haifa in what is today Israel, on the Mediterranean Sea. But today the Hejaz Railway lies in tatters, ruins. If we were to focus on reconstructing these curvy lines on the map, infrastructure, that cross the straight lines, the borders, I believe the Middle East would be a far more peaceful region.Now let's look at another part of the world, the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia, the 'stans. These countries' borders originate from Stalin's decrees. He purposely did not want these countries to make sense. He wanted ethnicities to mingle in ways that would allow him to divide and rule. Fortunately for them, most of their oil and gas resources were discovered after the Soviet Union collapsed.Now I know some of you may be thinking, \"Oil, oil, oil. Why is it all he's talking about is oil?\" Well, there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil and the way we're talking about it now. Before it was, how do we control their oil? Now it's their oil for their own purposes. And I assure you it's every bit as important to them as it might have been to colonizers and imperialists. Here are just some of the pipeline projections and possibilities and scenarios and routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades. A great deal of them.For a number of countries in this part of the world, having pipelines is the ticket to becoming part of the global economy and for having some meaning besides the borders that they are not loyal to themselves. Just take Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan was a forgotten corner of the Caucuses, but now with the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline into Turkey, it has rebranded itself as the frontier of the west.Then there is Turkmenistan, which most people think of as a frozen basket case. But now it's contributing gas across the Caspian Sea to provide for Europe, and even a potentially Turkmen- Afghan-Pakistan-India pipeline as well.Then there is Kazakhstan, which didn't even have a name before. It was more considered South Siberia during the Soviet Union. Today most people recognize Kazakhstan as an emerging geopolitical player. Why? Because it has shrewdly designed pipelines to flow across the Caspian, north through Russia, and even east to China. More pipelines means more silk roads, instead of the Great Game. The Great Game connotes dominance of one over the other. Silk road connotes independence and mutual trust. The more pipelines we have, the more silk roads we'll have, and the less of a dominant Great Game competition we'll have in the 21st century.Now let's look at the only part of the world that really has brought down its borders, and how that has enhanced its strength. And that is, of course, Europe. The European Union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries, and their main purpose was really to keep the rehabilitation of Germany to happen in a peaceful way. But then eventually it grew into 12 countries, and those are the 12 stars on the European flag. The E.U. also became a currency block, and is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world. On average, the E.U. has grown by one country per year since the end of the Cold War. In fact most of that happened on just one day. In 2004, 15 new countries joined the E.U. and now you have what most people consider a zone of peace spanning 27 countries and 450 million people.So what is next? What is the future of the European Union? Well in light blue, you see the zones or the regions that are at least two-thirds or more dependent on the European Union for trade and investment. What does that tell us? Trade and investment tell us that Europe is putting its money where its mouth is. Even if these regions aren't part of the E.U., they are becoming part of its sphere of influence. Just take the Balkans. Croatia, Serbia Bosnia, they're not members of the E.U. yet. But you can get on a German ICE train and make it almost to Albania. In Bosnia you use the Euro currency already, and that's the only currency they're probably ever going to have.So, looking at other parts of Europe's periphery, such as North Africa. On average, every year or two, a new oil or gas pipeline opens up under the Mediterranean, connecting North Africa to Europe. That not only helps Europe diminish its reliance on Russia for energy, but if you travel to North Africa today, you'll hear more and more people saying that they don't really think of their region as the Middle East. So in other words, I believe that President Sarkozy of France is right when he talks about a Mediterranean union.Now let's look at Turkey and the Caucasus. I mentioned Azerbaijan before. That corridor of Turkey and the Caucasus has become the conduit for 20 percent of Europe's energy supply. So does Turkey really have to be a member of the European Union? I don't think it does. I think it's already part of a Euro-Turkish superpower.So what's next? Where are we going to see borders change and new countries born? Well, South Central Asia, South West Asia is a very good place to start. Eight years after the U.S. invaded Afghanistan there is still a tremendous amount of instability. Pakistan and Afghanistan are still so fragile that neither of them have dealt constructively with the problem of Pashtun nationalism. This is the flag that flies in the minds of 20 million Pashtuns who live on both sides of the Afghan and Pakistan border.Let's not neglect the insurgency just to the south, Balochistan. Two weeks ago, Balochi rebels attacked a Pakistani military garrison, and this was the flag that they raised over it. The post-colonial entropy that is happening around the world is accelerating, and I expect more such changes to occur in the map as the states fragment.Of course, we can't forget Africa. 53 countries, and by far the most number of suspiciously straight lines on the map. If we were to look at all of Africa we could most certainly acknowledge far more, tribal divisions and so forth. But let's just look at Sudan, the second-largest country in Africa. It has three ongoing civil wars, the genocide in Darfur, which you all know about, the civil war in the east of the country, and south Sudan. South Sudan is going to be having a referendum in 2011 in which it is very likely to vote itself independence.Now let's go up to the Arctic Circle. There is a great race on for energy resources under the Arctic seabed. Who will win? Canada? Russia? The United States? Actually Greenland. Several weeks ago Greenland's [60,000] people voted themselves self-governance rights from Denmark. So Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller.What is the lesson from all of this? Geopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline. It's constantly morphing and changing the world, like climate change. And like our relationship with the ecosystem we're always searching for equilibrium in how we divide ourselves across the planet. Now we fear changes on the map. We fear civil wars, death tolls, having to learn the names of new countries. But I believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today is far worse and far more violent.The question is how do we change those borders, and what lines do we focus on? I believe we focus on the lines that cross borders, the infrastructure lines. Then we'll wind up with the world we want, a borderless one. Thank you.

million people are in its eastern areas.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nIn fact, the World Bank predicts\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nthat Russia's population is declining\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\ntowards about 120 million people\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nAnd there is another thing that you don't see on this map.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nStalin, Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nforced Russians out to the far east\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nto be in gulags, labor camps,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nnuclear cities, whatever the case was.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nBut as oil prices rose,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nRussian governments have invested in infrastructure\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nto unite the country, east and west.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nBut nothing has more perversely impacted\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nRussia's demographic distribution,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nbecause the people in the east, who never wanted to be there anyway,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nhave gotten on those trains and roads\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nand gone back to the west.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAs a result, in the Russian far east today,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nwhich is twice the size of India,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nyou have exactly six million Russians.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nSo let's get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nWe can start with Mongolia, or as some call it, Mine-golia.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nWhy do they call it that?\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nBecause in Mine-golia, Chinese firms operate\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nand own most of the mines -- copper, zinc, gold --\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nand they truck the resources south and east into mainland China.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nChina isn't conquering Mongolia.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nIt's buying it.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nColonies were once conquered. Today countries are bought.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nSo let's apply this principle to Siberia.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nSiberia most of you probably think of\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nas a cold, desolate, unlivable place.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nBut in fact, with global warming and rising temperatures,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nall of a sudden you have vast wheat fields\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nand agribusiness, and grain being produced in Siberia.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nBut who is it going to feed?\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nWell, just on the other side of the Amo River,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nin the Heilongjiang and Harbin provinces of China,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nyou have over 100 million people.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nThat's larger than the entire population of Russia.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nEvery single year, for at least a decade or more,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\n[60,000] of them have been voting with their feet,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:03.958\ncrossing, moving north and inhabiting this desolate terrain.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nThey set up their own bazaars and medical clinics.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nThey've taken over the timber industry\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nand been shipping the lumber east, back into China.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nAgain, like Mongolia,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nChina isn't conquering Russia. It's just leasing it.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nThat's what I call globalization Chinese style.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nNow maybe this is what the map of the region\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nmight look like in 10 to 20 years.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nBut hold on. This map is 700 years old.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nThis is the map of the Yuan Dynasty,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nled by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nSo history doesn't necessarily repeat itself,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nbut it does rhyme.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nThis is just to give you a taste of what's happening in this part of the world.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nAgain, globalization Chinese style.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nBecause globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nundermine and change the way we think about political geography.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nSo, the history of East Asia in fact,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\npeople don't think about nations and borders.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nThey think more in terms of empires and hierarchies,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nusually Chinese or Japanese.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nWell it's China's turn again.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nSo let's look at how China is re-establishing\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nthat hierarchy in the far East.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nIt starts with the global hubs.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nRemember the 40 dots on the nighttime map\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nthat show the hubs of the global economy?\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nEast Asia today has more of those global hubs\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nthan any other region in the world.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nTokyo, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nHong Kong, Singapore and Sidney.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nThese are the filters and funnels of global capital.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nTrillions of dollars a year are being brought into the region,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nso much of it being invested into China.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nThen there is trade.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nThese vectors and arrows represent ever stronger\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\ntrade relationships that China has\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nwith every country in the region.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nSpecifically, it targets Japan\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand Korea and Australia,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\ncountries that are strong allies of the United States.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nAustralia, for example, is heavily dependent\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:53.958\non exporting iron ore and natural gas to China.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nFor poorer countries, China reduces tariffs\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nso that Laos and Cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nand become dependent on exporting to China as well.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nAnd now many of you have been reading in the news\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nhow people are looking to China\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nto lead the rebound, the economic rebound, not just in Asia, but potentially for the world.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nThe Asian free trade zone, almost free trade zone, that's emerging\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nnow has a greater trade volume than trade across the Pacific.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nSo China is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nAnother pillar of this strategy is diplomacy.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nChina has signed military agreements with many countries in the region.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nIt has become the hub of diplomatic institutions\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nsuch as the East Asian Community.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nSome of these organizations don't even have\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nthe United States as a member.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nThere is a treaty of nonaggression between countries,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nsuch that if there were a conflict between China and the United States,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nmost countries vow to just sit it out,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nincluding American allies like Korea and Australia.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nAnother pillar of the strategy,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nlike Russia, is demographic.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nChina exports business people, nannies, students,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nteachers to teach Chinese around the region,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nto intermarry and to occupy ever greater\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\ncommanding heights of the economies.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nAlready ethnic Chinese people\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nin Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nare the real key factors and drivers\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nin the economies there.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nChinese pride is resurgent in the region\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nas a result.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nSingapore, for example, used to ban Chinese language education.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nNow it encourages it.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nIf you add it all up what do you get?\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nWell, if you remember before World War II,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nJapan had a vision\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nfor a greater Japanese co-prosperity sphere.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nWhat's emerging today is what you might call\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\na greater Chinese co-prosperity sphere.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nSo no matter what the lines on the map tell you\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nin terms of nations and borders,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nwhat you really have emerging in the far east\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nare national cultures,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nbut in a much more fluid, imperial zone.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nAll of this is happening without firing a shot.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nThat's most certainly not the case in the Middle East\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nwhere countries are still very uncomfortable\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nin the borders left behind by European colonialists.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nSo what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world?\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nWhat lines on the map should we focus on?\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nWhat I want to present to you is what I call\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nstate building, day by day.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nLet's start with Iraq.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nSix years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nthe country still exists more on a map than it does in reality.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nOil used to be one of the forces holding Iraq together;\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nnow it is the most significant cause of the country's disintegration.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nThe reason is Kurdistan.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nThe Kurds for 3,000 years\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nhave been waging a struggle for independence,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nand now is their chance to finally have it.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nThese are pipeline routes, which emerge from Kurdistan,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nwhich is an oil-rich region.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nAnd today, if you go to Kurdistan,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nyou'll see that Kurdish Peshmerga guerillas\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nare squaring off against the Sunni Iraqi army.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nBut what are they guarding?\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nIs it really a border on the map?\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nNo. It's the pipelines.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nIf the Kurds can control their pipelines, they can set the terms\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nof their own statehood.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nNow should we be upset about this, about the potential disintegration of Iraq?\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nI don't believe we should.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nIraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nbehind Saudi Arabia.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nAnd we'll have a chance to solve a 3,000 year old dispute.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nNow remember Kurdistan is landlocked.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nIt has no choice but to behave.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nIn order to profit from its oil\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nit has to export it through Turkey or Syria,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nand other countries, and Iraq itself.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nAnd therefore it has to have amicable relations with them.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nNow lets look at a perennial conflict in the region.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nThat is, of course, in Palestine.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nPalestine is something of a cartographic anomaly\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nbecause it's two parts Palestinian, one part Israel.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\n30 years of rose garden diplomacy\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nhave not delivered us peace in this conflict.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nWhat might? I believe that what might\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nsolve the problem is infrastructure.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nToday donors are spending billions of dollars on this.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nThese two arrows are an arc,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nan arc of commuter railroads and other infrastructure\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nthat link the West Bank and Gaza.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nIf Gaza can have a functioning port\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nand be linked to the West Bank, you can have a viable Palestinian state,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nPalestinian economy.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nThat, I believe, is going to bring peace to this particular conflict.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nThe lesson from Kurdistan and from Palestine\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nis that independence alone, without infrastructure,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nis futile.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nNow what might this entire region look like\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nif in fact we focus on other lines on the map besides borders,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nwhen the insecurities might abate?\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nThe last time that was the case was actually\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\na century ago, during the Ottoman Empire.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nThis is the Hejaz Railway.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nThe Hejaz Railway ran from Istanbul to Medina via Damascus.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nIt even had an offshoot running to Haifa\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nin what is today Israel, on the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nBut today the Hejaz Railway lies in tatters, ruins.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nIf we were to focus on reconstructing these curvy lines on the map,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\ninfrastructure, that cross the straight lines, the borders,\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nI believe the Middle East would be a far more peaceful region.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nNow let's look at another part of the world,\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nthe former Soviet Republics of Central Asia, the 'stans.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nThese countries' borders originate from Stalin's decrees.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nHe purposely did not want these countries to make sense.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nHe wanted ethnicities to mingle\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nin ways that would allow him to divide and rule.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nFortunately for them, most of their oil and gas resources\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nwere discovered after the Soviet Union collapsed.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nNow I know some of you may be thinking, \"Oil, oil, oil.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nWhy is it all he's talking about is oil?\"\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nWell, there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nand the way we're talking about it now.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nBefore it was, how do we control their oil?\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nNow it's their oil for their own purposes.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nAnd I assure you it's every bit as important to them\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nas it might have been to colonizers and imperialists.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nHere are just some of the pipeline projections\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nand possibilities and scenarios\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nand routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nA great deal of them.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nFor a number of countries in this part of the world,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nhaving pipelines is the ticket to becoming part of the global economy\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nand for having some meaning\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nbesides the borders that they are not loyal to themselves.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nJust take Azerbaijan.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nAzerbaijan was a forgotten corner of the Caucuses,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nbut now with the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline into Turkey,\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nit has rebranded itself as the frontier of the west.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nThen there is Turkmenistan, which most people think of\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nas a frozen basket case.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nBut now it's contributing gas across the Caspian Sea\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nto provide for Europe,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nand even a potentially Turkmen-\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nAfghan-Pakistan-India pipeline as well.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nThen there is Kazakhstan, which didn't even have a name before.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nIt was more considered South Siberia during the Soviet Union.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nToday most people recognize Kazakhstan\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nas an emerging geopolitical player. Why?\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nBecause it has shrewdly designed pipelines to flow across the Caspian,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nnorth through Russia, and even east to China.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nMore pipelines means more silk roads, instead of the Great Game.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nThe Great Game connotes dominance of one over the other.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nSilk road connotes independence and mutual trust.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nThe more pipelines we have, the more silk roads we'll have,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nand the less of a dominant Great Game competition\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nwe'll have in the 21st century.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nNow let's look at the only part of the world that really has brought down its borders,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nand how that has enhanced its strength.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nAnd that is, of course, Europe.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nThe European Union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nand their main purpose was really to keep the rehabilitation of Germany\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nto happen in a peaceful way.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nBut then eventually it grew into 12 countries,\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nand those are the 12 stars on the European flag.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nThe E.U. also became a currency block,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nand is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nOn average, the E.U. has grown by one country per year\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nsince the end of the Cold War.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nIn fact most of that happened on just one day.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nIn 2004, 15 new countries joined the E.U.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nand now you have what most people consider\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\na zone of peace spanning 27 countries\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nand 450 million people.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nSo what is next? What is the future of the European Union?\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nWell in light blue, you see the zones\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nor the regions that are at least two-thirds\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nor more dependent on the European Union\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nfor trade and investment.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nWhat does that tell us? Trade and investment tell us\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nthat Europe is putting its money where its mouth is.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nEven if these regions aren't part of the E.U.,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nthey are becoming part of its sphere of influence.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nJust take the Balkans. Croatia, Serbia\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nBosnia, they're not members of the E.U. yet.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nBut you can get on a German ICE train\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nand make it almost to Albania.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nIn Bosnia you use the Euro currency already,\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nand that's the only currency they're probably ever going to have.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nSo, looking at other parts of Europe's periphery, such as North Africa.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nOn average, every year or two,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\na new oil or gas pipeline opens up under the Mediterranean,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nconnecting North Africa to Europe.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nThat not only helps Europe diminish its reliance\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\non Russia for energy,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nbut if you travel to North Africa today, you'll hear more and more people saying\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nthat they don't really think of their region as the Middle East.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nSo in other words, I believe that President Sarkozy of France\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nis right when he talks about a Mediterranean union.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nNow let's look at Turkey and the Caucasus.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nI mentioned Azerbaijan before.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nThat corridor of Turkey and the Caucasus\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nhas become the conduit for 20 percent\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nof Europe's energy supply.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nSo does Turkey really have to be a member of the European Union?\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nI don't think it does. I think it's already part of\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.958\na Euro-Turkish superpower.\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nSo what's next? Where are we going to see borders change\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nand new countries born?\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nWell, South Central Asia, South West Asia\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nis a very good place to start.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nEight years after the U.S. invaded Afghanistan\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nthere is still a tremendous amount of instability.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nPakistan and Afghanistan are still so fragile\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nthat neither of them have dealt constructively\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nwith the problem of Pashtun nationalism.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nThis is the flag that flies in the minds\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nof 20 million Pashtuns\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nwho live on both sides of the Afghan and Pakistan border.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nLet's not neglect the insurgency just to the south,\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nBalochistan. Two weeks ago,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nBalochi rebels attacked a Pakistani military garrison,\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nand this was the flag that they raised over it.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nThe post-colonial entropy\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nthat is happening around the world is accelerating,\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nand I expect more such changes to occur in the map\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nas the states fragment.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nOf course, we can't forget Africa.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\n53 countries, and by far the most number\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nof suspiciously straight lines on the map.\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nIf we were to look at all of Africa\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nwe could most certainly acknowledge far more,\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.958\ntribal divisions and so forth.\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nBut let's just look at Sudan, the second-largest country in Africa.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nIt has three ongoing civil wars,\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nthe genocide in Darfur, which you all know about,\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nthe civil war in the east of the country,\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nand south Sudan.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nSouth Sudan is going to be having a referendum in 2011\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nin which it is very likely to vote itself independence.\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nNow let's go up to the Arctic Circle.\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nThere is a great race on for energy resources\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nunder the Arctic seabed.\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nWho will win? Canada? Russia? The United States?\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nActually Greenland.\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nSeveral weeks ago Greenland's [60,000] people\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nvoted themselves self-governance rights\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nfrom Denmark.\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nSo Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller.\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nWhat is the lesson from all of this?\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nGeopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline.\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nIt's constantly morphing and changing the world,\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nlike climate change.\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nAnd like our relationship with the ecosystem\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nwe're always searching for equilibrium\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nin how we divide ourselves across the planet.\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nNow we fear changes on the map.\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nWe fear civil wars, death tolls,\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nhaving to learn the names of new countries.\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nBut I believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nis far worse and far more violent.\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nThe question is how do we change those borders,\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nand what lines do we focus on?\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nI believe we focus on the lines that cross borders,\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nthe infrastructure lines.\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nThen we'll wind up with the world we want, a borderless one.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nThank you.\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:44.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Designers -- think big!", "duration": "1010", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_brown_urges_designers_to_think_big", "transcript": "I'd like to talk a little bit this morning about what happens if we move from design to design thinking. Now this rather old photo up there is actually the first project I was ever hired to do, something like 25 years ago. It's a woodworking machine, or at least a piece of one, and my task was to make this thing a little bit more modern, a little bit easier to use. I thought, at the time, I did a pretty good job. Unfortunately, not very long afterwards the company went out of business.This is the second project that I did. It's a fax machine. I put an attractive shell around some new technology. Again, 18 months later, the product was obsolete. And now, of course, the whole technology is obsolete. Now, I'm a fairly slow learner, but eventually it occurred to me that maybe what passed for design wasn't all that important \u2014 making things more attractive, making them a bit easier to use, making them more marketable. By focusing on a design, maybe just a single product, I was being incremental and not having much of an impact.But I think this small view of design is a relatively recent phenomenon, and in fact really emerged in the latter half of the 20th century as design became a tool of consumerism. So when we talk about design today, and particularly when we read about it in the popular press, we're often talking about products like these. Amusing? Yes. Desirable? Maybe. Important? Not so very.But this wasn't always the way. And I'd like to suggest that if we take a different view of design, and focus less on the object and more on design thinking as an approach, that we actually might see the result in a bigger impact. Now this gentleman, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, designed many great things in his career in the 19th century, including the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol and the Thames tunnel at Rotherhithe. Both great designs and actually very innovative too. His greatest creation runs actually right through here in Oxford. It's called the Great Western Railway.And as a kid I grew up very close to here, and one of my favorite things to do was to cycle along by the side of the railway waiting for the great big express trains to roar past. You can see it represented here in J.M.W. Turner's painting, \"Rain, Steam and Speed\". Now, what Brunel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengers was the experience of floating across the countryside.Now, this was back in the 19th century. And to do that meant creating the flattest gradients that had ever yet been made, which meant building long viaducts across river valleys \u2014 this is actually the viaduct across the Thames at Maidenhead \u2014 and long tunnels such as the one at Box, in Wiltshire. But he didn't stop there. He didn't stop with just trying to design the best railway journey. He imagined an integrated transportation system in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark on a train in London and disembark from a ship in New York. One journey from London to New York. This is the S.S. Great Western that he built to take care of the second half of that journey.Now, Brunel was working 100 years before the emergence of the design profession, but I think he was using design thinking to solve problems and to create world-changing innovations. Now, design thinking begins with what Roger Martin, the business school professor at the University of Toronto, calls integrative thinking. And that's the ability to exploit opposing ideas and opposing constraints to create new solutions. In the case of design, that means balancing desirability, what humans need, with technical feasibility, and economic viability. With innovations like the Great Western, we can stretch that balance to the absolute limit.So somehow, we went from this to this. Systems thinkers who were reinventing the world, to a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glasses working on small things. As our industrial society matured, so design became a profession and it focused on an ever smaller canvas until it came to stand for aesthetics, image and fashion. Now I'm not trying to throw stones here. I'm a fully paid-up member of that priesthood, and somewhere in here I have my designer glasses. There we go. But I do think that perhaps design is getting big again. And that's happening through the application of design thinking to new kinds of problems \u2014 to global warming, to education, healthcare, security, clean water, whatever.And as we see this reemergence of design thinking and we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems, there are some basic ideas that I think we can observe that are useful. And I'd like to talk about some of those just for the next few minutes. The first of those is that design is human-centered. It may integrate technology and economics, but it starts with what humans need, or might need. What makes life easier, more enjoyable? What makes technology useful and usable? But that is more than simply good ergonomics, putting the buttons in the right place. It's often about understanding culture and context before we even know where to start to have ideas.So when a team was working on a new vision screening program in India, they wanted to understand what the aspirations and motivations were of these school children to understand how they might play a role in screening their parents. Conversion Sound has developed a high quality, ultra-low-cost digital hearing aid for the developing world. Now, in the West we rely on highly trained technicians to fit these hearing aids. In places like India, those technicians simply don't exist. So it took a team working in India with patients and community health workers to understand how a PDA and an application on a PDA might replace those technicians in a fitting and diagnostic service.Instead of starting with technology, the team started with people and culture. So if human need is the place to start, then design thinking rapidly moves on to learning by making. Instead of thinking about what to build, building in order to think. Now, prototypes speed up the process of innovation, because it is only when we put our ideas out into the world that we really start to understand their strengths and weaknesses. And the faster we do that, the faster our ideas evolve.Now, much has been said and written about the Aravind Eye Institute in Madurai, India. They do an incredible job of serving very poor patients by taking the revenues from those who can afford to pay to cross-subsidize those who cannot. Now, they are very efficient, but they are also very innovative. When I visited them a few years ago, what really impressed me was their willingness to prototype their ideas very early.This is the manufacturing facility for one of their biggest cost breakthroughs. They make their own intraocular lenses. These are the lenses that replace those that are damaged by cataracts. And I think it's partly their prototyping mentality that really allowed them to achieve the breakthrough. Because they brought the cost down from $200 a pair, down to just $4 a pair. Partly they did this by instead of building a fancy new factory, they used the basement of one of their hospitals. And instead of installing the large-scale machines used by western producers, they used low-cost CAD/CAM prototyping technology. They are now the biggest manufacturer of these lenses in the developing world and have recently moved into a custom factory.So if human need is the place to start, and prototyping, a vehicle for progress, then there are also some questions to ask about the destination. Instead of seeing its primary objective as consumption, design thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation \u2014 the shift from a passive relationship between consumer and producer to the active engagement of everyone in experiences that are meaningful, productive and profitable.So I'd like to take the idea that Rory Sutherland talked about, this notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things, and take that a little bit further and say that I think the design of participatory systems, in which many more forms of value beyond simply cash are both created and measured, is going to be the major theme, not only for design, but also for our economy as we go forward.So William Beveridge, when he wrote the first of his famous reports in 1942, created what became Britain's welfare state in which he hoped that every citizen would be an active participant in their own social well-being. By the time he wrote his third report, he confessed that he had failed and instead had created a society of welfare consumers.Hilary Cottam, Charlie Leadbeater, and Hugo Manassei of Participle have taken this idea of participation, and in their manifesto entitled Beveridge 4.0, they are suggesting a framework for reinventing the welfare state. So in one of their projects called Southwark Circle, they worked with residents in Southwark, South London and a small team of designers to develop a new membership organization to help the elderly with household tasks. Designs were refined and developed with 150 older people and their families before the service was launched earlier this year.We can take this idea of participation perhaps to its logical conclusion and say that design may have its greatest impact when it's taken out of the hands of designers and put into the hands of everyone. Nurses and practitioners at U.S. healthcare system Kaiser Permanente study the topic of improving the patient experience, and particularly focused on the way that they exchange knowledge and change shift. Through a program of observational research, brainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping, they've developed a completely new way to change shift.They went from retreating to the nurse's station to discuss the various states and needs of patients, to developing a system that happened on the ward in front of patients, using a simple software tool. By doing this they brought the time that they were away from patients down from 40 minutes to 12 minutes, on average. They increased patient confidence and nurse happiness. When you multiply that by all the nurses in all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system, it resulted, actually, in a pretty big impact.And this is just one of thousands of opportunities in healthcare alone. So these are just some of the kind of basic ideas around design thinking and some of the new kinds of projects that they're being applied to. But I'd like to go back to Brunel here, and suggest a connection that might explain why this is happening now, and maybe why design thinking is a useful tool. And that connection is change. In times of change we need new alternatives, new ideas.Now, Brunel worked at the height of the Industrial Revolution, when all of life and our economy was being reinvented. Now the industrial systems of Brunel's time have run their course, and indeed they are part of the problem today. But, again, we are in the midst of massive change. And that change is forcing us to question quite fundamental aspects of our society \u2014 how we keep ourselves healthy, how we govern ourselves, how we educate ourselves, how we keep ourselves secure. And in these times of change, we need these new choices because our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete.So why design thinking? Because it gives us a new way of tackling problems. Instead of defaulting to our normal convergent approach where we make the best choice out of available alternatives, it encourages us to take a divergent approach, to explore new alternatives, new solutions, new ideas that have not existed before. But before we go through that process of divergence, there is actually quite an important first step. And that is, what is the question that we're trying to answer? What's the design brief? Now Brunel may have asked a question like this, \"How do I take a train from London to New York?\" But what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today?So these are some that we've been asked to think about recently. And one in particular, is one that we're working on with the Acumen Fund, in a project that's been funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. How might we improve access to safe drinking water for the world's poorest people, and at the same time stimulate innovation amongst local water providers?So instead of having a bunch of American designers come up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate, we took a sort of more open, collaborative and participative approach. We teamed designers and investment experts up with 11 water organizations across India. And through workshops they developed innovative new products, services, and business models.We hosted a competition and then funded five of those organizations to develop their ideas. So they developed and iterated these ideas. And then IDEO and Acumen spent several weeks working with them to help design new social marketing campaigns, community outreach strategies, business models, new water vessels for storing water and carts for delivering water. Some of those ideas are just getting launched into the market. And the same process is just getting underway with NGOs in East Africa.So for me, this project shows kind of how far we can go from some of those sort of small things that I was working on at the beginning of my career. That by focusing on the needs of humans and by using prototypes to move ideas along quickly, by getting the process out of the hands of designers, and by getting the active participation of the community, we can tackle bigger and more interesting questions. And just like Brunel, by focusing on systems, we can have a bigger impact. So that's one thing that we've been working on.I'm actually really quite interested, and perhaps more interested to know what this community thinks we could work on. What kinds of questions do we think design thinking could be used to tackle? And if you've got any ideas then feel free, you can post them to Twitter. There is a hash tag there that you can use, #CBDQ. And the list looked something like this a little while ago. And of course you can search to find the questions that you're interested in by using the same hash code.So I'd like to believe that design thinking actually can make a difference, that it can help create new ideas and new innovations, beyond the latest High Street products. To do that I think we have to take a more expansive view of design, more like Brunel, less a domain of a professional priesthood. And the first step is to start asking the right questions. Thank you very much.

It's a fax machine.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nI put an attractive shell around some new technology.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nAgain, 18 months later,\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nthe product was obsolete.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nAnd now, of course, the whole technology is obsolete.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nNow, I'm a fairly slow learner,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nbut eventually it occurred to me that\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nmaybe what passed for design\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nwasn't all that important --\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nmaking things more attractive,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nmaking them a bit easier to use,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nmaking them more marketable.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nBy focusing on a design,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nmaybe just a single product,\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nI was being incremental\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nand not having much of an impact.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nBut I think this small view of design\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nis a relatively recent phenomenon,\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nand in fact really emerged\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nin the latter half of the 20th century\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nas design became a tool of consumerism.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nSo when we talk about design today,\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nand particularly when we read about it in the popular press,\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nwe're often talking about products like these.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nAmusing? Yes. Desirable? Maybe.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nImportant? Not so very.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nBut this wasn't always the way.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nAnd I'd like to suggest that if we take\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\na different view of design,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nand focus less on the object\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nand more on design thinking as an approach,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nthat we actually might see the result in a bigger impact.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nNow this gentleman, Isambard Kingdom Brunel,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:10.958\ndesigned many great things in his career in the 19th century,\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nincluding the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nand the Thames tunnel at Rotherhithe.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nBoth great designs and actually very innovative too.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nHis greatest creation\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nruns actually right through here in Oxford.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nIt's called the Great Western Railway.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nAnd as a kid I grew up very close to here,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nand one of my favorite things to do\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nwas to cycle along by the side of the railway\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nwaiting for the great big express trains to roar past.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nYou can see it represented here in J.M.W. Turner's painting,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\n\"Rain, Steam and Speed\".\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nNow, what Brunel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengers\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nwas the experience of floating across the countryside.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nNow, this was back in the 19th century.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nAnd to do that meant creating the flattest gradients\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nthat had ever yet been made,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nwhich meant building long viaducts across river valleys --\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nthis is actually the viaduct across the Thames at Maidenhead --\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nand long tunnels such as the one at Box, in Wiltshire.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nBut he didn't stop there. He didn't stop\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nwith just trying to design the best railway journey.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nHe imagined an integrated transportation system\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nin which it would be possible for a passenger to embark\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\non a train in London\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nand disembark from a ship in New York.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nOne journey from London to New York.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nThis is the S.S. Great Western that he built\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nto take care of the second half of that journey.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nNow, Brunel was working 100 years before\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nthe emergence of the design profession,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nbut I think he was using design thinking\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nto solve problems and to create world-changing innovations.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nNow, design thinking begins with what Roger Martin,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nthe business school professor at the University of Toronto,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\ncalls integrative thinking.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nAnd that's the ability to exploit opposing ideas\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nand opposing constraints\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nto create new solutions.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nIn the case of design, that means\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nbalancing desirability, what humans need,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nwith technical feasibility,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nand economic viability.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nWith innovations like the Great Western,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nwe can stretch that balance to the absolute limit.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nSo somehow, we went from this to this.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nSystems thinkers who were reinventing the world,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nto a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glasses\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nworking on small things.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nAs our industrial society matured,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nso design became a profession\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nand it focused on an ever smaller canvas\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nuntil it came to stand for aesthetics,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nimage and fashion.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nNow I'm not trying to throw stones here.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nI'm a fully paid-up member of that priesthood,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nand somewhere in here I have my designer glasses.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nThere we go.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nBut I do think that perhaps design\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nis getting big again.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nAnd that's happening through\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nthe application of design thinking\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nto new kinds of problems --\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nto global warming, to education,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nhealthcare, security, clean water, whatever.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd as we see this reemergence of design thinking\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nand we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nthere are some basic ideas that I think we can observe that are useful.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nAnd I'd like to talk about some of those\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\njust for the next few minutes.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nThe first of those is that design is\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nhuman-centered.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nIt may integrate technology and economics,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nbut it starts with what humans need, or might need.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nWhat makes life easier, more enjoyable?\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nWhat makes technology useful and usable?\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nBut that is more than simply good ergonomics,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nputting the buttons in the right place.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nIt's often about understanding culture and context\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nbefore we even know where to start to have ideas.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nSo when a team was working on a new vision screening program in India,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nthey wanted to understand what the aspirations\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nand motivations were of these school children\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nto understand how they might play a role\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nin screening their parents.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nConversion Sound has developed a high quality,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nultra-low-cost digital hearing aid\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nfor the developing world.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nNow, in the West we rely on highly trained technicians\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nto fit these hearing aids.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nIn places like India, those technicians simply don't exist.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nSo it took a team working in India\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nwith patients and community health workers\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nto understand how a PDA\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nand an application on a PDA\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nmight replace those technicians\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nin a fitting and diagnostic service.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nInstead of starting with technology,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nthe team started with people and culture.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nSo if human need is the place to start,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nthen design thinking rapidly moves on to\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nlearning by making.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nInstead of thinking about what to build,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nbuilding in order to think.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nNow, prototypes speed up the process of innovation,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nbecause it is only when we put our ideas out into the world\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nthat we really start to understand their strengths and weaknesses.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nAnd the faster we do that,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nthe faster our ideas evolve.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nNow, much has been said and written about\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nthe Aravind Eye Institute in Madurai, India.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nThey do an incredible job of serving very poor patients\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nby taking the revenues from those who can afford to pay\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nto cross-subsidize those who cannot.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nNow, they are very efficient,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nbut they are also very innovative.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nWhen I visited them a few years ago,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nwhat really impressed me was their willingness\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nto prototype their ideas very early.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nThis is the manufacturing facility\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nfor one of their biggest cost breakthroughs.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nThey make their own intraocular lenses.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nThese are the lenses that replace those\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nthat are damaged by cataracts.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nAnd I think it's partly their prototyping mentality\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nthat really allowed them to achieve the breakthrough.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nBecause they brought the cost down\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nfrom $200 a pair,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:16.958\ndown to just $4 a pair.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nPartly they did this by instead of building\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\na fancy new factory,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nthey used the basement of one of their hospitals.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nAnd instead of installing the large-scale machines\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nused by western producers,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nthey used low-cost CAD/CAM prototyping technology.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nThey are now the biggest manufacturer of these lenses in the developing world\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nand have recently moved into a custom factory.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nSo if human need is the place to start,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nand prototyping, a vehicle for progress,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nthen there are also some questions to ask about the destination.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nInstead of seeing its primary objective as consumption,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\ndesign thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation --\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nthe shift from a passive relationship\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nbetween consumer and producer\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nto the active engagement of everyone\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nin experiences that are meaningful,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nproductive and profitable.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nSo I'd like to take the idea that Rory Sutherland talked about,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nthis notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nand take that a little bit further and say that\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nI think the design of participatory systems,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nin which many more forms of value\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nbeyond simply cash\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nare both created and measured,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nis going to be the major theme, not only for design,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nbut also for our economy as we go forward.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nSo William Beveridge, when he wrote the first of his famous reports in 1942,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.958\ncreated what became Britain's welfare state\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nin which he hoped that every citizen\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nwould be an active participant\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nin their own social well-being.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nBy the time he wrote his third report,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nhe confessed that he had failed\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nand instead had created a society of welfare consumers.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nHilary Cottam, Charlie Leadbeater,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nand Hugo Manassei of Participle\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nhave taken this idea of participation,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nand in their manifesto entitled Beveridge 4.0,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nthey are suggesting a framework\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nfor reinventing the welfare state.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nSo in one of their projects called Southwark Circle,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nthey worked with residents in Southwark, South London\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nand a small team of designers\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nto develop a new membership organization\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nto help the elderly with household tasks.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nDesigns were refined and developed\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nwith 150 older people and their families\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nbefore the service was launched earlier this year.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nWe can take this idea of participation\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nperhaps to its logical conclusion\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nand say that design may have its greatest impact\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nwhen it's taken out of the hands of designers\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nand put into the hands of everyone.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nNurses and practitioners at U.S. healthcare system\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nKaiser Permanente\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nstudy the topic of improving the patient experience,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nand particularly focused on the way that they exchange knowledge\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nand change shift.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nThrough a program of observational research,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nbrainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nthey've developed a completely new way to change shift.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nThey went from retreating to the nurse's station\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nto discuss the various states and needs of patients,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nto developing a system that happened on the ward\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nin front of patients, using a simple software tool.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nBy doing this they brought the time that they were away from patients\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:39.958\ndown from 40 minutes to 12 minutes, on average.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nThey increased patient confidence and nurse happiness.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nWhen you multiply that by all the nurses\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nin all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nit resulted, actually, in a pretty big impact.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nAnd this is just one of thousands\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nof opportunities in healthcare alone.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nSo these are just some of the kind of basic ideas\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\naround design thinking\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nand some of the new kinds of projects\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nthat they're being applied to.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nBut I'd like to go back to Brunel here,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nand suggest a connection that might explain why this is happening now,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nand maybe why design thinking is a useful tool.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAnd that connection is change.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nIn times of change we need\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nnew alternatives, new ideas.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nNow, Brunel worked at the height of the Industrial Revolution,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nwhen all of life and our economy\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nwas being reinvented.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nNow the industrial systems of Brunel's time have run their course,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nand indeed they are part of the problem today.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nBut, again, we are in the midst of massive change.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nAnd that change is forcing us to question\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nquite fundamental aspects of our society --\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nhow we keep ourselves healthy, how we govern ourselves,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nhow we educate ourselves, how we keep ourselves secure.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nAnd in these times of change, we need these new choices\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nbecause our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nSo why design thinking?\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nBecause it gives us a new way of tackling problems.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nInstead of defaulting to our normal convergent approach\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nwhere we make the best choice out of available alternatives,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nit encourages us to take a divergent approach,\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nto explore new alternatives, new solutions,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nnew ideas that have not existed before.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nBut before we go through that process of divergence,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nthere is actually quite an important first step.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nAnd that is, what is the question that we're trying to answer?\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nWhat's the design brief?\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nNow Brunel may have asked a question like this,\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:43.958\n\"How do I take a train from London to New York?\"\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nBut what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today?\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nSo these are some that we've been asked to think about recently.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nAnd one in particular, is one that we're working on with the Acumen Fund,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nin a project that's been funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nHow might we improve access to safe drinking water\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nfor the world's poorest people,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nand at the same time stimulate innovation\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:11.958\namongst local water providers?\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nSo instead of having a bunch of American designers\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\ncome up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate,\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nwe took a sort of more open, collaborative and participative approach.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nWe teamed designers and investment experts up with\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\n11 water organizations across India.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nAnd through workshops they developed\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\ninnovative new products, services, and business models.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nWe hosted a competition\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nand then funded five of those organizations\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nto develop their ideas.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nSo they developed and iterated these ideas.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nAnd then IDEO and Acumen spent several weeks working with them\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nto help design new social marketing campaigns,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\ncommunity outreach strategies, business models,\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nnew water vessels for storing water\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nand carts for delivering water.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nSome of those ideas are just getting launched into the market.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nAnd the same process is just getting underway\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nwith NGOs in East Africa.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nSo for me, this project shows\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nkind of how far we can go from\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nsome of those sort of small things\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nthat I was working on\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nat the beginning of my career.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nThat by focusing on the needs of humans\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nand by using prototypes\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nto move ideas along quickly,\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nby getting the process out of the hands of designers,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nand by getting the active participation of the community,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nwe can tackle bigger and more interesting questions.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nAnd just like Brunel, by focusing on systems,\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nwe can have a bigger impact.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nSo that's one thing that we've been working on.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nI'm actually really quite interested, and perhaps more interested\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nto know what this community thinks we could work on.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nWhat kinds of questions do we think\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:52.958\ndesign thinking could be used to tackle?\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nAnd if you've got any ideas\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nthen feel free, you can post them to Twitter.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nThere is a hash tag there that you can use, #CBDQ.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nAnd the list looked something like this a little while ago.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nAnd of course you can search to find the questions that you're interested in\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nby using the same hash code.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nSo I'd like to believe that design thinking\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nactually can make a

been feeling frustrated, because as a religious historian, I've become acutely aware of the centrality of compassion in all the major world faiths. Every single one of them has evolved their own version of what's been called the Golden Rule. Sometimes it comes in a positive version \u2014 \"Always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself.\" And equally important is the negative version \u2014 \"Don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you.\" Look into your own heart, discover what it is that gives you pain and then refuse, under any circumstance whatsoever, to inflict that pain on anybody else.And people have emphasized the importance of compassion, not just because it sounds good, but because it works. People have found that when they have implemented the Golden Rule as Confucius said, \"all day and every day,\" not just a question of doing your good deed for the day and then returning to a life of greed and egotism, but to do it all day and every day, you dethrone yourself from the center of your world, put another there, and you transcend yourself. And it brings you into the presence of what's been called God, Nirvana, Rama, Tao. Something that goes beyond what we know in our ego-bound existence.But you know you'd never know it a lot of the time, that this was so central to the religious life. Because with a few wonderful exceptions, very often when religious people come together, religious leaders come together, they're arguing about abstruse doctrines or uttering a council of hatred or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort. Often people don't really want to be compassionate. I sometimes see when I'm speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead. And that of course defeats the object of the exercise.Now why was I so grateful to TED? Because they took me very gently from my book-lined study and brought me into the 21st century, enabling me to speak to a much, much wider audience than I could have ever conceived. Because I feel an urgency about this. If we don't manage to implement the Golden Rule globally, so that we treat all peoples, wherever and whoever they may be, as though they were as important as ourselves, I doubt that we'll have a viable world to hand on to the next generation.The task of our time, one of the great tasks of our time, is to build a global society, as I said, where people can live together in peace. And the religions that should be making a major contribution are instead seen as part of the problem. And of course it's not just religious people who believe in the Golden Rule. This is the source of all morality, this imaginative act of empathy, putting yourself in the place of another.And so we have a choice, it seems to me. We can either go on bringing out or emphasizing the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith, or we can go back to the rabbis. Rabbi Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus, who, when asked by a pagan to sum up the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg, said, \"That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor. That is the Torah and everything else is only commentary.\"And the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that any interpretation of scripture that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate. And we need to revive that spirit. And it's not just going to happen because a spirit of love wafts us down. We have to make this happen, and we can do it with the modern communications that TED has introduced. Already I've been tremendously heartened at the response of all our partners.In Singapore, we have a group going to use the Charter to heal divisions recently that have sprung up in Singaporean society, and some members of the parliament want to implement it politically. In Malaysia, there is going to be an art exhibition in which leading artists are going to be taking people, young people, and showing them that compassion also lies at the root of all art. Throughout Europe, the Muslim communities are holding events and discussions, are discussing the centrality of compassion in Islam and in all faiths.But it can't stop there. It can't stop with the launch. Religious teaching, this is where we've gone so wrong, concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines. Religious teaching must always lead to action. And I intend to work on this till my dying day. And I want to continue with our partners to do two things \u2014 educate and stimulate compassionate thinking. Education because we've so dropped out of compassion. People often think it simply means feeling sorry for somebody. But of course you don't understand compassion if you're just going to think about it. You also have to do it.I want them to get the media involved because the media are crucial in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views we have of other people, which are dividing us from one another. The same applies to educators. I'd like youth to get a sense of the dynamism, the dynamic and challenge of a compassionate lifestyle. And also see that it demands acute intelligence, not just a gooey feeling.I'd like to call upon scholars to explore the compassionate theme in their own and in other people's traditions. And perhaps above all, to encourage a sensitivity about uncompassionate speaking, so that because people have this Charter, whatever their beliefs or lack of them, they feel empowered to challenge uncompassionate speech, disdainful remarks from their religious leaders, their political leaders, from the captains of industry. Because we can change the world, we have the ability.I would never have thought of putting the Charter online. I was still stuck in the old world of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room and issuing yet another arcane statement. And TED introduced me to a whole new way of thinking and presenting ideas. Because that is what is so wonderful about TED. In this room, all this expertise, if we joined it all together, we could change the world. And of course the problems sometimes seem insuperable.But I'd just like to quote, finish at the end with a reference to a British author, an Oxford author whom I don't quote very often, C.S. Lewis. But he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind ever since I read it when I was a schoolgirl. It's in his book \"The Four Loves.\" He said that he distinguished between erotic love, when two people gaze, spellbound, into each other's eyes. And then he compared that to friendship, when two people stand side by side, as it were, shoulder to shoulder, with their eyes fixed on a common goal.We don't have to fall in love with each other, but we can become friends. And I am convinced. I felt it very strongly during our little deliberations at Vevey, that when people of all different persuasions come together, working side by side for a common goal, differences melt away. And we learn amity. And we learn to live together and to get to know one another. Thank you very much.

I'm a spectroscopist. I have to talk about astronomy without showing you any single image of nebulae or galaxies, etc. because my job is spectroscopy. I never deal with images. But I'll try to convince you that spectroscopy is actually something which can change this world. Spectroscopy can probably answer the question, \"Is there anybody out there?\" Are we alone? SETI. It's not very fun to do spectroscopy.One of my colleagues in Bulgaria, Nevena Markova, spent about 20 years studying these profiles. And she published 42 articles just dedicated to the subject. Can you imagine? Day and night, thinking, observing, the same star for 20 years is incredible. But we are crazy. We do these things. (Laughter)And I'm not that far. I spent about eight months working on these profiles. Because I've noticed a very small symmetry in the profile of one of the planet host stars. And I thought, well maybe there is Lithium-6 in this star, which is an indication that this star has swallowed a planet. Because apparently you can't have this fragile isotope of Lithium-6 in the atmospheres of sun-like stars. But you have it in planets and asteroids. So if you engulf planet or large number of asteroids, you will have this Lithium-6 isotope in the spectrum of the star. So I invested more than eight months just studying the profile of this star.And actually it's amazing, because I got phone calls from many reporters asking, \"Have you actually seen the planet going into a star?\" Because they thought that if you are having a telescope, you are an astronomer so what you are doing is actually looking in a telescope. And you might have seen the planet going into a star. And I was saying, \"No, excuse me. What I see is this one.\" (Laughter) It's just incredible. Because nobody understood really. I bet that there were very few people who really understood what I'm talking about. Because this is the indication that the planet went into the star. It's amazing.The power of spectroscopy was actually realized by Pink Floyd already in 1973. (Laughter) Because they actually said that you can get any color you like in a spectrum. And all you need is time and money to make your spectrograph. This is the number one high resolution, most precise spectrograph on this planet, called HARPS, which is actually used to detect extrasolar planets and sound waves in the atmospheres of stars.How we get spectra? I'm sure most of you know from school physics that it's basically splitting a white light into colors. And if you have a liquid hot mass, it will produce something which we call a continuous spectrum. A hot gas is producing emission lines only, no continuum. And if you place a cool gas in front of a hot source, you will see certain patterns which we call absorption lines. Which is used actually to identify chemical elements in a cool matter, which is absorbing exactly at those frequencies.Now, what we can do with the spectra? We can actually study line-of-sight velocities of cosmic objects. And we can also study chemical composition and physical parameters of stars, galaxies, nebulae. A star is the most simple object. In the core, we have thermonuclear reactions going on, creating chemical elements. And we have a cool atmosphere. It's cool for me. Cool in my terms is three or four or five thousand degrees. My colleagues in infra-red astronomy call minus 200 Kelvin is cool for them. But you know, everything is relative. So for me 5,000 degrees is pretty cool. (Laughter)This is the spectrum of the Sun \u2014 24,000 spectral lines, and about 15 percent of these lines is not yet identified. It is amazing. So we are in the 21st century, and we still cannot properly understand the spectrum of the sun. Sometimes we have to deal with just one tiny, weak spectral line to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere. For instance, you see the spectral line of the gold is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the Sun. And we use this weak feature to measure the composition of gold in the atmosphere of the Sun.And now this is a work in progress. We have been dealing with a similarly very weak feature, which belongs to osmium. It's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae. It's the only place where you can produce, actually, osmium. Just comparing the composition of osmium in one of the planet host stars, we want to understand why there is so much of this element. Perhaps we even think that maybe supernova explosions trigger formations of planets and stars. It can be an indication.The other day, my colleague from Berkeley, Gibor Basri, emailed me a very interesting spectrum, asking me, \"Can you have a look at this?\" And I couldn't sleep, next two weeks, when I saw the huge amount of oxygen and other elements in the spectrum of the stars. I knew that there is nothing like that observed in the galaxy. It was incredible. The only conclusion we could make from this is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion in this system, which polluted the atmosphere of this star. And later a black hole was formed in a binary system, which is still there with a mass of about five solar masses. This was considered as first evidence that actually black holes come from supernovae explosions.My colleagues, comparing composition of chemical elements in different galactic stars, actually discovered alien stars in our galaxy. It's amazing that you can go so far simply studying the chemical composition of stars. They actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra is an alien. It comes from a different galaxy. There is interaction of galaxies. We know this. And sometimes they just capture stars.You've heard about solar flares. We were very surprised to discover a super flare, a flare which is thousands of millions of times more powerful than those we see in the Sun. In one of the binary stars in our galaxy called FH Leo, we discovered the super flare. And later we went to study the spectral stars to see is there anything strange with these objects. And we found that everything is normal. These stars are normal like the Sun. Age, everything was normal. So this is a mystery. It's one of the mysteries we still have, super flares. And there are six or seven similar cases reported in the literature.Now to go ahead with this, we really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe. It's very complicated. I don't really want you to try to understand what is here. (Laughter) But it's to show you how complicated is the whole story of the production of chemical elements. You have two channels \u2014 the massive stars and low-mass stars \u2014 producing and recycling matter and chemical elements in the universe. And doing this for 14 billion years, we end up with this picture, which is a very important graph, showing relative abundances of chemical elements in sun-like stars and in the interstellar medium.So which means that it's really impossible to find an object where you find about 10 times more sulfur than silicon, five times more calcium than oxygen. It's just impossible. And if you find one, I will say that this is something related to SETI, because naturally you can't do it. Doppler Effect is something very important from fundamental physics. And this is related to the change of the frequency of a moving source. The Doppler Effect is used to discover extrasolar planets.The precision which we need to discover a Jupiter-like planet around a sun-like star is something like 28.4 meters per second. And we need nine centimeters per second to detect an Earth-like planet. This can be done with the future spectrographs. I, myself, I'm actually involved in the team which is developing a CODEX, high resolution, future generation spectrograph for the 42 meter E-ELT telescope. And this is going to be an instrument to detect Earth-like planets around sun-like stars. It is an amazing tool called astroseismology where we can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of stars.This is the sound of an Alpha Cen. We can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of sun-like stars. Those waves have frequencies in infrasound domain, the sound actually nobody knows, domain. Coming back to the most important question, \"Is there anybody out there?\" This is closely related to tectonic and volcanic activity of planets. Connection between life and radioactive nuclei is straightforward. No life without tectonic activity, without volcanic activity. And we know very well that geothermal energy is mostly produced by decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium.How to measure, if we have planets where the amount of those elements is small, so those planets are tectonically dead, there cannot be life. If there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium, probably, again, there would be no life. Because can you imagine everything boiling? It's too much energy on a planet. Now, we have been measuring abundance of thorium in one of the stars with extrasolar planets. It's exactly the same game. A very tiny feature.We are actually trying to measure this profile and to detect thorium. It's very tough. It's very tough. And you have to, first you have to convince yourself. Then you have to convince your colleagues. And then you have to convince the whole world that you have actually detected something like this in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet host star somewhere in 100 parsec away from here. It's really difficult. But if you want to know about a life on extrasolar planets, you have to do this job. Because you have to know how much of radioactive element you have in those systems.The one way to discover about aliens is to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals. If you receive something interesting, well that's what SETI does actually, what SETI has been doing for many years. I think the most promising way is to go for biomarkers. You can see the spectrum of the Earth, this Earthshine spectrum, and that is a very clear signal. The slope which is coming, which we call a Red Edge, is a detection of vegetated area. It's amazing that we can detect vegetation from a spectrum. Now imagine doing this test for other planets.Now very recently, very recently, I'm talking about last six, seven, eight months, water, methane, carbon dioxide have been detected in the spectrum of a planet outside the solar system. It's amazing. So this is the power of spectroscopy. You can actually go and detect and study a chemical composition of planets far, far, far from solar system. We have to detect oxygen or ozone to make sure that we have all necessary conditions to have life.Cosmic miracles are something which can be related to SETI. Now imagine an object, amazing object, or something which we cannot explain when we just stand up and say, \"Look, we give up. Physics doesn't work.\" So it's something which you can always refer to SETI and say, \"Well, somebody must be doing this, somehow.\"And with the known physics etc, it's something actually which has been pointed out by Frank Drake, many years ago, and Shklovsky. If you see, in the spectrum of a planet host star, if you see strange chemical elements, it can be a signal from a civilization which is there and they want to signal about it. They want to actually signal their presence through these spectral lines, in the spectrum of a star, in different ways.There can be different ways doing this. One is, for instance, technetium is a radioactive element with a decay time of 4.2 million years. If you suddenly observe technetium in a sun-like star, you can be sure that somebody has put this element in the atmosphere, because in a natural way it is impossible to do this. Now we are reviewing the spectra of about 300 stars with extrasolar planets. And we are doing this job since 2000 and it's a very heavy project. We have been working very hard. And we have some interesting cases, candidates, so on, things which we can't really explain. And I hope in the near future we can confirm this.So the main question: \"Are we alone?\" I think it will not come from UFOs. It will not come from radio signals. I think it will come from a spectrum like this. It is the spectrum of a planet like Earth, showing a presence of nitrogen dioxide, as a clear signal of life, and oxygen and ozone. If, one day, and I think it will be within 15 years from now, or 20 years. If we discover a spectrum like this we can be sure that there is life on that planet. In about five years we will discover planets like Earth, around sun-like stars, the same distance as the Earth from the Sun. It will take about five years. And then we will need another 10, 15 years with space projects to get the spectra of Earth-like planets like the one I showed you. And if we see the nitrogen dioxide and oxygen, I think we have the perfect E.T. Thank you very much.

The only conclusion we could make from this\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nis clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nin this system, which polluted the atmosphere\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nof this star.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nAnd later a black hole was formed\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nin a binary system,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nwhich is still there with a mass of about\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nfive solar masses.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nThis was considered as first evidence that actually black holes\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.958\ncome from supernovae explosions.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nMy colleagues, comparing composition of chemical elements\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nin different galactic stars,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nactually discovered alien stars in our galaxy.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nIt's amazing that you can go so far\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nsimply studying the chemical composition of stars.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nThey actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nis an alien. It comes from a different galaxy.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nThere is interaction of galaxies. We know this.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nAnd sometimes they just capture stars.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nYou've heard about solar flares.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nWe were very surprised to discover\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\na super flare,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\na flare which is thousands of millions of times\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nmore powerful than those we see in the Sun.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nIn one of the binary stars in our galaxy\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\ncalled FH Leo,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nwe discovered the super flare.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAnd later we went to study the spectral stars\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nto see is there anything strange with these objects.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAnd we found that everything is normal.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nThese stars are normal like the Sun. Age, everything was normal.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nSo this is a mystery.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nIt's one of the mysteries we still have, super flares.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nAnd there are six or seven similar cases\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nreported in the literature.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nNow to go ahead with this,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nwe really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nIt's very complicated. I don't really want you to\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\ntry to understand what is here.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:07:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nBut it's to show you how complicated is the whole story\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nof the production of chemical elements.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nYou have two channels --\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nthe massive stars and low-mass stars --\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nproducing and recycling matter and chemical elements in the universe.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nAnd doing this for 14 billion years,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nwe end up with this picture,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nwhich is a very important graph,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nshowing relative abundances of chemical elements\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nin sun-like stars\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nand in the interstellar medium.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nSo which means that it's really impossible\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nto find an object where you find about 10 times more sulfur than silicon,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nfive times more calcium than oxygen. It's just impossible.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nAnd if you find one, I will say that\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nthis is something related to SETI,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nbecause naturally you can't do it.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nDoppler Effect is something very important\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nfrom fundamental physics.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nAnd this is related to the change of the frequency\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nof a moving source.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nThe Doppler Effect is used to discover extrasolar planets.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nThe precision which we need\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nto discover a Jupiter-like planet\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\naround a sun-like star\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nis something like 28.4 meters per second.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nAnd we need nine centimeters per second\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nto detect an Earth-like planet.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nThis can be done with the future spectrographs.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nI, myself, I'm actually involved in the team\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nwhich is developing a CODEX,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nhigh resolution, future generation spectrograph\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nfor the 42 meter E-ELT telescope.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nAnd this is going to be an instrument\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nto detect Earth-like planets\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\naround sun-like stars.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nIt is an amazing tool called astroseismology\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nwhere we can detect sound waves\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nin the atmospheres of stars.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nThis is the sound of an Alpha Cen.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nWe can detect sound waves\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nin the atmospheres of sun-like stars.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nThose waves have frequencies\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nin infrasound domain, the sound actually nobody knows, domain.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nComing back to the most important question,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\n\"Is there anybody out there?\"\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nThis is closely related\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nto tectonic and volcanic activity of planets.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nConnection between life\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nand radioactive nuclei\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nis straightforward.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nNo life without tectonic activity,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nwithout volcanic activity.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nAnd we know very well that geothermal energy\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nis mostly produced by decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nHow to measure, if we have planets\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nwhere the amount of those elements is small,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nso those planets are tectonically dead,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nthere cannot be life.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nIf there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nprobably, again, there would be no life.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nBecause can you imagine everything boiling?\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nIt's too much energy on a planet.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nNow, we have been measuring abundance\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nof thorium in one of the stars with extrasolar planets.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nIt's exactly the same game. A very tiny feature.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nWe are actually trying to measure this profile\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nand to detect thorium.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nIt's very tough. It's very tough.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nAnd you have to, first you have to convince yourself.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nThen you have to convince your colleagues.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nAnd then you have to convince the whole world\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nthat you have actually detected something like this\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nin the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nhost star somewhere in 100 parsec away from here.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nIt's really difficult.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nBut if you want to know about a life on extrasolar planets,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nyou have to do this job.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nBecause you have to know how much of radioactive element you have\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nin those systems.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nThe one way to discover about aliens\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nis to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nIf you receive something interesting,\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nwell that's what SETI does actually,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nwhat SETI has been doing for many years.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nI think the most promising way\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nis to go for biomarkers.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nYou can see the spectrum of the Earth, this Earthshine spectrum,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nand that is a very clear signal.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nThe slope which is coming, which we call a Red Edge,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nis a detection of vegetated area.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nIt's amazing that we can detect vegetation\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nfrom a spectrum.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nNow imagine doing this test\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nfor other planets.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nNow very recently, very recently,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nI'm talking about last six, seven, eight months,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nwater, methane, carbon dioxide\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nhave been detected in the spectrum\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nof a planet outside the solar system.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nIt's amazing. So this is the power of spectroscopy.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nYou can actually go and detect\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nand study a chemical composition of planets\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nfar, far, far from solar system.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nWe have to detect oxygen or ozone\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nto make sure that we have all necessary conditions\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nto have life.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nCosmic miracles are something\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nwhich can be related to SETI.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nNow imagine an object, amazing object,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nor something which we cannot explain\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nwhen we just stand up and say,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\n\"Look, we give up. Physics doesn't work.\"\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nSo it's something which you can always refer to SETI and say,\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:16.958\n\"Well, somebody must be doing this, somehow.\"\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nAnd with the known physics etc,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nit's something actually which has been pointed out\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nby Frank Drake,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nmany years ago, and Shklovsky.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nIf you see, in the spectrum of a planet host star,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nif you see strange chemical elements,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nit can be a signal from a civilization\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nwhich is there and they want to signal about it.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nThey want to actually signal their presence\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nthrough these spectral lines,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nin the spectrum of a star, in different ways.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nThere can be different ways doing this.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nOne is, for instance, technetium\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nis a radioactive element\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nwith a decay time of 4.2 million years.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nIf you suddenly observe technetium\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nin a sun-like star,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nyou can be sure that somebody has put this\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nelement in the atmosphere,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nbecause in a natural way it is impossible to do this.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nNow we are reviewing the spectra of about\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\n300 stars with extrasolar planets.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nAnd we are doing this job since 2000\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nand it's a very heavy project.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nWe have been working very hard.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd we have some interesting cases,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:31.958\ncandidates, so on, things which we can't really explain.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nAnd I hope in the near future\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nwe can confirm this.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nSo the main question: \"Are we alone?\"\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nI think it will not come from UFOs.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nIt will not come from radio signals.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nI think it will come from a spectrum like this.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nIt is the spectrum of a planet like Earth,\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nshowing a presence of nitrogen dioxide,\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nas a clear signal of life,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nand oxygen and ozone.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nIf, one day, and I think it will be\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nwithin 15 years from now, or 20 years.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nIf we discover a spectrum like this\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nwe can be sure that there is life on that planet.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nIn about five years we will discover\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nplanets like Earth, around sun-like stars,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nthe same distance as the Earth from the Sun.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nIt will take about five years.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nAnd then we will need another 10, 15 years\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nwith space projects\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nto get the spectra of Earth-like planets like the one I showed you.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nAnd if we see the nitrogen dioxide\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nand oxygen,\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nI think we have the perfect E.T.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:42.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The power of time off", "duration": "1060", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/stefan_sagmeister_the_power_of_time_off", "transcript": "I run a design studio in New York. Every seven years, I close it for one year to pursue some little experiments, things that are always difficult to accomplish during the regular working year. In that year, we are not available for any of our clients. We are totally closed. And as you can imagine, it is a lovely and very energetic time.I originally had opened the studio in New York to combine my two loves, music and design. And we created videos and packaging for many musicians that you know, and for even more that you've never heard of. As I realized, just like with many many things in my life that I actually love, I adapt to it. And I get, over time, bored by them. And for sure, in our case, our work started to look the same. You see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book. Quite the similar idea, then, a perfume packaged in a book, in a die cut. So I decided to close it down for one year.Also is the knowledge that right now we spend about in the first 25 years of our lives learning, then there is another 40 years that's really reserved for working. And then tacked on at the end of it are about 15 years for retirement. And I thought it might be helpful to basically cut off five of those retirement years and intersperse them in between those working years. (Applause) That's clearly enjoyable for myself. But probably even more important is that the work that comes out of these years flows back into the company and into society at large, rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two.There is a fellow TEDster who spoke two years ago, Jonathan Haidt, who defined his work into three different levels. And they rang very true for me. I can see my work as a job. I do it for money. I likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays. And I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism. In a career I'm definitely more engaged. But at the same time, there will be periods when I think is all that really hard work really worth my while? While in the third one, in the calling, very much likely I would do it also if I wouldn't be financially compensated for it.I am not a religious person myself, but I did look for nature. I had spent my first sabbatical in New York City. Looked for something different for the second one. Europe and the U.S. didn't really feel enticing because I knew them too well. So Asia it was. The most beautiful landscapes I had seen in Asia were Sri Lanka and Bali. Sri Lanka still had the civil war going on, so Bali it was. It's a wonderful, very craft-oriented society.I arrived there in September 2008, and pretty much started to work right away. There is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself. However the first thing that I needed was mosquito repellent typography because they were definitely around heavily. And then I needed some sort of way to be able to get back to all the wild dogs that surround my house, and attacked me during my morning walks. So we created this series of 99 portraits on tee shirts. Every single dog on one tee shirt. As a little retaliation with a just ever so slightly menacing message (Laughter) on the back of the shirt. (Laughter)Just before I left New York I decided I could actually renovate my studio. And then just leave it all to them. And I don't have to do anything. So I looked for furniture. And it turned out that all the furniture that I really liked, I couldn't afford. And all the stuff I could afford, I didn't like. So one of the things that we pursued in Bali was pieces of furniture. This one, of course, still works with the wild dogs. It's not quite finished yet. And I think by the time this lamp came about, (Laughter) I had finally made peace with those dogs. (Laughter)Then there is a coffee table. I also did a coffee table. It's called Be Here Now. It includes 330 compasses. And we had custom espresso cups made that hide a magnet inside, and make those compasses go crazy, always centering on them. Then this is a fairly talkative, verbose kind of chair. I also started meditating for the first time in my life in Bali. And at the same time, I'm extremely aware how boring it is to hear about other people's happinesses. So I will not really go too far into it.Many of you will know this TEDster, Danny Gilbert, whose book, actually, I got it through the TED book club. I think it took me four years to finally read it, while on sabbatical. And I was pleased to see that he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical. And I'll show you a couple of people that did well by pursuing sabbaticals.This is Ferran Adria. Many people think he is right now the best chef in the world with his restaurant north of Barcelona, El Bulli. His restaurant is open seven months every year. He closes it down for five months to experiment with a full kitchen staff. His latest numbers are fairly impressive. He can seat, throughout the year, he can seat 8,000 people. And he has 2.2 million requests for reservations.If I look at my cycle, seven years, one year sabbatical, it's 12.5 percent of my time. And if I look at companies that are actually more successful than mine, 3M since the 1930s is giving all their engineers 15 percent to pursue whatever they want. There is some good successes. Scotch tape came out of this program, as well as Art Fry developed sticky notes from during his personal time for 3M. Google, of course, very famously gives 20 percent for their software engineers to pursue their own personal projects.Anybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical? That's about five percent of everybody. So I'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up. Talk to them about if it was successful or not. I've found that finding out about what I'm going to like in the future, my very best way is to talk to people who have actually done it much better than myself envisioning it.When I had the idea of doing one, the process was I made the decision and I put it into my daily planner book. And then I told as many, many people as I possibly could about it so that there was no way that I could chicken out later on. (Laughter)In the beginning, on the first sabbatical, it was rather disastrous. I had thought that I should do this without any plan, that this vacuum of time somehow would be wonderful and enticing for idea generation. It was not. I just, without a plan, I just reacted to little requests, not work requests, those I all said no to, but other little requests. Sending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that. So I became my own intern. (Laughter)And I very quickly made a list of the things I was interested in, put them in a hierarchy, divided them into chunks of time and then made a plan, very much like in grade school. What does it say here? Monday, 8 to 9: story writing; 9 to 10: future thinking. Was not very successful. And so on and so forth. And that actually, specifically as a starting point of the first sabbatical, worked really well for me. What came out of it? I really got close to design again. I had fun. Financially, seen over the long term, it was actually successful. Because of the improved quality, we could ask for higher prices.And probably most importantly, basically everything we've done in the seven years following the first sabbatical came out of thinking of that one single year. And I'll show you a couple of projects that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical. One of the strands of thinking I was involved in was that sameness is so incredibly overrated. This whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same works for a very very few strand of companies, and not for everybody else.We were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica, the Rem Koolhaas-built music center in Porto, in Portugal. And even though I desired to do an identity that doesn't use the architecture, I failed at that. And mostly also because I realized out of a Rem Koolhaas presentation to the city of Porto, where he talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning. Which I understood after I translated it from architecture speech in to regular English, basically as logo making. And I understood that the building itself was a logo.So then it became quite easy. We put a mask on it, looked at it deep down in the ground, checked it out from all sides, west, north, south, east, top and bottom. Colored them in a very particular way by having a friend of mine write a piece of software, the Casa da Musica Logo Generator. That's connected to a scanner. You put any image in there, like that Beethoven image. And the software, in a second, will give you the Casa da Musica Beethoven logo. Which, when you actually have to design a Beethoven poster, comes in handy, because the visual information of the logo and the actual poster is exactly the same.So it will always fit together, conceptually, of course. If Zappa's music is performed, it gets its own logo. Or Philip Glass or Lou Reed or the Chemical Brothers, who all performed there, get their own Casa da Musica logo. It works the same internally with the president or the musical director, whose Casa da Musica portraits wind up on their business cards. There is a full-blown orchestra living inside the building. It has a more transparent identity. The truck they go on tour with. Or there's a smaller contemporary orchestra, 12 people that remixes its own title.And one of the handy things that came about was that you could take the logo type and create advertising out of it. Like this Donna Toney poster, or Chopin, or Mozart, or La Monte Young. You can take the shape and make typography out of it. You can grow it underneath the skin. You can have a poster for a family event in front of the house, or a rave underneath the house or a weekly program, as well as educational services.Second insight. So far, until that point I had been mostly involved or used the language of design for promotional purposes, which was fine with me. On one hand I have nothing against selling. My parents are both salespeople. But I did feel that I spent so much time learning this language, why do I only promote with it? There must be something else. And the whole series of work came out of it. Some of you might have seen it. I showed some of it at earlier TEDs before, under the title \"Things I've Learned in My Life So Far.\" I'll just show two now.This is a whole wall of bananas at different ripenesses on the opening day in this gallery in New York. It says, \"Self-confidence produces fine results.\" This is after a week. After two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, five weeks. And you see the self confidence almost comes back, but not quite. These are some pictures visitors sent to me. (Laughter)And then the city of Amsterdam gave us a plaza and asked us to do something. We used the stone plates as a grid for our little piece. We got 250,000 coins from the central bank, at different darknesses. So we got brand new ones, shiny ones, medium ones, and very old, dark ones. And with the help of 100 volunteers, over a week, created this fairly floral typography that spelled, \"Obsessions make my life worse and my work better.\"And the idea of course was to make the type so precious that as an audience you would be in between, \"Should I really take as much money as I can? Or should I leave the piece intact as it is right now?\" While we built all this up during that week, with the 100 volunteers, a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza got very close to it and quite loved it. So when it was finally done, and in the first night a guy came with big plastic bags and scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry, one of the neighbors called the police.And the Amsterdam police in all their wisdom, came, saw, and they wanted to protect the artwork. And they swept it all up and put it into custody at police headquarters. (Laughter) I think you see, you see them sweeping. You see them sweeping right here. That's the police, getting rid of it all. So after eight hours that's pretty much all that was left of the whole thing. (Laughter)We are also working on the start of a bigger project in Bali. It's a movie about happiness. And here we asked some nearby pigs to do the titles for us. They weren't quite slick enough. So we asked the goose to do it again, and hoped she would do somehow, a more elegant or pretty job. And I think she overdid it. Just a bit too ornamental. And my studio is very close to the monkey forest. And the monkeys in that monkey forest looked, actually, fairly happy. So we asked those guys to do it again. They did a fine job, but had a couple of readability problems. So of course whatever you don't really do yourself doesn't really get done properly.That film we'll be working on for the next two years. So it's going to be a while. And of course you might think that doing a film on happiness might not really be worthwhile. Then you can of course always go and see this guy.Video: (Laughter) And I'm happy I'm alive. I'm happy I'm alive. I'm happy I'm alive.Stefan Sagmeister: Thank you.

I do it for money.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nI likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nAnd I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nIn a career I'm definitely more engaged.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nBut at the same time, there will be periods when I think\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nis all that really hard work really worth my while?\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nWhile in the third one, in the calling,\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nvery much likely I would do it also\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nif I wouldn't be financially compensated for it.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nI am not a religious person myself,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nbut I did look for nature.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nI had spent my first sabbatical in New York City.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nLooked for something different for the second one.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nEurope and the U.S. didn't really feel enticing\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nbecause I knew them too well. So Asia it was.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nThe most beautiful landscapes I had seen in Asia\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nwere Sri Lanka and Bali.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nSri Lanka still had the civil war going on, so Bali it was.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nIt's a wonderful, very craft-oriented society.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nI arrived there in September 2008,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nand pretty much started to work right away.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nThere is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nHowever the first thing that I needed was\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nmosquito repellent typography\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nbecause they were definitely around heavily.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nAnd then I needed some sort of way\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nto be able to get back to all the wild dogs\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nthat surround my house,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nand attacked me during my morning walks.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nSo we created this series of 99 portraits on tee shirts.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nEvery single dog on one tee shirt.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nAs a little retaliation\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nwith a just ever so slightly menacing message\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\non the back of the shirt.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nJust before I left New York\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nI decided I could actually renovate my studio.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nAnd then just leave it all to them.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nAnd I don't have to do anything.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nSo I looked for furniture.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nAnd it turned out that\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nall the furniture that I really liked,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nI couldn't afford.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nAnd all the stuff I could afford, I didn't like.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nSo one of the things that we pursued in Bali\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nwas pieces of furniture.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nThis one, of course, still works with the wild dogs.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nIt's not quite finished yet.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nAnd I think by the time this lamp came about,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nI had finally made peace with those dogs.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nThen there is a coffee table. I also did a coffee table.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nIt's called Be Here Now.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nIt includes 330 compasses.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nAnd we had custom espresso cups made\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nthat hide a magnet inside,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nand make those compasses go crazy,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nalways centering on them.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nThen this is a fairly talkative, verbose kind of chair.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nI also started meditating for the first time in my life in Bali.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nAnd at the same time, I'm extremely aware\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nhow boring it is to hear about other people's happinesses.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nSo I will not really go too far into it.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nMany of you will know this TEDster,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nDanny Gilbert, whose book, actually,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nI got it through the TED book club.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nI think it took me four years\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nto finally read it, while on sabbatical.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nAnd I was pleased to see\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nthat he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nAnd I'll show you a couple of people\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nthat did well by pursuing sabbaticals.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nThis is Ferran Adria. Many people think\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nhe is right now the best chef in the world\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nwith his restaurant north of Barcelona, El Bulli.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nHis restaurant is open seven months every year.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nHe closes it down for five months\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nto experiment with a full kitchen staff.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nHis latest numbers are fairly impressive.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nHe can seat, throughout the year,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nhe can seat 8,000 people.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd he has 2.2 million requests for reservations.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nIf I look at my cycle, seven years, one year sabbatical,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nit's 12.5 percent of my time.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nAnd if I look at companies that are actually more successful than mine,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\n3M since the 1930s\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nis giving all their engineers\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:10.958\n15 percent to pursue whatever they want.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nThere is some good successes.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nScotch tape came out of this program,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nas well as Art Fry developed\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nsticky notes from during his personal time for 3M.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nGoogle, of course, very famously\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\ngives 20 percent for their software engineers\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nto pursue their own personal projects.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nAnybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical?\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nThat's about five percent of everybody.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nSo I'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nTalk to them about if it was successful or not.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nI've found that\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nfinding out about what I'm going to like in the future,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nmy very best way is to talk to people\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nwho have actually done it\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nmuch better than myself envisioning it.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nWhen I had the idea of doing one,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nthe process was I made the decision and I put it into my daily planner book.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nAnd then I told as many, many people as I possibly could about it\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nso that there was no way that I could chicken out later on.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nIn the beginning, on the first sabbatical,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nit was rather disastrous.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nI had thought that I should do this without any plan,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nthat this vacuum of time somehow would\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nbe wonderful and enticing\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nfor idea generation. It was not.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nI just, without a plan, I just reacted\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nto little requests, not work requests,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nthose I all said no to, but other little requests.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nSending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nSo I became my own intern.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nAnd I very quickly\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nmade a list of the things I was interested in,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nput them in a hierarchy, divided them into chunks of time\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nand then made a plan, very much like in grade school.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nWhat does it say here? Monday, 8 to 9: story writing;\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\n9 to 10: future thinking.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nWas not very successful. And so on and so forth.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nAnd that actually, specifically as a starting point\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nof the first sabbatical, worked really well for me.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nWhat came out of it?\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nI really got close to design again.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nI had fun.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nFinancially, seen over the long term, it was actually successful.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nBecause of the improved quality, we could ask for higher prices.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nAnd probably most importantly,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nbasically everything we've done\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nin the seven years following the first sabbatical\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.958\ncame out of thinking of that one single year.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nAnd I'll show you a couple of projects\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nthat came out of the seven years following that sabbatical.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nOne of the strands of thinking I was involved in was\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nthat sameness is so incredibly overrated.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nThis whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nworks for a very very few strand of companies,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nand not for everybody else.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nWe were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nthe Rem Koolhaas-built music center\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nin Porto, in Portugal.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nAnd even though I desired to do an identity\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nthat doesn't use the architecture,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nI failed at that.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nAnd mostly also because I realized\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nout of a Rem Koolhaas presentation to the city of Porto, where\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nhe talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nWhich I understood after I\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\ntranslated it from architecture speech\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nin to regular English,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nbasically as logo making.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nAnd I understood that the building itself was a logo.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nSo then it became quite easy.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nWe put a mask on it,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nlooked at it deep down in the ground,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nchecked it out from all sides,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nwest, north, south, east,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\ntop and bottom.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nColored them in a very particular way\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nby having a friend of mine write a piece of software,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nthe Casa da Musica Logo Generator.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nThat's connected to a scanner.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nYou put any image in there, like that Beethoven image.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAnd the software, in a second,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nwill give you the Casa da Musica Beethoven logo.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nWhich, when you actually have to design a Beethoven poster,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:36.958\ncomes in handy, because the visual information of the logo\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nand the actual poster is exactly the same.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nSo it will always fit together, conceptually, of course.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nIf Zappa's music is performed, it gets its own logo.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nOr Philip Glass or Lou Reed or the Chemical Brothers,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nwho all performed there, get their own\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nCasa da Musica logo.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nIt works the same internally with the president or the musical director,\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nwhose Casa da Musica portraits wind up on their business cards.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nThere is a full-blown orchestra\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nliving inside the building.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nIt has a more transparent identity.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nThe truck they go on tour with.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nOr there's a smaller contemporary orchestra,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:23.958\n12 people that remixes its own title.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nAnd one of the handy things that came about\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nwas that you could take the logo type\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nand create advertising out of it.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nLike this Donna Toney poster,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nor Chopin, or Mozart,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nor La Monte Young.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nYou can take the shape and make typography out of it.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nYou can grow it underneath the skin.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nYou can have a poster for a family event in front of the house,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nor a rave underneath the house\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nor a weekly program,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nas well as educational services.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nSecond insight. So far, until that point I had\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nbeen mostly involved\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nor used the language of design\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nfor promotional purposes,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nwhich was fine with me.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nOn one hand I have nothing against selling.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nMy parents are both salespeople.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nBut I did feel that\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nI spent so much time learning this language,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nwhy do I only promote with it?\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nThere must be something else.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nAnd the whole series of work came out of it.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nSome of you might have seen it.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nI showed some of it\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nat earlier TEDs before,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nunder the title \"Things I've Learned in My Life So Far.\"\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nI'll just show two now.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nThis is a whole wall of bananas\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nat different ripenesses\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\non the opening day in this gallery in New York.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nIt says, \"Self-confidence produces fine results.\"\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nThis is after a week.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nAfter two weeks,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nthree weeks, four weeks, five weeks.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nAnd you see the self confidence almost comes back,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nbut not quite.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nThese are some pictures visitors sent to me.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nAnd then the city of Amsterdam\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\ngave us a plaza and asked us to do something.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nWe used the stone plates as a grid\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nfor our little piece.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nWe got 250,000 coins from the central bank,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nat different darknesses.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nSo we got brand new ones, shiny ones,\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nmedium ones, and very old, dark ones.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nAnd with the help of 100 volunteers, over a week,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:37.958\ncreated this fairly floral typography\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nthat spelled, \"Obsessions make my life worse\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nand my work better.\"\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nAnd the idea of course was to\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nmake the type so precious\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nthat as an audience\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nyou would be in between,\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\n\"Should I really take as much money as I can?\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nOr should I leave the piece intact as it is right now?\"\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nWhile we built all this up\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nduring that week, with the 100 volunteers,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:05.958\na good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\ngot very close to it and quite loved it.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nSo when it was finally done,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nand in the first night\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\na guy came with big plastic bags\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nand scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\none of the neighbors called the police.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nAnd the Amsterdam police\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nin all their wisdom,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\ncame, saw,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nand they wanted to protect the artwork.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nAnd they swept it all up and put it into custody\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nat police headquarters.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nI think you see, you see them sweeping.

It's one of the great questions of our time. Yet it's one that's rarely asked. We take it for granted that if we go into a shop or restaurant, or indeed into this theater's foyer in about an hour's time, there is going to be food there waiting for us, having magically come from somewhere.But when you think that every day for a city the size of London, enough food has to be produced, transported, bought and sold, cooked, eaten, disposed of, and that something similar has to happen every day for every city on earth, it's remarkable that cities get fed at all.We live in places like this as if they're the most natural things in the world, forgetting that because we're animals and that we need to eat, we're actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were. And as more of us move into cities, more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me \u2014 it's soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil \u2014 in order to feed us. These are extraordinary landscapes, but few of us ever get to see them.And increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either. As more of us move into cities, more of us are eating meat, so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals. And given that it takes three times as much grain \u2014 actually ten times as much grain \u2014 to feed a human if it's passed through an animal first, that's not a very efficient way of feeding us.And it's an escalating problem too. By 2050, it's estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities. And it's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed. So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand. And that's going to pose an enormous problem. Six billion hungry carnivores to feed, by 2050. That's a big problem. And actually if we carry on as we are, it's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve.Nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land. Although at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion. We're very hungry for fossil fuels too. It takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the West. And even though there is food that we are producing at great cost, we don't actually value it. Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away. And to end all of this, at the end of this long process, we're not even managing to feed the planet properly. A billion of us are obese, while a further billion starve. None of it makes very much sense.And when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations, it's a grim picture. As we're moving into cities, the world is also embracing a Western diet. And if we look to the future, it's an unsustainable diet.So how did we get here? And more importantly, what are we going to do about it? Well, to answer the slightly easier question first, about 10,000 years ago, I would say, is the beginning of this process in the ancient Near East, known as the Fertile Crescent. Because, as you can see, it was crescent shaped. And it was also fertile. And it was here, about 10,000 years ago, that two extraordinary inventions, agriculture and urbanism, happened roughly in the same place and at the same time.This is no accident, because agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other. Because it was discovery of grain by our ancient ancestors for the first time that produced a food source that was large enough and stable enough to support permanent settlements. And if we look at what those settlements were like, we see they were compact. They were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at Ur, that were, in fact, effectively, spiritualized, central food distribution centers.Because it was the temples that organized the harvest, gathered in the grain, offered it to the gods, and then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people. So, if you like, the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them. And in fact, that's true of every ancient city. But of course not all of them were that small. Famously, Rome had about a million citizens by the first century A.D. So how did a city like this feed itself? The answer is what I call \"ancient food miles.\"Basically, Rome had access to the sea, which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away. This is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world, because it was very difficult to transport food over roads, which were rough. And the food obviously went off very quickly. So Rome effectively waged war on places like Carthage and Egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves. And, in fact, you could say that the expansion of the Empire was really sort of one long, drawn out militarized shopping spree, really. (Laughter) In fact \u2014 I love the fact, I just have to mention this: Rome in fact used to import oysters from London, at one stage. I think that's extraordinary.So Rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite. But the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre-industrial world. If we look at a map of London in the 17th century, we can see that its grain, which is coming in from the Thames, along the bottom of this map. So the grain markets were to the south of the city. And the roads leading up from them to Cheapside, which was the main market, were also grain markets.And if you look at the name of one of those streets, Bread Street, you can tell what was going on there 300 years ago. And the same of course was true for fish. Fish was, of course, coming in by river as well. Same thing. And of course Billingsgate, famously, was London's fish market, operating on-site here until the mid-1980s. Which is extraordinary, really, when you think about it. Everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port.This is another thing about food in cities: Once its roots into the city are established, they very rarely move. Meat is a very different story because, of course, animals could walk into the city. So much of London's meat was coming from the northwest, from Scotland and Wales. So it was coming in, and arriving at the city at the northwest, which is why Smithfield, London's very famous meat market, was located up there. Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on, to the northeast. I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway, and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes. And then when they hit the eastern end of Cheapside, that's where they were sold, which is why it's called Poultry.And, in fact, if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age, you can trace food coming in to it. You can actually see how it was physically shaped by food, both by reading the names of the streets, which give you a lot of clues. Friday Street, in a previous life, is where you went to buy your fish on a Friday. But also you have to imagine it full of food. Because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold.And if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830 you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from. In fact, if you were having Sunday lunch, the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window about three days earlier. So this was obviously an organic city, part of an organic cycle. And then 10 years later everything changed.This is an image of the Great Western in 1840. And as you can see, some of the earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep. So all of a sudden, these animals are no longer walking into market. They're being slaughtered out of sight and mind, somewhere in the countryside. And they're coming into the city by rail. And this changes everything. To start off with, it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities, really any size and shape, in any place. Cities used to be constrained by geography; they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means. All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography.And as you can see from these maps of London, in the 90 years after the trains came, it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot, and so on, to a large splurge, that would be very, very difficult to feed with anybody on foot, either animals or people. And of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars, and really this marks the end of this process. It's the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all.And this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell, devoid of mess, certainly devoid of people, because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape. In fact, what they did to get food was they got in their cars, drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts, came back with a week's worth of shopping, and wondered what on earth to do with it. And this really is the moment when our relationship, both with food and cities, changes completely.Here we have food \u2014 that used to be the center, the social core of the city \u2014 at the periphery. It used to be a social event, buying and selling food. Now it's anonymous. We used to cook; now we just add water, or a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something. We don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat. We just read the back of a label on a packet. And we don't value food. We don't trust it. So instead of trusting it, we fear it. And instead of valuing it, we throw it away.One of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they've made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder. By making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place, they've actually distanced us from our most important relationship, which is that of us and nature. And also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver, that, as we've seen, are unsustainable.So what are we going to do about that? It's not a new question. 500 years ago it's what Thomas More was asking himself. This is the frontispiece of his book \"Utopia.\" And it was a series of semi-independent city-states, if that sounds remotely familiar, a day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad, and grew vegetables in their back gardens, and ate communal meals together, and so on. And I think you could argue that food is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia, even though More never framed it that way.And here is another very famous \"Utopian\" vision, that of Ebenezer Howard, \"The Garden City.\" Same idea: series of semi-independent city-states, little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around, joined to one another by railway. And again, food could be said to be the ordering principle of his vision. It even got built, but nothing to do with this vision that Howard had. And that is the problem with these Utopian ideas, that they are Utopian.Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately. It was a kind of joke, because it's got a double derivation from the Greek. It can either mean a good place, or no place. Because it's an ideal. It's an imaginary thing. We can't have it. And I think, as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling, that makes it not much use. So I've come up with an alternative, which is Sitopia, from the ancient Greek, \"sitos\" for food, and \"topos\" for place.I believe we already live in Sitopia. We live in a world shaped by food, and if we realize that, we can use food as a really powerful tool \u2014 a conceptual tool, design tool, to shape the world differently. So if we were to do that, what might Sitopia look like? Well I think it looks a bit like this. I have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog. But anyway, this is \u2014 (Laughter) it's food at the center of life, at the center of family life, being celebrated, being enjoyed, people taking time for it. This is where food should be in our society.But you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this. By the way, these can be men as well. It's people who think about food, who think ahead, who plan, who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them. We need these people. We're part of a network. Because without these kinds of people we can't have places like this. Here, I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable. But networks, markets where food is being grown locally. It's common. It's fresh. It's part of the social life of the city. Because without that, you can't have this kind of place, food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape, and is not just a zero-sum commodity off in some unseen hell-hole. Cows with a view. Steaming piles of humus. This is basically bringing the whole thing together.And this is a community project I visited recently in Toronto. It's a greenhouse, where kids get told all about food and growing their own food. Here is a plant called Kevin, or maybe it's a plant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don't know. But anyway, these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important.So Sitopia, for me, is really a way of seeing. It's basically recognizing that Sitopia already exists in little pockets everywhere. The trick is to join them up, to use food as a way of seeing. And if we do that, we're going to stop seeing cities as big, metropolitan, unproductive blobs, like this. We're going to see them more like this, as part of the productive, organic framework of which they are inevitably a part, symbiotically connected. But of course, that's not a great image either, because we need not to be producing food like this anymore. We need to be thinking more about permaculture, which is why I think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing. It's a re-conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives.The best image I know of this is from 650 years ago. It's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's \"Allegory of Good Government.\" It's about the relationship between the city and the countryside. And I think the message of this is very clear. If the city looks after the country, the country will look after the city. And I want us to ask now, what would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today? What would an allegory of good government look like today? Because I think it's an urgent question. It's one we have to ask, and we have to start answering. We know we are what we eat. We need to realize that the world is also what we eat. But if we take that idea, we can use food as a really powerful tool to shape the world better. Thank you very much.

And actually if we carry on as we are,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nit's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nNineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nto create new arable land.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nAlthough at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nof existing arables to salinization and erosion.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nWe're very hungry for fossil fuels too.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nIt takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nof food that we consume in the West.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nAnd even though there is food that we are producing at great cost,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nwe don't actually value it.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nHalf the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nAnd to end all of this, at the end of this long process,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nwe're not even managing to feed the planet properly.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nA billion of us are obese, while a further billion starve.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nNone of it makes very much sense.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nAnd when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nis controlled by just five multinational corporations,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nit's a grim picture.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nAs we're moving into cities, the world is also embracing a Western diet.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nAnd if we look to the future,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nit's an unsustainable diet.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nSo how did we get here?\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nAnd more importantly, what are we going to do about it?\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nWell, to answer the slightly easier question first,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nabout 10,000 years ago, I would say,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nis the beginning of this process\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nin the ancient Near East,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nknown as the Fertile Crescent.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nBecause, as you can see, it was crescent shaped.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAnd it was also fertile.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nAnd it was here, about 10,000 years ago,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthat two extraordinary inventions,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nagriculture and urbanism, happened\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nroughly in the same place and at the same time.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nThis is no accident,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nbecause agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nBecause it was discovery of grain\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nby our ancient ancestors for the first time\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nthat produced a food source that was large enough\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nand stable enough to support permanent settlements.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nAnd if we look at what those settlements were like,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nwe see they were compact.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nThey were surrounded by productive farm land\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nand dominated by large temple complexes\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nlike this one at Ur,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nthat were, in fact, effectively,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nspiritualized, central food distribution centers.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nBecause it was the temples that organized the harvest,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\ngathered in the grain, offered it to the gods,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nand then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nSo, if you like,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nthe whole spiritual and physical life of these cities\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nwas dominated by the grain and the harvest\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nthat sustained them.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nAnd in fact, that's true of every ancient city.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nBut of course not all of them were that small.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nFamously, Rome had about a million citizens\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nby the first century A.D.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nSo how did a city like this feed itself?\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nThe answer is what I call \"ancient food miles.\"\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nBasically, Rome had access to the sea,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nwhich made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nThis is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nbecause it was very difficult to transport food over roads,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nwhich were rough.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nAnd the food obviously went off very quickly.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nSo Rome effectively waged war\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\non places like Carthage and Egypt\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\njust to get its paws on their grain reserves.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nAnd, in fact, you could say that the expansion of the Empire\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nwas really sort of one long, drawn out\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nmilitarized shopping spree, really.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nIn fact -- I love the fact, I just have to mention this:\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nRome in fact used to import oysters from London,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nat one stage. I think that's extraordinary.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nSo Rome shaped its hinterland\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nthrough its appetite.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nBut the interesting thing is that the other thing also\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nhappened in the pre-industrial world.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nIf we look at a map of London in the 17th century,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nwe can see that its grain, which is coming in from the Thames,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nalong the bottom of this map.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nSo the grain markets were to the south of the city.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nAnd the roads leading up from them\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nto Cheapside, which was the main market,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nwere also grain markets.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nAnd if you look at the name of one of those streets,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nBread Street, you can tell\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nwhat was going on there 300 years ago.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nAnd the same of course was true for fish.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nFish was, of course, coming in by river as well. Same thing.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nAnd of course Billingsgate, famously, was London's fish market,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:37.958\noperating on-site here until the mid-1980s.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nWhich is extraordinary, really, when you think about it.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nEverybody else was wandering around\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nwith mobile phones that looked like bricks\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nand sort of smelly fish happening down on the port.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nThis is another thing about food in cities:\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nOnce its roots into the city are established,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nthey very rarely move.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nMeat is a very different story\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nbecause, of course, animals could walk into the city.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nSo much of London's meat\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nwas coming from the northwest,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nfrom Scotland and Wales.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nSo it was coming in, and arriving at the city at the northwest,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nwhich is why Smithfield,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nLondon's very famous meat market, was located up there.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nPoultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on, to the northeast.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nI feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nand so the birds were coming in\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nwith their feet protected with little canvas shoes.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nAnd then when they hit the eastern end\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nof Cheapside, that's where they were sold,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nwhich is why it's called Poultry.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAnd, in fact, if you look at the map of any city\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nbuilt before the industrial age,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nyou can trace food coming in to it.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nYou can actually see how it was physically shaped by food,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nboth by reading the names of the streets, which give you a lot of clues.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nFriday Street, in a previous life,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nis where you went to buy your fish on a Friday.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nBut also you have to imagine it full of food.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nBecause the streets and the public spaces\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nwere the only places where food was bought and sold.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nyou can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nand be unaware of where your food came from.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nIn fact, if you were having Sunday lunch,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nthe chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nabout three days earlier.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nSo this was obviously an organic city,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\npart of an organic cycle.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nAnd then 10 years later everything changed.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nThis is an image of the Great Western in 1840.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nAnd as you can see, some of the earliest train passengers\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nwere pigs and sheep.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nSo all of a sudden, these animals are no longer walking into market.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nThey're being slaughtered out of sight and mind,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nsomewhere in the countryside.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nAnd they're coming into the city by rail.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nAnd this changes everything.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nTo start off with, it makes it possible\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nfor the first time to grow cities,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nreally any size and shape, in any place.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nCities used to be constrained by geography;\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nthey used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nAll of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nAnd as you can see from these maps of London,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nin the 90 years after the trains came,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nit goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nby animals coming in on foot, and so on,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nto a large splurge,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nthat would be very, very difficult to feed with anybody on foot,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\neither animals or people.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nand really this marks the end of this process.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nIt's the final emancipation of the city\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nfrom any apparent relationship with nature at all.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nAnd this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\ndevoid of mess, certainly devoid of people,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nbecause nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nIn fact, what they did to get food was they got in their cars,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\ndrove to a box somewhere on the outskirts,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\ncame back with a week's worth of shopping,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nand wondered what on earth to do with it.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nAnd this really is the moment when our relationship,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nboth with food and cities, changes completely.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nHere we have food -- that used to be the center,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nthe social core of the city -- at the periphery.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nIt used to be a social event, buying and selling food.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nNow it's anonymous.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nWe used to cook; now we just add water,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nor a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nWe don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nWe just read the back of a label on a packet.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nAnd we don't value food. We don't trust it.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nSo instead of trusting it, we fear it.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nAnd instead of valuing it, we throw it away.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nOne of the great ironies of modern food systems\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nis that they've made the very thing they promised\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nto make easier much harder.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nBy making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nthey've actually distanced us from our most important relationship,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nwhich is that of us and nature.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nAnd also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nthat, as we've seen, are unsustainable.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nSo what are we going to do about that?\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nIt's not a new question.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:56.958\n500 years ago it's what Thomas More was asking himself.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nThis is the frontispiece of his book \"Utopia.\"\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nAnd it was a series of semi-independent city-states,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nif that sounds remotely familiar,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\na day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nand grew vegetables in their back gardens,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nand ate communal meals together, and so on.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nAnd I think you could argue that\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nfood is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\neven though More never framed it that way.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nAnd here is another very famous \"Utopian\" vision,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nthat of Ebenezer Howard, \"The Garden City.\"\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nSame idea: series of semi-independent city-states,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nlittle blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\njoined to one another by railway.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nAnd again, food could be said to be\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nthe ordering principle of his vision.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nIt even got built, but nothing to do with\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nthis vision that Howard had.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nAnd that is the problem with these Utopian ideas,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nthat they are Utopian.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nUtopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nIt was a kind of joke, because it's got a double derivation from the Greek.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nIt can either mean a good place, or no place.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nBecause it's an ideal. It's an imaginary thing. We can't have it.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAnd I think, as a conceptual tool\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nfor thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nthat makes it not much use.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nSo I've come up with an alternative,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nwhich is Sitopia, from the ancient Greek,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\n\"sitos\" for food, and \"topos\" for place.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nI believe we already live in Sitopia.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nWe live in a world shaped by food,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand if we realize that, we can use food as a really powerful tool --\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:27.958\na conceptual tool, design tool, to shape the world differently.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nSo if we were to do that, what might Sitopia look like?\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nWell I think it looks a bit like this.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nI have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nBut anyway, this is -- (Laughter)\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nit's food at the center of life,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nat the center of family life, being celebrated,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nbeing enjoyed, people taking time for it.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nThis is where food should be in our society.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nBut you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nBy the way, these can be men as well.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nIt's people who think about food,\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nwho think ahead, who plan,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nwho can stare at a pile of raw vegetables\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nand actually recognize them.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nWe need these people. We're part of a network.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nBecause without these kinds of people we can't have places like this.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nHere, I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nBut networks, markets where food is being grown locally.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nIt's common. It's fresh.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nIt's part of the social life of the city.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nBecause without that, you can't have this kind of place,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nfood that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nand is not just a zero-sum commodity\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\noff in some unseen hell-hole.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nCows with a view.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nSteaming piles of humus.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nThis is basically bringing the whole thing together.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nAnd this is a community project\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nI visited recently in Toronto.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nIt's a greenhouse, where kids get told\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nall about food and growing their own food.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nHere is a plant called Kevin, or maybe it's a\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nplant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don't know.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nBut anyway, these kinds of projects\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nthat are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nSo Sitopia, for me, is really a way of seeing.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nIt's basically recognizing that Sitopia\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nalready exists in little pockets everywhere.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nThe trick is to join them up,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nto use food as a way of seeing.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nAnd if we do that, we're going to stop seeing cities\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nas big, metropolitan, unproductive blobs, like this.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nWe're going to see them more like this,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nas part of the productive, organic framework\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nof which they are inevitably a part,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nsymbiotically connected.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nBut of course, that's not a great image either,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nbecause we need not to be producing food like this anymore.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nWe need to be thinking more about permaculture,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nwhich is why I think this image just\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nsums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nIt's a re-conceptualization\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nof the way food shapes our lives.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nThe best image I know of this is from 650 years ago.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nIt's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's \"Allegory of Good Government.\"\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nIt's about the relationship between the city and the countryside.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nAnd I think the message of this is very clear.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nIf the city looks after the country,\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nthe country will look after the city.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nAnd I want us to ask now,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nwhat would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nif he painted this image today?\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nWhat would an allegory of good government look like today?\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nBecause I think it's an urgent question.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nIt's one we have to ask,\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nand we have to start answering.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nWe know we are what we eat.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nWe need to realize that the world is also what we eat.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nBut if we take that idea, we can use food\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nas a really powerful tool to shape the world better.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Tribal leadership", "duration": "999", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_logan_on_tribal_leadership", "transcript": "What we're really here to talk about is the \"how.\" Okay, so how exactly do we create this world-shattering, if you will, innovation? Now, I want to tell you a quick story. We'll go back a little more than a year. In fact, the date \u2014 I'm curious to know if any of you know what happened on this momentous date? It was February 3rd, 2008. Anyone remember what happened, February 3rd, 2008? Super Bowl. I heard it over here. It was the date of the Super Bowl.And the reason that this date was so momentous is that what my colleagues, John King and Halee Fischer-Wright, and I noticed as we began to debrief various Super Bowl parties, is that it seemed to us that across the United States, if you will, tribal councils had convened. And they had discussed things of great national importance. Like, \"Do we like the Budweiser commercial?\" and, \"Do we like the nachos?\" and, \"Who is going to win?\" But they also talked about which candidate they were going to support.And if you go back in time to February 3rd, it looked like Hilary Clinton was going to get the Democratic nomination. And there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way. But when we talked to people, it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the United States. Now what is a tribe? A tribe is a group of about 20 \u2014 so kind of more than a team \u2014 20 to about 150 people. And it's within these tribes that all of our work gets done. But not just work. It's within these tribes that societies get built, that important things happen.And so as we surveyed the, if you will, representatives from various tribal councils that met, also known as Super Bowl parties, we sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day. February 4th, we posted it on our website. This was before Super Tuesday. We said, \"The tribes that we're in are saying it's going to be Obama.\" Now, the reason we knew that was because we spent the previous 10 years studying tribes, studying these naturally occurring groups.All of you are members of tribes. In walking around at the break, many of you had met members of your tribe. And you were talking to them. And many of you were doing what great, if you will, tribal leaders do, which is to find someone who is a member of a tribe, and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe, and make introductions. That is in fact what great tribal leaders do.So here is the bottom line. If you focus in on a group like this \u2014 this happens to be a USC game \u2014 and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people, you would in fact see not a single crowd, just like there is not a single crowd here, but you would see these tribes that are then coming together. And from a distance it appears that it's a single group. And so people form tribes. They always have. They always will. Just as fish swim and birds fly, people form tribes. It's just what we do. But here's the rub. Not all tribes are the same, and what makes the difference is the culture.Now here is the net out of this. You're all a member of tribes. If you can find a way to take the tribes that you're in and nudge them forward, along these tribal stages to what we call Stage Five, which is the top of the mountain. But we're going to start with what we call Stage One. Now, this is the lowest of the stages. You don't want this. Okay? This is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen. But it's one that I think we need to learn from.Stage One produces people who do horrible things. This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech. Stage One is a group where people systematically sever relationships from functional tribes, and then pool together with people who think like they do. Stage One is literally the culture of gangs and it is the culture of prisons. Now, again, we don't often deal with Stage One. And I want to make the point that as members of society, we need to. It's not enough to simply write people off.But let's move on to Stage Two. Now, Stage One, you'll notice, says, in effect, \"Life Sucks.\" So, this other book that Steve mentioned, that just came out, called \"The Three Laws of Performance,\" my colleague, Steve Zaffron and I, argue that as people see the world, so they behave. Well, if people see the world in such a way that life sucks, then their behavior will follow automatically from that. It will be despairing hostility. They'll do whatever it takes to survive, even if that means undermining other people.Now, my birthday is coming up shortly, and my driver's license expires. And the reason that that's relevant is that very soon I will be walking into what we call a Stage Two tribe, which looks like this. (Laughter) Now, am I saying that in every Department of Motor Vehicles across the land, you find a Stage Two culture? No. But in the one near me, where I have to go in just a few days, what I will say when I'm standing in line is, \"How can people be so dumb, and yet live?\" (Laughter)Now, am I saying that there are dumb people working here? Actually, no, I'm not. But I'm saying the culture makes people dumb. So in a Stage Two culture \u2014 and we find these in all sorts of different places \u2014 you find them, in fact, in the best organizations in the world. You find them in all places in society. I've come across them at the organizations that everybody raves about as being best in class. But here is the point. If you believe and you say to people in your tribe, in effect, \"My life sucks. I mean, if I got to go to TEDx USC my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does.\" If that's how you talked, imagine what kind of work would get done. What kind of innovation would get done? The amount of world-changing behavior that would happen? In fact it would be basically nil.Now when we go on to Stage Three: this is the one that hits closest to home for many of us. Because it is in Stage Three that many of us move. And we park. And we stay. Stage Three says, \"I'm great. And you're not.\" (Laughter) I'm great and you're not. Now imagine having a whole room of people saying, in effect, \"I'm great and you're not.\" Or, \"I'm going to find some way to compete with you and come out on top as a result of that.\" A whole group of people communicating that way, talking that way.I know this sounds like a joke. Three doctors walk into a bar. But, in this case, three doctors walk into an elevator. I happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book. And one doctor said to the others, \"Did you see my article in the New England Journal of Medicine?\" And the other said, \"No. That's great. Congratulations!\"The next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said, \"Well while you were, you know, doing your research,\" \u2014 notice the condescending tone \u2014 \"While you were off doing your research, I was off doing more surgeries than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution.\"And the third one got the same wry smile and said, \"Well, while you were off doing your research, and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery, that eventually we'll train monkeys to do, or cells or robots, or maybe not even need to do it at all, I was off running the future of the residency program, which is really the future of medicine.\"And they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back. And the elevator door opened, and they all walked out. That is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe. Now, we find these in places where really smart, successful people show up. Like, oh, I don't know, TEDx USC. (Laughter)Here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation. It is moving from Stage Three to Stage Four. Let's take a look at a quick video snippet. This is from a company called Zappos, located outside Las Vegas. And my question on the other side is just going to be, \"What do you think they value?\" It was not Christmas time. There was a Christmas tree. This is their lobby. Employees volunteer time in the advice booth. Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon.Okay, we're going through the hallway here at Zappos. This is a call center. Notice how it's decorated. Notice people are applauding for us. They don't know who we are and they don't care. And if they did they probably wouldn't applaud. But you'll notice the level of excitement. Notice, again, how they decorate their office. Now, what's important to people at Zappos, these may not be the things that are important to you. But they value things like fun. And they value creativity. One of their stated values is, \"Be a little bit weird.\" And you'll notice they are a little bit weird.So when individuals come together and find something that unites them that's greater than their individual competence, then something very important happens. The group gels. And it changes from a group of highly motivated but fairly individually-centric people into something larger, into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence. Stage Four tribes can do remarkable things. But you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet. There is, in fact, another stage.Now, some of you may not recognize the scene that's up here. And if you take a look at the headline of Stage Five, which is \"Life is Great,\" this may seem a little incongruous. This is a scene or snippet from the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa for which Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Prize. Now think about that. South Africa, terrible atrocities had happened in the society. And people came together focused only on those two values: truth and reconciliation. There was no road map. No one had ever done anything like this before.And in this atmosphere, where the only guidance was people's values and their noble cause, what this group accomplished was historic. And people, at the time, feared that South Africa would end up going the way that Rwanda has gone, descending into one skirmish after another in a civil war that seems to have no end. In fact, South Africa has not gone down that road. Largely because people like Desmond Tutu set up a Stage Five process to involve the thousands and perhaps millions of tribes in the country, to bring everyone together. So, people hear this and they conclude the following, as did we in doing the study.Okay, got it. I don't want to talk Stage One. That's like, you know, \"Life sucks.\" Who wants to talk that way? I don't want to talk like they do at the particular DMV that's close to where Dave lives. I really don't want to just say \"I'm great,\" because that kind of sounds narcissistic, and then I won't have any friends. Saying, \"We're great\" \u2014 that sounds pretty good. But I should really talk Stage Five, right? \"Life is great.\"Well, in fact, there are three somewhat counter-intuitive findings that come out of all this. The first one, if you look at the Declaration of Independence and actually read it, the phrase that sticks in many of our minds is things about inalienable rights. I mean, that's Stage Five, right? Life is great, oriented only by our values, no other guidance. In fact, most of the document is written at Stage Two. \"My life sucks because I live under a tyrant, also known as King George. We're great! Who is not great? England!\" Sorry. (Laughter)Well, what about other great leaders? What about Gandhi? What about Martin Luther King? I mean, surely these were just people who preached, \"Life is great,\" right? Just one little bit of happiness and joy after another. In fact, Martin Luther King's most famous line was at Stage Three. He didn't say \"We have a dream.\" He said, \"I have a dream.\" Why did he do that? Because most people are not at Stage Five.Two percent are at Stage One. About 25 percent are at Stage Two, saying, in effect, \"My life sucks.\" 48 percent of working tribes say, these are employed tribes, say, \"I'm great and you're not.\" And we have to duke it out every day, so we resort to politics. Only about 22 percent of tribes are at Stage Four, oriented by our values, saying \"We're great. And our values are beginning to unite us.\" Only two percent, only two percent of tribes get to Stage Five. And those are the ones that change the world.So the first little finding from this is that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels so that you can touch every person in society. But you don't leave them where you found them. Okay? Tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are. So we have to have the ability to talk all the levels, to go to where they are. And then leaders nudge people within their tribes to the next level. I'd like to show you some examples of this.One of the people we interviewed was Frank Jordan, former Mayor of San Francisco. Before that he was Chief of Police in San Francisco. And he grew up essentially in Stage One. And you know what changed his life? It was walking into one of these, a Boys and Girls Club. Now here is what happened to this person who eventually became Mayor of San Francisco. He went from being alive and passionate at Stage One \u2014 remember, \"Life sucks, despairing hostility, I will do whatever it takes to survive\" \u2014 to walking into a Boys and Girls Club, folding his arms, sitting down in a chair, and saying, \"Wow. My life really sucks. I don't know anybody. I mean, if I was into boxing, like they were, then my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does. So I'm going to sit here in my chair and not do anything.\"In fact, that's progress. We move people from Stage One to Stage Two by getting them in a new tribe and then, over time, getting them connected. So, what about moving from Stage Three to Stage Four? I want to argue that we're doing that right here. TED represents a set of values, and as we unite around these values, something really interesting begins to emerge.If you want this experience to live on as something historic, then at the reception tonight I'd like to encourage you to do something beyond what people normally do and call networking. Which is not just to meet new people and extend your reach, extend your influence, but instead, find someone you don't know, and find someone else you don't know, and introduce them. That's called a triadic relationship.See, people who build world-changing tribes do that. They extend the reach of their tribes by connecting them, not just to myself, so that my following is greater, but I connect people who don't know each other to something greater than themselves. And ultimately that adds to their values.But we're not done yet. Because then how do we go from Stage Four, which is great, to Stage Five? The story that I like to end with is this. It comes out of a place called the Gallup Organization. You know they do polls, right? So it's Stage Four. We're great. Who is not great? Pretty much everybody else who does polls. If Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll, people will pay attention to the Gallup poll. Okay, we understand that. So, they were bored. They wanted to change the world. So here is the question someone asked.\"How could we, instead of just polling what Asia thinks or what the United States thinks, or who thinks what about Obama versus McCain or something like that, what does the entire world think?\" And they found a way to do the first-ever world poll. They had people involved who were Nobel laureates in economics, who reported being bored. And suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper and were trying to figure out, \"How do we survey the population of Sub-Saharan Africa? How do we survey populations that don't have access to technology, and speak languages we don't speak, and we don't know anyone who speaks those languages. Because in order to achieve on this great mission, we have to be able to do it. Incidentally, they did pull it off. And they released the first-ever world poll.So I'd like to leave you with these thoughts. First of all: we all form tribes, all of us. You're in tribes here. Hopefully you're extending the reach of the tribes that you have. But the question on the table is this: What kind of an impact are the tribes that you are in making? You're hearing one presentation after another, often representing a group of people, a tribe, about how they have changed the world. If you do what we've talked about, you listen for how people actually communicate in the tribes that you're in. And you don't leave them where they are. You nudge them forward. You remember to talk all five culture stages. Because we've got people in all five, around us. And the question that I'd like to leave you with is this: Will your tribes change the world? Thank you very much.

It's within these tribes\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nthat societies get built,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nthat important things happen.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nAnd so as we surveyed the, if you will, representatives\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nfrom various tribal councils that met,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nalso known as Super Bowl parties,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nwe sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nFebruary 4th, we posted it on our website. This was before Super Tuesday.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nWe said, \"The tribes that we're in\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nare saying it's going to be Obama.\"\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nNow, the reason we knew that\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nwas because we spent the previous 10 years\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nstudying tribes, studying these naturally occurring groups.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nAll of you are members of tribes.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nIn walking around at the break,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nmany of you had met members of your tribe. And you were talking to them.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nAnd many of you were doing what great, if you will, tribal leaders do,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nwhich is to find someone\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nwho is a member of a tribe,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nand to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nand make introductions.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nThat is in fact what great tribal leaders do.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nSo here is the bottom line.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nIf you focus in on a group like this --\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nthis happens to be a USC game --\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nand you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nand do magnification factors so you could see individual people,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nyou would in fact see not a single crowd,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\njust like there is not a single crowd here,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nbut you would see these tribes that are then coming together.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nAnd from a distance it appears that it's a single group.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nAnd so people form tribes.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nThey always have. They always will.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nJust as fish swim and birds fly,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\npeople form tribes. It's just what we do.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nBut here's the rub.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nNot all tribes are the same,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nand what makes the difference is the culture.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nNow here is the net out of this.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nYou're all a member of tribes.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nIf you can find a way to take the tribes that you're in\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nand nudge them forward,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nalong these tribal stages\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nto what we call Stage Five, which is the top of the mountain.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nBut we're going to start with what we call Stage One.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nNow, this is the lowest of the stages.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nYou don't want this. Okay?\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nThis is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nBut it's one that I think we need to learn from.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nStage One produces people\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nwho do horrible things.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nThis is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nStage One is a group where people\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nsystematically sever relationships from functional tribes,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nand then pool together\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nwith people who think like they do.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nStage One is literally the culture of gangs\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nand it is the culture of prisons.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nNow, again, we don't often deal with Stage One.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nAnd I want to make the point\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nthat as members of society, we need to.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nIt's not enough to simply write people off.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nBut let's move on to Stage Two.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nNow, Stage One, you'll notice, says, in effect, \"Life Sucks.\"\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nSo, this other book that Steve mentioned,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nthat just came out, called \"The Three Laws of Performance,\"\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nmy colleague, Steve Zaffron and I,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nargue that as people see the world, so they behave.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nWell, if people see the world in such a way that life sucks,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nthen their behavior will follow automatically from that.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nIt will be despairing hostility.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nThey'll do whatever it takes to survive,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\neven if that means undermining other people.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nNow, my birthday is coming up shortly,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nand my driver's license expires.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nAnd the reason that that's relevant is that very soon\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nI will be walking into what we call\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\na Stage Two tribe,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nwhich looks like this.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nNow, am I saying that in every Department of Motor Vehicles\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nacross the land, you find a Stage Two culture?\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nNo. But in the one near me,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nwhere I have to go in just a few days,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nwhat I will say when I'm standing in line is,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\n\"How can people be so dumb, and yet live?\"\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nNow, am I saying that there are dumb people working here?\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nActually, no, I'm not.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nBut I'm saying the culture makes people dumb.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nSo in a Stage Two culture --\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nand we find these in all sorts of different places --\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nyou find them, in fact, in the best organizations in the world.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nYou find them in all places in society.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nI've come across them at the organizations\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nthat everybody raves about as being best in class.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nBut here is the point. If you believe and you say\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nto people in your tribe, in effect,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\n\"My life sucks.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nI mean, if I got to go to TEDx USC\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nmy life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does.\"\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nIf that's how you talked, imagine what kind of work would get done.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nWhat kind of innovation would get done?\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nThe amount of world-changing behavior that would happen?\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nIn fact it would be basically nil.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nNow when we go on to Stage Three: this is the one\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nthat hits closest to home for many of us.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nBecause it is in Stage Three that many of us move.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nAnd we park. And we stay.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nStage Three says, \"I'm great. And you're not.\"\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:16.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nI'm great and you're not.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nNow imagine having a whole room of people\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nsaying, in effect, \"I'm great and you're not.\"\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nOr, \"I'm going to find some way to compete with you\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nand come out on top as a result of that.\"\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nA whole group of people communicating that way, talking that way.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nI know this sounds like a joke. Three doctors walk into a bar.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nBut, in this case, three doctors walk into an elevator.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nI happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAnd one doctor said to the others, \"Did you see my article\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nin the New England Journal of Medicine?\"\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nAnd the other said, \"No. That's great. Congratulations!\"\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nThe next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\n\"Well while you were, you know, doing your research,\" --\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nnotice the condescending tone --\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\n\"While you were off doing your research, I was off doing more surgeries\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nthan anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution.\"\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nAnd the third one got the same wry smile and said,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\n\"Well, while you were off doing your research,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nand you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nthat eventually we'll train monkeys to do,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nor cells or robots, or maybe not even need to do it at all,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nI was off running the future of the residency program,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nwhich is really the future of medicine.\"\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nAnd they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd the elevator door opened, and they all walked out.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nThat is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nNow, we find these in places\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nwhere really smart, successful people show up.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nLike, oh, I don't know, TEDx USC.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nHere is the greatest challenge we face in innovation.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nIt is moving from Stage Three\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nto Stage Four.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nLet's take a look at a quick video snippet.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nThis is from a company called Zappos, located outside Las Vegas.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nAnd my question on the other side is just going to be,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\n\"What do you think they value?\"\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nIt was not Christmas time. There was a Christmas tree.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nThis is their lobby.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nEmployees volunteer time in the advice booth.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nNotice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nOkay, we're going through the hallway here at Zappos.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nThis is a call center. Notice how it's decorated.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nNotice people are applauding for us.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nThey don't know who we are and they don't care. And if they did\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nthey probably wouldn't applaud.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nBut you'll notice the level of excitement.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nNotice, again, how they decorate their office.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nNow, what's important to people at Zappos,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nthese may not be the things that are important to you.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nBut they value things like fun. And they value creativity.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nOne of their stated values is, \"Be a little bit weird.\"\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nAnd you'll notice they are a little bit weird.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nSo when individuals come together\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nand find something that unites them\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nthat's greater than their individual competence,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nthen something very important happens.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nThe group gels. And it changes\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nfrom a group of highly motivated\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nbut fairly individually-centric people\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\ninto something larger,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\ninto a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nStage Four tribes can do remarkable things.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nBut you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nThere is, in fact, another stage.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nNow, some of you may not recognize the scene that's up here.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nAnd if you take a look at the headline of Stage Five, which is \"Life is Great,\"\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nthis may seem a little incongruous.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nThis is a scene or snippet\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nfrom the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nfor which Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Prize.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nNow think about that. South Africa,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nterrible atrocities had happened in the society.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nAnd people came together\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nfocused only on those two values: truth and reconciliation.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nThere was no road map. No one had ever done\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nanything like this before.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nAnd in this atmosphere, where the only guidance\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nwas people's values and their noble cause,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nwhat this group accomplished was historic.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nAnd people, at the time, feared that South Africa\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nwould end up going the way that Rwanda has gone,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\ndescending into one skirmish after another\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nin a civil war that seems to have no end.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nIn fact, South Africa has not gone down that road.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nLargely because people like Desmond Tutu\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nset up a Stage Five process\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nto involve the thousands and perhaps millions\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nof tribes in the country, to bring everyone together.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nSo, people hear this and they conclude the following,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nas did we in doing the study.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nOkay, got it. I don't want to talk Stage One.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nThat's like, you know, \"Life sucks.\" Who wants to talk that way?\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nI don't want to talk like they do\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nat the particular DMV that's close to where Dave lives.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nI really don't want to just say \"I'm great,\"\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nbecause that kind of sounds narcissistic, and then I won't have any friends.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nSaying, \"We're great\" -- that sounds pretty good.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nBut I should really talk Stage Five, right? \"Life is great.\"\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nWell, in fact, there are three somewhat counter-intuitive findings\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nthat come out of all this.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nThe first one, if you look at the Declaration of Independence\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nand actually read it,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nthe phrase that sticks in many of our minds\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nis things about inalienable rights.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nI mean, that's Stage Five, right? Life is great,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\noriented only by our values,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nno other guidance.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nIn fact, most of the document is written at Stage Two.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\n\"My life sucks because I live under a tyrant,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nalso known as King George.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nWe're great! Who is not great? England!\"\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nSorry. (Laughter)\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nWell, what about other great leaders? What about Gandhi?\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nWhat about Martin Luther King?\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nI mean, surely these were just people who preached, \"Life is great,\" right?\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nJust one little bit of happiness and joy after another.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nIn fact, Martin Luther King's most famous line was at Stage Three.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nHe didn't say \"We have a dream.\" He said, \"I have a dream.\"\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nWhy did he do that? Because most people\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nare not at Stage Five.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nTwo percent are at Stage One.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nAbout 25 percent are at Stage Two,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nsaying, in effect, \"My life sucks.\"\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:53.958\n48 percent of working tribes say, these are employed tribes,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nsay, \"I'm great and you're not.\"\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nAnd we have to duke it out every day, so we resort to politics.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nOnly about 22 percent of tribes\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nare at Stage Four,\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\noriented by our values, saying \"We're great.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nAnd our values are beginning to unite us.\"\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nOnly two percent, only two percent of tribes\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nget to Stage Five.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nAnd those are the ones that change the world.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nSo the first little finding from this\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nis that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nso that you can touch every person in society.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nBut you don't leave them where you found them. Okay?\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nTribes can only hear one level above and below where they are.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nSo we have to have the ability to talk\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nall the levels, to go to where they are.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nAnd then leaders nudge people\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nwithin their tribes to the next level.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nI'd like to show you some examples of this.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nOne of the people we interviewed was Frank Jordan,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nformer Mayor of San Francisco. Before that\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nhe was Chief of Police in San Francisco.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nAnd he grew up essentially in Stage One.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nAnd you know what changed his life? It was walking into\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\none of these, a Boys and Girls Club.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nNow here is what happened to this person\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nwho eventually became Mayor of San Francisco.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nHe went from being alive and passionate\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nat Stage One -- remember, \"Life sucks,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:05.958\ndespairing hostility, I will do whatever it takes to survive\" --\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nto walking into a Boys and Girls Club,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nfolding his arms, sitting down in a chair,\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nand saying, \"Wow. My life really sucks.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nI don't know anybody.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nI mean, if I was into boxing, like they were,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nthen my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nSo I'm going to sit here in my chair and not do anything.\"\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nIn fact, that's progress.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nWe move people from Stage One to Stage Two\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nby getting them in a new tribe\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nand then, over time, getting them connected.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nSo, what about moving\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nfrom Stage Three to Stage Four?\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nI want to argue that we're doing that right here.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nTED represents a set of values,\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nand as we unite around these values,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nsomething really interesting begins to emerge.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nIf you want this experience to live on\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nas something historic,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nthen at the reception tonight I'd like to encourage you to do something\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nbeyond what people normally do\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nand call networking.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nWhich is not just to meet new people\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nand extend your reach, extend your influence,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nbut instead, find someone you don't know,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nand find someone else you don't know,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nand introduce them.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nThat's called a triadic relationship.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nSee, people who build world-changing tribes do that.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nThey extend the reach of their tribes\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nby connecting them, not just to myself,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nso that my following is greater,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nbut I connect people who don't know each other\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nto something greater than themselves.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nAnd ultimately that adds to their values.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nBut we're not done yet. Because then how do we go from Stage Four,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nwhich is great, to Stage Five?\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nThe story that I like to end with is this. It comes out of\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\na place called the Gallup Organization.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nYou know they do polls, right?\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nSo it's Stage Four. We're great. Who is not great?\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nPretty much everybody else who does polls.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nIf Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\npeople will pay attention to the Gallup poll. Okay, we understand that.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nSo, they were bored.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nThey wanted to change the world. So here is the question someone asked.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\n\"How could we,\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\ninstead of just polling what Asia thinks\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nor what the United States thinks,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nor who thinks what about Obama\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nversus McCain or something like that,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nwhat does the entire world think?\"\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nAnd they found a way to do the first-ever world poll.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nThey had people involved who were Nobel laureates\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nin economics, who reported being bored.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nAnd suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nand were trying to figure out, \"How do we survey the population\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nof Sub-Saharan Africa?\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nHow do we survey populations that don't have access to technology,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nand speak languages we don't speak,\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nand we don't know anyone who speaks those languages. Because in order\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nto achieve on this great mission,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nwe have to be able to do it.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nIncidentally, they did pull it off.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nAnd they released the first-ever world poll.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nSo I'd like to leave you with these thoughts.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nFirst of all: we all form tribes, all of us.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nYou're in tribes here. Hopefully you're extending the reach\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nof the tribes that you have.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nBut the question on the table is this:\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nWhat kind of an impact are the tribes\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nthat you are in making?\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nYou're hearing one presentation after another,\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\noften representing a group of people, a tribe,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nabout how they have changed the world.\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nIf you do what we've talked about, you listen\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nfor how people actually communicate in the tribes that you're in.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nAnd you don't leave them where they are. You nudge them forward.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nYou remember to talk all five culture stages.\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nBecause we've got people in all five, around us.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nAnd the question that I'd like to leave you with is this:\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nWill your tribes change the world?\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The danger of a single story", "duration": "1129", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story", "transcript": "I'm a storyteller. And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call \"the danger of the single story.\" I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria. My mother says that I started reading at the age of two, although I think four is probably close to the truth. So I was an early reader, and what I read were British and American children's books.I was also an early writer, and when I began to write, at about the age of seven, stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read, I wrote exactly the kinds of stories I was reading: All my characters were white and blue-eyed, they played in the snow, they ate apples,(Laughter)and they talked a lot about the weather, how lovely it was that the sun had come out.(Laughter)Now, this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria. I had never been outside Nigeria. We didn't have snow, we ate mangoes, and we never talked about the weather, because there was no need to.My characters also drank a lot of ginger beer, because the characters in the British books I read drank ginger beer. Never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was.(Laughter)And for many years afterwards, I would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer. But that is another story.What this demonstrates, I think, is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in the face of a story, particularly as children. Because all I had read were books in which characters were foreign, I had become convinced that books by their very nature had to have foreigners in them and had to be about things with which I could not personally identify. Now, things changed when I discovered African books. There weren't many of them available, and they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books.But because of writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye, I went through a mental shift in my perception of literature. I realized that people like me, girls with skin the color of chocolate, whose kinky hair could not form ponytails, could also exist in literature. I started to write about things I recognized.Now, I loved those American and British books I read. They stirred my imagination. They opened up new worlds for me. But the unintended consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist in literature. So what the discovery of African writers did for me was this: It saved me from having a single story of what books are.I come from a conventional, middle-class Nigerian family. My father was a professor. My mother was an administrator. And so we had, as was the norm, live-in domestic help, who would often come from nearby rural villages. So, the year I turned eight, we got a new house boy. His name was Fide. The only thing my mother told us about him was that his family was very poor. My mother sent yams and rice, and our old clothes, to his family. And when I didn't finish my dinner, my mother would say, \"Finish your food! Don't you know? People like Fide's family have nothing.\" So I felt enormous pity for Fide's family.Then one Saturday, we went to his village to visit, and his mother showed us a beautifully patterned basket made of dyed raffia that his brother had made. I was startled. It had not occurred to me that anybody in his family could actually make something. All I had heard about them was how poor they were, so that it had become impossible for me to see them as anything else but poor. Their poverty was my single story of them.Years later, I thought about this when I left Nigeria to go to university in the United States. I was 19. My American roommate was shocked by me. She asked where I had learned to speak English so well, and was confused when I said that Nigeria happened to have English as its official language. She asked if she could listen to what she called my \"tribal music,\" and was consequently very disappointed when I produced my tape of Mariah Carey.(Laughter)She assumed that I did not know how to use a stove.What struck me was this: She had felt sorry for me even before she saw me. Her default position toward me, as an African, was a kind of patronizing, well-meaning pity. My roommate had a single story of Africa: a single story of catastrophe. In this single story, there was no possibility of Africans being similar to her in any way, no possibility of feelings more complex than pity, no possibility of a connection as human equals.I must say that before I went to the U.S., I didn't consciously identify as African. But in the U.S., whenever Africa came up, people turned to me. Never mind that I knew nothing about places like Namibia. But I did come to embrace this new identity, and in many ways I think of myself now as African. Although I still get quite irritable when Africa is referred to as a country, the most recent example being my otherwise wonderful flight from Lagos two days ago, in which there was an announcement on the Virgin flight about the charity work in \"India, Africa and other countries.\"(Laughter)So, after I had spent some years in the U.S. as an African, I began to understand my roommate's response to me. If I had not grown up in Nigeria, and if all I knew about Africa were from popular images, I too would think that Africa was a place of beautiful landscapes, beautiful animals, and incomprehensible people, fighting senseless wars, dying of poverty and AIDS, unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind, white foreigner. I would see Africans in the same way that I, as a child, had seen Fide's family.This single story of Africa ultimately comes, I think, from Western literature. Now, here is a quote from the writing of a London merchant called John Lok, who sailed to west Africa in 1561 and kept a fascinating account of his voyage. After referring to the black Africans as \"beasts who have no houses,\" he writes, \"They are also people without heads, having their mouth and eyes in their breasts.\"Now, I've laughed every time I've read this. And one must admire the imagination of John Lok. But what is important about his writing is that it represents the beginning of a tradition of telling African stories in the West: A tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa as a place of negatives, of difference, of darkness, of people who, in the words of the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling, are \"half devil, half child.\"And so, I began to realize that my American roommate must have throughout her life seen and heard different versions of this single story, as had a professor, who once told me that my novel was not \"authentically African.\" Now, I was quite willing to contend that there were a number of things wrong with the novel, that it had failed in a number of places, but I had not quite imagined that it had failed at achieving something called African authenticity. In fact, I did not know what African authenticity was. The professor told me that my characters were too much like him, an educated and middle-class man. My characters drove cars. They were not starving. Therefore they were not authentically African.But I must quickly add that I too am just as guilty in the question of the single story. A few years ago, I visited Mexico from the U.S. The political climate in the U.S. at the time was tense, and there were debates going on about immigration. And, as often happens in America, immigration became synonymous with Mexicans. There were endless stories of Mexicans as people who were fleecing the healthcare system, sneaking across the border, being arrested at the border, that sort of thing.I remember walking around on my first day in Guadalajara, watching the people going to work, rolling up tortillas in the marketplace, smoking, laughing. I remember first feeling slight surprise. And then, I was overwhelmed with shame. I realized that I had been so immersed in the media coverage of Mexicans that they had become one thing in my mind, the abject immigrant. I had bought into the single story of Mexicans and I could not have been more ashamed of myself.So that is how to create a single story, show a people as one thing, as only one thing, over and over again, and that is what they become.It is impossible to talk about the single story without talking about power. There is a word, an Igbo word, that I think about whenever I think about the power structures of the world, and it is \"nkali.\" It's a noun that loosely translates to \"to be greater than another.\" Like our economic and political worlds, stories too are defined by the principle of nkali: How they are told, who tells them, when they're told, how many stories are told, are really dependent on power.Power is the ability not just to tell the story of another person, but to make it the definitive story of that person. The Palestinian poet Mourid Barghouti writes that if you want to dispossess a people, the simplest way to do it is to tell their story and to start with, \"secondly.\" Start the story with the arrows of the Native Americans, and not with the arrival of the British, and you have an entirely different story. Start the story with the failure of the African state, and not with the colonial creation of the African state, and you have an entirely different story.I recently spoke at a university where a student told me that it was such a shame that Nigerian men were physical abusers like the father character in my novel. I told him that I had just read a novel called \"American Psycho\" \u2014(Laughter)\u2014 and that it was such a shame that young Americans were serial murderers.(Laughter)(Applause)Now, obviously I said this in a fit of mild irritation.(Laughter)But it would never have occurred to me to think that just because I had read a novel in which a character was a serial killer that he was somehow representative of all Americans. This is not because I am a better person than that student, but because of America's cultural and economic power, I had many stories of America. I had read Tyler and Updike and Steinbeck and Gaitskill. I did not have a single story of America.When I learned, some years ago, that writers were expected to have had really unhappy childhoods to be successful, I began to think about how I could invent horrible things my parents had done to me.(Laughter)But the truth is that I had a very happy childhood, full of laughter and love, in a very close-knit family.But I also had grandfathers who died in refugee camps. My cousin Polle died because he could not get adequate healthcare. One of my closest friends, Okoloma, died in a plane crash because our fire trucks did not have water. I grew up under repressive military governments that devalued education, so that sometimes, my parents were not paid their salaries. And so, as a child, I saw jam disappear from the breakfast table, then margarine disappeared, then bread became too expensive, then milk became rationed. And most of all, a kind of normalized political fear invaded our lives.All of these stories make me who I am. But to insist on only these negative stories is to flatten my experience and to overlook the many other stories that formed me. The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story.Of course, Africa is a continent full of catastrophes: There are immense ones, such as the horrific rapes in Congo and depressing ones, such as the fact that 5,000 people apply for one job vacancy in Nigeria. But there are other stories that are not about catastrophe, and it is very important, it is just as important, to talk about them.I've always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person. The consequence of the single story is this: It robs people of dignity. It makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult. It emphasizes how we are different rather than how we are similar.So what if before my Mexican trip, I had followed the immigration debate from both sides, the U.S. and the Mexican? What if my mother had told us that Fide's family was poor and hardworking? What if we had an African television network that broadcast diverse African stories all over the world? What the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe calls \"a balance of stories.\"What if my roommate knew about my Nigerian publisher, Muhtar Bakare, a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house? Now, the conventional wisdom was that Nigerians don't read literature. He disagreed. He felt that people who could read, would read, if you made literature affordable and available to them.Shortly after he published my first novel, I went to a TV station in Lagos to do an interview, and a woman who worked there as a messenger came up to me and said, \"I really liked your novel. I didn't like the ending. Now, you must write a sequel, and this is what will happen ...\"(Laughter)And she went on to tell me what to write in the sequel. I was not only charmed, I was very moved. Here was a woman, part of the ordinary masses of Nigerians, who were not supposed to be readers. She had not only read the book, but she had taken ownership of it and felt justified in telling me what to write in the sequel.Now, what if my roommate knew about my friend Funmi Iyanda, a fearless woman who hosts a TV show in Lagos, and is determined to tell the stories that we prefer to forget? What if my roommate knew about the heart procedure that was performed in the Lagos hospital last week? What if my roommate knew about contemporary Nigerian music, talented people singing in English and Pidgin, and Igbo and Yoruba and Ijo, mixing influences from Jay-Z to Fela to Bob Marley to their grandfathers.What if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in Nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband's consent before renewing their passports? What if my roommate knew about Nollywood, full of innovative people making films despite great technical odds, films so popular that they really are the best example of Nigerians consuming what they produce? What if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider, who has just started her own business selling hair extensions? Or about the millions of other Nigerians who start businesses and sometimes fail, but continue to nurse ambition?Every time I am home I am confronted with the usual sources of irritation for most Nigerians: our failed infrastructure, our failed government, but also by the incredible resilience of people who thrive despite the government, rather than because of it. I teach writing workshops in Lagos every summer, and it is amazing to me how many people apply, how many people are eager to write, to tell stories.My Nigerian publisher and I have just started a non-profit called Farafina Trust, and we have big dreams of building libraries and refurbishing libraries that already exist and providing books for state schools that don't have anything in their libraries, and also of organizing lots and lots of workshops, in reading and writing, for all the people who are eager to tell our many stories.Stories matter. Many stories matter. Stories have been used to dispossess and to malign, but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize. Stories can break the dignity of a people, but stories can also repair that broken dignity.The American writer Alice Walker wrote this about her Southern relatives who had moved to the North. She introduced them to a book about the Southern life that they had left behind. \"They sat around, reading the book themselves, listening to me read the book, and a kind of paradise was regained.\"I would like to end with this thought: That when we reject the single story, when we realize that there is never a single story about any place, we regain a kind of paradise.Thank you.(Applause)", "id":

disappointed\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.934\nwhen I produced my tape of Mariah Carey.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:48.651\nShe assumed that I did not know\nhow to use a stove.\n\n00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.996\nWhat struck me was this:\n\n00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.095\nShe had felt sorry for me\neven before she saw me.\n\n00:04:54.486 --> 00:04:57.934\nHer default position\ntoward me, as an African,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.994\nwas a kind of patronizing,\nwell-meaning pity.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:05.454\nMy roommate had a single story of Africa:\n\n00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:07.935\na single story of catastrophe.\n\n00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.656\nIn this single story,\n\n00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.934\nthere was no possibility of Africans\nbeing similar to her in any way,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.934\nno possibility of feelings\nmore complex than pity,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.934\nno possibility of a connection\nas human equals.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.081\nI must say that before I went to the U.S.,\n\n00:05:23.105 --> 00:05:25.386\nI didn't consciously identify as African.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.934\nBut in the U.S., whenever Africa came up,\npeople turned to me.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.704\nNever mind that I knew nothing\nabout places like Namibia.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.054\nBut I did come to embrace\nthis new identity,\n\n00:05:35.078 --> 00:05:37.934\nand in many ways I think\nof myself now as African.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:41.934\nAlthough I still get quite irritable\nwhen Africa is referred to as a country,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:45.934\nthe most recent example being\nmy otherwise wonderful flight\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.243\nfrom Lagos two days ago,\n\n00:05:47.267 --> 00:05:50.149\nin which there was an announcement\non the Virgin flight\n\n00:05:50.173 --> 00:05:54.934\nabout the charity work in \"India,\nAfrica and other countries.\"\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.275\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:56.434 --> 00:05:59.934\nSo, after I had spent some years\nin the U.S. as an African,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.132\nI began to understand\nmy roommate's response to me.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.983\nIf I had not grown up in Nigeria,\n\n00:06:06.007 --> 00:06:09.148\nand if all I knew about Africa\nwere from popular images,\n\n00:06:09.172 --> 00:06:14.344\nI too would think that Africa\nwas a place of beautiful landscapes,\n\n00:06:14.368 --> 00:06:15.934\nbeautiful animals,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.934\nand incomprehensible people,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.589\nfighting senseless wars,\ndying of poverty and AIDS,\n\n00:06:21.613 --> 00:06:23.934\nunable to speak for themselves\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:28.113\nand waiting to be saved\nby a kind, white foreigner.\n\n00:06:28.886 --> 00:06:31.055\nI would see Africans\nin the same way that I,\n\n00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:33.782\nas a child, had seen Fide's family.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:38.934\nThis single story of Africa ultimately\ncomes, I think, from Western literature.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:43.934\nNow, here is a quote from the writing\nof a London merchant called John Lok,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.934\nwho sailed to west Africa in 1561\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:50.621\nand kept a fascinating\naccount of his voyage.\n\n00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:55.934\nAfter referring to the black Africans\nas \"beasts who have no houses,\"\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:59.934\nhe writes, \"They are also\npeople without heads,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:03.926\nhaving their mouth and eyes\nin their breasts.\"\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.054\nNow, I've laughed\nevery time I've read this.\n\n00:07:07.078 --> 00:07:10.458\nAnd one must admire\nthe imagination of John Lok.\n\n00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:13.197\nBut what is important about his writing\n\n00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:14.934\nis that it represents the beginning\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.934\nof a tradition of telling\nAfrican stories in the West:\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:21.325\nA tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa\nas a place of negatives,\n\n00:07:21.437 --> 00:07:23.592\nof difference, of darkness,\n\n00:07:23.616 --> 00:07:28.934\nof people who, in the words\nof the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.899\nare \"half devil, half child.\"\n\n00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:34.934\nAnd so, I began to realize\nthat my American roommate\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.934\nmust have throughout her life\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:40.934\nseen and heard different versions\nof this single story,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.934\nas had a professor,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.724\nwho once told me that my novel\nwas not \"authentically African.\"\n\n00:07:47.827 --> 00:07:49.518\nNow, I was quite willing to contend\n\n00:07:49.542 --> 00:07:52.637\nthat there were a number of things\nwrong with the novel,\n\n00:07:52.661 --> 00:07:55.934\nthat it had failed in a number of places,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.197\nbut I had not quite imagined\nthat it had failed\n\n00:07:58.221 --> 00:08:00.934\nat achieving something\ncalled African authenticity.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:04.664\nIn fact, I did not know\nwhat African authenticity was.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:10.354\nThe professor told me that my characters\nwere too much like him,\n\n00:08:10.378 --> 00:08:12.354\nan educated and middle-class man.\n\n00:08:12.378 --> 00:08:14.480\nMy characters drove cars.\n\n00:08:14.504 --> 00:08:16.934\nThey were not starving.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.885\nTherefore they were not\nauthentically African.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.934\nBut I must quickly add\nthat I too am just as guilty\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.028\nin the question of the single story.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.949\nA few years ago,\nI visited Mexico from the U.S.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.625\nThe political climate in the U.S.\nat the time was tense,\n\n00:08:33.649 --> 00:08:36.934\nand there were debates going on\nabout immigration.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.934\nAnd, as often happens in America,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.934\nimmigration became\nsynonymous with Mexicans.\n\n00:08:42.656 --> 00:08:44.589\nThere were endless stories of Mexicans\n\n00:08:44.613 --> 00:08:47.934\nas people who were\nfleecing the healthcare system,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.934\nsneaking across the border,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.423\nbeing arrested at the border,\nthat sort of thing.\n\n00:08:54.121 --> 00:08:57.934\nI remember walking around\non my first day in Guadalajara,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.934\nwatching the people going to work,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.934\nrolling up tortillas in the marketplace,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.931\nsmoking, laughing.\n\n00:09:05.153 --> 00:09:07.934\nI remember first feeling slight surprise.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.934\nAnd then, I was overwhelmed with shame.\n\n00:09:11.299 --> 00:09:15.934\nI realized that I had been so immersed\nin the media coverage of Mexicans\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nthat they had become one thing in my mind,\n\n00:09:17.982 --> 00:09:19.807\nthe abject immigrant.\n\n00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:23.149\nI had bought into\nthe single story of Mexicans\n\n00:09:23.173 --> 00:09:25.680\nand I could not have\nbeen more ashamed of myself.\n\n00:09:26.029 --> 00:09:28.576\nSo that is how to create a single story,\n\n00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.934\nshow a people as one thing,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.934\nas only one thing,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.934\nover and over again,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.473\nand that is what they become.\n\n00:09:37.751 --> 00:09:40.197\nIt is impossible to talk\nabout the single story\n\n00:09:40.221 --> 00:09:41.910\nwithout talking about power.\n\n00:09:43.454 --> 00:09:45.202\nThere is a word, an Igbo word,\n\n00:09:45.226 --> 00:09:48.877\nthat I think about whenever I think about\nthe power structures of the world,\n\n00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:50.091\nand it is \"nkali.\"\n\n00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.934\nIt's a noun that loosely translates\nto \"to be greater than another.\"\n\n00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:58.440\nLike our economic and political worlds,\n\n00:09:58.464 --> 00:10:02.934\nstories too are defined\nby the principle of nkali:\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.934\nHow they are told, who tells them,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.195\nwhen they're told,\nhow many stories are told,\n\n00:10:08.219 --> 00:10:10.426\nare really dependent on power.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:15.101\nPower is the ability not just to tell\nthe story of another person,\n\n00:10:15.125 --> 00:10:18.934\nbut to make it the definitive\nstory of that person.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.054\nThe Palestinian poet\nMourid Barghouti writes\n\n00:10:21.078 --> 00:10:23.934\nthat if you want to dispossess a people,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.934\nthe simplest way to do it\nis to tell their story\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.188\nand to start with, \"secondly.\"\n\n00:10:30.442 --> 00:10:34.340\nStart the story with the arrows\nof the Native Americans,\n\n00:10:34.364 --> 00:10:36.934\nand not with the arrival of the British,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.935\nand you have an entirely different story.\n\n00:10:39.959 --> 00:10:44.391\nStart the story with\nthe failure of the African state,\n\n00:10:44.415 --> 00:10:47.934\nand not with the colonial\ncreation of the African state,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.700\nand you have an entirely different story.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.934\nI recently spoke at a university\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:57.743\nwhere a student told me\nthat it was such a shame\n\n00:10:57.767 --> 00:11:00.886\nthat Nigerian men were physical abusers\n\n00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.854\nlike the father character in my novel.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.934\nI told him that I had just read a novel\ncalled \"American Psycho\" --\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.934\n-- and that it was such a shame\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.934\nthat young Americans\nwere serial murderers.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:18.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:24.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.934\nNow, obviously I said this\nin a fit of mild irritation.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.149\nBut it would never have\noccurred to me to think\n\n00:11:32.173 --> 00:11:35.934\nthat just because I had read a novel\nin which a character was a serial killer\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:39.934\nthat he was somehow\nrepresentative of all Americans.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.934\nThis is not because I am\na better person than that student,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.934\nbut because of America's cultural\nand economic power,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.934\nI had many stories of America.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:51.934\nI had read Tyler and Updike\nand Steinbeck and Gaitskill.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.518\nI did not have a single story of America.\n\n00:11:55.629 --> 00:11:57.335\nWhen I learned, some years ago,\n\n00:11:57.359 --> 00:12:01.700\nthat writers were expected\nto have had really unhappy childhoods\n\n00:12:01.724 --> 00:12:03.934\nto be successful,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nI began to think about how I could invent\nhorrible things my parents had done to me.\n\n00:12:07.982 --> 00:12:09.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:13.934\nBut the truth is that I had\na very happy childhood,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.934\nfull of laughter and love,\nin a very close-knit family.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:20.169\nBut I also had grandfathers\nwho died in refugee camps.\n\n00:12:20.708 --> 00:12:24.934\nMy cousin Polle died because\nhe could not get adequate healthcare.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.934\nOne of my closest friends,\nOkoloma, died in a plane crash\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.934\nbecause our fire trucks\ndid not have water.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.934\nI grew up under repressive\nmilitary governments\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.934\nthat devalued education,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.934\nso that sometimes, my parents\nwere not paid their salaries.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:42.935\nAnd so, as a child, I saw jam\ndisappear from the breakfast table,\n\n00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:45.456\nthen margarine disappeared,\n\n00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.934\nthen bread became too expensive,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.829\nthen milk became rationed.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:54.615\nAnd most of all, a kind\nof normalized political fear\n\n00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:56.321\ninvaded our lives.\n\n00:12:57.781 --> 00:12:59.918\nAll of these stories make me who I am.\n\n00:13:00.415 --> 00:13:03.934\nBut to insist on only\nthese negative stories\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.934\nis to flatten my experience\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:10.622\nand to overlook the many other\nstories that formed me.\n\n00:13:11.352 --> 00:13:13.934\nThe single story creates stereotypes,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:18.934\nand the problem with stereotypes\nis not that they are untrue,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.934\nbut that they are incomplete.\n\n00:13:21.315 --> 00:13:23.918\nThey make one story become the only story.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.530\nOf course, Africa is a continent\nfull of catastrophes:\n\n00:13:27.554 --> 00:13:30.934\nThere are immense ones,\nsuch as the horrific rapes in Congo\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.584\nand depressing ones,\n\n00:13:32.608 --> 00:13:37.108\nsuch as the fact that 5,000 people apply\nfor one job vacancy in Nigeria.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:41.521\nBut there are other stories\nthat are not about catastrophe,\n\n00:13:41.545 --> 00:13:44.934\nand it is very important, it is just\nas important, to talk about them.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.934\nI've always felt that it is impossible\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.934\nto engage properly\nwith a place or a person\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:53.934\nwithout engaging with all of the stories\nof that place and that person.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:57.538\nThe consequence\nof the single story is this:\n\n00:13:57.562 --> 00:13:59.519\nIt robs people of dignity.\n\n00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:03.934\nIt makes our recognition\nof our equal humanity difficult.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:08.122\nIt emphasizes how we are different\nrather than how we are similar.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.447\nSo what if before my Mexican trip,\n\n00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:14.934\nI had followed the immigration\ndebate from both sides,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.934\nthe U.S. and the Mexican?\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:20.934\nWhat if my mother had told us\nthat Fide's family was poor\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.934\nand hardworking?\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.054\nWhat if we had an African\ntelevision network\n\n00:14:25.078 --> 00:14:28.934\nthat broadcast diverse\nAfrican stories all over the world?\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:33.289\nWhat the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe\ncalls \"a balance of stories.\"\n\n00:14:33.313 --> 00:14:37.289\nWhat if my roommate knew\nabout my Nigerian publisher,\n\n00:14:37.313 --> 00:14:38.934\nMuhtar Bakare,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.006\na remarkable man who left\nhis job in a bank\n\n00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.935\nto follow his dream\nand start a publishing house?\n\n00:14:43.959 --> 00:14:47.646\nNow, the conventional wisdom\nwas that Nigerians don't read literature.\n\n00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:48.924\nHe disagreed.\n\n00:14:48.948 --> 00:14:52.034\nHe felt that people\nwho could read, would read,\n\n00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:55.934\nif you made literature affordable\nand available to them.\n\n00:14:56.624 --> 00:14:58.934\nShortly after he published my first novel,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.934\nI went to a TV station\nin Lagos to do an interview,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:05.149\nand a woman who worked there\nas a messenger came up to me and said,\n\n00:15:05.173 --> 00:15:07.934\n\"I really liked your novel.\nI didn't like the ending.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:11.197\nNow, you must write a sequel,\nand this is what will happen ...\"\n\n00:15:11.221 --> 00:15:13.935\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:13.959 -->

"transcript": "I want to start with a game. Okay? And to win this game, all you have to do is see the reality that's in front of you as it really is, all right? So we have two panels here, of colored dots. And one of those dots is the same in the two panels. And you have to tell me which one.Now, I narrowed it down to the gray one, the green one, and, say, the orange one. So by a show of hands, we'll start with the easiest one. Show of hands: how many people think it's the gray one? Really? Okay. How many people think it's the green one? And how many people think it's the orange one? Pretty even split.Let's find out what the reality is. Here is the orange one.(Laughter)Here is the green one. And here is the gray one.(Laughter)So for all of you who saw that, you're complete realists. All right?(Laughter)So this is pretty amazing, isn't it? Because nearly every living system has evolved the ability to detect light in one way or another. So for us, seeing color is one of the simplest things the brain does. And yet, even at this most fundamental level, context is everything. What I'm going to talk about is not that context is everything, but why context is everything. Because it's answering that question that tells us not only why we see what we do, but who we are as individuals, and who we are as a society.But first, we have to ask another question, which is, \"What is color for?\" And instead of telling you, I'll just show you. What you see here is a jungle scene, and you see the surfaces according to the amount of light that those surfaces reflect. Now, can any of you see the predator that's about to jump out at you? And if you haven't seen it yet, you're dead, right?(Laughter)Can anyone see it? Anyone? No? Now let's see the surfaces according to the quality of light that they reflect. And now you see it.So, color enables us to see the similarities and differences between surfaces, according to the full spectrum of light that they reflect. But what you've just done is in many respects mathematically impossible. Why? Because, as Berkeley tells us, we have no direct access to our physical world, other than through our senses. And the light that falls onto our eyes is determined by multiple things in the world, not only the color of objects, but also the color of their illumination, and the color of the space between us and those objects. You vary any one of those parameters, and you'll change the color of the light that falls onto your eye.This is a huge problem, because it means that the same image could have an infinite number of possible real-world sources. Let me show you what I mean. Imagine that this is the back of your eye, okay? And these are two projections from the world. They're identical in every single way. Identical in shape, size, spectral content. They are the same, as far as your eye is concerned. And yet they come from completely different sources. The one on the right comes from a yellow surface, in shadow, oriented facing the left, viewed through a pinkish medium. The one on the left comes from an orange surface, under direct light, facing to the right, viewed through sort of a bluish medium. Completely different meanings, giving rise to the exact same retinal information. And yet it's only the retinal information that we get.So how on Earth do we even see? So if you remember anything in this next 18 minutes, remember this: that the light that falls onto your eye, sensory information, is meaningless, because it could mean literally anything. And what's true for sensory information is true for information generally. There's no inherent meaning in information. It's what we do with that information that matters.So, how do we see? Well, we see by learning to see. The brain evolved the mechanisms for finding patterns, finding relationships in information, and associating those relationships with a behavioral meaning, a significance, by interacting with the world. We're very aware of this in the form of more cognitive attributes, like language. I'm going to give you some letter strings, and I want you to read them out for me, if you can.Audience: \"Can you read this?\" \"You are not reading this.\" \"What are you reading?\"Beau Lotto: \"What are you reading?\" Half the letters are missing, right? There's no a priori reason why an \"H\" has to go between that \"W\" and \"A.\" But you put one there. Why? Because in the statistics of your past experience, it would have been useful to do so. So you do so again. And yet you don't put a letter after that first \"T.\" Why? Because it wouldn't have been useful in the past. So you don't do it again.So, let me show you how quickly our brains can redefine normality, even at the simplest thing the brain does, which is color. So if I could have the lights down up here. I want you to first notice that those two desert scenes are physically the same. One is simply the flipping of the other. Now I want you to look at that dot between the green and the red. And I want you to stare at that dot. Don't look anywhere else. We're going to look at it for about 30 seconds, which is a bit of a killer in an 18-minute talk.(Laughter)But I really want you to learn. And I'll tell you \u2014 don't look anywhere else \u2014 I'll tell you what's happening in your head. Your brain is learning, and it's learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination; the left side of its visual field is under green illumination. That's what it's learning. Okay? Now, when I tell you, I want you to look at the dot between the two desert scenes. So why don't you do that now?(Laughter)Can I have the lights up again?I take it from your response they don't look the same anymore, right?(Applause)Why? Because your brain is seeing that same information as if the right one is still under red light, and the left one is still under green light. That's your new normal. Okay? So, what does this mean for context? It means I can take two identical squares, put them in light and dark surrounds, and the one on the dark surround looks lighter than on the light surround. What's significant is not simply the light and dark surrounds that matter. It's what those light and dark surrounds meant for your behavior in the past.So I'll show you what I mean. Here we have that exact same illusion. We have two identical tiles on the left, one in a dark surround, one in a light surround. And the same thing over on the right. Now, I'll reveal those two scenes, but I'm not going to change anything within those boxes, except their meaning. And see what happens to your perception.Notice that on the left the two tiles look nearly completely opposite: one very white and one very dark, right? Whereas on the right, the two tiles look nearly the same. And yet there is still one on a dark surround, and one on a light surround. Why? Because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow, and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow, it would have to be more reflective \u2014 just the laws of physics. So you see it that way.Whereas on the right, the information is consistent with those two tiles being under the same light. If they're under the same light reflecting the same amount of light to your eye, then they must be equally reflective. So you see it that way. Which means we can bring all this information together to create some incredibly strong illusions.This is one I made a few years ago. And you'll notice you see a dark brown tile at the top, and a bright orange tile at the side. That is your perceptual reality. The physical reality is that those two tiles are the same.Here you see four gray tiles on your left, seven gray tiles on the right. I'm not going to change those tiles at all, but I'm going to reveal the rest of the scene. And see what happens to your perception. The four blue tiles on the left are gray. The seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray. They are the same. Okay? Don't believe me? Let's watch it again.What's true for color is also true for complex perceptions of motion. So, here we have \u2014 let's turn this around \u2014 a diamond. And what I'm going to do is, I'm going to hold it here, and I'm going to spin it. And for all of you, you'll see it probably spinning this direction. Now I want you to keep looking at it. Move your eyes around, blink, maybe close one eye. And suddenly it will flip, and start spinning the opposite direction. Yes? Raise your hand if you got that. Yes? Keep blinking. Every time you blink, it will switch. So I can ask you, which direction is it rotating? How do you know? Your brain doesn't know, because both are equally likely. So depending on where it looks, it flips between the two possibilities.Are we the only ones that see illusions? The answer to this question is no. Even the beautiful bumblebee, with its mere one million brain cells, which is 250 times fewer cells than you have in one retina, sees illusions, does the most complicated things that even our most sophisticated computers can't do. So in my lab we work on bumblebees, because we can completely control their experience, and see how it alters the architecture of their brain. We do this in what we call the Bee Matrix.Here you have the hive. You can see the queen bee, the large bee in the middle. Those are her daughters, the eggs. They go back and forth between this hive and the arena, via this tube. You'll see one of the bees come out here. You see how she has a little number on her? There's another one coming out, she also has a number on her. Now, they're not born that way, right? We pull them out, put them in the fridge, and they fall asleep. Then you can superglue little numbers on them.(Laughter)And now, in this experiment they get a reward if they go to the blue flowers. They land on the flower, stick their tongue in there, called a proboscis, and drink sugar water. She's drinking a glass of water that's about that big to you and I, will do that about three times, then fly. And sometimes they learn not to go to the blue, but to go where the other bees go. So they copy each other. They can count to five. They can recognize faces. And here she comes down the ladder. And she'll come into the hive, find an empty honey pot, and throw up, and that's honey.(Laughter)Now remember, she's supposed to be going to the blue flowers, but what are these bees doing in the upper right corner? It looks like they're going to green flowers. Now, are they getting it wrong? And the answer to the question is no. Those are actually blue flowers. But those are blue flowers under green light. So they're using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle, which is exactly what we do.So, illusions are often used, especially in art, in the words of a more contemporary artist, \"to demonstrate the fragility of our senses.\" Okay, this is complete rubbish. The senses aren't fragile. And if they were, we wouldn't be here. Instead, color tells us something completely different, that the brain didn't actually evolve to see the world the way it is. We can't. Instead, the brain evolved to see the world the way it was useful to see in the past. And how we see is by continually redefining normality.So, how can we take this incredible capacity of plasticity of the brain and get people to experience their world differently? Well, one of the ways we do it in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound, and we enable people to hear their visual world. And they can navigate the world using their ears.Here's David on the right, and he's holding a camera. On the left is what his camera sees. And you'll see there's a faint line going across that image. That line is broken up into 32 squares. In each square, we calculate the average color. And then we just simply translate that into sound. And now he's going to turn around, close his eyes, and find a plate on the ground with his eyes closed.(Continuous sound)(Sound changes momentarily)(Sound changes momentarily)(Sound changes momentarily)(Sound changes momentarily)(Sound changes momentarily)Beau Lotto: He finds it. Amazing, right? So not only can we create a prosthetic for the visually impaired, but we can also investigate how people literally make sense of the world. But we can also do something else. We can also make music with color. So, working with kids, they created images, thinking about what might the images you see sound like if we could listen to them. And then we translated these images. And this is one of those images. And this is a six-year-old child composing a piece of music for a 32-piece orchestra. And this is what it sounds like.(Electronic representation of orchestral music)So, a six-year-old child. Okay?Now, what does all this mean? What this suggests is that no one is an outside observer of nature, okay? We're not defined by our central properties, by the bits that make us up. We're defined by our environment and our interaction with that environment, by our ecology. And that ecology is necessarily relative, historical and empirical. So, what I'd like to finish with is this over here. Because what I've been trying to do is really celebrate uncertainty. Because I think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding.So, if some of you are still feeling a bit too certain, I'd like to do this one. So, if we have the lights down. And what we have here \u2014 Can everyone see 25 purple surfaces on your left, and 25, call it yellowish, surfaces on your right? So now, what I want to do, I'm going to put the middle nine surfaces here under yellow illumination, by simply putting a filter behind them. Now you can see that changes the light that's coming through there, right? Because now the light is going through a yellowish filter and then a purplish filter. I'm going to do the opposite on the left here. I'm going to put the middle nine under a purplish light.Now, some of you will have noticed that the consequence is that the light coming through those middle nine on the right, or your left, is exactly the same as the light coming through the middle nine on your right. Agreed? Yes? Okay. So they are physically the same. Let's pull the covers off. Now remember \u2014 you know that the middle nine are exactly the same. Do they look the same? No. The question is, \"Is that an illusion?\" And I'll leave you with that.So, thank you very much.(Laughter)(Applause)", "id": 653, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.323 --> 00:00:15.949\nI want to start with a game.

Okay.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.932\nHow many people think it's the green one?\n\n00:00:54.535 --> 00:00:56.969\nAnd how many people\nthink it's the orange one?\n\n00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:00.718\nPretty even split.\n\n00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:04.548\nLet's find out what the reality is.\n\n00:01:04.572 --> 00:01:06.392\nHere is the orange one.\n\n00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:09.107\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.282\nHere is the green one.\n\n00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.171\nAnd here is the gray one.\n\n00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.757\nSo for all of you who saw that,\nyou're complete realists.\n\n00:01:23.226 --> 00:01:24.399\nAll right?\n\n00:01:24.423 --> 00:01:25.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.729\nSo this is pretty amazing, isn't it?\n\n00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:29.555\nBecause nearly every living system\n\n00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.487\nhas evolved the ability\nto detect light in one way or another.\n\n00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:35.352\nSo for us, seeing color\n\n00:01:35.376 --> 00:01:37.686\nis one of the simplest things\nthe brain does.\n\n00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.511\nAnd yet, even at this\nmost fundamental level,\n\n00:01:40.535 --> 00:01:43.154\ncontext is everything.\n\n00:01:43.178 --> 00:01:46.359\nWhat I'm going to talk about\nis not that context is everything,\n\n00:01:46.383 --> 00:01:48.408\nbut why context is everything.\n\n00:01:48.432 --> 00:01:50.648\nBecause it's answering that question\n\n00:01:50.672 --> 00:01:54.216\nthat tells us not only\nwhy we see what we do,\n\n00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.934\nbut who we are as individuals,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.839\nand who we are as a society.\n\n00:01:59.447 --> 00:02:01.510\nBut first, we have to ask\nanother question,\n\n00:02:01.534 --> 00:02:03.042\nwhich is, \"What is color for?\"\n\n00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:05.281\nAnd instead of telling you,\nI'll just show you.\n\n00:02:05.305 --> 00:02:07.934\nWhat you see here is a jungle scene,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.742\nand you see the surfaces\naccording to the amount of light\n\n00:02:10.766 --> 00:02:12.431\nthat those surfaces reflect.\n\n00:02:12.455 --> 00:02:16.838\nNow, can any of you see the predator\nthat's about to jump out at you?\n\n00:02:16.862 --> 00:02:19.886\nAnd if you haven't seen it yet,\nyou're dead, right?\n\n00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:20.911\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:20.935 --> 00:02:23.273\nCan anyone see it? Anyone? No?\n\n00:02:23.297 --> 00:02:24.766\nNow let's see the surfaces\n\n00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.644\naccording to the quality of light\nthat they reflect.\n\n00:02:27.668 --> 00:02:29.209\nAnd now you see it.\n\n00:02:30.287 --> 00:02:32.552\nSo, color enables us to see\n\n00:02:32.576 --> 00:02:35.002\nthe similarities and differences\nbetween surfaces,\n\n00:02:35.026 --> 00:02:38.072\naccording to the full spectrum\nof light that they reflect.\n\n00:02:38.096 --> 00:02:39.557\nBut what you've just done\n\n00:02:39.581 --> 00:02:42.621\nis in many respects\nmathematically impossible.\n\n00:02:42.645 --> 00:02:43.892\nWhy?\n\n00:02:43.916 --> 00:02:45.346\nBecause, as Berkeley tells us,\n\n00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.933\nwe have no direct access\nto our physical world,\n\n00:02:47.957 --> 00:02:49.934\nother than through our senses.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.773\nAnd the light that falls onto our eyes\n\n00:02:51.797 --> 00:02:54.059\nis determined by multiple\nthings in the world,\n\n00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:55.934\nnot only the color of objects,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.934\nbut also the color of their illumination,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.767\nand the color of the space\nbetween us and those objects.\n\n00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:03.044\nYou vary any one of those parameters,\n\n00:03:03.068 --> 00:03:06.590\nand you'll change the color\nof the light that falls onto your eye.\n\n00:03:08.106 --> 00:03:09.290\nThis is a huge problem,\n\n00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:12.283\nbecause it means that the same image\n\n00:03:12.307 --> 00:03:15.828\ncould have an infinite number\nof possible real-world sources.\n\n00:03:15.852 --> 00:03:17.193\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n00:03:17.217 --> 00:03:20.050\nImagine that this\nis the back of your eye, okay?\n\n00:03:20.074 --> 00:03:22.574\nAnd these are two projections\nfrom the world.\n\n00:03:22.598 --> 00:03:25.061\nThey're identical in every single way.\n\n00:03:25.085 --> 00:03:29.117\nIdentical in shape,\nsize, spectral content.\n\n00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:31.910\nThey are the same,\nas far as your eye is concerned.\n\n00:03:32.956 --> 00:03:37.050\nAnd yet they come\nfrom completely different sources.\n\n00:03:38.178 --> 00:03:42.679\nThe one on the right\ncomes from a yellow surface,\n\n00:03:42.703 --> 00:03:45.108\nin shadow, oriented facing the left,\n\n00:03:45.132 --> 00:03:48.004\nviewed through a pinkish medium.\n\n00:03:48.028 --> 00:03:51.272\nThe one on the left comes\nfrom an orange surface,\n\n00:03:51.296 --> 00:03:53.479\nunder direct light, facing to the right,\n\n00:03:53.503 --> 00:03:55.487\nviewed through sort of a bluish medium.\n\n00:03:55.511 --> 00:03:57.686\nCompletely different meanings,\n\n00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.987\ngiving rise to the exact same\nretinal information.\n\n00:04:01.011 --> 00:04:04.328\nAnd yet it's only the retinal\ninformation that we get.\n\n00:04:05.038 --> 00:04:08.320\nSo how on Earth do we even see?\n\n00:04:08.344 --> 00:04:11.551\nSo if you remember anything\nin this next 18 minutes,\n\n00:04:11.575 --> 00:04:12.821\nremember this:\n\n00:04:12.845 --> 00:04:14.787\nthat the light that falls onto your eye,\n\n00:04:14.811 --> 00:04:17.234\nsensory information, is meaningless,\n\n00:04:17.258 --> 00:04:19.376\nbecause it could mean literally anything.\n\n00:04:19.956 --> 00:04:23.501\nAnd what's true for sensory information\nis true for information generally.\n\n00:04:23.525 --> 00:04:25.558\nThere's no inherent\nmeaning in information.\n\n00:04:25.582 --> 00:04:27.995\nIt's what we do with that\ninformation that matters.\n\n00:04:28.693 --> 00:04:32.416\nSo, how do we see?\nWell, we see by learning to see.\n\n00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.979\nThe brain evolved the mechanisms\nfor finding patterns,\n\n00:04:36.003 --> 00:04:38.043\nfinding relationships in information,\n\n00:04:38.067 --> 00:04:42.265\nand associating those relationships\nwith a behavioral meaning,\n\n00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.154\na significance, by interacting\nwith the world.\n\n00:04:45.178 --> 00:04:46.933\nWe're very aware of this\n\n00:04:46.957 --> 00:04:49.786\nin the form of more cognitive\nattributes, like language.\n\n00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.843\nI'm going to give you some letter strings,\n\n00:04:51.867 --> 00:04:54.360\nand I want you to read them\nout for me, if you can.\n\n00:04:54.384 --> 00:04:56.049\nAudience: \"Can you read this?\"\n\n00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.934\n\"You are not reading this.\"\n\n00:04:59.388 --> 00:05:00.834\n\"What are you reading?\"\n\n00:05:00.858 --> 00:05:04.242\nBeau Lotto: \"What are you reading?\"\nHalf the letters are missing, right?\n\n00:05:04.266 --> 00:05:05.575\nThere's no a priori reason\n\n00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.091\nwhy an \"H\" has to go\nbetween that \"W\" and \"A.\"\n\n00:05:08.115 --> 00:05:09.670\nBut you put one there. Why?\n\n00:05:09.694 --> 00:05:12.050\nBecause in the statistics\nof your past experience,\n\n00:05:12.074 --> 00:05:13.768\nit would have been useful to do so.\n\n00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:15.233\nSo you do so again.\n\n00:05:15.257 --> 00:05:17.934\nAnd yet you don't put a letter\nafter that first \"T.\"\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.822\nWhy? Because it wouldn't have been\nuseful in the past.\n\n00:05:20.846 --> 00:05:22.934\nSo you don't do it again.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:26.827\nSo, let me show you how quickly\nour brains can redefine normality,\n\n00:05:26.851 --> 00:05:29.581\neven at the simplest thing\nthe brain does, which is color.\n\n00:05:29.605 --> 00:05:32.239\nSo if I could have\nthe lights down up here.\n\n00:05:32.263 --> 00:05:36.062\nI want you to first notice that those\ntwo desert scenes are physically the same.\n\n00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:38.263\nOne is simply the flipping of the other.\n\n00:05:40.042 --> 00:05:42.352\nNow I want you to look at that dot\n\n00:05:42.376 --> 00:05:44.933\nbetween the green and the red.\n\n00:05:44.957 --> 00:05:47.934\nAnd I want you to stare at that dot.\nDon't look anywhere else.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.164\nWe're going to look\nat it for about 30 seconds,\n\n00:05:50.188 --> 00:05:52.630\nwhich is a bit of a killer\nin an 18-minute talk.\n\n00:05:52.654 --> 00:05:53.947\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:53.971 --> 00:05:55.565\nBut I really want you to learn.\n\n00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:57.890\nAnd I'll tell you -- don't look\nanywhere else --\n\n00:05:57.914 --> 00:05:59.969\nI'll tell you what's\nhappening in your head.\n\n00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:01.260\nYour brain is learning,\n\n00:06:01.284 --> 00:06:04.012\nand it's learning\nthat the right side of its visual field\n\n00:06:04.036 --> 00:06:05.329\nis under red illumination;\n\n00:06:05.353 --> 00:06:08.280\nthe left side of its visual field\nis under green illumination.\n\n00:06:08.304 --> 00:06:11.190\nThat's what it's learning. Okay?\n\n00:06:11.214 --> 00:06:15.893\nNow, when I tell you, I want you to look\nat the dot between the two desert scenes.\n\n00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:17.932\nSo why don't you do that now?\n\n00:06:17.956 --> 00:06:21.316\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.243\nCan I have the lights up again?\n\n00:06:23.267 --> 00:06:26.733\nI take it from your response\nthey don't look the same anymore, right?\n\n00:06:26.757 --> 00:06:27.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.934\nWhy? Because your brain\nis seeing that same information\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.645\nas if the right one is still\nunder red light,\n\n00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:35.827\nand the left one is still\nunder green light.\n\n00:06:35.851 --> 00:06:37.216\nThat's your new normal.\n\n00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.246\nOkay? So, what does this mean for context?\n\n00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.604\nIt means I can take two identical squares,\n\n00:06:41.628 --> 00:06:43.448\nput them in light and dark surrounds,\n\n00:06:43.472 --> 00:06:46.957\nand the one on the dark surround\nlooks lighter than on the light surround.\n\n00:06:46.981 --> 00:06:50.565\nWhat's significant is not simply the light\nand dark surrounds that matter.\n\n00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:54.234\nIt's what those light and dark surrounds\nmeant for your behavior in the past.\n\n00:06:54.258 --> 00:06:55.655\nSo I'll show you what I mean.\n\n00:06:55.679 --> 00:06:57.662\nHere we have that exact same illusion.\n\n00:06:57.686 --> 00:06:59.812\nWe have two identical tiles on the left,\n\n00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:02.122\none in a dark surround,\none in a light surround.\n\n00:07:02.146 --> 00:07:04.225\nAnd the same thing over on the right.\n\n00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:07.100\nNow, I'll reveal those two scenes,\n\n00:07:07.124 --> 00:07:09.792\nbut I'm not going to change\nanything within those boxes,\n\n00:07:09.816 --> 00:07:10.967\nexcept their meaning.\n\n00:07:10.991 --> 00:07:13.304\nAnd see what happens to your perception.\n\n00:07:13.328 --> 00:07:14.934\nNotice that on the left\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.723\nthe two tiles look nearly\ncompletely opposite:\n\n00:07:17.747 --> 00:07:20.838\none very white and one very dark, right?\n\n00:07:20.862 --> 00:07:24.137\nWhereas on the right,\nthe two tiles look nearly the same.\n\n00:07:24.161 --> 00:07:26.399\nAnd yet there is still one\non a dark surround,\n\n00:07:26.423 --> 00:07:27.788\nand one on a light surround.\n\n00:07:27.812 --> 00:07:28.963\nWhy?\n\n00:07:28.987 --> 00:07:32.934\nBecause if the tile in that shadow\nwere in fact in shadow,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.387\nand reflecting the same\namount of light to your eye\n\n00:07:35.411 --> 00:07:37.179\nas the one outside the shadow,\n\n00:07:37.203 --> 00:07:40.600\nit would have to be more reflective\n-- just the laws of physics.\n\n00:07:40.624 --> 00:07:42.142\nSo you see it that way.\n\n00:07:42.166 --> 00:07:44.824\nWhereas on the right,\nthe information is consistent\n\n00:07:44.848 --> 00:07:47.531\nwith those two tiles\nbeing under the same light.\n\n00:07:47.555 --> 00:07:51.388\nIf they're under the same light reflecting\nthe same amount of light to your eye,\n\n00:07:51.412 --> 00:07:53.197\nthen they must be equally reflective.\n\n00:07:53.221 --> 00:07:54.484\nSo you see it that way.\n\n00:07:54.508 --> 00:07:57.034\nWhich means we can bring\nall this information together\n\n00:07:57.058 --> 00:07:59.106\nto create some incredibly\nstrong illusions.\n\n00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:00.934\nThis is one I made a few years ago.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:04.271\nAnd you'll notice you see\na dark brown tile at the top,\n\n00:08:04.295 --> 00:08:06.774\nand a bright orange tile at the side.\n\n00:08:06.798 --> 00:08:08.528\nThat is your perceptual reality.\n\n00:08:08.552 --> 00:08:11.516\nThe physical reality\nis that those two tiles are the same.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.934\nHere you see four gray tiles on your left,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.470\nseven gray tiles on the right.\n\n00:08:19.494 --> 00:08:21.551\nI'm not going to change\nthose tiles at all,\n\n00:08:21.575 --> 00:08:23.742\nbut I'm going to reveal\nthe rest of the scene.\n\n00:08:23.766 --> 00:08:25.724\nAnd see what happens to your perception.\n\n00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:29.828\nThe four blue tiles on the left are gray.\n\n00:08:29.852 --> 00:08:33.505\nThe seven yellow tiles\non the right are also gray.\n\n00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:35.410\nThey are the same. Okay?\n\n00:08:35.434 --> 00:08:37.472\nDon't believe me? Let's watch it again.\n\n00:08:39.356 --> 00:08:43.610\nWhat's true for color is also true\nfor complex perceptions of motion.\n\n00:08:43.634 --> 00:08:46.443\nSo, here we have --\n\n00:08:46.467 --> 00:08:49.731\nlet's turn this around -- a diamond.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.578\nAnd what I'm going to do is,\nI'm going to hold it here,\n\n00:08:53.602 --> 00:08:55.448\nand I'm going to spin it.\n\n00:08:56.789 --> 00:08:59.933\nAnd for all of you, you'll see it\nprobably spinning this direction.\n\n00:08:59.957 --> 00:09:02.569\nNow I want you to keep looking at it.\n\n00:09:02.593 --> 00:09:05.093\nMove your eyes around,\nblink, maybe close one eye.\n\n00:09:05.117 --> 00:09:08.934\nAnd suddenly it will flip, and start\nspinning the opposite direction.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.130\nYes? Raise your hand if you got that. Yes?\n\n00:09:12.154 --> 00:09:13.361\nKeep blinking.\n\n00:09:13.385 --> 00:09:15.970\nEvery time you blink, it will switch.\n\n00:09:15.994 --> 00:09:18.591\nSo I can ask you,\nwhich direction is it rotating?\n\n00:09:20.115 --> 00:09:21.385\nHow do you know?\n\n00:09:22.098 --> 00:09:25.208\nYour brain doesn't know,\nbecause both are equally likely.\n\n00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:26.770\nSo depending on where it looks,\n\n00:09:26.794 --> 00:09:30.123\nit flips between the two possibilities.\n\n00:09:30.147 --> 00:09:32.071\nAre we the only ones that see illusions?\n\n00:09:32.095 --> 00:09:33.934\nThe answer to this question is no.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.677\nEven the beautiful bumblebee,\n\n00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:38.575\nwith its mere one million brain cells,\n\n00:09:38.599 --> 00:09:41.614\nwhich is 250 times fewer cells\nthan you have in one retina,\n\n00:09:41.638 --> 00:09:44.466\nsees illusions, does\nthe most complicated things\n\n00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.934\nthat even our most\nsophisticated computers can't do.\n\n00:09:47.299 --> 00:09:49.155\nSo in my lab we work on bumblebees,\n\n00:09:49.179 --> 00:09:51.668\nbecause we can completely\ncontrol their experience,\n\n00:09:51.692 --> 00:09:54.225\nand see how it alters\nthe architecture of their brain.\n\n00:09:54.249 --> 00:09:56.350\nWe do this in what we call the Bee Matrix.\n\n00:09:56.374 --> 00:09:57.648\nHere you have the hive.\n\n00:09:57.672 --> 00:10:00.267\nYou can see the queen bee,\nthe large bee in the middle.\n\n00:10:00.291 --> 00:10:01.917\nThose are her daughters, the eggs.\n\n00:10:01.941 --> 00:10:05.556\nThey go back and forth between this hive\nand the arena, via this tube.\n\n00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.387\nYou'll see one of the bees come out here.\n\n00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:13.505\nYou see how she has\na little number on her?\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.894\nThere's another one coming out,\nshe also has a number on her.\n\n00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:19.654\nNow, they're not born that way, right?\n\n00:10:19.678 --> 00:10:22.693\nWe pull them out, put them\nin the fridge, and they fall asleep.\n\n00:10:22.717 --> 00:10:25.010\nThen you can superglue\nlittle numbers on them.\n\n00:10:25.034 --> 00:10:26.217\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:26.241 --> 00:10:29.934\nAnd now, in this experiment they get\na reward if they go to the blue flowers.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.151\nThey land on the flower,\n\n00:10:31.175 --> 00:10:34.684\nstick their tongue in there,\ncalled a proboscis, and drink sugar water.\n\n00:10:34.708 --> 00:10:37.866\nShe's drinking a glass of water\nthat's about that big to you and I,\n\n00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:41.524\nwill do that about three times, then fly.\n\n00:10:43.864 --> 00:10:46.142\nAnd sometimes they learn\nnot to go to the blue,\n\n00:10:46.166 --> 00:10:47.934\nbut to go where the other bees go.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.172\nSo they copy each other.\n\n00:10:49.196 --> 00:10:51.482\nThey can count to five.\nThey can recognize faces.\n\n00:10:51.506 --> 00:10:53.467\nAnd here she comes down the ladder.\n\n00:10:53.491 --> 00:10:56.072\nAnd she'll come into the hive,\nfind an empty honey pot,\n\n00:10:56.096 --> 00:10:58.153\nand throw up, and that's honey.\n\n00:10:58.177 --> 00:10:59.328\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:59.352 --> 00:11:04.162\nNow remember, she's supposed\nto be going to the blue flowers,\n\n00:11:04.186 --> 00:11:06.813\nbut what are these bees doing\nin the upper right corner?\n\n00:11:06.837 --> 00:11:09.326\nIt looks like they're\ngoing to green flowers.\n\n00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.156\nNow, are they getting it wrong?\n\n00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.672\nAnd the answer to the question is no.\nThose are actually blue flowers.\n\n00:11:15.696 --> 00:11:19.259\nBut those are blue flowers\nunder green light.\n\n00:11:19.283 --> 00:11:23.015\nSo they're using the relationships\nbetween the colors to solve the puzzle,\n\n00:11:23.039 --> 00:11:25.110\nwhich is exactly what we do.\n\n00:11:25.134 --> 00:11:27.465\nSo, illusions are often used,\n\n00:11:27.489 --> 00:11:31.100\nespecially in art, in the words\nof a more contemporary artist,\n\n00:11:31.124 --> 00:11:33.584\n\"to demonstrate the fragility\nof our senses.\"\n\n00:11:33.608 --> 00:11:35.932\nOkay, this is complete rubbish.\n\n00:11:35.956 --> 00:11:39.906\nThe senses aren't fragile.\nAnd if they were, we wouldn't be here.\n\n00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.829\nInstead, color tells us\nsomething completely different,\n\n00:11:42.853 --> 00:11:46.221\nthat the brain didn't actually evolve\nto see the world the way it is.\n\n00:11:46.245 --> 00:11:47.456\nWe can't.\n\n00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.892\nInstead, the brain\nevolved to see the world\n\n00:11:49.916 --> 00:11:52.934\nthe way it was useful to see in the past.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:57.129\nAnd how we see is by continually\nredefining normality.\n\n00:11:59.448 --> 00:12:06.320\nSo, how can we take this incredible\ncapacity of plasticity of the brain\n\n00:12:06.344 --> 00:12:08.868\nand get people to experience\ntheir world differently?\n\n00:12:08.892 --> 00:12:11.589\nWell, one of the ways we do it\nin my lab and studio\n\n00:12:11.613 --> 00:12:14.851\nis we translate the light into sound,\n\n00:12:14.875 --> 00:12:17.949\nand we enable people to hear\ntheir visual world.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.616\nAnd they can navigate\nthe world using their ears.\n\n00:12:22.223 --> 00:12:25.579\nHere's David on the right,\nand he's holding a camera.\n\n00:12:25.603 --> 00:12:27.333\nOn the left is what his camera sees.\n\n00:12:27.357 --> 00:12:30.365\nAnd you'll see there's a faint line\ngoing across that image.\n\n00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:32.798\nThat line is broken up into 32 squares.\n\n00:12:32.822 --> 00:12:35.149\nIn each square,\nwe calculate the average color.\n\n00:12:35.173 --> 00:12:37.554\nAnd then we just simply\ntranslate that into sound.\n\n00:12:37.578 --> 00:12:40.811\nAnd now he's going to turn around,\n\n00:12:40.835 --> 00:12:43.695\nclose his eyes,\n\n00:12:43.719 --> 00:12:46.981\nand find a plate on the ground\nwith his eyes closed.\n\n00:12:47.005 --> 00:12:48.229\n(Continuous sound)\n\n00:12:49.962 --> 00:12:51.290\n(Sound changes momentarily)\n\n00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.450\n(Sound changes momentarily)\n\n00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:57.171\n(Sound changes momentarily)\n\n00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:01.215\n(Sound changes momentarily)\n\n00:13:03.084 --> 00:13:04.921\n(Sound changes momentarily)\n\n00:13:05.571 --> 00:13:07.512\nBeau Lotto: He finds it. Amazing, right?\n\n00:13:07.536 --> 00:13:10.599\nSo not only can we create a prosthetic\nfor the visually impaired,\n\n00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:13.106\nbut we can also investigate\n\n00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.826\nhow people literally\nmake sense of the world.\n\n00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.485\nBut we can also do something else.\n\n00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:20.597\nWe can also make music with color.\n\n00:13:20.621 --> 00:13:22.297\nSo, working with kids,\n\n00:13:22.321 --> 00:13:24.114\nthey created images,\n\n00:13:24.138 --> 00:13:26.254\nthinking about what might\nthe images you see\n\n00:13:26.278 --> 00:13:28.102\nsound like if we could listen to them.\n\n00:13:28.126 --> 00:13:29.934\nAnd then we translated these images.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.934\nAnd this is one of those images.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.934\nAnd this is a six-year-old child\ncomposing a piece of music\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.934\nfor a 32-piece orchestra.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.959\nAnd this is what it sounds like.\n\n00:13:39.983 --> 00:13:46.661\n(Electronic representation\nof orchestral music)\n\n00:14:06.547 --> 00:14:08.814\nSo, a six-year-old child. Okay?\n\n00:14:08.838 --> 00:14:10.955\nNow, what does all this mean?\n\n00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:16.891\nWhat this suggests is that no one\nis an outside observer of nature, okay?\n\n00:14:16.915 --> 00:14:18.980\nWe're not defined\nby our central properties,\n\n00:14:19.004 --> 00:14:20.668\nby the bits that make us up.\n\n00:14:20.692 --> 00:14:24.366\nWe're defined by our environment\nand our interaction with that environment,\n\n00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:26.042\nby our ecology.\n\n00:14:26.066 --> 00:14:32.098\nAnd that ecology is necessarily\nrelative, historical and empirical.\n\n00:14:34.003 --> 00:14:38.264\nSo, what I'd like to finish with\nis this over here.\n\n00:14:38.288 --> 00:14:41.549\nBecause what I've been trying to do\nis really celebrate uncertainty.\n\n00:14:41.573 --> 00:14:45.334\nBecause I think only through uncertainty\nis there potential for understanding.\n\n00:14:45.358 --> 00:14:48.226\nSo, if some of you are still\nfeeling a bit too certain,\n\n00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:49.792\nI'd like to do this one.\n\n00:14:49.816 --> 00:14:52.230\nSo, if we have the lights down.\n\n00:14:52.254 --> 00:14:57.136\nAnd what we have here --\n\n00:14:58.344 --> 00:15:03.114\nCan everyone see 25\npurple surfaces on your left,\n\n00:15:03.138 --> 00:15:07.330\nand 25, call it yellowish,\nsurfaces on your right?\n\n00:15:07.354 --> 00:15:08.668\nSo now, what I want to do,\n\n00:15:08.692 --> 00:15:11.709\nI'm going to put\nthe middle nine surfaces here\n\n00:15:11.733 --> 00:15:13.360\nunder yellow illumination,\n\n00:15:13.384 --> 00:15:15.390\nby simply putting a filter behind them.\n\n00:15:17.852 --> 00:15:21.823\nNow you can see that changes the light\nthat's coming through there, right?\n\n00:15:21.847 --> 00:15:24.928\nBecause now the light is going\nthrough a yellowish filter\n\n00:15:24.952 --> 00:15:26.499\nand then a purplish filter.\n\n00:15:26.523 --> 00:15:30.834\nI'm going to do the opposite\non the left here.\n\n00:15:30.858 --> 00:15:36.525\nI'm going to put the middle nine\nunder a purplish light.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:42.495\nNow, some of you will have noticed\nthat the consequence\n\n00:15:42.519 --> 00:15:45.582\nis that the light coming through those\nmiddle nine on the right,\n\n00:15:45.606 --> 00:15:48.414\nor your left, is exactly\nthe same as the light\n\n00:15:48.438 --> 00:15:51.130\ncoming through the middle\nnine on your right.\n\n00:15:51.154 --> 00:15:53.739\nAgreed? Yes?\n\n00:15:53.763 --> 00:15:56.312\nOkay. So they are physically the same.\n\n00:15:56.336 --> 00:15:58.974\nLet's pull the covers off.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.299\nNow remember --\n\n00:16:05.662 --> 00:16:09.381\nyou know that the middle nine\nare exactly the same.\n\n00:16:09.405 --> 00:16:10.624\nDo they look the same?\n\n00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.415\nNo.\n\n00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:15.394\nThe question is, \"Is that an illusion?\"\n\n00:16:15.418 --> 00:16:16.825\nAnd I'll leave you with that.\n\n00:16:16.849 --> 00:16:18.054\nSo, thank you very much.\n\n00:16:18.078 --> 00:16:19.243\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:19.267 --> 00:16:21.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Claim your \"manspace\"", "duration": "267", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/sam_martin_builds_a_room_of_his_own", "transcript": "So, I am indeed going to talk about the spaces men create for themselves, but first I want to tell you why I'm here. I'm here for two reasons. These two guys are my two sons Ford and Wren. When Ford was about three years old, we shared a very small room together, in a very small space. My office was on one half of the bedroom, and his bedroom was on the other half. And you can imagine, if you're a writer, that things would get really crowded around deadlines.So when Wren was on the way, I realized I needed to find a space of my own. There was no more space in the house. So I went out to the backyard, and without any previous building experience, and about 3,000 dollars and some recycled materials, I built this space. It had everything I needed. It was quiet. There was enough space. And I had control, which was very important.As I was building this space, I thought to myself, \"Surely I'm not the only guy to have to have carved out a space for his own.\" So I did some research. And I found that there was an historic precedence. Hemingway had his writing space. Elvis had two or three manspaces, which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in Graceland. In the popular culture, Superman had the Fortress of Solitude, and there was, of course, the Batcave.So I realized then that I wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now. Here is one of the first spaces I found. It is in Austin, Texas, which is where I'm from. On the outside it looks like a very typical garage, a nice garage. But on the inside, it's anything but. And this, to me, is a pretty classic manspace. It has neon concert posters, a bar and, of course, the leg lamp, which is very important.I soon realized that manspaces didn't have to be only inside. This guy built a bowling alley in his backyard, out of landscaping timbers, astroturf. And he found the scoreboard in the trash.Here's another outdoor space, a little bit more sophisticated. This a 1923 wooden tugboat, made completely out of Douglas fir. The guy did it all himself. And there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging-out space inside.So, pretty early on in my investigations I realized what I was finding was not what I expected to find, which was, quite frankly, a lot of beer can pyramids and overstuffed couches and flat-screen TVs. There were definitely hang-out spots. But some were for working, some were for playing, some were for guys to collect their things. Most of all, I was just surprised with what I was finding.Take this place for example. On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage. This is in Long Island, New York. The only thing that might tip you off is the round window. On the inside it's a recreation of a 16th century Japanese tea house. The man imported all the materials from Japan, and he hired a Japanese carpenter to build it in the traditional style. It has no nails or screws. All the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed.Here is another pretty typical scene. This is a suburban Las Vegas neighborhood. But you open one of the garage doors and there is a professional-size boxing ring inside. (Laughter) And so there is a good reason for this. It was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough. He won the silver medal for Ireland in the 1992 Olympics, and he trains in this space. He trains other people. And right off the garage he has his own trophy room where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments, which is another sort of important part about a manspace.So, while this space represents someone's profession, this one certainly represents a passion. It's made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship. It's a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s. Museum quality.So, as I came to the end of my journey, I found over 50 spaces. And they were unexpected and they were surprising. But they were also \u2014 I was really impressed by how personalized they were, and how much work went into them. And I realized that's because the guys that I met were all very passionate about what they did. And they really loved their professions. And they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies. And so they created these spaces to reflect what they love to do, and who they were.So if you don't have a space of your own, I highly recommend finding one, and getting into it. Thank you very much.

Cities, past and future. In Oxford, perhaps we can use Lewis Carroll and look in the looking glass that is New York City to try and see our true selves, or perhaps pass through to another world. Or, in the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald, \"As the moon rose higher, the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that once flowered for Dutch sailors' eyes, a fresh green breast of the new world.\"My colleagues and I have been working for 10 years to rediscover this lost world in a project we call The Mannahatta Project. We're trying to discover what Henry Hudson would have seen on the afternoon of September 12th, 1609, when he sailed into New York harbor. And I'd like to tell you the story in three acts, and if I have time still, an epilogue.So, Act I: A Map Found. So, I didn't grow up in New York. I grew up out west in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, like you see here, in the Red Rock Canyon. And from these early experiences as a child I learned to love landscapes. And so when it became time for me to do my graduate studies, I studied this emerging field of landscape ecology. Landscape ecology concerns itself with how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs make habitats for plants and animals. This experience and this training lead me to get a wonderful job with the Wildlife Conservation Society, which works to save wildlife and wild places all over the world. And over the last decade, I traveled to over 40 countries to see jaguars and bears and elephants and tigers and rhinos.But every time I would return from my trips I'd return back to New York City. And on my weekends I would go up, just like all the other tourists, to the top of the Empire State Building, and I'd look down on this landscape, on these ecosystems, and I'd wonder, \"How does this landscape work to make habitat for plants and animals? How does it work to make habitat for animals like me?\" I'd go to Times Square and I'd look at the amazing ladies on the wall, and wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them. I'd go to Central Park and see the rolling topography of Central Park come up against the abrupt and sheer topography of midtown Manhattan.I started reading about the history and the geography in New York City. I read that New York City was the first mega-city, a city of 10 million people or more, in 1950. I started seeing paintings like this. For those of you who are from New York, this is 125th street under the West Side Highway. (Laughter) It was once a beach. And this painting has John James Audubon, the painter, sitting on the rock. And it's looking up on the wooded heights of Washington Heights to Jeffrey's Hook, where the George Washington Bridge goes across today.Or this painting, from the 1740s, from Greenwich Village. Those are two students at King's College \u2014 later Columbia University \u2014 sitting on a hill, overlooking a valley. And so I'd go down to Greenwich Village and I'd look for this hill, and I couldn't find it. And I couldn't find that palm tree. What's that palm tree doing there? (Laughter)So, it was in the course of these investigations that I ran into a map. And it's this map you see here. It's held in a geographic information system which allows me to zoom in. This map isn't from Hudson's time, but from the American Revolution, 170 years later, made by British military cartographers during the occupation of New York City. And it's a remarkable map. It's in the National Archives here in Kew. And it's 10 feet long and three and a half feet wide.And if I zoom in to lower Manhattan you can see the extent of New York City as it was, right at the end of the American Revolution. Here's Bowling Green. And here's Broadway. And this is City Hall Park. So the city basically extended to City Hall Park. And just beyond it you can see features that have vanished, things that have disappeared. This is the Collect Pond, which was the fresh water source for New York City for its first 200 years, and for the Native Americans for thousands of years before that. You can see the Lispenard Meadows draining down through here, through what is TriBeCa now, and the beaches that come up from the Battery, all the way to 42nd St.This map was made for military reasons. They're mapping the roads, the buildings, these fortifications that they built. But they're also mapping things of ecological interest, also military interest: the hills, the marshes, the streams. This is Richmond Hill, and Minetta Water, which used to run its way through Greenwich Village. Or the swamp at Gramercy Park, right here. Or Murray Hill. And this is the Murrays' house on Murray Hill, 200 years ago. Here is Times Square, the two streams that came together to make a wetland in Times Square, as it was at the end of the American Revolution.So I saw this remarkable map in a book. And I thought to myself, \"You know, if I could georeference this map, if I could place this map in the grid of the city today, I could find these lost features of the city, in the block-by-block geography that people know, the geography of where people go to work, and where they go to live, and where they like to eat.\" So, after some work we were able to georeference it, which allows us to put the modern streets on the city, and the buildings, and the open spaces, so that we can zoom in to where the Collect Pond is. We can digitize the Collect Pond and the streams, and see where they actually are in the geography of the city today. So this is fun for finding where things are relative to the old topography.But I had another idea about this map. If we take away the streets, and if we take away the buildings, and if we take away the open spaces, then we could take this map. If we pull off the 18th century features we could drive it back in time. We could drive it back to its ecological fundamentals: to the hills, to the streams, to the basic hydrology and shoreline, to the beaches, the basic aspects that make the ecological landscape.Then, if we added maps like the geology, the bedrock geology, and the surface geology, what the glaciers leave, if we make the soil map, with the 17 soil classes, that are defined by the National Conservation Service, if we make a digital elevation model of the topography that tells us how high the hills were, then we can calculate the slopes. We can calculate the aspect. We can calculate the winter wind exposure \u2014 so, which way the winter winds blow across the landscape. The white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds.We compiled all the information about where the Native Americans were, the Lenape. And we built a probability map of where they might have been. So, the red areas on this map indicate the places that are best for human sustainability on Manhattan, places that are close to water, places that are near the harbor to fish, places protected from the winter winds. We know that there was a Lenape settlement down here by the Collect Pond. And we knew that they planted a kind of horticulture, that they grew these beautiful gardens of corn, beans, and squash, the \"Three Sisters\" garden.So, we built a model that explains where those fields might have been. And the old fields, the successional fields that go. And we might think of these as abandoned. But, in fact, they're grassland habitats for grassland birds and plants. And they have become successional shrub lands, and these then mix in to a map of all the ecological communities. And it turns out that Manhattan had 55 different ecosystem types. You can think of these as neighborhoods, as distinctive as TriBeCa and the Upper East Side and Inwood \u2014 that these are the forest and the wetlands and the marine communities, the beaches.And 55 is a lot. On a per-area basis, Manhattan had more ecological communities per acre than Yosemite does, than Yellowstone, than Amboseli. It was really an extraordinary landscape that was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity.So, Act II: A Home Reconstructed. So, we studied the fish and the frogs and the birds and the bees, the 85 different kinds of fish that were on Manhattan, the Heath hens, the species that aren't there anymore, the beavers on all the streams, the black bears, and the Native Americans, to study how they used and thought about their landscape. We wanted to try and map these. And to do that what we did was we mapped their habitat needs.Where do they get their food? Where do they get their water? Where do they get their shelter? Where do they get their reproductive resources? To an ecologist, the intersection of these is habitat, but to most people, the intersection of these is their home. So, we would read in field guides, the standard field guides that maybe you have on your shelves, you know, what beavers need is, \"A slowly meandering stream with aspen trees and alders and willows, near the water.\" That's the best thing for a beaver.So we just started making a list. Here is the beaver. And here is the stream, and the aspen and the alder and the willow. As if these were the maps that we would need to predict where you would find the beaver. Or the bog turtle, needing wet meadows and insects and sunny places. Or the bobcat, needing rabbits and beavers and den sites. And rapidly we started to realize that beavers can be something that a bobcat needs. But a beaver also needs things. And that having it on either side means that we can link it together, that we can create the network of the habitat relationships for these species.Moreover, we realized that you can start out as being a beaver specialist, but you can look up what an aspen needs. An aspen needs fire and dry soils. And you can look at what a wet meadow needs. And it need beavers to create the wetlands, and maybe some other things. But you can also talk about sunny places. So, what does a sunny place need? Not habitat per se. But what are the conditions that make it possible? Or fire. Or dry soils. And that you can put these on a grid that's 1,000 columns long across the top and 1,000 rows down the other way. And then we can visualize this data like a network, like a social network.And this is the network of all the habitat relationships of all the plants and animals on Manhattan, and everything they needed, going back to the geology, going back to time and space at the very core of the web. We call this the Muir Web. And if you zoom in on it it looks like this. Each point is a different species or a different stream or a different soil type. And those little gray lines are the connections that connect them together. They are the connections that actually make nature resilient. And the structure of this is what makes nature work, seen with all its parts. We call these Muir Webs after the Scottish-American naturalist John Muir, who said, \"When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find that it's bound fast by a thousand invisible cords that cannot be broken, to everything in the universe.\"So then we took the Muir webs and we took them back to the maps. So if we wanted to go between 85th and 86th, and Lex and Third, maybe there was a stream in that block. And these would be the kind of trees that might have been there, and the flowers and the lichens and the mosses, the butterflies, the fish in the stream, the birds in the trees. Maybe a timber rattlesnake lived there. And perhaps a black bear walked by. And maybe Native Americans were there. And then we took this data.You can see this for yourself on our website. You can zoom into any block on Manhattan, and see what might have been there 400 years ago. And we used it to try and reveal a landscape here in Act III. We used the tools they use in Hollywood to make these fantastic landscapes that we all see in the movies.And we tried to use it to visualize Third Avenue. So we would take the landscape and we would build up the topography. We'd lay on top of that the soils and the waters, and illuminate the landscape. We would lay on top of that the map of the ecological communities. And feed into that the map of the species. So that we would actually take a photograph, flying above Times Square, looking toward the Hudson River, waiting for Hudson to come. Using this technology, we can make these fantastic georeferenced views. We can basically take a picture out of any window on Manhattan and see what that landscape looked like 400 years ago.This is the view from the East River, looking up Murray Hill at where the United Nations is today. This is the view looking down the Hudson River, with Manhattan on the left, and New Jersey out on the right, looking out toward the Atlantic Ocean. This is the view over Times Square, with the beaver pond there, looking out toward the east. So we can see the Collect Pond, and Lispenard Marshes back behind. We can see the fields that the Native Americans made. And we can see this in the geography of the city today. So when you're watching \"Law and Order,\" and the lawyers walk up the steps they could have walked back down those steps of the New York Court House, right into the Collect Pond, 400 years ago.So these images are the work of my friend and colleague, Mark Boyer, who is here in the audience today. And I'd just like, if you would give him a hand, to call out for his fine work. (Applause)There is such power in bringing science and visualization together, that we can create images like this, perhaps looking on either side of a looking glass. And even though I've only had a brief time to speak, I hope you appreciate that Mannahatta was a very special place. The place that you see here on the left side was interconnected. It was based on this diversity. It had this resilience that is what we need in our modern world.But I wouldn't have you think that I don't like the place on the right, which I quite do. I've come to love the city and its kind of diversity, and its resilience, and its dependence on density and how we're connected together. In fact, that I see them as reflections of each other, much as Lewis Carroll did in \"Through the Looking Glass.\" We can compare these two and hold them in our minds at the same time, that they really are the same place, that there is no way that cities can escape from nature. And I think this is what we're learning about building cities in the future.So if you'll allow me a brief epilogue, not about the past, but about 400 years from now, what we're realizing is that cities are habitats for people, and need to supply what people need: a sense of home, food, water, shelter, reproductive resources, and a sense of meaning. This is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity. And so many of the talks here at TED are about meaning, about bringing meaning to our lives in all kinds of different ways, through technology, through art, through science, so much so that I think we focus so much on that side of our lives, that we haven't given enough attention to the food and the water and the shelter, and what we need to raise the kids.So, how can we envision the city of the future? Well, what if we go to Madison Square Park, and we imagine it without all the cars, and bicycles instead and large forests, and streams instead of sewers and storm drains? What if we imagined the Upper East Side with green roofs, and streams winding through the city, and windmills supplying the power we need? Or if we imagine the New York City metropolitan area, currently home to 12 million people, but 12 million people in the future, perhaps living at the density of Manhattan, in only 36 percent of the area, with the areas in between covered by farmland, covered by wetlands, covered by the marshes we need.This is the kind of future I think we need, is a future that has the same diversity and abundance and dynamism of Manhattan, but that learns from the sustainability of the past, of the ecology, the original ecology, of nature with all its parts. Thank you very much.

00:01:07.958\nand if I have time still, an epilogue.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nSo, Act I: A Map Found.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nSo, I didn't grow up in New York.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nI grew up out west in the\nSierra Nevada Mountains, like you see here,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nin the Red Rock Canyon.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nAnd from these early\nexperiences as a child\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nI learned to love landscapes.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nAnd so when it became time\nfor me to do my graduate studies,\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nI studied this emerging field\nof landscape ecology.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nLandscape ecology concerns itself\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nwith how the stream and the meadow\nand the forest and the cliffs\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nmake habitats for plants and animals.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nThis experience and this training\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nlead me to get a wonderful job\nwith the Wildlife Conservation Society,\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nwhich works to save wildlife\nand wild places all over the world.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nAnd over the last decade,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nI traveled to over 40 countries\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nto see jaguars and bears and elephants\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nand tigers and rhinos.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nBut every time I would return\nfrom my trips I'd return back to New York City.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nAnd on my weekends I would go up,\njust like all the other tourists,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nto the top of the Empire State Building,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nand I'd look down on this landscape,\non these ecosystems,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nand I'd wonder, \"How does this landscape\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nwork to make habitat\nfor plants and animals?\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nHow does it work to make habitat\nfor animals like me?\"\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nI'd go to Times Square and I'd look\nat the amazing ladies on the wall,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nand wonder why nobody is looking\nat the historical figures just behind them.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nI'd go to Central Park and see\nthe rolling topography of Central Park\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\ncome up against the abrupt and sheer\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:27.958\ntopography of midtown Manhattan.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nI started reading about the history\nand the geography in New York City.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nI read that New York City\nwas the first mega-city,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:36.958\na city of 10 million people\nor more, in 1950.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nI started seeing paintings like this.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nFor those of you who are from New York,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nthis is 125th street\nunder the West Side Highway.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nIt was once a beach.\nAnd this painting\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nhas John James Audubon,\nthe painter, sitting on the rock.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nAnd it's looking up on the wooded heights\nof Washington Heights\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nto Jeffrey's Hook, where the George\nWashington Bridge goes across today.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nOr this painting, from the 1740s,\nfrom Greenwich Village.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nThose are two students at King's College --\nlater Columbia University --\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nsitting on a hill, overlooking a valley.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nAnd so I'd go down to Greenwich\nVillage and I'd look for this hill,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nand I couldn't find it.\nAnd I couldn't find that palm tree.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nWhat's that palm tree doing there?\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nSo, it was in the course of these investigations\nthat I ran into a map.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nAnd it's this map you see here.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nIt's held in a geographic information system\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nwhich allows me to zoom in.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nThis map isn't from Hudson's time,\nbut from the American Revolution,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\n170 years later, made by\nBritish military cartographers\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nduring the occupation of New York City.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd it's a remarkable map.\nIt's in the National Archives here in Kew.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nAnd it's 10 feet long and\nthree and a half feet wide.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nAnd if I zoom in to lower Manhattan\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nyou can see the extent\nof New York City as it was,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nright at the end of the American Revolution.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nHere's Bowling Green.\nAnd here's Broadway.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAnd this is City Hall Park.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nSo the city basically extended\nto City Hall Park.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nAnd just beyond it you can see features\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthat have vanished,\nthings that have disappeared.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nThis is the Collect Pond, which was\nthe fresh water source for New York City\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nfor its first 200 years,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nand for the Native Americans\nfor thousands of years before that.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nYou can see the Lispenard Meadows\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\ndraining down through here,\nthrough what is TriBeCa now,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nand the beaches that\ncome up from the Battery,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nall the way to 42nd St.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nThis map was made for military reasons.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nThey're mapping the roads,\nthe buildings, these fortifications\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nthat they built.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nBut they're also mapping\nthings of ecological interest,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nalso military interest: the hills,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nthe marshes, the streams.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nThis is Richmond Hill,\nand Minetta Water,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nwhich used to run its way\nthrough Greenwich Village.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nOr the swamp at Gramercy Park, right here.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nOr Murray Hill.\nAnd this is the Murrays' house\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\non Murray Hill, 200 years ago.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nHere is Times Square,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nthe two streams that came\ntogether to make a wetland\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nin Times Square, as it was\nat the end of the American Revolution.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nSo I saw this remarkable map in a book.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nAnd I thought to myself, \"You know,\nif I could georeference this map,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nif I could place this map\nin the grid of the city today,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nI could find these lost features\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nof the city,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nin the block-by-block\ngeography that people know,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nthe geography of where people\ngo to work, and where they go to live,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nand where they like to eat.\"\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nSo, after some work\nwe were able to georeference it,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nwhich allows us to put\nthe modern streets on the city,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nand the buildings, and the open spaces,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nso that we can zoom in\nto where the Collect Pond is.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nWe can digitize the Collect\nPond and the streams,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nand see where they actually are\nin the geography of the city today.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nSo this is fun\nfor finding where things are\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nrelative to the old topography.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nBut I had another idea about this map.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nIf we take away the streets,\nand if we take away the buildings,\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand if we take away the open spaces,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nthen we could take this map.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nIf we pull off the 18th century features\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nwe could drive it back in time.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nWe could drive it back\nto its ecological fundamentals:\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nto the hills, to the streams,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nto the basic hydrology\nand shoreline, to the beaches,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nthe basic aspects that\nmake the ecological landscape.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nThen, if we added maps\nlike the geology, the bedrock geology,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nand the surface geology,\nwhat the glaciers leave,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nif we make the soil map,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nwith the 17 soil classes,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nthat are defined by\nthe National Conservation Service,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nif we make a digital elevation model\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nof the topography\nthat tells us how high the hills were,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nthen we can calculate the slopes.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nWe can calculate the aspect.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nWe can calculate the\nwinter wind exposure --\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nso, which way the winter\nwinds blow across the landscape.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nThe white areas on this map\nare the places protected from the winter winds.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nWe compiled all the information\nabout where the Native Americans were, the Lenape.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nAnd we built a probability map\nof where they might have been.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nSo, the red areas\non this map indicate the places\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nthat are best for human\nsustainability on Manhattan,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nplaces that are close to water,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nplaces that are near the harbor to fish,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nplaces protected from the winter winds.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nWe know that there was a Lenape settlement\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\ndown here by the Collect Pond.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nAnd we knew that they\nplanted a kind of horticulture,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nthat they grew these beautiful gardens\nof corn, beans, and squash,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nthe \"Three Sisters\" garden.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nSo, we built a model that explains\nwhere those fields might have been.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nAnd the old fields, the successional fields that go.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nAnd we might think of these as abandoned.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nBut, in fact, they're grassland habitats\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nfor grassland birds and plants.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAnd they have become\nsuccessional shrub lands,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nand these then mix in\nto a map of all the ecological communities.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nAnd it turns out that Manhattan\nhad 55 different ecosystem types.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nYou can think of these as neighborhoods,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nas distinctive as TriBeCa\nand the Upper East Side and Inwood --\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nthat these are the forest and the wetlands\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nand the marine communities, the beaches.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAnd 55 is a lot. On a per-area basis,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nManhattan had more ecological communities\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nper acre than Yosemite does,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nthan Yellowstone, than Amboseli.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nIt was really an extraordinary landscape\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nthat was capable of supporting\nan extraordinary biodiversity.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nSo, Act II: A Home Reconstructed.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nSo, we studied the fish and the frogs\nand the birds and the bees,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nthe 85 different kinds of fish\nthat were on Manhattan,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nthe Heath hens, the species\nthat aren't there anymore,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nthe beavers on all the streams,\nthe black bears,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nand the Native Americans,\nto study how they used\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nand thought about their landscape.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nWe wanted to try and map these.\nAnd to do that what we did\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nwas we mapped their habitat needs.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nWhere do they get their food?\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nWhere do they get their water?\nWhere do they get their shelter?\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nWhere do they get their\nreproductive resources?\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nTo an ecologist, the intersection\nof these is habitat,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nbut to most people,\nthe intersection of these is their home.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nSo, we would read in field guides,\nthe standard field guides\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nthat maybe you have on your shelves,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nyou know, what beavers need is,\n\"A slowly meandering stream\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nwith aspen trees and alders and willows,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nnear the water.\"\nThat's the best thing for a beaver.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nSo we just started making a list.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nHere is the beaver.\nAnd here is the stream,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nand the aspen and the alder\nand the willow.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nAs if these were the maps\nthat we would need\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nto predict where you would find the beaver.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nOr the bog turtle, needing wet meadows\nand insects and sunny places.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nOr the bobcat, needing rabbits\nand beavers and den sites.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nAnd rapidly we started to realize\nthat beavers can be\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nsomething that a bobcat needs.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nBut a beaver also needs things.\nAnd that having it\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\non either side means that\nwe can link it together,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nthat we can create the network\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nof the habitat relationships\nfor these species.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nMoreover, we realized\nthat you can start out\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nas being a beaver specialist,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nbut you can look up what an aspen needs.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nAn aspen needs fire and dry soils.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nAnd you can look at\nwhat a wet meadow needs.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nAnd it need beavers\nto create the wetlands,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nand maybe some other things.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nBut you can also talk\nabout sunny places.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nSo, what does a sunny place need?\nNot habitat per se.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nBut what are the conditions\nthat make it possible?\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nOr fire. Or dry soils.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nAnd that you can put these\non a grid that's 1,000 columns long\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nacross the top and 1,000 rows\ndown the other way.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nAnd then we can visualize\nthis data like a network,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nlike a social network.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nAnd this is the network\nof all the habitat relationships\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nof all the plants and animals\non Manhattan,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nand everything they needed,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\ngoing back to the geology,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\ngoing back to time and space\nat the very core of the web.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nWe call this the Muir Web.\nAnd if you zoom in on it it looks like this.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nEach point is a different species\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nor a different stream\nor a different soil type.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nAnd those little gray lines are the connections\nthat connect them together.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nThey are the connections\nthat actually make nature resilient.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nAnd the structure of this\nis what makes nature work,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nseen with all its parts.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nWe call these Muir Webs\nafter the Scottish-American naturalist\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nJohn Muir, who said, \"When we try\nto pick out anything by itself,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nwe find that it's bound fast\nby a thousand invisible cords\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nthat cannot be broken,\nto everything in the universe.\"\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nSo then we took the Muir webs\nand we took them back to the maps.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nSo if we wanted to go between 85th and 86th,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nand Lex and Third,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nmaybe there was a stream in that block.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nAnd these would be the kind of trees\nthat might have been there,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nand the flowers and the lichens\nand the mosses,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nthe butterflies, the fish in the stream,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nthe birds in the trees.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nMaybe a timber rattlesnake lived there.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nAnd perhaps a black bear walked by.\nAnd maybe Native Americans were there.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nAnd then we took this data.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nYou can see this for yourself\non our website.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nYou can zoom into\nany block on Manhattan,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nand see what might have\nbeen there 400 years ago.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nAnd we used it to try\nand reveal a landscape\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nhere in Act III.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nWe used the tools they use in Hollywood\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nto make these fantastic landscapes\nthat we all see in the movies.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nAnd we tried to use it to visualize Third Avenue.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nSo we would take the landscape\nand we would build up the topography.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nWe'd lay on top of that the soils and the waters,\nand illuminate the landscape.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nWe would lay on top of that\nthe map of the ecological communities.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nAnd feed into that the map of the species.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nSo that we would actually take a photograph,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nflying above Times Square,\nlooking toward the Hudson River,\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nwaiting for Hudson to come.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nUsing this technology, we can make these\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nfantastic georeferenced views.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nWe can basically take a picture\nout of any window\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\non Manhattan and see what that landscape\nlooked like 400 years ago.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nThis is the view from the East River,\nlooking up Murray Hill\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nat where the United Nations is today.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nThis is the view looking\ndown the Hudson River,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nwith Manhattan on the left,\nand New Jersey out on the right,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nlooking out toward the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nThis is the view over Times Square,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nwith the beaver pond there,\nlooking out toward the east.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nSo we can see the Collect Pond,\nand Lispenard Marshes back behind.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nWe can see the fields\nthat the Native Americans made.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nAnd we can see this\nin the geography of the city today.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nSo when you're watching \"Law and Order,\"\nand the lawyers walk up the steps\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nthey could have walked\nback down those steps\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nof the New York Court House,\nright into the Collect Pond,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:55.958\n400 years ago.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nSo these images are the work\nof my friend and colleague,\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nMark Boyer, who is here\nin the audience today.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nAnd I'd just like, if you would\ngive him a hand,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nto call out for his fine work.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:14.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nThere is such power in bringing\nscience and visualization together,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nthat we can create images like this,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nperhaps looking on either\nside of a looking glass.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nAnd even though I've only\nhad a brief time to speak,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nI hope you appreciate that\nMannahatta was a very special place.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nThe place that you see here\non the left side\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nwas interconnected.\nIt was based on this diversity.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nIt had this resilience that is\nwhat we need in our modern world.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nBut I wouldn't have you think\nthat I don't like the place\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\non the right, which I quite do.\nI've come to love the city\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nand its kind of diversity,\nand its resilience,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nand its dependence on density\nand how we're connected together.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nIn fact, that I see them\nas reflections of each other,\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nmuch as Lewis Carroll did\nin \"Through the Looking Glass.\"\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nWe can compare these two and hold them\nin our minds at the same time,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nthat they really are the same place,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nthat there is no way that cities\ncan escape from nature.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nAnd I think this is what we're learning\nabout building cities in the future.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nSo if you'll allow me a brief epilogue,\nnot about the past,\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nbut about 400 years from now,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nwhat we're realizing is that\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\ncities are habitats for people,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nand need to supply what people need:\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\na sense of home, food, water, shelter,\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nreproductive resources,\nand a sense of meaning.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nThis is the particular additional\nhabitat requirement of humanity.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nAnd so many of the talks here\nat TED are about meaning,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nabout bringing meaning to our lives\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nin all kinds of different ways, through technology,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nthrough art, through science,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nso much so that I think\nwe focus so much on\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nthat side of our lives,\nthat we haven't given enough\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nattention to the food and the water\nand the shelter,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nand what we need to raise the kids.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nSo, how can we envision\nthe city of the future?\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nWell, what if we go\nto Madison Square Park,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nand we imagine it without all the cars,\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nand bicycles instead\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nand large forests, and streams instead\nof sewers and storm drains?\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nWhat if we imagined the Upper East Side\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nwith green roofs, and streams\nwinding through the city,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nand windmills supplying\nthe power we need?\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nOr if we imagine the New York\nCity metropolitan area,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\ncurrently home to 12 million people,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nbut 12 million people in the future,\nperhaps living at the density of Manhattan,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nin only 36 percent of the area,\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nwith the areas in between\ncovered by farmland,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\ncovered by wetlands,\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\ncovered by the marshes we need.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nThis is the kind of future I think we need,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nis a future that has the same diversity\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nand abundance and dynamism of Manhattan,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nbut that learns from the\nsustainability of the past,\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nof the ecology, the original ecology,\nof nature with all its parts.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:59.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Robots that \"show emotion\"", "duration": "297", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_hanson_robots_that_relate_to_you",

And by that, I mean that I develop robots that are characters, but also robots that will eventually come to empathize with you. So we're starting with a variety of technologies that have converged into these conversational character robots that can see faces, make eye contact with you, make a full range of facial expressions, understand speech and begin to model how you're feeling and who you are, and build a relationship with you.I developed a series of technologies that allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions than previously achieved, on lower power, which enabled the walking biped robots, the first androids. So, it's a full range of facial expressions simulating all the major muscles in the human face, running on very small batteries, extremely lightweight.The materials that allowed the battery-operated facial expressions is a material that we call Frubber, and it actually has three major innovations in the material that allow this to happen. One is hierarchical pores, and the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material.There he's starting to walk. This is at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. I built the head. They built the body. So the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines, and not just sentience, but empathy.We're working with the Machine Perception Laboratory at the U.C. San Diego. They have this really remarkable facial expression technology that recognizes facial expressions, what facial expressions you're making. It also recognizes where you're looking, your head orientation. We're emulating all the major facial expressions, and then controlling it with the software that we call the Character Engine. And here is a little bit of the technology that's involved in that.In fact, right now \u2014 plug it from here, and then plug it in here, and now let's see if it gets my facial expressions. Okay. So I'm smiling. (Laughter) Now I'm frowning. And this is really heavily backlit. Okay, here we go. Oh, it's so sad. Okay, so you smile, frowning. So his perception of your emotional states is very important for machines to effectively become empathetic.Machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like killing. Right? Those machines have no place for empathy. And there is billions of dollars being spent on that. Character robotics could plant the seed for robots that actually have empathy. So, if they achieve human level intelligence or, quite possibly, greater than human levels of intelligence, this could be the seeds of hope for our future.So, we've made 20 robots in the last eight years, during the course of getting my Ph.D. And then I started Hanson Robotics, which has been developing these things for mass manufacturing. This is one of our robots that we showed at Wired NextFest a couple of years ago. And it sees multiple people in a scene, remembers where individual people are, and looks from person to person, remembering people.So, we're involving two things. One, the perception of people, and two, the natural interface, the natural form of the interface, so that it's more intuitive for you to interact with the robot. You start to believe that it's alive and aware.So one of my favorite projects was bringing all this stuff together in an artistic display of an android portrait of science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick, who wrote great works like, \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" which was the basis of the movie \"Bladerunner.\" In these stories, robots often think that they're human, and they sort of come to life. So we put his writings, letters, his interviews, correspondences, into a huge database of thousands of pages, and then used some natural language processing to allow you to actually have a conversation with him. And it was kind of spooky, because he would say these things that just sounded like they really understood you.And this is one of the most exciting projects that we're developing, which is a little character that's a spokesbot for friendly artificial intelligence, friendly machine intelligence. And we're getting this mass-manufactured. We specked it out to actually be doable with a very, very low-cost bill of materials, so that it can become a childhood companion for kids. Interfacing with the Internet, it gets smarter over the years. As artificial intelligence evolves, so does his intelligence.Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. That's incredible.

Normally, as an advertising man, I actually speak at TED Evil, which is TED's secret sister that pays all the bills. It's held every two years in Burma. And I particularly remember a really good speech by Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again. (Laughter)But, actually, it's suddenly come to me after years working in the business, that what we create in advertising, which is intangible value \u2014 you might call it perceived value, you might call it badge value, subjective value, intangible value of some kind \u2014 gets rather a bad rap. If you think about it, if you want to live in a world in the future where there are fewer material goods, you basically have two choices. You can either live in a world which is poorer, which people in general don't like. Or you can live in a world where actually intangible value constitutes a greater part of overall value, that actually intangible value, in many ways is a very, very fine substitute for using up labor or limited resources in the creation of things.Here is one example. This is a train which goes from London to Paris. The question was given to a bunch of engineers, about 15 years ago, \"How do we make the journey to Paris better?\" And they came up with a very good engineering solution, which was to spend six billion pounds building completely new tracks from London to the coast, and knocking about 40 minutes off a three-and-half-hour journey time. Now, call me Mister Picky. I'm just an ad man ... ... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey merely to make it shorter. Now what is the hedonic opportunity cost on spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks?Here is my naive advertising man's suggestion. What you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male and female supermodels, pay them to walk the length of the train, handing out free Chateau Petrus for the entire duration of the journey. (Laughter) (Applause) Now, you'll still have about three billion pounds left in change, and people will ask for the trains to be slowed down. (Laughter)Now, here is another naive advertising man's question again. And this shows that engineers, medical people, scientific people, have an obsession with solving the problems of reality, when actually most problems, once you reach a basic level of wealth in society, most problems are actually problems of perception. So I'll ask you another question. What on earth is wrong with placebos? They seem fantastic to me. They cost very little to develop. They work extraordinarily well. They have no side effects, or if they do, they're imaginary, so you can safely ignore them. (Laughter)So I was discussing this. And I actually went to the Marginal Revolution blog by Tyler Cowen. I don't know if anybody knows it. Someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further, and actually produce placebo education. The point is that education doesn't actually work by teaching you things. It actually works by giving you the impression that you've had a very good education, which gives you an insane sense of unwarranted self-confidence, which then makes you very, very successful in later life. So, welcome to Oxford, ladies and gentlemen. (Laughter) (Applause)But, actually, the point of placebo education is interesting. How many problems of life can be solved actually by tinkering with perception, rather than that tedious, hardworking and messy business of actually trying to change reality? Here's a great example from history. I've heard this attributed to several other kings, but doing a bit of historical research, it seems to be Fredrick the Great. Fredrick the Great of Prussia was very, very keen for the Germans to adopt the potato and to eat it, because he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate, wheat and potatoes, you get less price volatility in bread. And you get a far lower risk of famine, because you actually had two crops to fall back on, not one.The only problem is: potatoes, if you think about it, look pretty disgusting. And also, 18th century Prussians ate very, very few vegetables \u2014 rather like contemporary Scottish people. (Laughter) So, actually, he tried making it compulsory. The Prussian peasantry said, \"We can't even get the dogs to eat these damn things. They are absolutely disgusting and they're good for nothing.\" There are even records of people being executed for refusing to grow potatoes.So he tried plan B. He tried the marketing solution, which is he declared the potato as a royal vegetable, and none but the royal family could consume it. And he planted it in a royal potato patch, with guards who had instructions to guard over it, night and day, but with secret instructions not to guard it very well. (Laughter) Now, 18th century peasants know that there is one pretty safe rule in life, which is if something is worth guarding, it's worth stealing. Before long, there was a massive underground potato-growing operation in Germany. What he'd effectively done is he'd re-branded the potato. It was an absolute masterpiece.I told this story and a gentleman from Turkey came up to me and said, \"Very, very good marketer, Fredrick the Great. But not a patch on Ataturk.\" Ataturk, rather like Nicolas Sarkozy, was very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil, in Turkey, to modernize it. Now, boring people would have just simply banned the veil. But that would have ended up with a lot of awful kickback and a hell of a lot of resistance. Ataturk was a lateral thinker. He made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil. (Laughter) (Applause)I can't verify that fully, but it does not matter. There is your environmental problem solved, by the way, guys: All convicted child molesters have to drive a Porsche Cayenne. (Laughter) What Ataturk realized actually is two very fundamental things. Which is that, actually, first one, all value is actually relative. All value is perceived value.For those of you who don't speak Spanish, jugo de naranja \u2014 it's actually the Spanish for \"orange juice.\" Because actually it's not the dollar. It's actually the peso in Buenos Aires. Very clever Buenos Aires street vendors decided to practice price discrimination to the detriment of any passing gringo tourists. As an advertising man, I have to admire that.But the first thing is that all value is subjective. Second point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion. These funny signs that flash your speed at you, some of the new ones, on the bottom right, now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face, to act as an emotional trigger. What's fascinating about these signs is they cost about 10 percent of the running cost of a conventional speed camera, but they prevent twice as many accidents. So, the bizarre thing, which is baffling to conventional, classically trained economists, is that a weird little smiley face has a better effect on changing your behavior than the threat of a \u00a360 fine and three penalty points.Tiny little behavioral economics detail: in Italy, penalty points go backwards. You start with 12 and they take them away. Because they found that loss aversion is a more powerful influence on people's behavior. In Britain we tend to feel, \"Whoa! Got another three!\" Not so in Italy.Another fantastic case of creating intangible value to replace actual or material value, which remember, is what, after all, the environmental movement needs to be about: This again is from Prussia, from, I think, about 1812, 1813. The wealthy Prussians, to help in the war against the French, were encouraged to give in all their jewelry. And it was replaced with replica jewelry made of cast iron. Here's one: \"Gold gab ich f\u00fcr Eisen, 1813.\" The interesting thing is that for 50 years hence, the highest status jewelry you could wear in Prussia wasn't made of gold or diamonds. It was made of cast iron. Because actually, never mind the actual intrinsic value of having gold jewelry. This actually had symbolic value, badge value. It said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past.So, the modern equivalent would of course be this. (Laughter) But, actually, there is a thing, just as there are Veblen goods, where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare \u2014 there are opposite kind of things where actually the value in them depends on them being ubiquitous, classless and minimalistic.If you think about it, Shakerism was a proto-environmental movement. Adam Smith talks about 18th century America, where the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great, it was almost a block in the economy in New England, because even wealthy farmers could find nothing to spend their money on without incurring the displeasure of their neighbors. It's perfectly possible to create these social pressures which lead to more egalitarian societies.What's also interesting, if you look at products that have a high component of what you might call messaging value, a high component of intangible value, versus their intrinsic value: They are often quite egalitarian. In terms of dress, denim is perhaps the perfect example of something which replaces material value with symbolic value. Coca-Cola. A bunch of you may be a load of pinkos, and you may not like the Coca-Cola company, but it's worth remembering Andy Warhol's point about Coke. What Warhol said about Coke is, he said, \"What I really like about Coca-Cola is the president of the United States can't get a better Coke than the bum on the corner of the street.\" Now, that is, actually, when you think about it \u2014 we take it for granted \u2014 it's actually a remarkable achievement, to produce something that's that democratic.Now, we basically have to change our views slightly. There is a basic view that real value involves making things, involves labor. It involves engineering. It involves limited raw materials. And that what we add on top is kind of false. It's a fake version. And there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it. It patently veers toward propaganda. However, what we do have now is a much more variegated media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value, and it's much fairer.When I grew up, this was basically the media environment of my childhood as translated into food. You had a monopoly supplier. On the left, you have Rupert Murdoch, or the BBC. (Laughter) And on your right you have a dependent public which is pathetically grateful for anything you give it. (Laughter)Nowadays, the user is actually involved. This is actually what's called, in the digital world, \"user-generated content.\" Although it's called agriculture in the world of food. (Laughter) This is actually called a mash-up, where you take content that someone else has produced and you do something new with it. In the world of food we call it cooking. This is food 2.0, which is food you produce for the purpose of sharing it with other people. This is mobile food. British are very good at that. Fish and chips in newspaper, the Cornish Pasty, the pie, the sandwich. We invented the whole lot of them. We're not very good at food in general. Italians do great food, but it's not very portable, generally. (Laughter)I only learned this the other day. The Earl of Sandwich didn't invent the sandwich. He actually invented the toasty. But then, the Earl of Toasty would be a ridiculous name. (Laughter)Finally, we have contextual communication. Now, the reason I show you Pernod \u2014 it's only one example. Every country has a contextual alcoholic drink. In France it's Pernod. It tastes great within the borders of that country, but absolute shite if you take it anywhere else. (Laughter) Unicum in Hungary, for example. The Greeks have actually managed to produce something called Retsina, which even tastes shite when you're in Greece. (Laughter)But so much communication now is contextual that the capacity for actually nudging people, for giving them better information \u2014 B.J. Fogg, at the University of Stanford, makes the point that actually the mobile phone is \u2014 He's invented the phrase, \"persuasive technologies.\" He believes the mobile phone, by being location-specific, contextual, timely and immediate, is simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented.Now, if we have all these tools at our disposal, we simply have to ask the question, and Thaler and Sunstein have, of how we can use these more intelligently. I'll give you one example. If you had a large red button of this kind, on the wall of your home, and every time you pressed it, it saved 50 dollars for you, put 50 dollars into your pension, you would save a lot more. The reason is that the interface fundamentally determines the behavior. Okay?Now, marketing has done a very, very good job of creating opportunities for impulse buying. Yet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving. If you did this, more people would save more. It's simply a question of changing the interface by which people make decisions, and the very nature of the decisions changes. Obviously, I don't want people to do this, because as an advertising man I tend to regard saving as just consumerism needlessly postponed. (Laughter) But if anybody did want to do that, that's the kind of thing we need to be thinking about, actually: fundamental opportunities to change human behavior.Now, I've got an example here from Canada. There was a young intern at Ogilvy Canada called Hunter Somerville, who was working in improv in Toronto, and got a part-time job in advertising, and was given the job of advertising Shreddies. Now this is the most perfect case of creating intangible, added value, without changing the product in the slightest. Shreddies is a strange, square, whole-grain cereal, only available in New Zealand, Canada and Britain. It's Kraft's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown. (Laughter) In working out how you could re-launch Shreddies, he came up with this.Video: (Buzzer) Man: Shreddies is supposed to be square. (Laughter)Woman: Have any of these diamond shapes gone out? (Laughter)Voiceover: New Diamond Shreddies cereal. Same 100 percent whole-grain wheat in a delicious diamond shape. (Applause)Rory Sutherland: I'm not sure this isn't the most perfect example of intangible value creation. All it requires is photons, neurons, and a great idea to create this thing. I would say it's a work of genius. But, naturally, you can't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research.Man: So, Shreddies is actually producing a new product, which is something very exciting for them. So they are introducing new Diamond Shreddies. (Laughter) So I just want to get your first impressions when you see that, when you see the Diamond Shreddies box there. (Laughter)Woman: Weren't they square?Woman #2: I'm a little bit confused. Woman #3: They look like the squares to me.Man: They \u2014 Yeah, it's all in the appearance. But it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine. Like a six, if you flip it over it looks like a nine. But a six is very different from a nine.Woman # 3: Or an \"M\" and a \"W\". Man: An \"M\" and a \"W\", exactly.Man #2: [unclear] You just looked like you turned it on its end. But when you see it like that it's more interesting looking.Man: Just try both of them. Take a square one there, first. (Laughter) Man: Which one did you prefer? Man #2: The first one.Man: The first one? (Laughter)Rory Sutherland: Now, naturally, a debate raged. There were conservative elements in Canada, unsurprisingly, who actually resented this intrusion. So, eventually, the manufacturers actually arrived at a compromise, which was the combo pack. (Laughter) (Applause) (Laughter)If you think it's funny, bear in mind there is an organization called the American Institute of Wine Economics, which actually does extensive research into perception of things, and discovers that except for among perhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people, there is no correlation between quality and enjoyment in wine, except when you tell the people how expensive it is, in which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more. So drink your wine blind in the future.But this is both hysterically funny \u2014 but I think an important philosophical point, which is, going forward, we need more of this kind of value. We need to spend more time appreciating what already exists, and less time agonizing over what else we can do.Two quotations to more or less end with. One of them is, \"Poetry is when you make new things familiar and familiar things new.\" Which isn't a bad definition of what our job is, to help people appreciate what is unfamiliar, but also to gain a greater appreciation, and place a far higher value on those things which are already existing. There is some evidence, by the way, that things like social networking help do that. Because they help people share news. They give badge value to everyday little trivial activities. So they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display, and increase the kind of third-party enjoyment you can get from the smallest, simplest things in life. Which is magic.The second one is the second G.K. Chesterton quote of this session, which is, \"We are perishing for want of wonder, not for want of wonders,\" which I think for anybody involved in technology, is perfectly true. And a final thing: When you place a value on things like health, love, sex and other things, and learn to place a material value on what you've previously discounted for being merely intangible, a thing not seen, you realize you're much, much wealthier than you ever imagined. Thank you very much indeed. (Applause)", "id": 658, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nThis is my first time at TED. Normally, as an advertising man,\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nI actually speak at TED Evil, which is TED's secret sister\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nthat pays all the bills.\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nIt's held every two years in Burma.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nAnd I particularly remember a really good speech\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nby Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nBut, actually, it's suddenly come to me after years working in the business,\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nthat what we create in advertising,\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nwhich is intangible value -- you might call it perceived value,\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nyou might call it badge value, subjective value,\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nintangible value of some kind --\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\ngets rather a bad rap.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nIf you think about it, if you want to live in a world in the future\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nwhere there are fewer material goods, you basically have two choices.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nYou can either live in a world which is poorer,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nwhich people in general don't like.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nOr you can live in a world where actually intangible value\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nconstitutes a greater part of overall value,\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nthat actually intangible value, in many ways\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nis a very, very fine substitute\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nfor using up labor or limited resources\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nin the creation of things.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nHere is one example. This is a train which goes from London to Paris.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nThe question was given to a bunch of engineers,\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nabout 15 years ago, \"How do we make the journey to Paris better?\"\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nAnd they came up with a very good engineering solution,\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nwhich was to spend six billion pounds\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nbuilding completely new tracks\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nfrom London to the coast,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nand knocking about 40 minutes off a three-and-half-hour journey time.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nNow, call me Mister Picky. I'm just an ad man ...\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.958\n... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nmerely to make it shorter.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nNow what is the hedonic opportunity cost\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\non spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks?\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nHere is my naive advertising man's suggestion.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nWhat you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nand female supermodels,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:56.958\npay them to walk the length of the train, handing out free Chateau Petrus\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nfor the entire duration of the journey.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:01.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nNow, you'll still have about three billion pounds left in change,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nand people will ask for the trains to be slowed down.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nNow, here is another naive advertising man's question again.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nAnd this shows that engineers,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nmedical people, scientific people,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nhave an obsession with solving the problems of reality,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nwhen actually most problems, once you reach a basic level of wealth\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nin society, most problems are actually problems of perception.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nSo I'll ask you another question.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nWhat on earth is wrong with placebos?\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nThey seem fantastic to me. They cost very little to develop.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nThey work extraordinarily well.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nThey have no side effects,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nor if they do, they're imaginary, so you can safely ignore them.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nSo I was discussing this. And I actually went to the Marginal Revolution blog\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nby Tyler Cowen. I don't know if anybody knows it.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nSomeone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nand actually produce placebo education.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nThe point is that education doesn't actually work by teaching you things.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nIt actually works by giving you the impression\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nthat you've had a very good education, which gives you an insane sense\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nof unwarranted self-confidence,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nwhich then makes you very, very successful in later life.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nSo, welcome to Oxford, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:09.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nBut, actually, the point of placebo education is interesting.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nHow many problems of life can be solved\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nactually by tinkering with perception,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nrather than that tedious, hardworking and messy business\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nof actually trying to change reality?\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nHere's a great example from history. I've heard this attributed to several other kings,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nbut doing a bit of historical research,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nit seems to be Fredrick the Great.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nFredrick the Great of Prussia was very, very keen\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nfor the Germans to adopt the potato and to eat it,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nbecause he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nwheat and potatoes, you get less price volatility in bread.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nAnd you get a far lower risk of famine,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nbecause you actually had two crops to fall back on, not one.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nThe only problem is: potatoes, if you think about it, look pretty disgusting.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAnd also, 18th century Prussians ate very, very few vegetables --\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nrather like contemporary Scottish people.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nSo, actually, he tried making it compulsory.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nThe Prussian peasantry said,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\n\"We can't even get the dogs to eat these damn things.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nThey are absolutely disgusting and they're good for nothing.\"\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nThere are even records of people being executed\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nfor refusing to grow potatoes.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nSo he tried plan B.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nHe tried the marketing solution, which is he declared the potato\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nas a royal vegetable, and none but the royal family could consume it.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nAnd he planted it in a royal potato patch,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nwith guards who had instructions\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nto guard over it, night and day,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nbut with secret instructions not to guard it very well.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nNow, 18th century peasants know that there is one\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\npretty safe rule in life, which is if something is worth guarding,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nit's worth stealing.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nBefore long, there was a massive underground\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\npotato-growing operation in Germany.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nWhat he'd effectively done is he'd re-branded the potato.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nIt was an absolute masterpiece.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nI told this story and a gentleman from Turkey came up to me and said,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.958\n\"Very, very good marketer, Fredrick the Great. But not a patch on Ataturk.\"\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nAtaturk, rather like Nicolas Sarkozy,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nwas very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nin Turkey, to modernize it.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nNow, boring people would have just simply banned the veil.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nBut that would have ended up with a lot of awful kickback\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nand a hell of a lot of resistance.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAtaturk was a lateral thinker.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nHe made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nI can't verify that fully, but it does not matter.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nThere is your environmental problem solved, by the way, guys:\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAll convicted child molesters\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nhave to drive a Porsche Cayenne.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nWhat Ataturk realized actually is two very fundamental things.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nWhich is that, actually, first one,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nall value is actually relative.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nAll value is perceived value.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nFor those of you who don't speak Spanish, jugo de naranja -- it's actually the Spanish for \"orange juice.\"\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nBecause actually it's not the dollar. It's actually the peso\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nin Buenos Aires. Very clever Buenos Aires street vendors\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\ndecided to practice price discrimination\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nto the detriment of any passing gringo tourists.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nAs an advertising man, I have to admire that.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nBut the first thing is that all value is subjective.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nSecond point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nThese funny signs that flash your speed at you,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nsome of the new ones, on the bottom right,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nnow actually show a smiley face or a frowny face,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nto act as an emotional trigger.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nWhat's fascinating about these signs is they cost about 10 percent\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nof the running cost of a conventional speed camera,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nbut they prevent twice as many accidents.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nSo, the bizarre thing, which is baffling\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nto conventional, classically trained economists,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nis that a weird little smiley face\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nhas a better effect on changing your behavior\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nthan the threat of a \u00a360 fine and three penalty points.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nTiny little behavioral economics detail:\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nin Italy, penalty points go backwards.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nYou start with 12 and they take them away.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nBecause they found that loss aversion\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nis a more powerful influence on people's behavior.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nIn Britain we tend to feel, \"Whoa!

This actually\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nhad symbolic value, badge value.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nIt said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nSo, the modern equivalent would of course be this.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nBut, actually, there is a thing, just as there are Veblen goods,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nwhere the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare --\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nthere are opposite kind of things\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nwhere actually the value in them depends on them being\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nubiquitous, classless and minimalistic.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nIf you think about it, Shakerism was a proto-environmental movement.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nAdam Smith talks about 18th century America,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nwhere the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nit was almost a block in the economy in New England,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nbecause even wealthy farmers could find nothing to spend their money on\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nwithout incurring the displeasure of their neighbors.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nIt's perfectly possible to create these social pressures\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nwhich lead to more egalitarian societies.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nWhat's also interesting, if you look at products\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nthat have a high component\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nof what you might call messaging value,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\na high component of intangible value, versus their intrinsic value:\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nThey are often quite egalitarian.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nIn terms of dress, denim is perhaps the perfect example of something\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nwhich replaces material value with symbolic value.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nCoca-Cola.

It's a fake version.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nAnd there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nIt patently veers toward propaganda.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nHowever, what we do have now\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nis a much more variegated media ecosystem\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nin which to kind of create this kind of value, and it's much fairer.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nWhen I grew up, this was basically the media environment of my childhood\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nas translated into food.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nYou had a monopoly supplier.

Fogg,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nat the University of Stanford, makes the point\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nthat actually the mobile phone is --\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nHe's invented the phrase, \"persuasive technologies.\"\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nHe believes the mobile phone, by being location-specific,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\ncontextual, timely and immediate,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nis simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nNow, if we have all these tools at our disposal,\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nwe simply have to ask the question,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nand Thaler and Sunstein have, of how we can use these more intelligently.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nI'll give you one example.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nIf you had a large red button of this kind, on the wall of your home,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nand every time you pressed it, it saved 50 dollars for you,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nput 50 dollars into your pension,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nyou would save a lot more.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nThe reason is that the interface fundamentally determines\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nthe behavior. Okay?\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nNow, marketing has done a very, very good job of creating\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nopportunities for impulse buying.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nYet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nIf you did this, more people would save more.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nIt's simply a question of changing the interface\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nby which people make decisions,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nand the very nature of the decisions changes.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nObviously, I don't want people to do this,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nbecause as an advertising man I tend to regard saving as just\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nconsumerism needlessly postponed.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nBut if anybody did want to do that,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nthat's the kind of thing we need to be thinking about, actually:\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nfundamental opportunities to change human behavior.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nNow, I've got an example here from Canada.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nThere was a young intern at Ogilvy Canada\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\ncalled Hunter Somerville,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nwho was working in improv in Toronto,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nand got a part-time job in advertising,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nand was given the job of advertising Shreddies.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nNow this is the most perfect case of creating\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nintangible, added value,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nwithout changing the product in the slightest.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nShreddies is a strange, square, whole-grain cereal,\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nonly available in New Zealand, Canada and Britain.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nIt's Kraft's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nIn working out how you could re-launch Shreddies,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nhe came up with this.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nVideo: (Buzzer)\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nMan: Shreddies is supposed to be square.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:48.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nWoman: Have any of these diamond shapes gone out?\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nVoiceover: New Diamond Shreddies cereal.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nSame 100 percent whole-grain wheat in a delicious diamond shape.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:02.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nRory Sutherland: I'm not sure this isn't the most perfect example\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nof intangible value creation. All it requires is\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nphotons, neurons, and a great idea to create this thing.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nI would say it's a work of genius.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nBut, naturally, you can't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nMan: So, Shreddies is actually producing a new product,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nwhich is something very exciting for them.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nSo they are introducing new Diamond Shreddies.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:28.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nSo I just want to get your first impressions when you see that,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nwhen you see the Diamond Shreddies box there.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nWoman: Weren't they square?\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nWoman #2: I'm a little bit confused. Woman #3: They look like the squares to me.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nMan: They -- Yeah, it's all in the appearance.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nBut it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine. Like a six,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nif you flip it over it looks like a nine.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nBut a six is very different from a nine.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nWoman # 3: Or an \"M\" and a \"W\". Man: An \"M\" and a \"W\", exactly.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nMan #2: [unclear]\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nYou just looked like you turned it on its end. But when you see it like that\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nit's more interesting looking.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nMan: Just try both of them.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nTake a square one there, first.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nMan: Which one did you prefer? Man #2: The first one.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nMan: The first one?\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nRory Sutherland: Now, naturally, a debate raged.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nThere were conservative elements in Canada, unsurprisingly,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nwho actually resented this intrusion.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nSo, eventually, the manufacturers actually\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\narrived at a compromise, which was the combo pack.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:45.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nIf you think it's funny, bear in mind there is an organization called\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nthe American Institute of Wine Economics,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nwhich actually does extensive research into perception of things,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nand discovers that except for among\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nperhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nthere is no correlation between quality and enjoyment\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nin wine,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nexcept when you tell the people how expensive it is,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nin which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nSo drink your wine blind in the future.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nBut this is both hysterically funny --\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nbut I think an important philosophical point,\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nwhich is, going forward, we need more of this kind of value.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nWe need to spend more time appreciating what already exists,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nand less time agonizing over what else we can do.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nTwo quotations to more or less end with.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nOne of them is, \"Poetry is when you make new things\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nfamiliar and familiar things new.\"\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nWhich isn't a bad definition of what our job is,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nto help people appreciate what is unfamiliar, but also\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nto gain a greater appreciation, and place a far higher value on\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nthose things which are already existing.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nThere is some evidence, by the way, that things like social networking help do that.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nBecause they help people share news.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nThey give badge value to everyday little trivial activities.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nSo they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display,\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nand increase the kind of third-party\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nenjoyment you can get from the smallest, simplest things in life. Which is magic.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nThe second one is the second G.K. Chesterton quote of this session,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nwhich is, \"We are perishing for want of wonder, not for want of wonders,\"\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nwhich I think for anybody involved in technology, is perfectly true.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nAnd a final thing: When you place a value on things like health,\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nlove, sex and other things,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nand learn to place a material value\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\non what you've previously discounted\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nfor being merely intangible, a thing not seen,\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nyou realize you're much, much wealthier than you ever imagined.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nThank you very much indeed.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:28.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A brain in a supercomputer", "duration": "890", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/henry_markram_supercomputing_the_brain_s_secrets", "transcript": "Our mission is to build a detailed, realistic computer model of the human brain. And we've done, in the past four years, a proof of concept on a small part of the rodent brain, and with this proof of concept we are now scaling the project up to reach the human brain.Why are we doing this? There are three important reasons. The first is, it's essential for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society, and I think that it is a key step in evolution. The second reason is, we cannot keep doing animal experimentation forever, and we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge into a working model. It's like a Noah's Ark. It's like an archive. And the third reason is that there are two billion people on the planet that are affected by mental disorder, and the drugs that are used today are largely empirical. I think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on how to treat disorders.Now, even at this stage, we can use the brain model to explore some fundamental questions about how the brain works. And here, at TED, for the first time, I'd like to share with you how we're addressing one theory \u2014 there are many theories \u2014 one theory of how the brain works. So, this theory is that the brain creates, builds, a version of the universe, and projects this version of the universe, like a bubble, all around us.Now, this is of course a topic of philosophical debate for centuries. But, for the first time, we can actually address this, with brain simulation, and ask very systematic and rigorous questions, whether this theory could possibly be true. The reason why the moon is huge on the horizon is simply because our perceptual bubble does not stretch out 380,000 kilometers. It runs out of space. And so what we do is we compare the buildings within our perceptual bubble, and we make a decision. We make a decision it's that big, even though it's not that big.And what that illustrates is that decisions are the key things that support our perceptual bubble. It keeps it alive. Without decisions you cannot see, you cannot think, you cannot feel. And you may think that anesthetics work by sending you into some deep sleep, or by blocking your receptors so that you don't feel pain, but in fact most anesthetics don't work that way. What they do is they introduce a noise into the brain so that the neurons cannot understand each other. They are confused, and you cannot make a decision. So, while you're trying to make up your mind what the doctor, the surgeon, is doing while he's hacking away at your body, he's long gone. He's at home having tea. (Laughter)So, when you walk up to a door and you open it, what you compulsively have to do to perceive is to make decisions, thousands of decisions about the size of the room, the walls, the height, the objects in this room. 99 percent of what you see is not what comes in through the eyes. It is what you infer about that room. So I can say, with some certainty, \"I think, therefore I am.\" But I cannot say, \"You think, therefore you are,\" because \"you\" are within my perceptual bubble.Now, we can speculate and philosophize this, but we don't actually have to for the next hundred years. We can ask a very concrete question. \"Can the brain build such a perception?\" Is it capable of doing it? Does it have the substance to do it? And that's what I'm going to describe to you today.So, it took the universe 11 billion years to build the brain. It had to improve it a little bit. It had to add to the frontal part, so that you would have instincts, because they had to cope on land. But the real big step was the neocortex. It's a new brain. You needed it. The mammals needed it because they had to cope with parenthood, social interactions, complex cognitive functions.So, you can think of the neocortex actually as the ultimate solution today, of the universe as we know it. It's the pinnacle, it's the final product that the universe has produced. It was so successful in evolution that from mouse to man it expanded about a thousandfold in terms of the numbers of neurons, to produce this almost frightening organ, structure. And it has not stopped its evolutionary path. In fact, the neocortex in the human brain is evolving at an enormous speed.If you zoom into the surface of the neocortex, you discover that it's made up of little modules, G5 processors, like in a computer. But there are about a million of them. They were so successful in evolution that what we did was to duplicate them over and over and add more and more of them to the brain until we ran out of space in the skull. And the brain started to fold in on itself, and that's why the neocortex is so highly convoluted. We're just packing in columns, so that we'd have more neocortical columns to perform more complex functions.So you can think of the neocortex actually as a massive grand piano, a million-key grand piano. Each of these neocortical columns would produce a note. You stimulate it; it produces a symphony. But it's not just a symphony of perception. It's a symphony of your universe, your reality. Now, of course it takes years to learn how to master a grand piano with a million keys. That's why you have to send your kids to good schools, hopefully eventually to Oxford. But it's not only education. It's also genetics. You may be born lucky, where you know how to master your neocortical column, and you can play a fantastic symphony.In fact, there is a new theory of autism called the \"intense world\" theory, which suggests that the neocortical columns are super-columns. They are highly reactive, and they are super-plastic, and so the autists are probably capable of building and learning a symphony which is unthinkable for us. But you can also understand that if you have a disease within one of these columns, the note is going to be off. The perception, the symphony that you create is going to be corrupted, and you will have symptoms of disease.So, the Holy Grail for neuroscience is really to understand the design of the neocoritical column \u2014 and it's not just for neuroscience; it's perhaps to understand perception, to understand reality, and perhaps to even also understand physical reality. So, what we did was, for the past 15 years, was to dissect out the neocortex, systematically. It's a bit like going and cataloging a piece of the rainforest. How many trees does it have? What shapes are the trees? How many of each type of tree do you have? Where are they positioned?But it's a bit more than cataloging because you actually have to describe and discover all the rules of communication, the rules of connectivity, because the neurons don't just like to connect with any neuron. They choose very carefully who they connect with. It's also more than cataloging because you actually have to build three-dimensional digital models of them. And we did that for tens of thousands of neurons, built digital models of all the different types of neurons we came across. And once you have that, you can actually begin to build the neocortical column.And here we're coiling them up. But as you do this, what you see is that the branches intersect actually in millions of locations, and at each of these intersections they can form a synapse. And a synapse is a chemical location where they communicate with each other. And these synapses together form the network or the circuit of the brain. Now, the circuit, you could also think of as the fabric of the brain. And when you think of the fabric of the brain, the structure, how is it built? What is the pattern of the carpet? You realize that this poses a fundamental challenge to any theory of the brain, and especially to a theory that says that there is some reality that emerges out of this carpet, out of this particular carpet with a particular pattern.The reason is because the most important design secret of the brain is diversity. Every neuron is different. It's the same in the forest. Every pine tree is different. You may have many different types of trees, but every pine tree is different. And in the brain it's the same. So there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another, and there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in yours. And your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned in exactly the same way. And you may have more or less neurons. So it's very unlikely that you got the same fabric, the same circuitry.So, how could we possibly create a reality that we can even understand each other? Well, we don't have to speculate. We can look at all 10 million synapses now. We can look at the fabric. And we can change neurons. We can use different neurons with different variations. We can position them in different places, orient them in different places. We can use less or more of them. And when we do that what we discovered is that the circuitry does change. But the pattern of how the circuitry is designed does not. So, the fabric of the brain, even though your brain may be smaller, bigger, it may have different types of neurons, different morphologies of neurons, we actually do share the same fabric. And we think this is species-specific, which means that that could explain why we can't communicate across species.So, let's switch it on. But to do it, what you have to do is you have to make this come alive. We make it come alive with equations, a lot of mathematics. And, in fact, the equations that make neurons into electrical generators were discovered by two Cambridge Nobel Laureates. So, we have the mathematics to make neurons come alive. We also have the mathematics to describe how neurons collect information, and how they create a little lightning bolt to communicate with each other. And when they get to the synapse, what they do is they effectively, literally, shock the synapse. It's like electrical shock that releases the chemicals from these synapses.And we've got the mathematics to describe this process. So we can describe the communication between the neurons. There literally are only a handful of equations that you need to simulate the activity of the neocortex. But what you do need is a very big computer. And in fact you need one laptop to do all the calculations just for one neuron. So you need 10,000 laptops. So where do you go? You go to IBM, and you get a supercomputer, because they know how to take 10,000 laptops and put it into the size of a refrigerator. So now we have this Blue Gene supercomputer. We can load up all the neurons, each one on to its processor, and fire it up, and see what happens. Take the magic carpet for a ride.Here we activate it. And this gives the first glimpse of what is happening in your brain when there is a stimulation. It's the first view. Now, when you look at that the first time, you think, \"My god. How is reality coming out of that?\" But, in fact, you can start, even though we haven't trained this neocortical column to create a specific reality. But we can ask, \"Where is the rose?\" We can ask, \"Where is it inside, if we stimulate it with a picture?\" Where is it inside the neocortex? Ultimately it's got to be there if we stimulated it with it.So, the way that we can look at that is to ignore the neurons, ignore the synapses, and look just at the raw electrical activity. Because that is what it's creating. It's creating electrical patterns. So when we did this, we indeed, for the first time, saw these ghost-like structures: electrical objects appearing within the neocortical column. And it's these electrical objects that are holding all the information about whatever stimulated it. And then when we zoomed into this, it's like a veritable universe.So the next step is just to take these brain coordinates and to project them into perceptual space. And if you do that, you will be able to step inside the reality that is created by this machine, by this piece of the brain. So, in summary, I think that the universe may have \u2014 it's possible \u2014 evolved a brain to see itself, which may be a first step in becoming aware of itself. There is a lot more to do to test these theories, and to test any other theories. But I hope that you are at least partly convinced that it is not impossible to build a brain. We can do it within 10 years, and if we do succeed, we will send to TED, in 10 years, a hologram to talk to you. Thank you.

It's like an archive.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nAnd the third reason is that there are two billion people on the planet\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nthat are affected by mental disorder,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nand the drugs that are used today\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nare largely empirical.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nI think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nhow to treat disorders.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nNow, even at this stage,\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nwe can use the brain model\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nto explore some fundamental questions\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nabout how the brain works.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nAnd here, at TED, for the first time,\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nI'd like to share with you how we're addressing\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\none theory -- there are many theories --\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:43.958\none theory of how the brain works.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nSo, this theory is that the brain\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:53.958\ncreates, builds, a version of the universe,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nand projects this version of the universe,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nlike a bubble, all around us.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nNow, this is of course a topic of philosophical debate for centuries.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nBut, for the first time, we can actually address this,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nwith brain simulation,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nand ask very systematic and rigorous questions,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nwhether this theory could possibly be true.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nThe reason why the moon is huge on the horizon\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nis simply because our perceptual bubble\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:27.958\ndoes not stretch out 380,000 kilometers.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nIt runs out of space.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nAnd so what we do is we compare the buildings\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nwithin our perceptual bubble,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nand we make a decision.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nWe make a decision it's that big,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\neven though it's not that big.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nAnd what that illustrates\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nis that decisions are the key things\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nthat support our perceptual bubble. It keeps it alive.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nWithout decisions you cannot see, you cannot think,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nyou cannot feel.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nAnd you may think that anesthetics work\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nby sending you into some deep sleep,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nor by blocking your receptors so that you don't feel pain,\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nbut in fact most anesthetics don't work that way.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nWhat they do is they introduce a noise\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\ninto the brain so that the neurons cannot understand each other.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nThey are confused,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nand you cannot make a decision.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nSo, while you're trying to make up your mind\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nwhat the doctor, the surgeon, is doing\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nwhile he's hacking away at your body, he's long gone.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nHe's at home having tea.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nSo, when you walk up to a door and you open it,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nwhat you compulsively have to do to perceive\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nis to make decisions,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nthousands of decisions about the size of the room,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nthe walls, the height, the objects in this room.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\n99 percent of what you see\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nis not what comes in through the eyes.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nIt is what you infer about that room.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nSo I can say, with some certainty,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\n\"I think, therefore I am.\"\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nBut I cannot say, \"You think, therefore you are,\"\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nbecause \"you\" are within my perceptual bubble.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nNow, we can speculate and philosophize this,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nbut we don't actually have to for the next hundred years.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nWe can ask a very concrete question.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:20.958\n\"Can the brain build such a perception?\"\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nIs it capable of doing it?\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nDoes it have the substance to do it?\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nAnd that's what I'm going to describe to you today.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nSo, it took the universe 11 billion years to build the brain.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nIt had to improve it a little bit.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nIt had to add to the frontal part, so that you would have instincts,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nbecause they had to cope on land.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nBut the real big step was the neocortex.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nIt's a new brain. You needed it.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nThe mammals needed it\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nbecause they had to cope with parenthood,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nsocial interactions,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\ncomplex cognitive functions.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nSo, you can think of the neocortex\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nactually as the ultimate solution today,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nof the universe as we know it.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nIt's the pinnacle, it's the final product\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nthat the universe has produced.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nIt was so successful in evolution\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nthat from mouse to man it expanded\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nabout a thousandfold in terms of the numbers of neurons,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nto produce this almost frightening\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\norgan, structure.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nAnd it has not stopped its evolutionary path.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nIn fact, the neocortex in the human brain\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nis evolving at an enormous speed.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nIf you zoom into the surface of the neocortex,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nyou discover that it's made up of little modules,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nG5 processors, like in a computer.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nBut there are about a million of them.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nThey were so successful in evolution\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nthat what we did was to duplicate them\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nover and over and add more and more of them to the brain\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nuntil we ran out of space in the skull.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nAnd the brain started to fold in on itself,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nand that's why the neocortex is so highly convoluted.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nWe're just packing in columns,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nso that we'd have more neocortical columns\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nto perform more complex functions.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nSo you can think of the neocortex actually as\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\na massive grand piano,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\na million-key grand piano.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nEach of these neocortical columns\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nwould produce a note.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nYou stimulate it; it produces a symphony.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nBut it's not just a symphony of perception.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nIt's a symphony of your universe, your reality.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nNow, of course it takes years to learn how\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nto master a grand piano with a million keys.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nThat's why you have to send your kids to good schools,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nhopefully eventually to Oxford.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nBut it's not only education.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nIt's also genetics.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nYou may be born lucky,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nwhere you know how to master your neocortical column,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nand you can play a fantastic symphony.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nIn fact, there is a new theory of autism\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\ncalled the \"intense world\" theory,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nwhich suggests that the neocortical columns are super-columns.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nThey are highly reactive, and they are super-plastic,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nand so the autists are probably capable of\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nbuilding and learning a symphony\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nwhich is unthinkable for us.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nBut you can also understand\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nthat if you have a disease\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nwithin one of these columns,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nthe note is going to be off.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nThe perception, the symphony that you create\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nis going to be corrupted,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nand you will have symptoms of disease.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nSo, the Holy Grail for neuroscience\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nis really to understand the design of the neocoritical column --\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nand it's not just for neuroscience;\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nit's perhaps to understand perception, to understand reality,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nand perhaps to even also understand physical reality.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nSo, what we did was, for the past 15 years,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nwas to dissect out the neocortex, systematically.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nIt's a bit like going and cataloging a piece of the rainforest.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nHow many trees does it have?\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nWhat shapes are the trees?\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nHow many of each type of tree do you have? Where are they positioned?\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nBut it's a bit more than cataloging because you actually have to\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:04.958\ndescribe and discover all the rules of communication,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nthe rules of connectivity,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nbecause the neurons don't just like to connect with any neuron.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nThey choose very carefully who they connect with.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nIt's also more than cataloging\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nbecause you actually have to build three-dimensional\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\ndigital models of them.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nAnd we did that for tens of thousands of neurons,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nbuilt digital models of all the different types\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nof neurons we came across.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nAnd once you have that, you can actually\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nbegin to build the neocortical column.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nAnd here we're coiling them up.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nBut as you do this, what you see\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nis that the branches intersect\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nactually in millions of locations,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nand at each of these intersections\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nthey can form a synapse.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nAnd a synapse is a chemical location\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nwhere they communicate with each other.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nAnd these synapses together\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nform the network\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nor the circuit of the brain.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nNow, the circuit, you could also think of as\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nthe fabric of the brain.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nAnd when you think of the fabric of the brain,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nthe structure, how is it built? What is the pattern of the carpet?\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nYou realize that this poses\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.958\na fundamental challenge to any theory of the brain,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nand especially to a theory that says\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nthat there is some reality that emerges\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nout of this carpet, out of this particular carpet\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nwith a particular pattern.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nThe reason is because the most important design secret of the brain\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nis diversity.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nEvery neuron is different.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nIt's the same in the forest. Every pine tree is different.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nYou may have many different types of trees,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nbut every pine tree is different. And in the brain it's the same.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nSo there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another,\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nand there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in yours.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nAnd your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nin exactly the same way.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nAnd you may have more or less neurons.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nSo it's very unlikely\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nthat you got the same fabric, the same circuitry.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nSo, how could we possibly create a reality\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nthat we can even understand each other?\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nWell, we don't have to speculate.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nWe can look at all 10 million synapses now.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nWe can look at the fabric. And we can change neurons.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nWe can use different neurons with different variations.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nWe can position them in different places,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\norient them in different places.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nWe can use less or more of them.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nAnd when we do that\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nwhat we discovered is that the circuitry does change.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nBut the pattern of how the circuitry is designed does not.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nSo, the fabric of the brain,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\neven though your brain may be smaller, bigger,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nit may have different types of neurons,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\ndifferent morphologies of neurons,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nwe actually do share\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nthe same fabric.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nAnd we think this is species-specific,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nwhich means that that could explain\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nwhy we can't communicate across species.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nSo, let's switch it on. But to do it, what you have to do\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nis you have to make this come alive.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nWe make it come alive\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nwith equations, a lot of mathematics.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nAnd, in fact, the equations that make neurons into electrical generators\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nwere discovered by two Cambridge Nobel Laureates.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nSo, we have the mathematics to make neurons come alive.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nWe also have the mathematics to describe\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nhow neurons collect information,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nand how they create a little lightning bolt\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nto communicate with each other.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAnd when they get to the synapse,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nwhat they do is they effectively,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nliterally, shock the synapse.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nIt's like electrical shock\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nthat releases the chemicals from these synapses.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nAnd we've got the mathematics to describe this process.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nSo we can describe the communication between the neurons.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nThere literally are only a handful\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nof equations that you need to simulate\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nthe activity of the neocortex.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nBut what you do need is a very big computer.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nAnd in fact you need one laptop\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nto do all the calculations just for one neuron.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nSo you need 10,000 laptops.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nSo where do you go? You go to IBM,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nand you get a supercomputer, because they know how to take\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.958\n10,000 laptops and put it into the size of a refrigerator.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nSo now we have this Blue Gene supercomputer.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nWe can load up all the neurons,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\neach one on to its processor,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nand fire it up, and see what happens.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nTake the magic carpet for a ride.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nHere we activate it. And this gives the first glimpse\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nof what is happening in your brain\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nwhen there is a stimulation.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nIt's the first view.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nNow, when you look at that the first time, you think,\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:37.958\n\"My god. How is reality coming out of that?\"\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nBut, in fact, you can start,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.958\neven though we haven't trained this neocortical column\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nto create a specific reality.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nBut we can ask, \"Where is the rose?\"\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nWe can ask, \"Where is it inside,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nif we stimulate it with a picture?\"\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nWhere is it inside the neocortex?\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nUltimately it's got to be there if we stimulated it with it.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nSo, the way that we can look at that\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nis to ignore the neurons, ignore the synapses,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nand look just at the raw electrical activity.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nBecause that is what it's creating.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nIt's creating electrical patterns.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nSo when we did this,\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nwe indeed, for the first time,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nsaw these ghost-like structures:\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nelectrical objects appearing\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nwithin the neocortical column.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd it's these electrical objects\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nthat are holding all the information about\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nwhatever stimulated it.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nAnd then when we zoomed into this,\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nit's like a veritable universe.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nSo the next step\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nis just to take these brain coordinates\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nand to project them into perceptual space.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nAnd if you do that,\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nyou will be able to step inside\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nthe reality that is created\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nby this machine,\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nby this piece of the brain.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nSo, in summary,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nI think that the universe may have --\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nit's possible --\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nevolved a brain to see itself,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nwhich may be a first step in becoming aware of itself.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nThere is a lot more to do to test these theories,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nand to test any other theories.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nBut I hope that you are at least partly convinced\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nthat it is not impossible to build a brain.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nWe can do it within 10 years,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nand if we do succeed,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nwe will send to TED, in 10 years,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\na hologram to talk to you.

Let me start with the observation that most of the sound around us is accidental; much of it is unpleasant. (Traffic noise) We stand on street corners, shouting over noise like this, pretending it doesn't exist. This habit of suppressing sound has meant that our relationship with sound has become largely unconscious.There are four major ways sound is affecting you all the time, and I'd like to raise them in your consciousness today. The first is physiological.(Alarm clocks ring)Sorry about that. I just gave you a shot of cortisol, your fight-flight hormone. Sounds are affecting your hormone secretions all the time, but also your breathing, heart rate \u2014 which I just also did \u2014 and your brainwaves.It's not just unpleasant sounds like that that do it. This is surf. (Ocean waves) It has the frequency of roughly 12 cycles per minute. Most people find that very soothing, and, interestingly, 12 cycles per minute is roughly the frequency of the breathing of a sleeping human, so there is a deep resonance with being at rest. We also associate it with being stress-free and on holiday.The second way in which sound affects you is psychological. Music is the most powerful form of sound that we know that affects our emotional state. (Albinoni's Adagio) This is guaranteed to make most of you feel pretty sad if I leave it on. Music is not the only kind of sound, however, which affects your emotions.Natural sound can do that, too. Birdsong, for example, is a sound which most people find reassuring. There's a reason: over hundreds of thousands of years we've learned that when the birds are singing, things are safe. It's when they stop you need to be worried.The third way in which sound affects you is cognitively. You can't understand two people talking at once (Voice-over) or in this case, one person talking twice. You have to choose which me you're going to listen to.We have a very small amount of bandwidth for processing auditory input, which is why noise like this ...(Office noise)is extremely damaging for productivity. If you have to work in an open-plan office like this, your productivity is greatly reduced. And whatever number you're thinking of, it probably isn't as bad as this.[Open-plan offices productivity down 66%]You are one-third as productive in open-plan offices as in quiet rooms. I have a tip for you: if you work in spaces like that, carry headphones with you, with a soothing sound like birdsong. Put them on, and your productivity goes back up to triple what it would be.The fourth way in which sound affects us is behaviorally. With all that other stuff going on, it would be amazing if our behavior didn't change.(Techno music)So ask yourself: Is this person ever going to drive at a steady 28 miles per hour? I don't think so. At the simplest, you move away from unpleasant sound and towards pleasant sounds. So if I were to play this ...(Jackhammer)for more than a few seconds, you'd feel uncomfortable; for more than a few minutes, you'd be leaving the room in droves. For people who can't get away from noise like that, it's extremely damaging for their health.And that's not the only thing that bad sound damages. Most retail sound is inappropriate and accidental, even hostile, and it has a dramatic effect on sales. For you retailers, you may want to look away before I show this slide.[Inappropriate retail soundscapes sales down 28%]They're losing up to 30 percent of their business with people leaving shops faster, or just turning around at the door. We've all done it, left the area, because the sound in there is so dreadful.I want to spend just a moment talking about the model we've developed, which allows us to start at the top and look at the drivers of sound, analyze the soundscape and then predict the four outcomes I just talked about. Or start at the bottom and say what outcomes we want, and then design a soundscape to have a desired effect. At last we've got some science we can apply. And we're in the business of designing soundscapes.Just a word on music. Music is the most powerful sound there is, often inappropriately deployed. It's powerful for two reasons: you recognize it fast, and you associate it very powerfully. I'll give you two examples.(First chord of \"A Hard Day's Night\")Most of you recognize that immediately. The younger, maybe not.(Laughter)(First notes of \"Jaws\" theme)Most of you associate that with something! Now, those are one-second samples of music. Music is very powerful, and unfortunately, it's veneering commercial spaces, often inappropriately. I hope that's going to change over the next few years.Let me talk about brands for a moment, since some of you run brands. Every brand is out there making sound right now. There are eight expressions of a brand in sound; they're all important. And every brand needs to have guidelines at the center. I'm glad to say that is starting to happen now.(Intel ad jingle)You all recognize that one.(Nokia ringtone)This is the most-played tune in the world today \u2014 1.8 billion times a day, that tune is played.(Laughter)And it cost Nokia absolutely nothing.I'll leave you with four golden rules, for those of you who run businesses, for commercial sound. First, make it congruent, pointing in the same direction as your visual communication. That increases impact by over 1,100 percent. If your sound is pointing the opposite direction, incongruent, you reduce impact by 86 percent. That's an order of magnitude, up or down. This is important. Secondly, make it appropriate to the situation. Thirdly, make it valuable. Give people something with the sound, don't just bombard them with stuff. Finally, test and test it again. Sound is complex; there are many countervailing influences. It can be a bit like a bowl of spaghetti: sometimes you just have to eat it and see what happens.So I hope this talk has raised sound in your consciousness. If you're listening consciously, you can take control of the sound around you. It's good for your health and for your productivity. If we all do that, we move to a state that I like to think will be sound living in the world. I'll leave you with more birdsong.

sound is pointing\nthe opposite direction, incongruent,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.934\nyou reduce impact by 86 percent.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.644\nThat's an order of magnitude, up or down.\n\n00:04:56.668 --> 00:04:58.152\nThis is important.\n\n00:04:58.176 --> 00:05:00.934\nSecondly, make it appropriate\nto the situation.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.215\nThirdly, make it

again.\n\n00:05:07.314 --> 00:05:10.098\nSound is complex; there are many\ncountervailing influences.\n\n00:05:10.122 --> 00:05:12.099\nIt can be a bit like a bowl of spaghetti:\n\n00:05:12.123 -->

"https://www.ted.com/talks/john_gerzema_the_post_crisis_consumer", "transcript": "Thirteen trillion dollars in wealth has evaporated over the course of the last two years. We've questioned the future of capitalism. We've questioned the financial industry. We've looked at our government oversight. We've questioned where we're going. And yet, at the same time, this very well may be a seminal moment in American history, an opportunity for the consumer to actually take control and guide us to a new trajectory in America.I'm calling this The Great Unwind.(Laughter)And the idea is a simple, simple idea, which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action. Consumers who represent 72 percent of the GDP of America have actually started, just like banks and just like businesses, to de-leverage, to unwind their leverage in daily life, to remove themselves from the liability and risk that presents itself as they move forward.So, to understand this \u2014 and I'm going to stress this \u2014 it's not about the consumer being in retreat. The consumer is empowered. To understand this, we'll step back and look at what's happened over the last year and a half. So if you've been gone, this is the CliffsNotes on what's happened in the economy.(Laughter)Unemployment up. Housing values down. Equity markets down. Commodity prices are like this.If you're a mom trying to manage a budget, and oil was 150 dollars a barrel last summer, and it's somewhere between 50 and 70, do you plan vacations? How do you buy? What's your strategy in your household? Will the bailout work? We have national debt, Detroit, currency valuations, health care \u2014 all these issues facing us. You put them all together, mix them up in a bouillabaisse, and you have consumer confidence that's basically a ticking time bomb.In fact, let's go back and look at what caused this crisis, because the consumer, all of us, in our daily lives, actually contributed a large part to the problem. This is something I call the 50-20 paradox. It took us 50 years to reach annual savings ratings of almost 10 percent. Fifty years. Do you know what this was right here? This was World War II. Do you know why savings was so high? There was nothing to buy, unless you wanted to buy some rivets.What happened, though, over the course of the last 20 years, we went from a 10 percent savings rate to a negative savings rate. Because we binged. We bought extra-large cars, supersized everything, we bought remedies for restless leg syndrome. All these things together basically created a factor where the consumer drove us headlong into the crisis that we face today. The personal debt-to-income ratio basically went from 65 to 135 percent in the span of about 15 years. So consumers got over-leveraged. And of course our banks did as well, as did our federal government.This is an absolutely staggering chart. It shows leverage, trended out from 1919 to 2009. And what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education, future children in our households.So if you look at this in the context of visualizing the bailout, what you can see is, if you stack up dollar bills, first of all, 360,000 dollars is about the size of a five-foot-four guy. But if you stack it up, you see this amazing, staggering amount of dollars that have been put into the system to fund and bail us out. So this is the first 315 billion. But I read this fact the other day, that one trillion seconds equals 32,000 years. So if you think about that, the context, the casualness with which we talk about trillion-dollar bailout here and trillion there, we are stacking ourselves up for long-term leverage.However, consumers have moved. They are taking responsibility. What we're seeing is an uptake in the savings rate. In fact, 11 straight months of savings have happened since the beginning of the crisis. We're working our way back up to that 10 percent. Also, remarkably, in the fourth quarter, spending dropped to its lowest level in 62 years \u2014 almost a 3.7 percent decline.Visa now reports that more people are using debit cards than credit cards. So we're starting to pay for things with money that we have. And we're starting to be much more careful about how we save and invest. But that's not really the whole story, because this has also been a dramatic time of transformation. And you've got to admit, over the last year and a half, consumers have been doing some weird things. It's pretty staggering, what we've lived through. If you take into account that 80 percent of all Americans were born after World War II, this was essentially our Depression.And so, as a result, some crazy things have happened. I'll give you some examples. Let's talk about dentists, vasectomies, guns and shark attacks.(Laughter)Dentists report molars \u2014 people grinding their teeth, coming in and reporting that they've had stress. So there's an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced. Gun sales, according to the FBI, who does background checks, are up almost 25 percent since January. Vasectomies are up 48 percent, according to the Cornell Institute. And lastly, but a very good point, hopefully not related to the former point I just made, which is that shark attacks are at their lowest level from 2003. Does anybody know why?(Laughter)No one's at the beach. So there's a bright side to everything.But seriously, what we see happening, and the reason I want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat, is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the consumer who drove us into this recession to lead us right back out. What I mean by that is we can move from mindless consumption to mindful consumption. Right?(Applause)If you think about the last three decades, the consumer has moved from savvy about marketing in the '90s, to gathering all these amazing social and search tools in this decade. But the one thing holding them back is the ability to discriminate. By restricting their demand, consumers can actually align their values with their spending, and drive capitalism and business to not just be about more, but to be about better.We're going to explain that right now. Based on Y&R's BrandAsset Valuator, proprietary tool of VML and Young & Rubicam, we set out to understand what's been happening in the crisis with the consumer marketplace. We found a couple of really interesting things. We're going to go through four value shifts that we see driving new consumer behaviors, that offer new management principles.The first cultural value shift we see is this tendency toward something we call \"liquid life.\" This is the movement from Americans defining their success on having things to having liquidity, because the less excess that you have around you, the more nimble and fleet of foot you are. As a result, d\u00e9class\u00e9 consumption is in. D\u00e9class\u00e9 consumption is the whole idea that spending money frivolously makes you look a little bit anti-fashion. The management principle is dollars and cents.So let's look at some examples of this d\u00e9class\u00e9 consumption that falls out of this value. The first thing is, something must be happening when P. Diddy vows to tone down his bling.(Laughter)But seriously, we also have this phenomenon on Madison Avenue and in other places, where people are actually walking out of luxury boutiques with ordinary, generic paper bags to hide the brand purchases. We see high-end haggling in fashion today, high-end haggling for luxury and real estate. We also see just a relaxing of ego, and sort of a dismantling of artifice.This is a story on the yacht club that's all basically blue collar. Blue-collar yacht club \u2014 where you can join, but you've got to work in the boatyard as condition of membership. We also see the trend toward tourism that's a little bit more low-key: agritourism \u2014 going to vineyards and going to farms.And then we also see this movement forward from dollars and cents. What businesses can do to connect with these new mindsets is really interesting. A couple things that are kind of cool. One is that Frito-Lay figured out this liquidity thing with their consumer. They found their consumer had more money at the beginning of the month, less at the end of the month. So they started to change their packaging: larger packs at the beginning of the month, smaller packaging at the end of the month.Really interestingly, too, was the San Francisco Giants. They've just instituted dynamic pricing. It takes into account everything from the pitcher match-ups, to the weather, to the team records, in setting prices for the consumer. Another quick example of these types of movements is the rise of Zynga. Zynga has risen on the consumer's desire to not want to be locked in to fixed cost. Again, this theme is about variable cost, variable living. So micro-payments have become huge. And lastly, some people are using Hulu as a device to get rid of their cable bill. So, really clever ideas there that are being taken ahold of and that marketers are starting to understand.The second of the four values is this movement toward ethics and fair play. We see that play itself out with empathy and respect. The consumer is demanding it. And, as a result, businesses must provide not only value, but values. Increasingly, consumers are looking at the culture of the company, at their conduct in the marketplace. So we see with empathy and respect lots of really hopeful things come out of this recession. I'll give you a few examples.One is the rise toward communities and neighborhoods, and increased emphasis on your neighbors as your support system. Also, a wonderful by-product of a really lousy thing, which has been unemployment, is a rise in volunteerism that's been noted in our country. We also see the phenomenon \u2014 some of you may have \"boomerang kids\" \u2014 these are \"boomerang alumni,\" where universities are actually reconnecting with alumni and helping them with jobs, sharing skills and retraining. We also talked about character and professionalism. We had this miracle on the Hudson in New York City in January, and suddenly Sully has become a key name on BabyCenter.(Laughter)So, from a value and values standpoint, what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways. Microsoft is doing something wonderful. They are actually vowing to retrain two million Americans with IT training, using their existing infrastructure to do something good.Also, a really interesting company is GORE-TEX. GORE-TEX is all about personal accountability of their management and their employees, to the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses. But they also talk about the fact that their executives \u2014 all of their expense reports are put onto their company intranet for everyone to see. Complete transparency. Think twice before you have that bottle of wine.(Laughter)The third of the four laws of post-crisis consumerism is about durable living. We're seeing in our data that consumers are realizing this is a marathon, not a sprint. They're digging in and looking for ways to extract value out of every purchase they make. Witness the fact that Americans are holding on to their cars longer than ever before: 9.4 years on average, in March. A record. We also see the fact that libraries have become a huge resource for America. Did you know that 68 percent of Americans now carry a library card? The highest percentage ever in our nation's history.So what you see in this trend is also the accumulation of knowledge. Continuing education is up. Everything is focused on betterment, training, development and moving forward. We also see a big DIY movement. I was fascinated to learn that 30 percent of all homes in America are actually built by owners. That includes cottages and the like, but 30 percent. People are getting their hands dirty, rolling up their sleeves. They want these skills.We see it with the phenomenon of raising backyard hens, chickens and ducks. And when you work out the math, they say it doesn't work, but the principle is there; it's about being sustainable and taking care of yourself. Then we look at the High Line in New York City, an excellent use of reimagining existing infrastructure for something good, which is a brand-new park in New York City.So what brands can do, and companies, is pay dividends to consumers, be a brand that lasts, offer transparency, promise you're going to be there beyond today's sale. Perfect example of that is Patagonia. Patagonia's \"Footprint Chronicles\" basically goes through and tracks every product they make, and gives you social responsibility, and helps you understand the ethics behind the product they make.Another great example is Fidelity. Rather than instant cash-back rewards on your credit or debit purchases, this is about 529 rewards for your student education. Or the interesting company Sunrun. I love this company. They've created a consumer collective where they put solar panels on households and create a consumer-based utility, where the electricity they generate is basically pumped back out into the marketplace. So it's a consumer-driven co-op.The fourth post-crisis consumerism that we see is this movement about \"return to the fold.\" It's incredibly important right now. Trust is not parceled out, as we all know. It's now about connecting to your communities, connecting to your social networks. In my book, I talked about the fact that 72 percent of people trust what other people say about a brand or a company, versus 15 percent on advertising. So in that respect, cooperative consumerism has really taken off. This is about consumers working together to get what they want out of the marketplace. Let's look at a couple of quick examples.The artisanal movement is huge: everything about locally derived products and services, supporting your local neighborhoods, whether it's cheeses, wines and other products. Also this rise of local currencies. Realizing that it's difficult to get loans in this environment, you're doing business with people you trust in your local markets. So this rise of local currency is another really interesting phenomenon. And then they did a recent report I thought was fascinating. They actually started, in certain communities in the United States, to publish people's electricity usage. And what they found out is when that was available for public record, the people's electricity usage in those communities dropped.Then we also look at the idea of cow-pooling, which is the whole phenomenon of consumers organizing together to buy meat from organic farms, that they know is safe and controlled in the way that they want it to be controlled. And then there's this other really interesting movement in California, which is about carrot mobs. The traditional thing would be to boycott, right? Have a stick. Well, why not have a carrot? So these are consumers organizing, pooling their resources to incentify companies to do good.And then we look at what companies can do. This is all the opportunity about being a community organizer. You have to realize that you can't fight and control this. You actually need to organize it. You need to harness it. You need to give it meaning. And there's lots of really interesting examples here. First is just the rise of the fact that Zagat's has actually moved out of and diversified from rating restaurants, into actually rating health care. So what credentials does Zagat's have? Well, they have a lot, because it's their network of people. So that becomes a very powerful force for them to make their brand more elastic.Then you look at the phenomenon of Kogi. This Kogi doesn't exist. It's a moving truck. It's a moving truck through L.A., and the only way you can find it is through Twitter.(Laughter)Or you look at Johnson & Johnson's \"Momversations,\" a phenomenal blog that's been built up, where J&J basically is tapping into the power of mommy bloggers, allowing them to create a forum where they can communicate and connect. And it's also become a very valuable advertising revenue for J&J as well. This, plus the fact that you've got phenomenal work from CEOs, from Ford to Zappos, connecting on Twitter, creating an open environment, allowing their employees to be part of the process, rather than hidden behind walls.You see this rising force in total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt, all because the consumer is demanding it. So when we look at this and step back, what I believe is that the crisis that exists today is definitely real. It's been tremendously powerful for consumers. But at the same time, this is also a tremendous opportunity. The Chinese character for crisis is actually the same side of the same coin. Crisis equals opportunity. What we're seeing with consumers right now is the ability for them to actually lead us forward out of this recession.So we believe that values-driven spending will force capitalism to be better: it will drive innovation; it will make longer-lasting products; it will create better, more intuitive customer service; and it will give us the opportunity to connect with companies that share the values that we share. So when we look back and step out at this and see the beginning of these trends that we're seeing in our data, we see a very hopeful picture for the future of America.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 661, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.934\nThirteen trillion dollars in wealth\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.934\nhas evaporated over the course\nof the last two years.\n\n00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:20.808\nWe've questioned the future of capitalism.\n\n00:00:20.832 --> 00:00:23.184\nWe've questioned the financial industry.\n\n00:00:23.208 --> 00:00:25.184\nWe've looked at our government oversight.\n\n00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:26.902\nWe've questioned where we're going.\n\n00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.235\nAnd yet, at the same time,\n\n00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.135\nthis very well may be\na seminal moment in American history,\n\n00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:35.484\nan opportunity for the consumer\nto actually take control and guide us\n\n00:00:35.508 --> 00:00:37.684\nto a new trajectory in America.\n\n00:00:37.708 --> 00:00:39.433\nI'm calling this The Great Unwind.\n\n00:00:39.457 --> 00:00:40.459\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:40.483 --> 00:00:43.084\nAnd the idea is a simple, simple idea,\n\n00:00:43.108 --> 00:00:47.188\nwhich is the fact that the consumer\nhas moved from a state of anxiety\n\n00:00:47.212 --> 00:00:48.370\nto action.\n\n00:00:48.394 --> 00:00:52.633\nConsumers who represent 72 percent\nof the GDP of America\n\n00:00:52.657 --> 00:00:56.101\nhave actually started, just like banks\nand just like businesses,\n\n00:00:56.125 --> 00:01:00.209\nto de-leverage, to unwind\ntheir leverage in daily life,\n\n00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:03.184\nto remove themselves\nfrom the liability and risk\n\n00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:06.084\nthat presents itself as they move forward.\n\n00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:08.841\nSo, to understand this --\nand I'm going to stress this --\n\n00:01:08.865 --> 00:01:11.028\nit's not about the consumer\nbeing in retreat.\n\n00:01:11.052 --> 00:01:12.412\nThe consumer is empowered.\n\n00:01:12.436 --> 00:01:15.693\nTo understand this, we'll step back\nand look at what's happened\n\n00:01:15.717 --> 00:01:17.612\nover the last year and a half.\n\n00:01:17.636 --> 00:01:19.855\nSo if you've been gone,\nthis is the CliffsNotes\n\n00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:21.503\non what's happened in the economy.\n\n00:01:21.527 --> 00:01:22.531\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:22.555 --> 00:01:25.625\nUnemployment up.

--> 00:02:13.274\nDo you know why savings was so high?\n\n00:02:13.298 --> 00:02:16.608\nThere was nothing to buy,\nunless you wanted to buy some rivets.\n\n00:02:16.632 --> 00:02:19.562\nWhat happened, though,\nover the course of the last 20 years,\n\n00:02:19.586 --> 00:02:23.746\nwe went from a 10 percent savings rate\nto a negative savings rate.\n\n00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.423\nBecause we binged.\n\n00:02:25.447 --> 00:02:29.240\nWe bought extra-large cars,\nsupersized everything,\n\n00:02:29.264 --> 00:02:31.972\nwe bought remedies\nfor restless leg syndrome.\n\n00:02:31.996 --> 00:02:35.902\nAll these things together\nbasically created a factor\n\n00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:38.514\nwhere the consumer drove us\nheadlong into the crisis\n\n00:02:38.538 --> 00:02:39.811\nthat we face today.\n\n00:02:39.835 --> 00:02:46.112\nThe personal debt-to-income ratio\nbasically went from 65 to 135 percent\n\n00:02:46.136 --> 00:02:48.644\nin the span of about 15 years.\n\n00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:50.755\nSo consumers got over-leveraged.\n\n00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:53.960\nAnd of course our banks did as well,\nas did our federal government.\n\n00:02:53.984 --> 00:02:56.050\nThis is an absolutely staggering chart.\n\n00:02:56.074 --> 00:03:00.681\nIt shows leverage,\ntrended out from 1919 to 2009.\n\n00:03:00.705 --> 00:03:03.357\nAnd what you end up seeing\nis the whole phenomenon\n\n00:03:03.381 --> 00:03:07.237\nthat we are actually stepping forth\nand basically leveraging\n\n00:03:07.261 --> 00:03:10.440\nfuture education, future children\nin our households.\n\n00:03:10.464 --> 00:03:13.564\nSo if you look at this in the context\nof visualizing the bailout,\n\n00:03:13.588 --> 00:03:16.084\nwhat you can see is,\nif you stack up dollar bills,\n\n00:03:16.108 --> 00:03:18.350\nfirst of all, 360,000 dollars\n\n00:03:18.374 --> 00:03:20.893\nis about the size of a five-foot-four guy.\n\n00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:25.194\nBut if you stack it up, you see\nthis amazing, staggering amount of dollars\n\n00:03:25.218 --> 00:03:28.084\nthat have been put into the system\nto fund and bail us out.\n\n00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:30.273\nSo this is the first 315 billion.\n\n00:03:30.297 --> 00:03:32.070\nBut I read this fact the other day,\n\n00:03:32.094 --> 00:03:35.404\nthat one trillion seconds\nequals 32,000 years.\n\n00:03:35.428 --> 00:03:36.745\nSo if you think about that,\n\n00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.265\nthe context, the casualness\nwith which we talk about\n\n00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:41.542\ntrillion-dollar bailout here\nand trillion there,\n\n00:03:41.566 --> 00:03:44.951\nwe are stacking ourselves up\nfor long-term leverage.\n\n00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:47.627\nHowever, consumers have moved.\n\n00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:49.690\nThey are taking responsibility.\n\n00:03:49.714 --> 00:03:52.243\nWhat we're seeing\nis an uptake in the savings rate.\n\n00:03:52.267 --> 00:03:54.982\nIn fact, 11 straight months\nof savings have happened\n\n00:03:55.006 --> 00:03:56.653\nsince the beginning of the crisis.\n\n00:03:56.677 --> 00:03:59.041\nWe're working our way back up\nto that 10 percent.\n\n00:03:59.065 --> 00:04:00.995\nAlso, remarkably, in the fourth quarter,\n\n00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.400\nspending dropped\nto its lowest level in 62 years --\n\n00:04:04.424 --> 00:04:07.084\nalmost a 3.7 percent decline.\n\n00:04:07.108 --> 00:04:10.988\nVisa now reports that more people\nare using debit cards than credit cards.\n\n00:04:11.012 --> 00:04:14.405\nSo we're starting to pay for things\nwith money that we have.\n\n00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:18.084\nAnd we're starting to be much more careful\nabout how we save and invest.\n\n00:04:18.108 --> 00:04:20.084\nBut that's not really the whole story,\n\n00:04:20.108 --> 00:04:23.025\nbecause this has also been a dramatic\ntime of transformation.\n\n00:04:23.049 --> 00:04:25.675\nAnd you've got to admit,\nover the last year and a half,\n\n00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.767\nconsumers have been doing\nsome weird things.\n\n00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:30.082\nIt's pretty staggering,\nwhat we've lived through.\n\n00:04:30.106 --> 00:04:32.802\nIf you take into account\nthat 80 percent of all Americans\n\n00:04:32.826 --> 00:04:34.222\nwere born after World War II,\n\n00:04:34.246 --> 00:04:35.979\nthis was essentially our Depression.\n\n00:04:36.003 --> 00:04:38.808\nAnd so, as a result,\nsome crazy things have happened.\n\n00:04:38.832 --> 00:04:40.182\nI'll give you some examples.\n\n00:04:40.206 --> 00:04:44.871\nLet's talk about dentists, vasectomies,\nguns and shark attacks.\n\n00:04:44.895 --> 00:04:46.683\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:46.707 --> 00:04:50.590\nDentists report molars --\npeople grinding their teeth,\n\n00:04:50.614 --> 00:04:52.977\ncoming in and reporting\nthat they've had stress.\n\n00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:56.423\nSo there's an increase in people\nhaving to have their fillings replaced.\n\n00:04:56.447 --> 00:04:59.741\nGun sales, according to the FBI,\nwho does background checks,\n\n00:04:59.765 --> 00:05:02.859\nare up almost 25 percent since January.\n\n00:05:02.883 --> 00:05:07.536\nVasectomies are up 48 percent,\naccording to the Cornell Institute.\n\n00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.964\nAnd lastly, but a very good point,\n\n00:05:09.988 --> 00:05:12.564\nhopefully not related\nto the former point I just made,\n\n00:05:12.588 --> 00:05:16.051\nwhich is that shark attacks\nare at their lowest level from 2003.\n\n00:05:16.075 --> 00:05:17.596\nDoes anybody know why?\n\n00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:19.151\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:19.175 --> 00:05:20.343\nNo one's at the beach.\n\n00:05:20.367 --> 00:05:22.263\nSo there's a bright side to everything.\n\n00:05:22.287 --> 00:05:24.473\nBut seriously, what we see happening,\n\n00:05:24.497 --> 00:05:27.758\nand the reason I want to stress\nthat the consumer is not in retreat,\n\n00:05:27.782 --> 00:05:29.797\nis that this is a tremendous opportunity\n\n00:05:29.821 --> 00:05:32.415\nfor the consumer who drove us\ninto this recession\n\n00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:33.964\nto lead us right back out.\n\n00:05:33.988 --> 00:05:37.330\nWhat I mean by that is we can\nmove from mindless consumption\n\n00:05:37.354 --> 00:05:39.382\nto mindful consumption.\n\n00:05:39.406 --> 00:05:40.566\nRight?\n\n00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.665\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:43.721\nIf you think about the last three decades,\n\n00:05:43.745 --> 00:05:47.027\nthe consumer has moved\nfrom savvy about marketing in the '90s,\n\n00:05:47.051 --> 00:05:51.028\nto gathering all these amazing social\nand search tools in this decade.\n\n00:05:51.052 --> 00:05:54.381\nBut the one thing holding them back\nis the ability to discriminate.\n\n00:05:54.405 --> 00:05:55.742\nBy restricting their demand,\n\n00:05:55.766 --> 00:05:59.084\nconsumers can actually align\ntheir values with their spending,\n\n00:05:59.108 --> 00:06:02.688\nand drive capitalism and business\nto not just be about more,\n\n00:06:02.712 --> 00:06:03.878\nbut to be about better.\n\n00:06:03.902 --> 00:06:05.879\nWe're going to explain that right now.\n\n00:06:05.903 --> 00:06:08.684\nBased on Y&amp;R's BrandAsset Valuator,\n\n00:06:08.708 --> 00:06:11.409\nproprietary tool of VML\nand Young &amp; Rubicam,\n\n00:06:11.433 --> 00:06:14.317\nwe set out to understand\nwhat's been happening in the crisis\n\n00:06:14.341 --> 00:06:15.882\nwith the consumer marketplace.\n\n00:06:15.906 --> 00:06:18.123\nWe found a couple\nof really interesting things.\n\n00:06:18.147 --> 00:06:20.574\nWe're going to go\nthrough four value shifts\n\n00:06:20.598 --> 00:06:22.934\nthat we see driving\nnew consumer behaviors,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.015\nthat offer new management principles.\n\n00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:26.849\nThe first cultural value shift we see\n\n00:06:26.873 --> 00:06:29.499\nis this tendency toward something\nwe call \"liquid life.\"\n\n00:06:29.523 --> 00:06:30.673\nThis is the movement\n\n00:06:30.697 --> 00:06:33.778\nfrom Americans defining\ntheir success on having things\n\n00:06:33.802 --> 00:06:35.084\nto having liquidity,\n\n00:06:35.108 --> 00:06:37.800\nbecause the less excess\nthat you have around you,\n\n00:06:37.824 --> 00:06:39.976\nthe more nimble and fleet of foot you are.\n\n00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.470\nAs a result, d\u00e9class\u00e9 consumption is in.\n\n00:06:42.494 --> 00:06:46.429\nD\u00e9class\u00e9 consumption is the whole idea\nthat spending money frivolously\n\n00:06:46.453 --> 00:06:49.191\nmakes you look a little bit anti-fashion.\n\n00:06:49.215 --> 00:06:51.704\nThe management principle\nis dollars and cents.\n\n00:06:51.728 --> 00:06:54.572\nSo let's look at some examples\nof this d\u00e9class\u00e9 consumption\n\n00:06:54.596 --> 00:06:56.024\nthat falls out of this value.\n\n00:06:56.048 --> 00:06:58.345\nThe first thing is,\nsomething must be happening\n\n00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:00.445\nwhen P. Diddy vows to tone down his bling.\n\n00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:01.483\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:01.507 --> 00:07:03.849\nBut seriously, we also have\nthis phenomenon\n\n00:07:03.873 --> 00:07:05.798\non Madison Avenue and in other places,\n\n00:07:05.822 --> 00:07:08.745\nwhere people are actually\nwalking out of luxury boutiques\n\n00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:12.582\nwith ordinary, generic paper bags\nto hide the brand purchases.\n\n00:07:12.606 --> 00:07:15.583\nWe see high-end haggling in fashion today,\n\n00:07:15.607 --> 00:07:18.084\nhigh-end haggling\nfor luxury and real estate.\n\n00:07:18.108 --> 00:07:20.480\nWe also see just a relaxing of ego,\n\n00:07:20.504 --> 00:07:22.756\nand sort of a dismantling of artifice.\n\n00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.627\nThis is a story on the yacht club\nthat's all basically blue collar.\n\n00:07:26.651 --> 00:07:28.825\nBlue-collar yacht club --\nwhere you can join,\n\n00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:32.084\nbut you've got to work in the boatyard\nas condition of membership.\n\n00:07:32.108 --> 00:07:36.769\nWe also see the trend toward tourism\nthat's a little bit more low-key:\n\n00:07:36.793 --> 00:07:39.920\nagritourism -- going to vineyards\nand going to farms.\n\n00:07:39.944 --> 00:07:43.569\nAnd then we also see this movement\nforward from dollars and cents.\n\n00:07:43.593 --> 00:07:46.308\nWhat businesses can do to connect\nwith these new mindsets\n\n00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:47.499\nis really interesting.\n\n00:07:47.523 --> 00:07:49.368\nA couple things that are kind of cool.\n\n00:07:49.392 --> 00:07:53.085\nOne is that Frito-Lay figured out\nthis liquidity thing with their consumer.\n\n00:07:53.109 --> 00:07:56.512\nThey found their consumer had more\nmoney at the beginning of the month,\n\n00:07:56.536 --> 00:07:57.945\nless at the end of the month.\n\n00:07:57.969 --> 00:07:59.982\nSo they started to change their packaging:\n\n00:08:00.006 --> 00:08:02.028\nlarger packs at the beginning\nof the month,\n\n00:08:02.052 --> 00:08:04.072\nsmaller packaging at the end of the month.\n\n00:08:04.096 --> 00:08:06.815\nReally interestingly, too,\nwas the San Francisco Giants.\n\n00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:09.084\nThey've just instituted dynamic pricing.\n\n00:08:09.108 --> 00:08:12.327\nIt takes into account everything\nfrom the pitcher match-ups,\n\n00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:14.194\nto the weather, to the team records,\n\n00:08:14.218 --> 00:08:16.622\nin setting prices for the consumer.\n\n00:08:16.646 --> 00:08:21.677\nAnother quick example of these types\nof movements is the rise of Zynga.\n\n00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:23.981\nZynga has risen on the consumer's desire\n\n00:08:24.005 --> 00:08:26.017\nto not want to be locked in to fixed cost.\n\n00:08:26.041 --> 00:08:28.801\nAgain, this theme is about variable\ncost, variable living.\n\n00:08:28.825 --> 00:08:30.697\nSo micro-payments have become huge.\n\n00:08:30.721 --> 00:08:33.300\nAnd lastly, some people are using Hulu\n\n00:08:33.324 --> 00:08:35.396\nas a device to get rid\nof their cable bill.\n\n00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:39.010\nSo, really clever ideas there\nthat are being taken ahold of\n\n00:08:39.034 --> 00:08:41.205\nand that marketers\nare starting to understand.\n\n00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:43.859\nThe second of the four values\nis this movement toward\n\n00:08:43.883 --> 00:08:45.188\nethics and fair play.\n\n00:08:45.212 --> 00:08:48.349\nWe see that play itself out\nwith empathy and respect.\n\n00:08:48.373 --> 00:08:49.994\nThe consumer is demanding it.\n\n00:08:50.018 --> 00:08:53.184\nAnd, as a result, businesses\nmust provide not only value,\n\n00:08:53.208 --> 00:08:54.360\nbut values.\n\n00:08:54.384 --> 00:08:57.557\nIncreasingly, consumers are looking\nat the culture of the company,\n\n00:08:57.581 --> 00:08:59.326\nat their conduct in the marketplace.\n\n00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.018\nSo we see with empathy and respect\n\n00:09:01.042 --> 00:09:03.838\nlots of really hopeful things\ncome out of this recession.\n\n00:09:03.862 --> 00:09:05.253\nI'll give you a few examples.\n\n00:09:05.277 --> 00:09:07.802\nOne is the rise toward communities\nand neighborhoods,\n\n00:09:07.826 --> 00:09:11.540\nand increased emphasis on your neighbors\nas your support system.\n\n00:09:11.564 --> 00:09:15.611\nAlso, a wonderful by-product\nof a really lousy thing,\n\n00:09:15.635 --> 00:09:17.003\nwhich has been unemployment,\n\n00:09:17.027 --> 00:09:19.828\nis a rise in volunteerism\nthat's been noted in our country.\n\n00:09:19.852 --> 00:09:23.522\nWe also see the phenomenon --\nsome of you may have \"boomerang kids\" --\n\n00:09:23.546 --> 00:09:25.183\nthese are \"boomerang alumni,\"\n\n00:09:25.207 --> 00:09:27.940\nwhere universities are actually\nreconnecting with alumni\n\n00:09:27.964 --> 00:09:30.745\nand helping them with jobs,\nsharing skills and retraining.\n\n00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:33.317\nWe also talked about character\nand professionalism.\n\n00:09:33.341 --> 00:09:37.084\nWe had this miracle on the Hudson\nin New York City in January,\n\n00:09:37.108 --> 00:09:41.084\nand suddenly Sully has become\na key name on BabyCenter.\n\n00:09:41.108 --> 00:09:42.178\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:42.202 --> 00:09:44.598\nSo, from a value and values standpoint,\n\n00:09:44.622 --> 00:09:47.575\nwhat companies can do is connect\nin lots of different ways.\n\n00:09:47.599 --> 00:09:49.491\nMicrosoft is doing something wonderful.\n\n00:09:49.515 --> 00:09:53.353\nThey are actually vowing to retrain\ntwo million Americans with IT training,\n\n00:09:53.377 --> 00:09:56.479\nusing their existing infrastructure\nto do something good.\n\n00:09:56.503 --> 00:09:58.964\nAlso, a really interesting\ncompany is GORE-TEX.\n\n00:09:58.988 --> 00:10:01.698\nGORE-TEX is all about\npersonal accountability\n\n00:10:01.722 --> 00:10:03.671\nof their management and their employees,\n\n00:10:03.695 --> 00:10:07.253\nto the point where they really\nkind of shun the idea of bosses.\n\n00:10:07.277 --> 00:10:10.042\nBut they also talk about the fact\nthat their executives --\n\n00:10:10.066 --> 00:10:13.138\nall of their expense reports\nare put onto their company intranet\n\n00:10:13.162 --> 00:10:14.341\nfor everyone to see.\n\n00:10:14.365 --> 00:10:16.084\nComplete transparency.\n\n00:10:16.108 --> 00:10:18.384\nThink twice before you have\nthat bottle of wine.\n\n00:10:18.408 --> 00:10:19.465\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:19.489 --> 00:10:22.262\nThe third of the four laws\nof post-crisis consumerism\n\n00:10:22.286 --> 00:10:23.771\nis about durable living.\n\n00:10:23.795 --> 00:10:26.332\nWe're seeing in our data\nthat consumers are realizing\n\n00:10:26.356 --> 00:10:28.084\nthis is a marathon, not a sprint.\n\n00:10:28.108 --> 00:10:30.967\nThey're digging in and looking\nfor ways to extract value\n\n00:10:30.991 --> 00:10:33.084\nout of every purchase they make.\n\n00:10:33.108 --> 00:10:36.023\nWitness the fact that Americans\nare holding on to their cars\n\n00:10:36.047 --> 00:10:39.909\nlonger than ever before:\n9.4 years on average, in March.\n\n00:10:39.933 --> 00:10:41.084\nA record.\n\n00:10:41.108 --> 00:10:45.084\nWe also see the fact that libraries\nhave become a huge resource for America.\n\n00:10:45.108 --> 00:10:48.950\nDid you know that 68 percent\nof Americans now carry a library card?\n\n00:10:48.974 --> 00:10:51.439\nThe highest percentage ever\nin our nation's history.\n\n00:10:51.463 --> 00:10:55.084\nSo what you see in this trend\nis also the accumulation of knowledge.\n\n00:10:55.108 --> 00:10:56.827\nContinuing education is up.\n\n00:10:56.851 --> 00:10:59.489\nEverything is focused\non betterment, training,\n\n00:10:59.513 --> 00:11:01.298\ndevelopment and moving forward.\n\n00:11:01.322 --> 00:11:03.859\nWe also see a big DIY movement.\n\n00:11:04.382 --> 00:11:08.546\nI was fascinated to learn that 30 percent\nof all homes in America\n\n00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.084\nare actually built by owners.\n\n00:11:10.108 --> 00:11:11.966\nThat includes cottages and the like,\n\n00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.158\nbut 30 percent.\n\n00:11:13.182 --> 00:11:16.194\nPeople are getting their hands dirty,\nrolling up their sleeves.\n\n00:11:16.218 --> 00:11:17.385\nThey want these skills.\n\n00:11:17.409 --> 00:11:20.973\nWe see it with the phenomenon of raising\nbackyard hens, chickens and ducks.\n\n00:11:20.997 --> 00:11:23.685\nAnd when you work out the math,\nthey say it doesn't work,\n\n00:11:23.709 --> 00:11:25.009\nbut the principle is there;\n\n00:11:25.033 --> 00:11:27.748\nit's about being sustainable\nand taking care of yourself.\n\n00:11:27.772 --> 00:11:30.383\nThen we look at the High Line\nin New York City,\n\n00:11:30.407 --> 00:11:33.175\nan excellent use of reimagining\nexisting infrastructure\n\n00:11:33.199 --> 00:11:34.358\nfor something good,\n\n00:11:34.382 --> 00:11:36.417\nwhich is a brand-new park\nin New York City.\n\n00:11:36.441 --> 00:11:40.532\nSo what brands can do, and companies,\nis pay dividends to consumers,\n\n00:11:40.556 --> 00:11:42.084\nbe a brand that lasts,\n\n00:11:42.108 --> 00:11:43.497\noffer transparency,\n\n00:11:43.521 --> 00:11:46.015\npromise you're going to be there\nbeyond today's sale.\n\n00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:48.084\nPerfect example of that is Patagonia.\n\n00:11:48.108 --> 00:11:49.822\nPatagonia's \"Footprint Chronicles\"\n\n00:11:49.846 --> 00:11:53.644\nbasically goes through and tracks\nevery product they make,\n\n00:11:53.668 --> 00:11:55.458\nand gives you social responsibility,\n\n00:11:55.482 --> 00:11:59.021\nand helps you understand the ethics\nbehind the product they make.\n\n00:11:59.045 --> 00:12:00.827\nAnother great example is Fidelity.\n\n00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:04.537\nRather than instant cash-back rewards\non your credit or debit purchases,\n\n00:12:04.561 --> 00:12:09.457\nthis is about 529 rewards\nfor your student education.\n\n00:12:09.481 --> 00:12:11.568\nOr the interesting company Sunrun.\n\n00:12:11.592 --> 00:12:12.747\nI love this company.\n\n00:12:12.771 --> 00:12:14.838\nThey've created a consumer collective\n\n00:12:14.862 --> 00:12:17.208\nwhere they put solar panels on households\n\n00:12:17.232 --> 00:12:19.327\nand create a consumer-based utility,\n\n00:12:19.351 --> 00:12:21.049\nwhere the electricity they generate\n\n00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:23.697\nis basically pumped back out\ninto the marketplace.\n\n00:12:23.721 --> 00:12:25.457\nSo it's a consumer-driven co-op.\n\n00:12:25.481 --> 00:12:29.155\nThe fourth post-crisis\nconsumerism that we see\n\n00:12:29.179 --> 00:12:31.496\nis this movement\nabout \"return to the fold.\"\n\n00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.319\nIt's incredibly important right now.\n\n00:12:33.343 --> 00:12:35.927\nTrust is not parceled out, as we all know.\n\n00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:38.143\nIt's now about connecting\nto your communities,\n\n00:12:38.167 --> 00:12:39.929\nconnecting to your social networks.\n\n00:12:39.953 --> 00:12:41.667\nIn my book, I talked about the fact\n\n00:12:41.691 --> 00:12:44.366\nthat 72 percent of people trust\nwhat other people say\n\n00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.841\nabout a brand or a company,\n\n00:12:45.865 --> 00:12:47.907\nversus 15 percent on advertising.\n\n00:12:47.931 --> 00:12:51.651\nSo in that respect, cooperative\nconsumerism has really taken off.\n\n00:12:51.675 --> 00:12:54.658\nThis is about consumers working\ntogether to get what they want\n\n00:12:54.682 --> 00:12:55.858\nout of the marketplace.\n\n00:12:55.882 --> 00:12:57.859\nLet's look at a couple of quick examples.\n\n00:12:57.883 --> 00:12:59.456\nThe artisanal movement is huge:\n\n00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.537\neverything about locally\nderived products and services,\n\n00:13:02.561 --> 00:13:04.345\nsupporting your local neighborhoods,\n\n00:13:04.369 --> 00:13:07.345\nwhether it's cheeses,\nwines and other products.\n\n00:13:07.369 --> 00:13:10.027\nAlso this rise of local currencies.\n\n00:13:10.051 --> 00:13:13.026\nRealizing that it's difficult\nto get loans in this environment,\n\n00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.109\nyou're doing business\nwith people you trust\n\n00:13:15.133 --> 00:13:16.312\nin your local markets.\n\n00:13:16.336 --> 00:13:20.204\nSo this rise of local currency\nis another really interesting phenomenon.\n\n00:13:20.228 --> 00:13:23.850\nAnd then they did a recent report\nI thought was fascinating.\n\n00:13:23.874 --> 00:13:27.047\nThey actually started, in certain\ncommunities in the United States,\n\n00:13:27.071 --> 00:13:29.098\nto publish people's electricity usage.\n\n00:13:29.122 --> 00:13:32.433\nAnd what they found out is when\nthat was available for public record,\n\n00:13:32.457 --> 00:13:35.527\nthe people's electricity usage\nin those communities dropped.\n\n00:13:36.469 --> 00:13:39.084\nThen we also look\nat the idea of cow-pooling,\n\n00:13:39.108 --> 00:13:43.303\nwhich is the whole phenomenon\nof consumers organizing together\n\n00:13:43.327 --> 00:13:47.220\nto buy meat from organic farms,\nthat they know is safe and controlled\n\n00:13:47.244 --> 00:13:49.430\nin the way that they want it\nto be controlled.\n\n00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:53.021\nAnd then there's this other really\ninteresting movement in California,\n\n00:13:53.045 --> 00:13:54.528\nwhich is about carrot mobs.\n\n00:13:54.552 --> 00:13:57.598\nThe traditional thing would be\nto boycott, right? Have a stick.\n\n00:13:57.622 --> 00:13:58.968\nWell, why not have a carrot?\n\n00:13:58.992 --> 00:14:02.296\nSo these are consumers organizing,\npooling their resources\n\n00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.084\nto incentify companies to do good.\n\n00:14:05.108 --> 00:14:07.905\nAnd then we look at what companies can do.\n\n00:14:07.929 --> 00:14:11.382\nThis is all the opportunity\nabout being a community organizer.\n\n00:14:11.406 --> 00:14:14.373\nYou have to realize\nthat you can't fight and control this.\n\n00:14:14.397 --> 00:14:16.007\nYou actually need to organize it.\n\n00:14:16.031 --> 00:14:18.556\nYou need to harness it.\nYou need to give it meaning.\n\n00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.792\nAnd there's lots of really\ninteresting examples here.\n\n00:14:21.816 --> 00:14:26.609\nFirst is just the rise of the fact\nthat Zagat's has actually moved out of\n\n00:14:26.633 --> 00:14:28.861\nand diversified from rating restaurants,\n\n00:14:28.885 --> 00:14:31.084\ninto actually rating health care.\n\n00:14:31.108 --> 00:14:33.237\nSo what credentials does Zagat's have?\n\n00:14:33.261 --> 00:14:34.431\nWell, they have a lot,\n\n00:14:34.455 --> 00:14:36.299\nbecause it's their network of people.\n\n00:14:36.323 --> 00:14:38.866\nSo that becomes\na very powerful force for them\n\n00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.084\nto make their brand more elastic.\n\n00:14:41.108 --> 00:14:43.365\nThen you look at the phenomenon of Kogi.\n\n00:14:43.894 --> 00:14:46.871\nThis Kogi doesn't exist.\nIt's a moving truck.\n\n00:14:46.895 --> 00:14:48.494\nIt's a moving truck through L.A.,\n\n00:14:48.518 --> 00:14:51.014\nand the only way you can find it\nis through Twitter.\n\n00:14:51.038 --> 00:14:52.095\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:52.119 --> 00:14:53.272\nOr you look at\n\n00:14:53.296 --> 00:14:58.358\nJohnson &amp; Johnson's \"Momversations,\"\na phenomenal blog that's been built up,\n\n00:14:58.382 --> 00:15:02.512\nwhere J&amp;J basically is tapping\ninto the power of mommy bloggers,\n\n00:15:02.536 --> 00:15:06.984\nallowing them to create a forum\nwhere they can communicate and connect.\n\n00:15:07.008 --> 00:15:11.847\nAnd it's also become a very valuable\nadvertising revenue for J&amp;J as well.\n\n00:15:11.871 --> 00:15:16.085\nThis, plus the fact that you've got\nphenomenal work from CEOs,\n\n00:15:16.109 --> 00:15:18.649\nfrom Ford to Zappos,\nconnecting on Twitter,\n\n00:15:18.673 --> 00:15:20.084\ncreating an open environment,\n\n00:15:20.108 --> 00:15:23.146\nallowing their employees\nto be part of the process,\n\n00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:24.878\nrather than hidden behind walls.\n\n00:15:24.902 --> 00:15:29.107\nYou see this rising force\nin total transparency and openness\n\n00:15:29.131 --> 00:15:30.919\nthat companies are starting to adopt,\n\n00:15:30.943 --> 00:15:33.250\nall because the consumer is demanding it.\n\n00:15:33.274 --> 00:15:35.220\nSo when we look at this and step back,\n\n00:15:35.244 --> 00:15:39.436\nwhat I believe is that the crisis\nthat exists today is definitely real.\n\n00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.084\nIt's been tremendously\npowerful for consumers.\n\n00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:45.671\nBut at the same time,\nthis is also a tremendous opportunity.\n\n00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:49.162\nThe Chinese character for crisis\nis actually the same side\n\n00:15:49.186 --> 00:15:50.353\nof the same coin.\n\n00:15:50.377 --> 00:15:52.084\nCrisis equals opportunity.\n\n00:15:52.108 --> 00:15:55.602\nWhat we're seeing with consumers\nright now is the ability for them\n\n00:15:55.626 --> 00:15:58.262\nto actually lead us forward\nout of this recession.\n\n00:15:58.286 --> 00:16:03.084\nSo we believe that values-driven spending\nwill force capitalism to be better:\n\n00:16:03.108 --> 00:16:04.988\nit will drive innovation;\n\n00:16:05.012 --> 00:16:07.113\nit will make longer-lasting products;\n\n00:16:07.137 --> 00:16:09.733\nit will create better,\nmore intuitive customer service;\n\n00:16:09.757 --> 00:16:12.634\nand it will give us the opportunity\nto connect with companies\n\n00:16:12.658 --> 00:16:14.729\nthat share the values that we share.\n\n00:16:14.753 --> 00:16:16.772\nSo when we look back and step out at this\n\n00:16:16.796 --> 00:16:20.084\nand see the beginning of these trends\nthat we're seeing in our data,\n\n00:16:20.108 --> 00:16:22.957\nwe see a very hopeful picture\nfor the future of America.\n\n00:16:22.981 --> 00:16:24.149\nThank you very much.\n\n00:16:24.173 --> 00:16:25.989\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Animating a photo-real digital face", "duration": "366", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_debevec_animates_a_photo_real_digital_face", "transcript": "One of the biggest challenges in computer graphics has been being able to create a photo-real, digital human face. And one of the reasons it is so difficult is that, unlike aliens and dinosaurs, we look at human faces every day. They are very important to how we communicate with each other. As a result, we're tuned in to the subtlest things that could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering, in order to believe whether these things are realistic.And what I'm going to do in the next five minutes is take you through a process where we tried to create a reasonably photo-realistic computer-generated face, using some computer graphics technology we've developed, and also some collaborators at a company called Image Metrics. And we're going to try to do a photo-real face of an actress named Emily O'Brien, who is right there. And that's actually a completely computer-generated rendering of her face. By the end of the talk, we're going to see it move.The way that we did this is we tried to start with Emily herself, who was gracious enough to come to our laboratory in Marina Del Rey, and sit for a session in Light Stage 5. This is a face-scanning sphere, with 156 white LEDs all around that allow us to photograph her in a series of very controlled illumination conditions. And the lighting that we use these days looks something like this. We shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds.And we basically capture enough information with video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face, and different principle directions of light from the light stage, to figure out both the coarse-scale and the fine-scale detail of her face. If we zoom in on this photograph right here, we can see it's a really nice photograph to have of her, because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time to get a nice image of her facial texture.And in addition, we've actually used polarizers on all the lights \u2014 just like polarized sunglasses can block the glare off of the road, polarizers can block the shine off of the skin, so we don't get all those specular reflections to take this map. Now, if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit, we can actually bring that specular reflection of the skin back in, and you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point. If you take the difference between these two images here, you can get an image lit from the entire sphere of light of just the shine off of Emily's skin.I don't think any photograph like this had ever been taken before we had done this. And this is very important light to capture, because this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin. It doesn't get underneath the translucent layers of the skin and blur out. And, as a result, it's a very good cue to the detailed shape of the skin-pore structure and all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have, the things that actually make us look like real humans.So, if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection, we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape, and augment it with information that puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles. And, even more importantly, since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture, we can shoot Emily in just part of an afternoon, in many different facial poses and facial expressions.So, here you can see her moving her eyes around, moving her mouth around. And these we're actually going to use to create a photo-real digital character. If you take a look at these scans that we have of Emily, you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things as it goes into different facial expressions. You can see things. Not only the face shape changes, but all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs. You can see that the skin pore structure changes enormously from stretched skin pores to the regular skin texture. You can see the furrows in the brow and how the microstructure changes there. You can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down. Her muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that.In addition to this kind of high-resolution geometry, since it's all captured with cameras, we've got a great texture map to use for the face. And by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination, the red and the green and the blue, diffuse the light differently, we can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer. Then, instead of looking like a plaster mannequin, it actually looks like it's made out of living human flesh.And this is what we used to give to the company Image Metrics to create a rigged, digital version of Emily. We're just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here. But they basically created a digital puppet of her, where you can pull on these various strings, and it actually moves her face in ways that are completely consistent with the scans that we took. And, in addition to the coarse-scale geometry, they also used all of that detail to create a set of what are called \"displacement maps\" that animate as well. These are the displacement maps here. And you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates.So the next process was then to animate her. We actually used one of her own performances to provide the source data. So, by analyzing this video with computer vision techniques, they were able to drive the facial rig with the computer-generated performance. So what you're going to see now, after this, is a completely photo-real digital face. We can turn the volume up a little bit if that's available.Emily: Image Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company. We specialize in high-quality facial animation for video games and films. Image Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company. We specialize in high quality facial animation for video games and films.Paul Debevec: So, if we break that down into layers, here's that diffuse component we saw in the first slide. Here is the specular component animating. You can see all the wrinkles happening there. And there is the underlying wireframe mesh. And that is Emily herself.Now, where are we going with this here? We've gone a little bit beyond Light Stage 5. This is Light Stage 6, and we're looking at taking this technology and applying it to whole human bodies. This is Bruce Lawmen, one of our researchers in the group, who graciously agreed to get captured running in the Light Stage. And let's take a look at a computer-generated version of Bruce, running in a new environment. And thank you very much.

other.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nAs a result, we're tuned in to the subtlest things\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nthat could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering,\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nin order to believe whether these things are realistic.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nAnd what I'm going to do in the next five minutes\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nis take you through a process\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nwhere we tried to create a reasonably photo-realistic computer-generated face,\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nusing some computer graphics technology we've developed,\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nand also some collaborators at a company called Image Metrics.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nAnd we're going to try to do a photo-real face\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nof an actress named Emily O'Brien, who is right there.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nAnd that's actually a completely computer-generated rendering of her face.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nBy the end of the talk, we're going to see it move.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nThe way that we did this is we tried to start with Emily herself,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nwho was gracious enough to come to our laboratory\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nin Marina Del Rey, and sit for a session in Light Stage 5.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nThis is a face-scanning sphere, with 156 white LEDs all around\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nthat allow us to photograph her\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nin a series of very controlled illumination conditions.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nAnd the lighting that we use these days looks something like this.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nWe shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nAnd we basically capture enough information\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nwith video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face,\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nand different principle directions of light from the light stage,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nto figure out both the coarse-scale\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nand the fine-scale detail of her face.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nIf we zoom in on this photograph right here,\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nwe can see it's a really nice photograph to have of her,\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nbecause she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nto get a nice image of her facial texture.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nAnd in addition, we've actually used polarizers on all the lights --\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\njust like polarized sunglasses can block\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nthe glare off of the road,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\npolarizers can block the shine off of the skin,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nso we don't get all those specular reflections to take this map.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nNow, if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nwe can actually bring that specular reflection\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nof the skin back in,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nand you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nIf you take the difference between these two images here,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nyou can get an image lit from the entire sphere of light\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nof just the shine off of Emily's skin.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nI don't think any photograph like this had ever been taken\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nbefore we had done this.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nAnd this is very important light to capture,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nbecause this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nIt doesn't get underneath the translucent\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nlayers of the skin and blur out.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nAnd, as a result, it's a very good cue\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nto the detailed shape of the skin-pore structure\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nand all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nthe things that actually make us look like real humans.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nSo, if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nwe can go from a traditional face scan\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nthat might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape,\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nand augment it with information\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nthat puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nAnd, even more importantly,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nsince this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nwe can shoot Emily\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nin just part of an afternoon,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nin many different facial poses and facial expressions.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nSo, here you can see her moving her eyes around, moving her mouth around.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nAnd these we're actually going to use to create a photo-real digital character.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nIf you take a look at these scans that we have of Emily,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nyou can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nas it goes into different facial expressions.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nYou can see things. Not only the face shape changes,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nbut all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nYou can see that the skin pore structure changes enormously\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nfrom stretched skin pores\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nto the regular skin texture.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nYou can see the furrows in the brow and how the microstructure changes there.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nYou can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nHer muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nIn addition to this kind of high-resolution geometry,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nsince it's all captured with cameras, we've got a great texture map to use for the face.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAnd by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nthe red and the green and the blue,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\ndiffuse the light differently,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nwe can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nThen, instead of looking like a plaster mannequin,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nit actually looks like it's made out of living human flesh.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nAnd this is what we used\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nto give to the company Image Metrics\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nto create a rigged, digital version of Emily.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nWe're just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nBut they basically created a digital puppet of her,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nwhere you can pull on these various strings,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nand it actually moves her face in ways that are\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\ncompletely consistent with the scans that we took.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nAnd, in addition to the coarse-scale geometry,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nthey also used all of that detail\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nto create a set of what are called \"displacement maps\"\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nthat animate as well.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nThese are the displacement maps here.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nAnd you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nSo the next process was then to animate her.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nWe actually used one of her own performances to provide the source data.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nSo, by analyzing this video with computer vision techniques,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nthey were able to drive the facial rig\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nwith the computer-generated performance.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nSo what you're going to see now, after this,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nis a completely photo-real digital face.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nWe can turn the volume up a little bit if that's available.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nEmily: Image Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nWe specialize in high-quality facial animation\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nfor video games and films.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nImage Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nWe specialize in high quality facial animation\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nfor video games and films.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nPaul Debevec: So, if we break that down into layers, here's that diffuse component\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nwe saw in the first slide.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nHere is the specular component animating.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nYou can see all the wrinkles happening there.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nAnd there is the underlying wireframe mesh.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nAnd that is Emily herself.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nNow, where are we going with this here?\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nWe've gone a little bit beyond Light Stage 5. This is Light Stage 6,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nand we're looking at taking this technology\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nand applying it to whole human bodies.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nThis is Bruce Lawmen, one of our researchers in the group,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nwho graciously agreed to get captured running in the Light Stage.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAnd let's take a look at a computer-generated version\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nof Bruce, running in a new environment.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nAnd thank you very much.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:57.958\n(Applause)"}]

[{"title": "Do schools kill creativity?", "duration": "1164", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity", "transcript": "Good morning. How are you?(Laughter)It's been great, hasn't it? I've been blown away by the whole thing. In fact, I'm leaving.(Laughter)There have been three themes running through the conference which are relevant to what I want to talk about. One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here. Just the variety of it and the range of it. The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen, in terms of the future. No idea how this may play out.I have an interest in education. Actually, what I find is everybody has an interest in education. Don't you? I find this very interesting. If you're at a dinner party, and you say you work in education \u2014 Actually, you're not often at dinner parties, frankly.(Laughter)If you work in education, you're not asked.(Laughter)And you're never asked back, curiously. That's strange to me. But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, \"What do you do?\" and you say you work in education, you can see the blood run from their face. They're like, \"Oh my God,\" you know, \"Why me?\"(Laughter)\"My one night out all week.\"(Laughter)But if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall. Because it's one of those things that goes deep with people, am I right? Like religion, and money and other things. So I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do. We have a huge vested interest in it, partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp. If you think of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065. Nobody has a clue, despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days, what the world will look like in five years' time. And yet we're meant to be educating them for it. So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary.And the third part of this is that we've all agreed, nonetheless, on the really extraordinary capacities that children have \u2014 their capacities for innovation. I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn't she? Just seeing what she could do. And she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood. What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent. And my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents. And we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity. My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status.(Applause) Thank you.(Applause)That was it, by the way. Thank you very much.(Laughter)So, 15 minutes left.(Laughter)Well, I was born... no.(Laughter)I heard a great story recently \u2014 I love telling it \u2014 of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson. She was six, and she was at the back, drawing, and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson, she did. The teacher was fascinated. She went over to her, and she said, \"What are you drawing?\" And the girl said, \"I'm drawing a picture of God.\" And the teacher said, \"But nobody knows what God looks like.\" And the girl said, \"They will, in a minute.\"(Laughter)When my son was four in England \u2014 Actually, he was four everywhere, to be honest.(Laughter)If we're being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year. He was in the Nativity play. Do you remember the story?(Laughter)No, it was big, it was a big story. Mel Gibson did the sequel, you may have seen it.(Laughter)\"Nativity II.\" But James got the part of Joseph, which we were thrilled about. We considered this to be one of the lead parts. We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts: \"James Robinson IS Joseph!\" (Laughter) He didn't have to speak, but you know the bit where the three kings come in? They come in bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh. This really happened. We were sitting there and I think they just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boy afterward and we said, \"You OK with that?\" And he said, \"Yeah, why? Was that wrong?\" They just switched. The three boys came in, four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads, and they put these boxes down, and the first boy said, \"I bring you gold.\" And the second boy said, \"I bring you myrrh.\" And the third boy said, \"Frank sent this.\"(Laughter)What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance. If they don't know, they'll have a go. Am I right? They're not frightened of being wrong. I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative. What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original \u2014 if you're not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities.Picasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists. The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up. I believe this passionately, that we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it. Or rather, we get educated out of it. So why is this?I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago. In fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles. So you can imagine what a seamless transition that was.(Laughter)Actually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield, just outside Stratford, which is where Shakespeare's father was born. Are you struck by a new thought? I was. You don't think of Shakespeare having a father, do you? Do you? Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child, do you? Shakespeare being seven? I never thought of it. I mean, he was seven at some point. He was in somebody's English class, wasn't he?(Laughter)How annoying would that be?(Laughter)\"Must try harder.\"(Laughter)Being sent to bed by his dad, you know, to Shakespeare, \"Go to bed, now! And put the pencil down.\"(Laughter)\"And stop speaking like that.\"(Laughter)\"It's confusing everybody.\"(Laughter)Anyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles, and I just want to say a word about the transition. My son didn't want to come. I've got two kids; he's 21 now, my daughter's 16. He didn't want to come to Los Angeles. He loved it, but he had a girlfriend in England. This was the love of his life, Sarah. He'd known her for a month.(Laughter)Mind you, they'd had their fourth anniversary, because it's a long time when you're 16. He was really upset on the plane, he said, \"I'll never find another girl like Sarah.\" And we were rather pleased about that, frankly \u2014(Laughter)Because she was the main reason we were leaving the country.(Laughter)But something strikes you when you move to America and travel around the world: Every education system on Earth has the same hierarchy of subjects. Every one. Doesn't matter where you go. You'd think it would be otherwise, but it isn't. At the top are mathematics and languages, then the humanities, and at the bottom are the arts. Everywhere on Earth. And in pretty much every system too, there's a hierarchy within the arts. Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance. There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why? Why not? I think this is rather important. I think math is very important, but so is dance. Children dance all the time if they're allowed to, we all do. We all have bodies, don't we? Did I miss a meeting?(Laughter)Truthfully, what happens is, as children grow up, we start to educate them progressively from the waist up. And then we focus on their heads. And slightly to one side.If you were to visit education, as an alien, and say \"What's it for, public education?\" I think you'd have to conclude, if you look at the output, who really succeeds by this, who does everything that they should, who gets all the brownie points, who are the winners \u2014 I think you'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors. Isn't it? They're the people who come out the top. And I used to be one, so there.(Laughter)And I like university professors, but you know, we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement. They're just a form of life, another form of life. But they're rather curious, and I say this out of affection for them. There's something curious about professors in my experience \u2014 not all of them, but typically, they live in their heads. They live up there, and slightly to one side. They're disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way. They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads.(Laughter)Don't they? It's a way of getting their head to meetings.(Laughter)If you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences, get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics, and pop into the discotheque on the final night.(Laughter)And there, you will see it. Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably, off the beat.(Laughter)Waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it.(Laughter)Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability. And there's a reason. Around the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before the 19th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.Number one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top. So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that. Is that right? Don't do music, you're not going to be a musician; don't do art, you won't be an artist. Benign advice \u2014 now, profoundly mistaken. The whole world is engulfed in a revolution.And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence, because the universities designed the system in their image. If you think of it, the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance. And the consequence is that many highly-talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not, because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized. And I think we can't afford to go on that way.In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history. More people, and it's the combination of all the things we've talked about \u2014 technology and its transformation effect on work, and demography and the huge explosion in population.Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything. Isn't that true? When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job. If you didn't have a job, it's because you didn't want one. And I didn't want one, frankly. (Laughter) But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games, because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA, and now you need a PhD for the other. It's a process of academic inflation. And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet. We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence.We know three things about intelligence. One, it's diverse. We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it. We think visually, we think in sound, we think kinesthetically. We think in abstract terms, we think in movement. Secondly, intelligence is dynamic. If you look at the interactions of a human brain, as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations, intelligence is wonderfully interactive. The brain isn't divided into compartments. In fact, creativity \u2014 which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value \u2014 more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things.By the way, there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum. It's thicker in women. Following off from Helen yesterday, this is probably why women are better at multi-tasking. Because you are, aren't you? There's a raft of research, but I know it from my personal life. If my wife is cooking a meal at home \u2014 which is not often, thankfully.(Laughter)No, she's good at some things, but if she's cooking, she's dealing with people on the phone, she's talking to the kids, she's painting the ceiling, she's doing open-heart surgery over here. If I'm cooking, the door is shut, the kids are out, the phone's on the hook, if she comes in I get annoyed. I say, \"Terry, please, I'm trying to fry an egg in here.\"(Laughter)\"Give me a break.\"(Laughter)Actually, do you know that old philosophical thing, if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it, did it happen? Remember that old chestnut? I saw a great t-shirt recently, which said, \"If a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him, is he still wrong?\"(Laughter)And the third thing about intelligence is, it's distinct. I'm doing a new book at the moment called \"Epiphany,\" which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent. I'm fascinated by how people got to be there. It's really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of, Gillian Lynne. Have you heard of her? Some have. She's a choreographer, and everybody knows her work. She did \"Cats\" and \"Phantom of the Opera.\" She's wonderful. I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet, as you can see. Anyway, Gillian and I had lunch one day and I said, \"How did you get to be a dancer?\" It was interesting. When she was at school, she was really hopeless. And the school, in the '30s, wrote to her parents and said, \"We think Gillian has a learning disorder.\" She couldn't concentrate; she was fidgeting. I think now they'd say she had ADHD. Wouldn't you? But this was the 1930s, and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point. It wasn't an available condition.(Laughter)People weren't aware they could have that.(Laughter)Anyway, she went to see this specialist. So, this oak-paneled room, and she was there with her mother, and she was led and sat on this chair at the end, and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while this man talked to her mother about the problems Gillian was having at school. Because she was disturbing people; her homework was always late; and so on, little kid of eight. In the end, the doctor went and sat next to Gillian, and said, \"I've listened to all these things your mother's told me, I need to speak to her privately. Wait here. We'll be back; we won't be very long,\" and they went and left her.But as they went out of the room, he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk. And when they got out, he said to her mother, \"Just stand and watch her.\" And the minute they left the room, she was on her feet, moving to the music. And they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said, \"Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick; she's a dancer. Take her to a dance school.\"I said, \"What happened?\" She said, \"She did. I can't tell you how wonderful it was. We walked in this room and it was full of people like me. People who couldn't sit still. People who had to move to think.\" Who had to move to think. They did ballet, they did tap, jazz; they did modern; they did contemporary. She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School; she became a soloist; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet. She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School, founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company, met Andrew Lloyd Webber. She's been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history, she's given pleasure to millions, and she's a multi-millionaire. Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down.(Applause)What I think it comes to is this: Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson. I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology, one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity. Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth: for a particular commodity. And for the future, it won't serve us. We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we're educating our children.There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk, who said, \"If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth, within 50 years all life on Earth would end. If all human beings disappeared from the Earth, within 50 years all forms of life would flourish.\" And he's right.What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination. We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we've talked about. And the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are. And our task is to educate their whole being, so they can face this future. By the way \u2014 we may not see this future, but they will. And our job is to help them make something of it.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 66, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:16.636\nGood morning.

--> 00:03:31.501\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:31.525 --> 00:03:34.270\nI heard a great story recently\n-- I love telling it --\n\n00:03:34.294 --> 00:03:37.009\nof a little girl\nwho was in a drawing lesson.\n\n00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:39.168\nShe was six, and she was\nat the back, drawing,\n\n00:03:39.192 --> 00:03:41.992\nand the teacher said this girl\nhardly ever paid attention,\n\n00:03:42.016 --> 00:03:43.802\nand in this drawing lesson, she did.\n\n00:03:43.826 --> 00:03:45.166\nThe teacher was fascinated.\n\n00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.952\nShe went over to her,\nand she said, \"What are

And it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice; I'm extremely grateful. I have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night. And I say that sincerely, partly because (Mock sob) I need that.(Laughter)Put yourselves in my position.(Laughter)I flew on Air Force Two for eight years.(Laughter)Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane!(Laughter)(Applause)I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me.(Laughter)It's a true story \u2014 every bit of this is true.Soon after Tipper and I left the \u2014 (Mock sob) White House \u2014(Laughter)we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville. Driving ourselves.(Laughter)I know it sounds like a little thing to you, but \u2014(Laughter)I looked in the rear-view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me. There was no motorcade back there.(Laughter)You've heard of phantom limb pain?(Laughter)This was a rented Ford Taurus.(Laughter)It was dinnertime, and we started looking for a place to eat. We were on I-40. We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee. We got off the exit, we found a Shoney's restaurant. Low-cost family restaurant chain, for those of you who don't know it. We went in and sat down at the booth, and the waitress came over, made a big commotion over Tipper.(Laughter)She took our order, and then went to the couple in the booth next to us, and she lowered her voice so much, I had to really strain to hear what she was saying. And she said \"Yes, that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper.\" And the man said, \"He's come down a long way, hasn't he?\"(Laughter)(Applause)There's been kind of a series of epiphanies.(Laughter)The very next day, continuing the totally true story, I got on a G-V to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria, in the city of Lagos, on the topic of energy. And I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville. And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you: Tipper and I were driving ourselves, Shoney's, low-cost family restaurant chain, what the man said \u2014 they laughed. I gave my speech, then went back out to the airport to fly back home. I fell asleep on the plane until, during the middle of the night, we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling. I woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air, and I looked, and there was a man running across the runway. And he was waving a piece of paper, and he was yelling, \"Call Washington! Call Washington!\" And I thought to myself, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be wrong in Washington? Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things.(Laughter)But what it turned out to be, was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech, and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. It was printed in Monterey, I checked.(Laughter)And the story began, \"Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday,\" quote: 'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant'\" \u2014(Laughter)\"'named Shoney's, and we are running it ourselves.'\"(Laughter)Before I could get back to U.S. soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on \u2014 one of them had me in a big white chef's hat, Tipper was saying, \"One more burger with fries!\"(Laughter)Three days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton, saying, \"Congratulations on the new restaurant, Al!\"(Laughter)We like to celebrate each other's successes in life.(Laughter)I was going to talk about information ecology. But I was thinking that, since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED, that maybe I could talk about that another time.(Applause)Chris Anderson: It's a deal!(Applause)Al Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on: What can you do about the climate crisis? I want to start with a couple of \u2014 I'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five. Now, the slide show. I update the slide show every time I give it. I add new images, because I learn more about it every time I give it. It's like beach-combing, you know? Every time the tide comes in and out, you find some more shells. Just in the last two days, we got the new temperature records in January. This is just for the United States of America. Historical average for Januarys is 31 degrees; last month was 39.5 degrees.Now, I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment \u2014 I'm kidding. But these are the recapitulation slides, and then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do. But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these. First of all, this is where we're projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming, under business as usual. Efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit. Efficiency and conservation \u2014 it's not a cost; it's a profit. The sign is wrong. It's not negative; it's positive. These are investments that pay for themselves. But they are also very effective in deflecting our path.Cars and trucks \u2014 I talked about that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective. It's an easy, visible target of concern \u2014 and it should be \u2014 but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest standards in the world. And so we should address that. But it's part of the puzzle. Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks. Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference. And with what Vinod, and John Doerr and others, many of you here \u2014 there are a lot of people directly involved in this \u2014 this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it. Carbon Capture and Sequestration \u2014 that's what CCS stands for \u2014 is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe. Not quite there yet. OK. Now, what can you do?Reduce emissions in your home. Most of these expenditures are also profitable. Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles \u2014 buy a hybrid. Use light rail. Figure out some of the other options that are much better. It's important.Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy, between things that have a harsh effect, or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis. Consider this: Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life. Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people. It is easier than you think. It really is. A lot of us in here have made that decision, and it is really pretty easy. It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced. And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net.There is a carbon calculator. Participant Productions convened \u2014 with my active involvement \u2014 the leading software writers in the world, on this arcane science of carbon calculation, to construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator. You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce. And by the time the movie comes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0, and we will have click-through purchases of offsets.Next, consider making your business carbon-neutral. Again, some of us have done that, and it's not as hard as you think. Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology, or entertainment, or design and architecture community. Invest sustainably. Majora mentioned this. Listen, if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management. Over time, people do what you pay them to do. And if they judge how much they're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested, based on the short-term returns, you're going to get short-term decisions. A lot more to be said about that.Become a catalyst of change. Teach others, learn about it, talk about it. The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining. And it comes out in May. Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it. Consider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well. And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow \u2014 re-purposed, with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it's not just the slides, it's what they mean. And it's how they link together. And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge. Working with Larry Lessig, it will be, somewhere in that process, posted with tools and limited-use copyrights, so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way.(Applause)Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm's length from politics? It doesn't mean that if you're a Republican, that I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat. We need Republicans as well. This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that in this group it really is. Become politically active. Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work. Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 global warming pollution \u2014 and trading it. Here's why: as long as the United States is out of the world system, it's not a closed system. Once it becomes a closed system, with U.S. participation, then everybody who's on a board of directors \u2014 how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation? Once it's a closed system, you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided. The market will work to solve this problem \u2014 if we can accomplish this. Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring. We have to change the minds of the American people. Because presently, the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done.And in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did. It's now repetition of short, hot-button, 30-second, 28-second television ads. We have to buy a lot of those ads. Let's re-brand global warming, as many of you have suggested. I like \"climate crisis\" instead of \"climate collapse,\" but again, those of you who are good at branding, I need your help on this. Somebody said the test we're facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination.(Laughter)That's really true.I said the other night, and I'll repeat now: this is not a political issue. Again, the Republicans here \u2014 this shouldn't be partisan. You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do. This is an opportunity. Not just this, but connected to the ideas that are here, to bring more coherence to them. We are one.Thank you very much, I appreciate it.(Applause)", "id": 1, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:15.295 --> 00:00:16.486\nThank you so much,

phantom limb pain?\n\n00:02:03.508 --> 00:02:08.320\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:08.344 --> 00:02:12.560\nThis was a rented Ford Taurus.\n\n00:02:12.584 --> 00:02:15.088\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:15.112 --> 00:02:17.118\nIt was dinnertime,\n\n00:02:17.142 --> 00:02:20.062\nand we started looking for a place to eat.\n\n00:02:20.546 --> 00:02:21.951\nWe were on I-40.\n\n00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:25.172\nWe got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee.\n\n00:02:25.196 --> 00:02:28.884\nWe got off the exit,\nwe found a Shoney's restaurant.\n\n00:02:28.908 --> 00:02:32.947\nLow-cost family restaurant chain,\nfor those of you who don't know it.\n\n00:02:33.835 --> 00:02:38.270\nWe went in and sat down at the booth,\nand the waitress came over,\n\n00:02:38.294 --> 00:02:40.280\nmade a big commotion over Tipper.\n\n00:02:40.304 --> 00:02:42.767\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:42.791 --> 00:02:46.211\nShe took our order, and then went\nto the couple in the booth next to us,\n\n00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:48.339\nand she lowered her voice so much,\n\n00:02:48.363 --> 00:02:51.364\nI had to really strain to hear\nwhat she was saying.\n\n00:02:51.388 --> 00:02:54.067\nAnd she said \"Yes, that's former\nVice President Al Gore\n\n00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:55.934\nand his wife, Tipper.\"\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.485\nAnd the man said,\n\n00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:59.701\n\"He's come down a long way, hasn't he?\"\n\n00:02:59.725 --> 00:03:04.633\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:04.657 --> 00:03:08.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:12.077\nThere's been kind\nof a series of epiphanies.\n\n00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:13.245\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.934\nThe very next day,\ncontinuing the totally true story,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:22.934\nI got on a G-V to fly to Africa\nto make a speech in Nigeria,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.814\nin the city of Lagos,\non the topic of energy.\n\n00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:30.055\nAnd I began the speech\nby telling them the story\n\n00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.792\nof what had just happened\nthe day before in Nashville.\n\n00:03:33.154 --> 00:03:36.460\nAnd I told it pretty much the same way\nI've just shared it with you:\n\n00:03:36.484 --> 00:03:38.222\nTipper and I were driving ourselves,\n\n00:03:38.246 --> 00:03:40.284\nShoney's, low-cost\nfamily restaurant chain,\n\n00:03:40.308 --> 00:03:42.241\nwhat the man said -- they laughed.\n\n00:03:42.661 --> 00:03:46.244\nI gave my speech, then went back\nout to the airport to fly back home.\n\n00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:48.134\nI fell asleep on the plane\n\n00:03:48.158 --> 00:03:50.696\nuntil, during the middle\nof the night, we landed\n\n00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.934\non the Azores Islands for refueling.\n\n00:03:53.322 --> 00:03:56.434\nI woke up, they opened the door,\nI went out to get some fresh air,\n\n00:03:56.458 --> 00:03:59.934\nand I looked, and there was a man\nrunning across the runway.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.013\nAnd he was waving a piece\nof paper, and he was yelling,\n\n00:04:03.037 --> 00:04:07.111\n\"Call Washington! Call Washington!\"\n\n00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.384\nAnd I thought to myself,\nin the middle of the night,\n\n00:04:10.408 --> 00:04:11.844\nin the middle of the Atlantic,\n\n00:04:11.868 --> 00:04:14.088\nwhat in the world could be\nwrong in Washington?\n\n00:04:14.112 --> 00:04:16.373\nThen I remembered\nit could be a bunch of things.\n\n00:04:16.397 --> 00:04:21.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.885\nBut what it turned out to be,\n\n00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:27.220\nwas that my staff was extremely upset\n\n00:04:27.244 --> 00:04:33.446\nbecause one of the wire services\nin Nigeria had already written a story\n\n00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.890\nabout my speech,\n\n00:04:34.914 --> 00:04:36.890\nand it had already been printed in cities\n\n00:04:36.914 --> 00:04:39.246\nall across the United States of America.\n\n00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.098\nIt was printed in Monterey, I checked.\n\n00:04:41.122 --> 00:04:42.272\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:45.172\nAnd the story began,\n\n00:04:45.196 --> 00:04:49.489\n\"Former Vice President Al Gore\nannounced in Nigeria yesterday,\" quote:\n\n00:04:49.513 --> 00:04:53.142\n'My wife Tipper and I have opened\na low-cost family restaurant'\" --\n\n00:04:53.166 --> 00:04:54.808\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:54.832 --> 00:04:56.180\n\"'named Shoney's,\n\n00:04:56.204 --> 00:04:58.003\nand we are running it ourselves.'\"\n\n00:04:58.027 --> 00:05:01.347\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:01.371 --> 00:05:03.529\nBefore I could get back to U.S. soil,\n\n00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:07.667\nDavid Letterman and Jay Leno\nhad already started in on --\n\n00:05:07.691 --> 00:05:10.934\none of them had me\nin a big white chef's hat,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.387\nTipper was saying,\n\"One more burger with fries!\"\n\n00:05:13.411 --> 00:05:14.458\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:14.482 --> 00:05:15.764\nThree days later,\n\n00:05:15.788 --> 00:05:18.527\nI got a nice, long, handwritten letter\n\n00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:21.972\nfrom my friend and partner\nand colleague Bill Clinton, saying,\n\n00:05:21.996 --> 00:05:24.392\n\"Congratulations\non the new restaurant, Al!\"\n\n00:05:24.416 --> 00:05:31.089\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:31.113 --> 00:05:34.250\nWe like to celebrate\neach other's successes in life.\n\n00:05:34.274 --> 00:05:39.671\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:40.564 --> 00:05:43.111\nI was going to talk\nabout information ecology.\n\n00:05:43.135 --> 00:05:45.153\nBut I was thinking that,\n\n00:05:45.177 --> 00:05:48.934\nsince I plan to make a lifelong habit\nof coming back to TED,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.651\nthat maybe I could talk\nabout that another time.\n\n00:05:51.675 --> 00:05:53.075\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:54.496\nChris Anderson: It's a deal!\n\n00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.146\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.688\nAl Gore: I want to focus\non what many of you have said\n\n00:06:01.712 --> 00:06:03.578\nyou would like me to elaborate on:\n\n00:06:03.602 --> 00:06:07.419\nWhat can you do about the climate crisis?\n\n00:06:08.275 --> 00:06:11.614\nI want to start with a couple of --\n\n00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:14.207\nI'm going to show some new images,\n\n00:06:14.231 --> 00:06:19.354\nand I'm going to recapitulate\njust four or five.\n\n00:06:20.033 --> 00:06:21.605\nNow, the slide show.\n\n00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:24.934\nI update the slide show\nevery time I give it.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.195\nI add new images,\n\n00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:29.124\nbecause I learn more about it\nevery time I give it.\n\n00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:31.732\nIt's like beach-combing, you know?\n\n00:06:31.756 --> 00:06:34.934\nEvery time the tide comes in and out,\nyou find some more shells.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:40.941\nJust in the last two days, we got\nthe new temperature records in January.\n\n00:06:40.965 --> 00:06:43.975\nThis is just for\nthe United States of America.\n\n00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:46.737\nHistorical average\nfor Januarys is 31 degrees;\n\n00:06:46.761 --> 00:06:50.445\nlast month was 39.5 degrees.\n\n00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:55.703\nNow, I know that you wanted some more\nbad news about the environment --\n\n00:06:55.727 --> 00:06:56.895\nI'm kidding.\n\n00:06:57.362 --> 00:07:00.418\nBut these are the recapitulation slides,\n\n00:07:00.442 --> 00:07:03.836\nand then I'm going to go into new\nmaterial about what you can do.\n\n00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.255\nBut I wanted to elaborate\non a couple of these.\n\n00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:09.590\nFirst of all, this is where\nwe're projected to go\n\n00:07:09.614 --> 00:07:11.716\nwith the U.S. contribution\nto global warming,\n\n00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.524\nunder business as usual.\n\n00:07:13.548 --> 00:07:18.934\nEfficiency in end-use electricity\nand end-use of all energy\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.582\nis the low-hanging fruit.\n\n00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:25.110\nEfficiency and conservation --\nit's not a cost; it's a profit.\n\n00:07:25.134 --> 00:07:27.811\nThe sign is wrong.\n\n00:07:27.835 --> 00:07:29.978\nIt's not negative; it's positive.\n\n00:07:30.002 --> 00:07:32.842\nThese are investments\nthat pay for themselves.\n\n00:07:32.866 --> 00:07:36.737\nBut they are also very effective\nin deflecting our path.\n\n00:07:37.578 --> 00:07:41.573\nCars and trucks -- I talked\nabout that in the slideshow,\n\n00:07:41.597 --> 00:07:44.089\nbut I want you to put it in perspective.\n\n00:07:44.851 --> 00:07:49.448\nIt's an easy, visible target of concern --\n\n00:07:49.472 --> 00:07:50.934\nand it should be --\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:55.637\nbut there is more global warming pollution\nthat comes from buildings\n\n00:07:55.661 --> 00:07:57.383\nthan from cars and trucks.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.599\nCars and trucks are very significant,\n\n00:08:00.623 --> 00:08:03.208\nand we have the lowest\nstandards in the world.\n\n00:08:03.232 --> 00:08:06.258\nAnd so we should address that.\nBut it's part of the puzzle.\n\n00:08:06.282 --> 00:08:11.643\nOther transportation efficiency\nis as important as cars and trucks.\n\n00:08:11.667 --> 00:08:16.009\nRenewables at the current levels\nof technological efficiency\n\n00:08:16.033 --> 00:08:17.780\ncan make this much difference.\n\n00:08:17.804 --> 00:08:23.759\nAnd with what Vinod, and John Doerr\nand others, many of you here --\n\n00:08:23.783 --> 00:08:26.350\nthere are a lot of people\ndirectly involved in this --\n\n00:08:26.374 --> 00:08:28.906\nthis wedge is going to grow\nmuch more rapidly\n\n00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.117\nthan the current projection shows it.\n\n00:08:31.141 --> 00:08:36.881\nCarbon Capture and Sequestration --\nthat's what CCS stands for --\n\n00:08:36.905 --> 00:08:43.720\nis likely to become the killer app\nthat will enable us\n\n00:08:43.744 --> 00:08:50.155\nto continue to use fossil fuels\nin a way that is safe.\n\n00:08:51.417 --> 00:08:52.753\nNot quite there yet.\n\n00:08:52.777 --> 00:08:55.943\nOK. Now, what can you do?\n\n00:08:58.453 --> 00:09:00.210\nReduce emissions in your home.\n\n00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:05.178\nMost of these expenditures\nare also profitable.\n\n00:09:05.965 --> 00:09:07.934\nInsulation, better design.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.647\nBuy green electricity where you can.\n\n00:09:11.394 --> 00:09:15.204\nI mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid.\n\n00:09:15.228 --> 00:09:16.934\nUse light rail.\n\n00:09:17.463 --> 00:09:20.245\nFigure out some of the other options\nthat are much better.\n\n00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:21.434\nIt's important.\n\n00:09:22.212 --> 00:09:23.931\nBe a green consumer.\n\n00:09:23.955 --> 00:09:26.934\nYou have choices with everything you buy,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:30.565\nbetween things that have a harsh effect,\n\n00:09:30.589 --> 00:09:36.089\nor a much less harsh effect\non the global climate crisis.\n\n00:09:36.828 --> 00:09:38.660\nConsider this:\n\n00:09:38.684 --> 00:09:41.936\nMake a decision to live\na carbon-neutral life.\n\n00:09:42.621 --> 00:09:45.055\nThose of you who are good at branding,\n\n00:09:45.079 --> 00:09:47.551\nI'd love to get your advice and help\n\n00:09:47.575 --> 00:09:53.653\non how to say this in a way\nthat connects with the most people.\n\n00:09:53.677 --> 00:09:55.658\nIt is easier than you think.\n\n00:09:55.682 --> 00:09:56.998\nIt really is.\n\n00:09:59.181 --> 00:10:02.576\nA lot of us in here\nhave made that decision,\n\n00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.734\nand it is really pretty easy.\n\n00:10:04.758 --> 00:10:10.685\nIt means reduce\nyour carbon dioxide emissions\n\n00:10:10.709 --> 00:10:13.405\nwith the full range\nof choices that you make,\n\n00:10:13.429 --> 00:10:17.554\nand then purchase or acquire offsets\n\n00:10:17.578 --> 00:10:20.695\nfor the remainder that you have not\ncompletely reduced.\n\n00:10:20.719 --> 00:10:27.209\nAnd what it means is elaborated\nat climatecrisis.net.\n\n00:10:27.713 --> 00:10:30.578\nThere is a carbon calculator.\n\n00:10:31.459 --> 00:10:34.934\nParticipant Productions convened --\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.528\nwith my active involvement --\n\n00:10:37.552 --> 00:10:40.369\nthe leading software writers in the world,\n\n00:10:40.393 --> 00:10:43.696\non this arcane science\nof carbon calculation,\n\n00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.822\nto construct a consumer-friendly\ncarbon calculator.\n\n00:10:48.275 --> 00:10:54.484\nYou can very precisely calculate\nwhat your CO2 emissions are,\n\n00:10:54.508 --> 00:10:57.826\nand then you will be given\noptions to reduce.\n\n00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:01.047\nAnd by the time the movie\ncomes out in May,\n\n00:11:01.071 --> 00:11:02.934\nthis will be updated to 2.0,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:06.392\nand we will have click-through\npurchases of offsets.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.180\nNext, consider making\nyour business carbon-neutral.\n\n00:11:10.204 --> 00:11:11.812\nAgain, some of us have done that,\n\n00:11:11.836 --> 00:11:13.842\nand it's not as hard as you think.\n\n00:11:15.154 --> 00:11:19.344\nIntegrate climate solutions\ninto all of your innovations,\n\n00:11:19.368 --> 00:11:21.281\nwhether you are from the technology,\n\n00:11:21.305 --> 00:11:24.934\nor entertainment, or design\nand architecture community.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.001\nInvest sustainably.\n\n00:11:27.025 --> 00:11:28.714\nMajora mentioned this.\n\n00:11:29.206 --> 00:11:35.998\nListen, if you have invested money\nwith managers who you compensate\n\n00:11:36.022 --> 00:11:38.739\non the basis of their annual performance,\n\n00:11:38.763 --> 00:11:43.675\ndon't ever again complain\nabout quarterly report CEO management.\n\n00:11:44.765 --> 00:11:47.321\nOver time, people do\nwhat you pay them to do.\n\n00:11:48.694 --> 00:11:53.387\nAnd if they judge how much\nthey're going to get paid\n\n00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:56.711\non your capital that they've invested,\n\n00:11:56.735 --> 00:11:58.678\nbased on the short-term returns,\n\n00:11:58.702 --> 00:12:01.018\nyou're going to get short-term

about it,\ntalk about it.\n\n00:12:11.221 --> 00:12:14.626\nThe movie is a movie version\nof the slideshow\n\n00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.569\nI gave two nights ago,\nexcept it's a lot more entertaining.\n\n00:12:18.652 --> 00:12:20.799\nAnd it comes out in May.\n\n00:12:21.395 --> 00:12:25.356\nMany of you here have the opportunity\nto ensure that a lot of people see it.\n\n00:12:27.064 --> 00:12:30.667\nConsider sending somebody to Nashville.\n\n00:12:31.348 --> 00:12:32.503\nPick well.\n\n00:12:33.339 --> 00:12:37.785\nAnd I am personally going to train people\nto give this slideshow --\n\n00:12:37.809 --> 00:12:42.564\nre-purposed, with some\nof the personal stories obviously replaced\n\n00:12:42.588 --> 00:12:44.658\nwith a generic approach,\n\n00:12:44.682 --> 00:12:47.381\nand it's not just the slides,\nit's what they mean.\n\n00:12:47.405 --> 00:12:49.006\nAnd it's how they link together.\n\n00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:53.617\nAnd so I'm going to be conducting\na course this summer\n\n00:12:53.641 --> 00:12:57.476\nfor a group of people that are\nnominated by different folks\n\n00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.729\nto come and then give it en

week,\n\n00:13:06.647 --> 00:13:09.678\nto keep it right on the cutting edge.\n\n00:13:09.702 --> 00:13:13.583\nWorking with Larry Lessig, it will be,\nsomewhere in that process,\n\n00:13:13.607 -->

00:13:27.104\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:27.128 --> 00:13:28.618\nWhere did anybody get the idea\n\n00:13:28.642 --> 00:13:30.994\nthat you ought to stay\narm's length from politics?\n\n00:13:31.018 --> 00:13:33.108\nIt doesn't mean\nthat if you're a Republican,\n\n00:13:33.132 --> 00:13:35.456\nthat I'm trying to convince you\nto be a Democrat.\n\n00:13:35.893 --> 00:13:37.398\nWe need Republicans as well.\n\n00:13:37.422 --> 00:13:39.431\nThis used to be a bipartisan issue,\n\n00:13:39.455 --> 00:13:41.912\nand I know that\nin this group it really is.\n\n00:13:41.936 --> 00:13:43.488\nBecome

--\n\n00:13:52.284 --> 00:13:54.299\nglobal warming pollution --\nand trading it.\n\n00:13:54.323 --> 00:13:58.934\nHere's why: as long as the United States\nis out of the world system,\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.626\nit's not a closed system.\n\n00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:04.697\nOnce it becomes a closed system,\nwith U.S. participation,\n\n00:14:04.721 --> 00:14:06.944\nthen

--> 00:14:13.799\nOnce it's a closed system,\n\n00:14:13.823 --> 00:14:20.060\nyou will have legal liability\nif you do not urge your CEO\n\n00:14:20.084 --> 00:14:24.211\nto get the maximum income from reducing\nand trading the carbon emissions\n\n00:14:24.235 --> 00:14:25.544\nthat can be avoided.\n\n00:14:25.568 --> 00:14:28.233\nThe market will work\nto solve this problem --\n\n00:14:30.907 --> 00:14:33.124\nif we can accomplish this.\n\n00:14:34.392 --> 00:14:37.777\nHelp with the mass persuasion campaign\nthat will start this spring.\n\n00:14:37.801 --> 00:14:40.309\nWe have to change the minds\nof the American people.\n\n00:14:40.333 --> 00:14:43.092\nBecause presently, the politicians\ndo not have permission\n\n00:14:43.116 --> 00:14:45.035\nto do what needs to be done.\n\n00:14:45.313 --> 00:14:50.767\nAnd in our modern country, the role\nof logic and reason no longer includes\n\n00:14:50.791 --> 00:14:53.745\nmediating between wealth and power\nthe way it once did.\n\n00:14:53.769 --> 00:14:59.329\nIt's now repetition of short, hot-button,\n30-second, 28-second television ads.\n\n00:14:59.353 --> 00:15:01.211\nWe have to buy a lot of those ads.\n\n00:15:02.179 --> 00:15:06.489\nLet's re-brand global warming,\nas many of you have suggested.\n\n00:15:06.513 --> 00:15:09.382\nI like \"climate crisis\"\ninstead of \"climate collapse,\"\n\n00:15:09.406 --> 00:15:11.733\nbut again, those of you\nwho are good at branding,\n\n00:15:11.757 --> 00:15:13.162\nI need your help on this.\n\n00:15:13.726 --> 00:15:17.826\nSomebody said the test\nwe're facing now, a scientist told me,\n\n00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.934\nis whether the combination\nof an opposable thumb\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.775\nand a neocortex is a viable combination.\n\n00:15:23.905 --> 00:15:25.404\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:25.783 --> 00:15:27.340\nThat's really true.\n\n00:15:30.118 --> 00:15:33.518\nI said the other night,\nand I'll repeat now:\n\n00:15:33.542 --> 00:15:35.707\nthis is not a political issue.\n\n00:15:35.731 --> 00:15:41.270\nAgain, the Republicans here --\nthis shouldn't be partisan.\n\n00:15:41.294 --> 00:15:44.934\nYou have more influence\nthan some of us who are Democrats do.\n\n00:15:45.379 --> 00:15:46.855\nThis is an opportunity.\n\n00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:51.731\nNot just this, but connected\nto the ideas that are here,\n\n00:15:51.755 --> 00:15:53.683\nto bring more coherence to them.\n\n00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:55.619\nWe are one.\n\n00:15:56.023 --> 00:15:58.358\nThank you very much, I appreciate it.\n\n00:15:58.382 --> 00:16:04.624\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Simplicity sells", "duration": "1286", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_pogue_says_simplicity_sells", "transcript": "(Music: \"The Sound of Silence,\" Simon & Garfunkel)Hello voice mail, my old friend.(Laughter)I've called for tech support again. I ignored my boss's warning. I called on a Monday morning. Now it's evening, and my dinner first grew cold, and then grew mold. I'm still on hold. I'm listening to the sounds of silence. I don't think you understand. I think your phone lines are unmanned. I punched every touch tone I was told, but I've still spent 18 hours on hold. It's not enough your software crashed my Mac, and it constantly hangs and bombs \u2014 it erased my ROMs! Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence. In my dreams I fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys. Say your motorcycle crashes. Blood comes gushing from your gashes. With your fading strength, you call 9-1-1 and you pray for a trained MD. But you get me.(Laughter)And you listen to the sounds of silence.(Music)(Applause)Thank you.Good evening and welcome to: \"Spot the TED Presenter Who Used to Be a Broadway Accompanist.\"(Laughter)When I was offered the Times column six years ago, the deal was like this: you'll be sent the coolest, hottest, slickest new gadgets. Every week, it'll arrive at your door. You get to try them out, play with them, evaluate them until the novelty wears out, before you have to send them back, and you'll get paid for it. You can think about it, if you want. So, I've always been a technology nut, and I absolutely love it. The job, though, came with one small downside, and that is, they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column. And what I've noticed is \u2014 first of all, you get an incredible amount of email.If you ever are feeling lonely, get a New York Times column, because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails. And the email I'm getting a lot today is about frustration. People are feeling like things \u2014 Ok, I just had an alarm come up on my screen. Lucky you can't see it. People are feeling overwhelmed. They're feeling like it's too much technology, too fast. It may be good technology, but I feel like there's not enough of a support structure. There's not enough help. There's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use. One time I wrote a column about my efforts to reach Dell Technical Support, and within 12 hours, there were 700 messages from readers on the feedback boards on the Times website, from users saying, \"\"Me too, and here's my tale of woe.\" I call it \"software rage.\" And man, let me tell you, whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will \u2014 Oh, how did that get up there? Just kidding.(Laughter)Ok, so why is the problem accelerating? And part of the problem is, ironically, because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use. I'll show you what I mean. This is what the computer interface used to look like, DOS. Over the years, it's gotten easier to use. This is the original Mac operating system. Reagan was President. Madonna was still a brunette. And the entire operating system \u2014 this is the good part \u2014 the entire operating system fit in 211 k. You couldn't put the Mac OS X logo in 211 k!(Laughter)So the irony is, that as these things became easier to use, a less technical, broader audience was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time.I once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the Apple call center for a day. The guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to. And the calls that \u2014 you know how they say, \"Your call may be recorded for quality assurance?\" Uh-uh. Your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD.(Laughter)Which they do.(Laughter)And I have a copy.(Laughter)It's in your gift bag. No, no. With your voices on it!So, some of the stories are just so classic, and yet so understandable. A woman called Apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking. Making a squeaking noise. And the technician said,\"Well, ma'am, what do you mean your mouse is squeaking?\"She says, \"All I can tell you is that it squeaks louder, the faster I move it across the screen.\"(Laughter)And the technician's like, \"Ma'am, you've got the mouse up against the screen?\"She goes, \"Well, the message said, 'Click here to continue.'\"(Laughter)Well, if you like that one \u2014 how much time have we got? Another one, a guy called \u2014 this is absolutely true \u2014 his computer had crashed, and he told the technician he couldn't restart it, no matter how many times he typed \"11.\" And the technician said, \"What? Why are you typing 11?\" He said, \"The message says, 'Error Type 11.'\"(Laughter)So, we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users. But why is the technical overload crisis, the complexity crisis, accelerating now?In the hardware world, it's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller, smaller, smaller. So the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier, but our fingers are essentially staying the same size. So it gets to be more and more of a challenge. Software is subject to another primal force: the mandate to release more and more versions. When you buy a piece of software, it's not like buying a vase or a candy bar, where you own it. It's more like joining a club, where you pay dues every year, and every year, they say, \"We've added more features, and we'll sell it to you for $99.\" I know one guy who's spent $4,000 just on Photoshop over the years. And software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades. I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox \u2014 which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times, you eventually ruin it.I mean, Microsoft Word was last just a word processor in, you know, the Eisenhower administration.(Laughter)But what's the alternative? Microsoft actually did this experiment. They said, \"Well, wait a minute. Everyone complains that we're adding so many features. Let's create a word processor that's just a word processor: Simple, pure; does not do web pages, is not a database.\" And it came out, and it was called Microsoft Write. And none of you are nodding in acknowledgment, because it died. It tanked. No one ever bought it. I call this the Sport Utility Principle. People like to surround themselves with unnecessary power, right? They don't need the database and the website, but they're like, \"Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might, you know, I might need that someday.\" So the problem is: as you add more features, where are they going to go? Where are you going to stick them? You only have so many design tools. You can do buttons, you can do sliders, pop-up menus, sub-menus. But if you're not careful about how you choose, you wind up with this.(Laughter)This is an un-retouched \u2014 this is not a joke \u2014 un-retouched photo of Microsoft Word, the copy that you have, with all the toolbars open. You've obviously never opened all the toolbars, but all you have to type in is this little, teeny window down here.(Laughter)And we've arrived at the age of interface matrices, where there are so many features and options, you have to do two dimensions, you know: a vertical and a horizontal. You guys all complain about how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically. The off switch is in there somewhere. I'm telling you \u2014 it's there. Part of the art of designing a simple, good interface, is knowing when to use which one of these features. So, here is the log-off dialogue box for Windows 2000. There are only four choices, so why are they in a pop-up menu? It's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices. They could have put them all out in view.Here's Apple's take on the exact same dialogue box.(Applause)Thank you \u2014 yes, I designed the dialogue box. No, no. Already, we can see that Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design. Microsoft's approach to simplicity tends to be: let's break it down; let's just make it more steps. There are these \"wizards\" everywhere. And you know, there's a new version of Windows coming out this fall. If they continue at this pace, there's absolutely no telling where they might wind up.[Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard](Laughter)(Applause)\"Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard.\" Ok, I'll bite. Let's click \"Next\" to continue.(Laughter)(Applause)From the drop-down menu, choose the first letter you want to type. Ok.(Laughter)So there is a limit that we don't want to cross. So what is the answer? How do you pack in all these features in a simple, intelligent way? I believe in consistency, when possible, real-world equivalents, trash can folder, when possible, label things, mostly. But I beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all, which is intelligence. Now what do I mean by that? I'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent, but it's better.If you are buying something on the web, you're supposed to put in your address, and you're supposed to choose what country you're from, ok? There are 200 countries in the world. We like to think of the Internet as a global village. I'm sorry; it's not one yet. It's mainly like, the United States, Europe, and Japan. So why is \"United States\" in the \"U\"s?(Laughter)You have to scroll, like, seven screensful to get to it. Now, it would be inconsistent to put \"United States\" first, but it would be intelligent.This one's been touched on before, but why in God's name do you shut down a Windows PC by clicking a button called \"Start?\"(Laughter)Here's another pet one of mine: you have a printer. Most of the time, you want to print one copy of your document, in page order, on that printer. So why in God's name do you see this every time you print? It's like a 747 shuttle cockpit.(Laughter)And one of the buttons at the bottom, you'll notice, is not \"Print.\"(Laughter)(Applause)Now, I'm not saying that Apple is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity. Palm is also, especially in the old days, wonderful about this. I actually got to speak to Palm when they were flying high in the '90s, and after the talk, I met one of the employees. He says, \"Nice talk.\" And I said, \"Thank you. What do you do here?\" He said, \"I'm a tap counter.\" I'm like, \"You're a what?\" He goes, \"Well Jeff Hawkins, the CEO, says, 'If any task on the Palm Pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus, it's too long, and it has to be redesigned.' So I'm the tap counter.\" So, I'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter.(Laughter)This is Microsoft Word. Ok, when you want to create a new blank document in Word \u2014 it could happen.(Laughter)You go up to the \"File\" menu and you choose \"New.\" Now, what happens when you choose \"New?\" Do you get a new blank document? You do not. On the opposite side of the monitor, a task bar appears, and somewhere in those links \u2014 by the way, not at the top \u2014 somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document. Ok, so that is a company not counting taps. You know, I don't want to just stand here and make fun of Microsoft ... Yes, I do.(Laughter)(Applause)The Bill Gates song!(Piano music)I've been a geek forever and I wrote the very first DOS. I put my software and IBM together; I got profit and they got the loss.(Laughter)I write the code that makes the whole world run. I'm getting royalties from everyone. Sometimes it's garbage, but the press is snowed. You buy the box; I'll sell the code. Every software company is doing Microsoft's R&D. You can't keep a good idea down these days. Even Windows is a hack. We're kind of based loosely on the Mac. So it's big, so it's slow. You've got nowhere to go. I'm not doing this for praise. I write the code that fits the world today. Big mediocrity in every way. We've entered planet domination mode. You'll have no choice; you'll buy my code. I am Bill Gates and I write the code.(Applause)But actually, I believe there are really two Microsofts. There's the old one, responsible for Windows and Office. They're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh, but they can't. They're locked in, because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis. But there's also a new Microsoft, that's really doing good, simple interface designs. I liked the Media Center PC. I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch. The Wireless Watch flopped miserably in the market, but it wasn't because it wasn't simply and beautifully designed. But let's put it this way: would you pay $10 a month to have a watch that has to be recharged every night like your cell phone, and stops working when you leave your area code?(Laughter)So, the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse. So is there any hope? The screens are getting smaller, people are illuminating, putting manuals in the boxes, things are coming out at a faster pace. It's funny \u2014 when Steve Jobs came back to Apple in 1997, after 12 years away, it was the MacWorld Expo \u2014 he came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans, and he sort of did this. The crowd went wild, but I had just seen \u2014 I'm like, where have I seen this before? I had just seen the movie \"Evita\" \u2014(Laughter)with Madonna, and I'm like, you know what? I've got to do one about Steve Jobs.(Music)It won't be easy. You'll think I'm strange.(Laughter)When I try to explain why I'm back, after telling the press Apple's future is black. You won't believe me. All that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named Woz.(Laughter)You try rhyming with garage!(Laughter)Don't cry for me, Cupertino.(Laughter)The truth is, I never left you. I know the ropes now, know what the tricks are. I made a fortune over at Pixar.(Laughter)Don't cry for me, Cupertino. I've still got the drive and vision. I still wear sandals in any weather. It's just that these days, they're Gucci leather.(Laughter)(Applause)Thank you.So Steve Jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty. And the truth is, for years I was a little depressed, because Americans obviously did not value it, because the Mac had three percent market share, Windows had 95 percent market share \u2014 people did not think it was worth putting a price on it. So I was a little depressed. And then I heard Al Gore's talk, and I realized I didn't know the meaning of depressed.(Laughter)But it turns out I was wrong, right? Because the iPod came out, and it violated every bit of common wisdom. Other products cost less; other products had more features, they had voice recorders and FM transmitters. The other products were backed by Microsoft, with an open standard, not Apple's propriety standard. But the iPod won \u2014 this is the one they wanted. The lesson was: simplicity sells. And there are signs that the industry is getting the message. This is a little company that's done very well with simplicity and elegance. The Sonos thing \u2014 it's catching on.I've got just a couple examples. Physically, a really cool, elegant thinking coming along lately. When you have a digital camera, how do you get the pictures back to your computer? Well, you either haul around a USB cable, or you buy a card reader and haul that around. Either one, you're going to lose. What I do is, I take out the memory card, and I fold it in half, revealing USB contacts. I just stick it in the computer, offload the pictures, put it right back in the camera. I never have to lose anything. Here's another example. Chris, you're the source of all power. Will you be my power plug?Chris Anderson: Oh yeah. DP: Hold that and don't let go. You might've seen this, this is Apple's new laptop. This the power cord. It hooks on like this. And I'm sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives, or one of your children. You walk along \u2014 and I'm about to pull this onto the floor. I don't care. It's a loaner. Here we go. Whoa! It's magnetic \u2014 it doesn't pull the laptop onto the floor.(Applause)In my very last example \u2014 I do a lot of my work using speech recognition software. And I'll just \u2014 you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous. Speech recognition software is really great for doing emails very quickly; period. Like, I get hundreds of them a day; period. And it's not just what I dictate that it writes down; period. I also use this feature called voice macros; period. Correct \"dissuade.\" Not \"just.\" Ok, this is not an ideal situation, because it's getting the echo from the hall and stuff. The point is, I can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word, and having it write out a much longer thing. So if somebody sends me a fan letter, I'll say, \"Thanks for that.\"[Thank you so much for taking the time to write ...](Laughter)(Applause)And conversely, if somebody sends me hate mail \u2014 which happens daily \u2014 I say, \"Piss off.\"(Laughter)[I admire your frankness ...](Laughter)(Applause)So that's my dirty little secret. Don't tell anyone.(Laughter)So the point is \u2014 this is a really interesting story. This is version eight of this software, and do you know what they put in version eight? No new features. It's never happened before in software! The company put no new features. They just said, \"We'll make this software work right.\" Right? Because for years, people had bought this software, tried it out \u2014 95 percent accuracy was all they got, which means one in 20 words is wrong \u2014 and they'd put it in their drawer. And the company got sick of that, so they said, \"This version, we're not going to do anything, but make sure it's darned accurate.\" And so that's what they did.This cult of doing things right is starting to spread. So, my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology: remember, if it doesn't work, it's not necessarily you, ok? It could be the design of the thing you're using. Be aware in life of good design and bad design. And if you're among the people who create this stuff: Easy is hard. Pre-sweat the details for your audience. Count the taps.

wasn't\nsimply and beautifully designed.\n\n00:14:50.732 --> 00:14:51.978\nBut let's put it this way:\n\n00:14:52.002 --> 00:14:54.493\nwould you pay $10 a month to have a watch\n\n00:14:54.517 --> 00:14:57.775\nthat has to be recharged\nevery night like your cell phone,\n\n00:14:57.799 --> 00:15:00.338\nand stops working\nwhen you leave your area code?\n\n00:15:00.362 --> 00:15:02.960\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:02.984 --> 00:15:05.485\nSo, the signs might indicate\n\n00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:08.346\nthat the complexity crunch\nis only going to get worse.\n\n00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.023\nSo is there any hope?\n\n00:15:10.047 --> 00:15:12.746\nThe screens are getting smaller,\npeople are illuminating,\n\n00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.167\nputting manuals in the boxes,\n\n00:15:14.191 --> 00:15:16.934\nthings are coming out at a faster pace.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:20.351\nIt's funny -- when Steve Jobs\ncame back to Apple in 1997,\n\n00:15:20.375 --> 00:15:23.200\nafter 12 years away,\nit was the MacWorld Expo --\n\n00:15:23.224 --> 00:15:26.366\nhe came to the stage\nin that black turtleneck and jeans,\n\n00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:27.542\nand he sort of did this.\n\n00:15:27.566 --> 00:15:29.934\nThe crowd went wild,\nbut I had just seen --\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.884\nI'm like, where have I seen this before?\n\n00:15:31.908 --> 00:15:33.717\nI had just seen the movie \"Evita\" --\n\n00:15:33.741 --> 00:15:36.826\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:38.008\nwith Madonna,\n\n00:15:38.032 --> 00:15:39.780\nand I'm like, you know what?\n\n00:15:39.804 --> 00:15:42.901\nI've got to do one about Steve Jobs.\n\n00:15:42.925 --> 00:15:43.933\n(Music)\n\n00:15:43.957 --> 00:15:46.973\nIt won't be easy.\nYou'll think I'm strange.\n\n00:15:46.997 --> 00:15:48.141\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:48.165 --> 00:15:50.474\nWhen I try to explain why I'm back,\n\n00:15:50.498 --> 00:15:53.589\nafter telling the press\nApple's future is black.\n\n00:15:53.613 --> 00:15:56.208\nYou won't believe me.\n\n00:15:56.232 --> 00:16:00.934\nAll that you see is a kid in his teens\nwho started out in a garage\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.934\nwith only a buddy named Woz.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.510\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:05.534 --> 00:16:07.267\nYou try rhyming with garage!\n\n00:16:07.291 --> 00:16:09.733\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:09.757 --> 00:16:12.632\nDon't cry for me, Cupertino.\n\n00:16:12.656 --> 00:16:13.978\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:14.002 --> 00:16:16.934\nThe truth is, I never left you.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:20.493\nI know the ropes now,\nknow what the tricks are.\n\n00:16:20.517 --> 00:16:23.934\nI made a fortune over at Pixar.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:24.997\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:25.021 --> 00:16:27.672\nDon't cry for me, Cupertino.\n\n00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.453\nI've still got the drive and vision.\n\n00:16:31.477 --> 00:16:34.929\nI still wear sandals in any weather.\n\n00:16:34.953 --> 00:16:36.934\nIt's just that these days,\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.934\nthey're Gucci leather.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:47.866\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:49.374\nThank you.\n\n00:16:49.773 --> 00:16:54.481\nSo Steve Jobs had always believed\nin simplicity and elegance and beauty.\n\n00:16:54.505 --> 00:16:56.402\nAnd the truth is,\n\n00:16:56.426 --> 00:16:58.554\nfor years I was a little depressed,\n\n00:16:58.578 --> 00:17:00.851\nbecause Americans\nobviously did not value it,\n\n00:17:00.875 --> 00:17:03.152\nbecause the Mac had\nthree percent market share,\n\n00:17:03.176 --> 00:17:05.033\nWindows had 95 percent market share --\n\n00:17:05.057 --> 00:17:07.934\npeople did not think it was worth\nputting a price on it.\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.749\nSo I was a little depressed.\n\n00:17:09.773 --> 00:17:11.330\nAnd then I heard Al Gore's talk,\n\n00:17:11.354 --> 00:17:13.893\nand I realized I didn't know\nthe meaning of depressed.\n\n00:17:13.917 --> 00:17:14.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.695\nBut it turns out I was wrong, right?\n\n00:17:16.719 --> 00:17:18.452\nBecause the iPod came out,\n\n00:17:18.476 --> 00:17:21.094\nand it violated every bit\nof common wisdom.\n\n00:17:21.118 --> 00:17:24.094\nOther products cost less;\nother products had more features,\n\n00:17:24.118 --> 00:17:26.855\nthey had voice recorders\nand FM transmitters.\n\n00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:30.101\nThe other products were backed\nby Microsoft, with an open standard,\n\n00:17:30.125 --> 00:17:31.839\nnot Apple's propriety standard.\n\n00:17:31.863 --> 00:17:34.435\nBut the iPod won --\nthis is the one they wanted.\n\n00:17:34.459 --> 00:17:36.722\nThe lesson was: simplicity sells.\n\n00:17:36.746 --> 00:17:39.620\nAnd there are signs that the industry\nis getting the message.\n\n00:17:39.644 --> 00:17:43.235\nThis is a little company that's done\nvery well with simplicity and elegance.\n\n00:17:43.259 --> 00:17:44.998\nThe Sonos thing -- it's catching on.\n\n00:17:45.022 --> 00:17:46.720\nI've got just a couple examples.\n\n00:17:46.744 --> 00:17:50.420\nPhysically, a really cool,\nelegant thinking coming along lately.\n\n00:17:50.444 --> 00:17:52.397\nWhen you have a digital camera,\n\n00:17:52.421 --> 00:17:55.664\nhow do you get the pictures\nback to your computer?\n\n00:17:55.688 --> 00:17:58.030\nWell, you either haul around a USB cable,\n\n00:17:58.054 --> 00:18:00.210\nor you buy a card reader\nand haul that around.\n\n00:18:00.234 --> 00:18:01.821\nEither one, you're going to lose.\n\n00:18:01.845 --> 00:18:04.304\nWhat I do is, I take out the memory card,\n\n00:18:04.328 --> 00:18:09.673\nand I fold it in half,\nrevealing USB contacts.\n\n00:18:09.697 --> 00:18:12.355\nI just stick it in the computer,\noffload the pictures,\n\n00:18:12.379 --> 00:18:13.918\nput it right back in the camera.\n\n00:18:13.942 --> 00:18:15.742\nI never have to lose anything.\n\n00:18:15.766 --> 00:18:17.303\nHere's another example.\n\n00:18:17.327 --> 00:18:20.397\nChris, you're the source of all power.\nWill you be my power plug?\n\n00:18:20.421 --> 00:18:23.161\nChris Anderson: Oh yeah.\nDP: Hold that and don't let go.\n\n00:18:23.185 --> 00:18:25.606\nYou might've seen this,\nthis is Apple's new laptop.\n\n00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:27.654\nThis the power cord.\nIt hooks on like this.\n\n00:18:27.678 --> 00:18:31.075\nAnd I'm sure every one of you has done\nthis at some point in your lives,\n\n00:18:31.099 --> 00:18:32.274\nor one of your children.\n\n00:18:32.298 --> 00:18:35.123\nYou walk along -- and I'm\nabout to pull this onto the floor.\n\n00:18:35.147 --> 00:18:36.483\nI don't care. It's a loaner.\n\n00:18:36.507 --> 00:18:37.690\nHere we go. Whoa!\n\n00:18:37.714 --> 00:18:40.783\nIt's magnetic -- it doesn't pull\nthe laptop onto the floor.\n\n00:18:40.807 --> 00:18:44.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:46.927\nIn my very last example --\n\n00:18:46.951 --> 00:18:50.927\nI do a lot of my work\nusing speech recognition software.\n\n00:18:50.951 --> 00:18:53.181\nAnd I'll just --\nyou have to be kind of quiet\n\n00:18:53.205 --> 00:18:54.808\nbecause the software is nervous.\n\n00:18:55.482 --> 00:18:57.562\nSpeech recognition\nsoftware is really great\n\n00:18:57.586 --> 00:19:00.116\nfor doing emails very quickly; period.\n\n00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.779\nLike, I get hundreds of them\na day; period.\n\n00:19:02.803 --> 00:19:06.094\nAnd it's not just what I dictate\nthat it writes down; period.\n\n00:19:06.118 --> 00:19:09.308\nI also use this feature\ncalled voice macros; period.\n\n00:19:10.878 --> 00:19:12.060\nCorrect \"dissuade.\"\n\n00:19:15.957 --> 00:19:17.111\nNot \"just.\"\n\n00:19:19.206 --> 00:19:20.888\nOk, this is not an ideal situation,\n\n00:19:20.912 --> 00:19:23.451\nbecause it's getting the echo\nfrom the hall and stuff.\n\n00:19:23.475 --> 00:19:27.711\nThe point is, I can respond to people\nvery quickly by saying a short word,\n\n00:19:27.735 --> 00:19:29.807\nand having it write out\na much longer thing.\n\n00:19:29.831 --> 00:19:32.197\nSo if somebody\nsends me a fan letter, I'll say,\n\n00:19:32.221 --> 00:19:33.378\n\"Thanks for that.\"\n\n00:19:33.402 --> 00:19:35.909\n[Thank you so much\nfor taking the time to write ...]\n\n00:19:35.933 --> 00:19:36.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:39.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:44.396\nAnd conversely, if somebody\nsends me hate mail --\n\n00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.722\nwhich happens daily --\n\n00:19:46.746 --> 00:19:48.798\nI say, \"Piss off.\"\n\n00:19:51.466 --> 00:19:52.783\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:52.807 --> 00:19:55.279\n[I admire your frankness ...]\n\n00:19:55.303 --> 00:19:56.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:56.958 --> 00:20:02.311\n(Applause)\n\n00:20:02.335 --> 00:20:04.934\nSo that's my dirty little secret.\nDon't tell anyone.\n\n00:20:04.958 --> 00:20:06.073\n(Laughter)\n\n00:20:06.097 --> 00:20:08.934\nSo the point is --\nthis is a really interesting story.\n\n00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:10.836\nThis is version eight of this software,\n\n00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.058\nand do you know what they put\nin version eight?\n\n00:20:13.082 --> 00:20:16.144\nNo new features. It's never\nhappened before in software!\n\n00:20:16.168 --> 00:20:17.899\nThe company put no new features.\n\n00:20:17.923 --> 00:20:21.538\nThey just said, \"We'll make\nthis software work right.\" Right?\n\n00:20:21.562 --> 00:20:24.778\nBecause for years, people had bought\nthis software, tried it out --\n\n00:20:24.802 --> 00:20:26.603\n95 percent accuracy was all they got,\n\n00:20:26.627 --> 00:20:28.523\nwhich means one in 20 words is wrong --\n\n00:20:28.547 --> 00:20:30.174\nand they'd put it in their drawer.\n\n00:20:30.198 --> 00:20:31.778\nAnd the company got sick of that,\n\n00:20:31.802 --> 00:20:34.638\nso they said, \"This version,\nwe're not going to do anything,\n\n00:20:34.662 --> 00:20:36.395\nbut make sure it's darned accurate.\"\n\n00:20:36.419 --> 00:20:37.768\nAnd so that's what they did.\n\n00:20:37.792 --> 00:20:40.380\nThis cult of doing things right\nis starting to spread.\n\n00:20:40.404 --> 00:20:43.900\nSo, my final advice for those of you\nwho are consumers of this technology:\n\n00:20:43.924 --> 00:20:47.934\nremember, if it doesn't work,\nit's not necessarily you, ok?\n\n00:20:47.958 --> 00:20:50.292\nIt could be the design\nof the thing you're using.\n\n00:20:50.316 --> 00:20:53.104\nBe aware in life\nof good design and bad design.\n\n00:20:53.128 --> 00:20:55.995\nAnd if you're among the people\nwho create this stuff:\n\n00:20:56.019 --> 00:20:57.338\nEasy is hard.\n\n00:20:57.362 --> 00:20:59.696\nPre-sweat the details for your audience.\n\n00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.934\nCount the taps.\n\n00:21:00.958 --> 00:21:03.901\nRemember, the hard part\nis not deciding what features to add,\n\n00:21:03.925 --> 00:21:05.694\nit's deciding what to leave out.\n\n00:21:05.718 --> 00:21:08.915\nAnd best of all, your motivation is:\nsimplicity sells.\n\n00:21:09.569 --> 00:21:11.236\nCA: Bravo.

However, when we're not at TED, we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible, especially in large urban areas like New York City. And that's because most people with decision-making powers, in both the public and the private sector, really don't feel as though they're in danger.The reason why I'm here today, in part, is because of a dog \u2014 an abandoned puppy I found back in the rain, back in 1998. She turned out to be a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated. When she came into my life, we were fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront despite the fact that our small part of New York City already handled more than 40 percent of the entire city's commercial waste: a sewage treatment pelletizing plant, a sewage sludge plant, four power plants, the world's largest food-distribution center, as well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week. The area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city.So when I was contacted by the Parks Department about a $10,000 seed-grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects, I thought they were really well-meaning, but a bit naive. I'd lived in this area all my life, and you could not get to the river, because of all the lovely facilities that I mentioned earlier. Then, while jogging with my dog one morning, she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump. There were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here, but she kept dragging me, and lo and behold, at the end of that lot was the river. I knew that this forgotten little street-end, abandoned like the dog that brought me there, was worth saving. And I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalization of the new South Bronx.And just like my new dog, it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined. We garnered much support along the way, and the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had had in more than 60 years. We leveraged that $10,000 seed grant more than 300 times, into a $3 million park.And in the fall, I'm going to exchange marriage vows with my beloved.(Audience whistles)Thank you very much.(Applause)That's him pressing my buttons back there, which he does all the time.(Laughter)(Applause)But those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mine. We feel the problems right now, and have for some time. Environmental justice, for those of you who may not be familiar with the term, goes something like this: no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other.Unfortunately, race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff, like parks and trees, and where one might find the bad stuff, like power plants and waste facilities. As a black person in America, I am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health. I am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility, which I do. These land-use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity, diabetes and asthma. Why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood? Our 27 percent obesity rate is high even for this country, and diabetes comes with it. One out of four South Bronx children has asthma. Our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national average. These impacts are coming everyone's way. And we all pay dearly for solid waste costs, health problems associated with pollution and more odiously, the cost of imprisoning our young black and Latino men, who possess untold amounts of untapped potential. Fifty percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line; 25 percent of us are unemployed. Low-income citizens often use emergency-room visits as primary care. This comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits. Poor people are not only still poor, they are still unhealthy.Fortunately, there are many people like me who are striving for solutions that won't compromise the lives of low-income communities of color in the short term, and won't destroy us all in the long term. None of us want that, and we all have that in common. So what else do we have in common?Well, first of all, we're all incredibly good-looking.(Laughter)Graduated high school, college, post-graduate degrees, traveled to interesting places, didn't have kids in your early teens, financially stable, never been imprisoned. OK. Good.(Laughter)But, besides being a black woman, I am different from most of you in some other ways. I watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down. My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam, only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home. Jesus. I grew up with a crack house across the street. Yeah, I'm a poor black child from the ghetto. These things make me different from you. But the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my community, and I am in between these two worlds with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other.So how did things get so different for us? In the late '40s, my dad \u2014 a Pullman porter, son of a slave \u2014 bought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx, and a few years later, he married my mom. At the time, the community was a mostly white, working-class neighborhood. My dad was not alone. And as others like him pursued their own version of the American dream, white flight became common in the South Bronx and in many cities around the country. Red-lining was used by banks, wherein certain sections of the city, including ours, were deemed off-limits to any sort of investment. Many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions \u2014 dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding.Hunts Point was formerly a walk-to-work community, but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to. A national highway construction boom was added to our problems. In New York State, Robert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway-expansion campaign. One of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan. The South Bronx, which lies in between, did not stand a chance. Residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed. 600,000 people were displaced. The common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx. And if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community, that it's bad and ugly, how could it not reflect on you? So now, my family's property was worthless, save for that it was our home, and all we had. And luckily for me, that home and the love inside of it, along with help from teachers, mentors and friends along the way, was enough.Now, why is this story important? Because from a planning perspective, economic degradation begets environmental degradation, which begets social degradation. The disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come. Antiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood. Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided? What costs are associated with these decisions? And who pays? Who profits? Does anything justify what the local community goes through? This was \"planning\" \u2014 in quotes \u2014 that did not have our best interests in mind.Once we realized that, we decided it was time to do our own planning. That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building a Greenway movement in the South Bronx. I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on-street bike paths. Physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety, the placement of the waste and other facilities, which, if done properly, don't compromise a community's quality of life. They provide opportunities to be more physically active, as well as local economic development. Think bike shops, juice stands. We secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects. This is Lafayette Avenue \u2014 and that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects. And once this path is constructed, it'll connect the South Bronx with more than 400 acres of Randall's Island Park. Right now we're separated by about 25 feet of water, but this link will change that.As we nurture the natural environment, its abundance will give us back even more. We run a project called the Bronx [Environmental] Stewardship Training, which provides job training in the fields of ecological restoration, so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well-paying jobs. Little by little, we're seeding the area with green-collar jobs \u2014 and with people that have both a financial and personal stake in their environment. The Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era, built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it. Even during rush hour, it goes virtually unused. The community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway. We have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to re-envision how this 28 acres can be better utilized for parkland, affordable housing and local economic development.We also built New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices. Cool roofs are highly-reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat, and pass it on to the building or atmosphere. Green roofs are soil and living plants. Both can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat, contribute to urban \"heat island\" effect and degrade under the sun, which we in turn breathe. Green roofs also retain up to 75 percent of rainfall, so they reduce a city's need to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions \u2014 which, incidentally, are often located in environmental justice communities like mine. And they provide habitats for our little friends![Butterfly](Laughter)So cool!Anyway, the demonstration project is a springboard for our own green roof installation business, bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx.[Green is the new black ...](Laughter) (Applause)I like that, too.Anyway, I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here, but since I have all of your attention: We need investors. End of pitch. It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission. Anyway \u2014(Laughter)(Applause)OK. Katrina.Prior to Katrina, the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward had a lot in common. Both were largely populated by poor people of color, both hotbeds of cultural innovation: think hip-hop and jazz. Both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another. In the post-Katrina era, we have still more in common. We're at best ignored, and maligned and abused, at worst, by negligent regulatory agencies, pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability. Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable. But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out. We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone. Now will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two, like the South Bronx did? Or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation in communities like mine?Now listen, I do not expect individuals, corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral. This presentation today only represents some of what I've been through. Like a tiny little bit. You've no clue. But I'll tell you later, if you want to know.(Laughter)But \u2014 I know it's the bottom line, or one's perception of it, that motivates people in the end. I'm interested in what I like to call the \"triple bottom line\" that sustainable development can produce. Developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned: the developers, government and the community where these projects go up.At present, that's not happening in New York City. And we are operating with a comprehensive urban-planning deficit. A parade of government subsidies is going to propose big-box and stadium developments in the South Bronx, but there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic, pollution, solid waste and the impacts on open space. And their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it's not even funny. Because on top of that, the world's richest sports team is replacing the House That Ruth Built by destroying two well-loved community parks. Now, we'll have even less than that stat I told you about earlier. And although less than 25 percent of South Bronx residents own cars, these projects include thousands of new parking spaces, yet zip in terms of mass public transit. Now, what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy, environmentally-challenged community, versus incorporating structural, sustainable changes. My agency is working closely with Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues.Now let's get this straight: I am not anti-development. Ours is a city, not a wilderness preserve. And I've embraced my inner capitalist. And, but I don't have \u2014(Laughter)You probably all have, and if you haven't, you need to.(Laughter)So I don't have a problem with developers making money. There's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable, community-friendly development can still make a fortune. Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins \u2014 both heroes of mine by the way \u2014 have shown that you can actually do that. I do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit. That it continues is a shame upon us all, because we are all responsible for the future that we create. But one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities, is to learn from visionaries in other cities. This is my version of globalization.Let's take Bogota. Poor, Latino, surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking; a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx. However, this city was blessed in the late 1990s with a highly-influential mayor named Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa. He looked at the demographics. Few Bogotanos own cars, yet a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving them. If you're a mayor, you can do something about that. His administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three, outlawed parking on those streets, expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes, created public plazas, created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world. For his brilliant efforts, he was nearly impeached. But as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day-to-day lives, incredible things happened. People stopped littering. Crime rates dropped, because the streets were alive with people. His administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time, and on a third-world budget, at that. We have no excuse in this country, I'm sorry. But the bottom line is: their people-first agenda was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars, but rather, to provide opportunities for all Bogotanos to participate in the city's resurgence. That development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the U.S. But Bogota's example has the power to change that.You, however, are blessed with the gift of influence. That's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange. Use your influence in support of comprehensive, sustainable change everywhere. Don't just talk about it at TED. This is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build, and as you all know, politics are personal. Help me make green the new black. Help me make sustainability sexy. Make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations. Help me fight for environmental and economic justice. Support investments with a triple-bottom-line return. Help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table, and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere. Oh good, glad I have a little more time!Listen \u2014 when I spoke to Mr. Gore the other day after breakfast, I asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included in his new marketing strategy. His response was a grant program. I don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for funding. I was making him an offer.(Applause)What troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around. Now, don't get me wrong, we need money.(Laughter)But grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision-making process. Of the 90 percent of the energy that Mr. Gore reminded us that we waste every day, don't add wasting our energy, intelligence and hard-earned experience to that count.(Applause)I have come from so far to meet you like this. Please don't waste me. By working together, we can become one of those small, rapidly-growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world. We might have come to this conference from very, very different stations in life, but believe me, we all share one incredibly powerful thing. We have nothing to lose and everything to gain.Ciao, bellos!(Applause)", "id": 53, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:14.364\nIf you're

00:01:23.361\nSo when I was contacted\nby the Parks Department\n\n00:01:23.385 --> 00:01:27.543\nabout a $10,000 seed-grant initiative\nto help develop waterfront projects,\n\n00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:30.481\nI thought they were really\nwell-meaning, but a bit naive.\n\n00:01:30.505 --> 00:01:34.172\nI'd lived in this area all my life,\nand you could not get to the river,\n\n00:01:34.196 --> 00:01:37.489\nbecause of all the lovely facilities\nthat I mentioned earlier.\n\n00:01:37.513 --> 00:01:39.773\nThen, while jogging\nwith my dog one morning,\n\n00:01:39.797 --> 00:01:42.908\nshe pulled me into what I thought\nwas just another illegal dump.\n\n00:01:43.564 --> 00:01:47.341\nThere were weeds and piles of garbage\nand other stuff that I won't mention here,\n\n00:01:47.365 -->

than I'd imagined.\n\n00:02:06.283 --> 00:02:08.418\nWe garnered much support along the way,\n\n00:02:08.442 --> 00:02:11.602\nand the Hunts Point Riverside Park\nbecame the first waterfront

00:05:14.796\nBut the things we have in common\n\n00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.559\nset me apart from most\nof the people in my community,\n\n00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:19.409\nand I am in between these two

00:05:28.636\nIn the late '40s, my dad --\na Pullman porter, son of a slave --\n\n00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.527\nbought a house in the Hunts Point\nsection of the South Bronx,\n\n00:05:31.551 --> 00:05:33.566\nand a few years later, he married my mom.\n\n00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.071\nAt the time, the community was a mostly\nwhite, working-class neighborhood.\n\n00:05:37.095 --> 00:05:38.621\nMy dad was not alone.\n\n00:05:38.645 --> 00:05:42.082\nAnd as others like him pursued\ntheir own version of the American dream,\n\n00:05:42.106 --> 00:05:44.635\nwhite flight became common\nin the South Bronx\n\n00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:46.659\nand in many cities around the country.\n\n00:05:46.976 --> 00:05:50.609\nRed-lining was used by banks,\nwherein certain sections of the city,\n\n00:05:50.633 --> 00:05:54.622\nincluding ours, were deemed\noff-limits to any sort of investment.\n\n00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:58.114\nMany landlords believed it was more\nprofitable to torch their buildings\n\n00:05:58.138 --> 00:06:02.309\nand collect insurance money rather\nthan to sell under those conditions --\n\n00:06:02.333 --> 00:06:04.773\ndead or injured former tenants\nnotwithstanding.\n\n00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:07.639\nHunts Point was formerly\na walk-to-work community,\n\n00:06:07.663 --> 00:06:11.589\nbut now residents had neither\nwork nor home to walk to.\n\n00:06:11.613 --> 00:06:14.799\nA national highway construction boom\nwas added to our problems.\n\n00:06:14.823 --> 00:06:15.974\nIn New York State,\n\n00:06:15.998 --> 00:06:19.781\nRobert Moses spearheaded\nan aggressive highway-expansion campaign.\n\n00:06:19.805 --> 00:06:22.001\nOne of its primary goals was\nto make it easier\n\n00:06:22.025 --> 00:06:27.050\nfor residents of wealthy communities\nin Westchester County to go to Manhattan.\n\n00:06:27.074 --> 00:06:30.149\nThe South Bronx, which lies in between,\ndid not stand a chance.\n\n00:06:30.173 --> 00:06:32.723\nResidents were often given\nless than a month's notice\n\n00:06:32.747 --> 00:06:34.377\nbefore their buildings were razed.\n\n00:06:34.401 --> 00:06:36.725\n600,000 people were displaced.\n\n00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:38.059\nThe common perception was\n\n00:06:38.083 --> 00:06:41.934\nthat only pimps and pushers\nand prostitutes were from the South Bronx.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.888\nAnd if you are told\nfrom your earliest days\n\n00:06:44.912 --> 00:06:47.529\nthat nothing good is going to come\nfrom your community,\n\n00:06:47.553 --> 00:06:48.704\nthat it's bad and ugly,\n\n00:06:48.728 --> 00:06:50.818\nhow could it not reflect on you?\n\n00:06:51.293 --> 00:06:53.811\nSo now, my family's property\nwas worthless,\n\n00:06:53.835 --> 00:06:56.477\nsave for that it was our home,\nand all we had.\n\n00:06:56.501 --> 00:07:00.227\nAnd luckily for me, that home\nand the love inside of it,\n\n00:07:00.251 --> 00:07:05.393\nalong with help from teachers, mentors\nand friends along the way, was enough.\n\n00:07:05.417 --> 00:07:07.106\nNow, why is this story important?\n\n00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.940\nBecause from a planning perspective,\n\n00:07:08.964 --> 00:07:12.681\neconomic degradation\nbegets environmental degradation,\n\n00:07:12.705 --> 00:07:15.221\nwhich begets social degradation.\n\n00:07:15.245 --> 00:07:18.308\nThe disinvestment that began\nin the 1960s set the stage\n\n00:07:18.332 --> 00:07:20.934\nfor all the environmental\ninjustices that were to come.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.934\nAntiquated zoning and land-use\nregulations are still used to this day\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.001\nto continue putting polluting\nfacilities in my neighborhood.\n\n00:07:28.025 --> 00:07:31.803\nAre these factors taken into consideration\nwhen land-use policy is decided?\n\n00:07:31.827 --> 00:07:34.423\nWhat costs are associated\nwith these decisions?\n\n00:07:34.447 --> 00:07:36.683\nAnd who pays? Who profits?\n\n00:07:36.707 --> 00:07:40.326\nDoes anything justify\nwhat the local community goes through?\n\n00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.644\nThis was \"planning\" -- in quotes --\n\n00:07:42.668 --> 00:07:44.936\nthat did not have\nour best interests in mind.\n\n00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.375\nOnce we realized that, we decided\nit was time to do our own planning.\n\n00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:50.343\nThat small park I told you about earlier\n\n00:07:50.367 --> 00:07:53.645\nwas the first stage of building\na Greenway movement in the South Bronx.\n\n00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:57.021\nI wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million\ndollar federal transportation grant\n\n00:07:57.045 --> 00:07:59.153\nto design the plan\nfor a waterfront esplanade\n\n00:07:59.177 --> 00:08:00.907\nwith dedicated on-street bike paths.\n\n00:08:00.931 --> 00:08:04.389\nPhysical improvements help inform\npublic policy regarding traffic safety,\n\n00:08:04.413 --> 00:08:06.658\nthe placement of the waste\nand other facilities,\n\n00:08:06.682 --> 00:08:10.154\nwhich, if done properly, don't compromise\na community's quality of life.\n\n00:08:10.178 --> 00:08:12.892\nThey provide opportunities\nto be more physically active,\n\n00:08:12.916 --> 00:08:15.349\nas well as local economic development.\n\n00:08:15.373 --> 00:08:16.945\nThink bike shops, juice stands.\n\n00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:19.840\nWe secured 20 million dollars\nto build first-phase projects.\n\n00:08:19.864 --> 00:08:21.738\nThis is Lafayette Avenue --\n\n00:08:21.762 --> 00:08:24.919\nand that's redesigned\nby Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects.\n\n00:08:24.943 --> 00:08:27.964\nAnd once this path is constructed,\nit'll connect the South Bronx\n\n00:08:27.988 --> 00:08:30.337\nwith more than 400 acres\nof Randall's Island Park.\n\n00:08:30.361 --> 00:08:34.335\nRight now we're separated by about 25 feet\nof water, but this link will change that.\n\n00:08:34.359 --> 00:08:38.623\nAs we nurture the natural environment,\nits abundance will give us back even more.\n\n00:08:38.647 --> 00:08:42.458\nWe run a project called the Bronx\n[Environmental] Stewardship Training,\n\n00:08:42.482 --> 00:08:45.789\nwhich provides job training in the fields\nof ecological restoration,\n\n00:08:45.813 --> 00:08:48.614\nso that folks from our community\nhave the skills to compete\n\n00:08:48.638 --> 00:08:49.977\nfor these well-paying jobs.\n\n00:08:50.001 --> 00:08:53.338\nLittle by little, we're seeding\nthe area with green-collar jobs --\n\n00:08:53.362 --> 00:08:56.221\nand with people that have both\na financial and personal stake\n\n00:08:56.245 --> 00:08:57.402\nin their environment.\n\n00:08:57.426 --> 00:09:00.069\nThe Sheridan Expressway\nis an underutilized relic\n\n00:09:00.093 --> 00:09:01.292\nof the Robert Moses era,\n\n00:09:01.316 --> 00:09:04.692\nbuilt with no regard for the neighborhoods\nthat were divided by it.\n\n00:09:04.716 --> 00:09:07.485\nEven during rush hour,\nit goes virtually unused.\n\n00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:10.181\nThe community created\nan alternative transportation plan\n\n00:09:10.205 --> 00:09:12.831\nthat allows for the removal\nof the highway.\n\n00:09:12.855 --> 00:09:15.978\nWe have the opportunity now to bring\ntogether all the stakeholders\n\n00:09:16.002 --> 00:09:18.590\nto re-envision how this 28 acres\ncan be better utilized\n\n00:09:18.614 --> 00:09:21.656\nfor parkland, affordable housing\nand local economic development.\n\n00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.507\nWe also built New York City's first green\nand cool roof demonstration project\n\n00:09:26.531 --> 00:09:27.919\non top of our offices.\n\n00:09:27.943 --> 00:09:31.408\nCool roofs are highly-reflective\nsurfaces that don't absorb solar heat,\n\n00:09:31.432 --> 00:09:33.535\nand pass it on to\nthe building or atmosphere.\n\n00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:35.591\nGreen roofs are soil and living plants.\n\n00:09:35.615 --> 00:09:38.862\nBoth can be used instead\nof petroleum-based roofing materials\n\n00:09:38.886 --> 00:09:41.657\nthat absorb heat, contribute\nto urban \"heat island\" effect\n\n00:09:41.681 --> 00:09:43.006\nand degrade under the sun,\n\n00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.252\nwhich we in turn breathe.\n\n00:09:44.276 --> 00:09:46.934\nGreen roofs also retain\nup to 75 percent of rainfall,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.617\nso they reduce a city's need to fund\ncostly end-of-pipe solutions --\n\n00:09:50.641 --> 00:09:52.461\nwhich, incidentally, are often located\n\n00:09:52.485 --> 00:09:54.706\nin environmental justice\ncommunities like mine.\n\n00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.030\nAnd they provide habitats\nfor our little friends!\n\n00:09:58.054 --> 00:09:59.211\n[Butterfly]\n\n00:09:59.235 --> 00:10:00.458\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:00.482 --> 00:10:01.665\nSo cool!\n\n00:10:01.689 --> 00:10:04.195\nAnyway, the demonstration\nproject is a springboard\n\n00:10:04.219 --> 00:10:06.343\nfor our own green roof\ninstallation business,\n\n00:10:06.367 --> 00:10:09.869\nbringing jobs and sustainable\neconomic activity to the South Bronx.\n\n00:10:09.893 --> 00:10:11.269\n[Green is the new black ...]\n\n00:10:11.293 --> 00:10:15.436\n(Laughter) (Applause)\n\n00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.111\nI like that, too.\n\n00:10:17.135 --> 00:10:20.831\nAnyway, I know Chris told us\nnot to do pitches up here,\n\n00:10:20.855 --> 00:10:22.735\nbut since I have all of your attention:\n\n00:10:22.759 --> 00:10:24.346\nWe need investors. End of pitch.\n\n00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.758\nIt's better to ask\nfor forgiveness than permission.\n\n00:10:26.782 --> 00:10:27.938\nAnyway --\n\n00:10:27.962 --> 00:10:29.422\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:29.446 --> 00:10:34.365\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:36.652\nOK. Katrina.\n\n00:10:37.842 --> 00:10:40.866\nPrior to Katrina, the South Bronx\nand New Orleans' Ninth Ward\n\n00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.079\nhad a lot in common.\n\n00:10:42.103 --> 00:10:44.857\nBoth were largely populated\nby poor people of color,\n\n00:10:44.881 --> 00:10:48.176\nboth hotbeds of cultural innovation:\nthink hip-hop and jazz.\n\n00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.534\nBoth are waterfront communities\nthat host both industries and residents\n\n00:10:51.558 --> 00:10:53.444\nin close proximity of one another.\n\n00:10:53.468 --> 00:10:56.516\nIn the post-Katrina era,\nwe have still more in common.\n\n00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.018\nWe're at best ignored,\nand maligned and abused, at worst,\n\n00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:03.389\nby negligent regulatory agencies,\npernicious zoning\n\n00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:05.586\nand lax governmental accountability.\n\n00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:10.038\nNeither the destruction of the Ninth Ward\nnor the South Bronx was inevitable.\n\n00:11:10.062 --> 00:11:12.198\nBut we have emerged with valuable lessons\n\n00:11:12.222 --> 00:11:14.495\nabout how to dig ourselves out.\n\n00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:18.321\nWe are more than simply\nnational symbols of urban blight\n\n00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:21.651\nor problems to be solved\nby empty campaign promises\n\n00:11:21.675 --> 00:11:23.285\nof presidents come and gone.\n\n00:11:23.309 --> 00:11:26.128\nNow will we let the Gulf Coast\nlanguish for a decade or two,\n\n00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:27.414\nlike the South Bronx did?\n\n00:11:27.438 --> 00:11:28.922\nOr will we take proactive steps\n\n00:11:28.946 --> 00:11:31.883\nand learn from the homegrown resource\nof grassroots activists\n\n00:11:31.907 --> 00:11:34.753\nthat have been born of desperation\nin communities like mine?\n\n00:11:34.777 --> 00:11:37.420\nNow listen, I do not expect individuals,\n\n00:11:37.444 --> 00:11:40.229\ncorporations or government\nto make the world a better place\n\n00:11:40.253 --> 00:11:42.077\nbecause it is right or moral.\n\n00:11:42.554 --> 00:11:46.834\nThis presentation today only represents\nsome of what I've been through.\n\n00:11:46.858 --> 00:11:48.934\nLike a tiny little bit. You've no clue.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.054\nBut I'll tell you later,\nif you want to know.\n\n00:11:51.078 --> 00:11:52.143\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:52.167 --> 00:11:56.457\nBut -- I know it's the bottom line,\nor one's perception of it,\n\n00:11:56.481 --> 00:11:58.217\nthat motivates people in the end.\n\n00:11:58.241 --> 00:12:01.163\nI'm interested in what I like to call\nthe \"triple bottom line\"\n\n00:12:01.187 --> 00:12:03.411\nthat sustainable development can produce.\n\n00:12:03.435 --> 00:12:07.357\nDevelopments that have the potential\nto create positive returns\n\n00:12:07.381 --> 00:12:10.483\nfor all concerned:\nthe developers, government\n\n00:12:10.507 --> 00:12:12.943\nand the community\nwhere these projects go up.\n\n00:12:12.967 --> 00:12:15.507\nAt present, that's not happening\nin New York City.\n\n00:12:16.269 --> 00:12:19.934\nAnd we are operating with a comprehensive\nurban-planning deficit.\n\n00:12:20.316 --> 00:12:22.411\nA parade of government subsidies\n\n00:12:22.435 --> 00:12:25.987\nis going to propose big-box and stadium\ndevelopments in the South Bronx,\n\n00:12:26.011 --> 00:12:29.094\nbut there is scant coordination\nbetween city agencies\n\n00:12:29.118 --> 00:12:32.868\non how to deal with the cumulative effects\nof increased traffic, pollution,\n\n00:12:32.892 --> 00:12:35.417\nsolid waste and the impacts on open space.\n\n00:12:35.441 --> 00:12:39.821\nAnd their approaches to local economic\nand job development are so lame\n\n00:12:39.845 --> 00:12:41.016\nit's not even funny.\n\n00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.239\nBecause on top of that,\n\n00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:47.686\nthe world's richest sports team\nis replacing the House That Ruth Built\n\n00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:50.527\nby destroying two\nwell-loved community parks.\n\n00:12:50.551 --> 00:12:53.662\nNow, we'll have even less\nthan that stat I told you about earlier.\n\n00:12:53.686 --> 00:12:57.004\nAnd although less than 25 percent\nof South Bronx residents own cars,\n\n00:12:57.028 --> 00:13:00.702\nthese projects include\nthousands of new parking spaces,\n\n00:13:00.726 --> 00:13:03.980\nyet zip in terms of mass public transit.\n\n00:13:04.004 --> 00:13:06.036\nNow, what's missing from the larger debate\n\n00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.989\nis a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis\n\n00:13:08.013 --> 00:13:11.412\nbetween not fixing an unhealthy,\nenvironmentally-challenged community,\n\n00:13:11.436 --> 00:13:15.043\nversus incorporating structural,\nsustainable changes.\n\n00:13:15.067 --> 00:13:18.298\nMy agency is working closely\nwith Columbia University and others\n\n00:13:18.322 --> 00:13:19.908\nto shine a light on these issues.\n\n00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:23.131\nNow let's get this straight:\nI am not anti-development.\n\n00:13:23.155 --> 00:13:25.563\nOurs is a city, not a wilderness preserve.\n\n00:13:25.587 --> 00:13:28.626\nAnd I've embraced my inner capitalist.\n\n00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.127\nAnd, but I don't have --\n\n00:13:30.151 --> 00:13:31.776\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.396\nYou probably all have,\nand if you haven't, you need to.\n\n00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:38.190\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:38.214 --> 00:13:41.630\nSo I don't have a problem\nwith developers making money.\n\n00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:44.604\nThere's enough precedent out there\nto show that a sustainable,\n\n00:13:44.628 --> 00:13:49.019\ncommunity-friendly development\ncan still make a fortune.\n\n00:13:49.043 --> 00:13:52.115\nFellow TEDsters Bill McDonough\nand Amory Lovins --\n\n00:13:52.139 --> 00:13:56.108\nboth heroes of mine by the way --\nhave shown that you can actually do that.\n\n00:13:56.132 --> 00:13:58.934\nI do have a problem\nwith developments that hyper-exploit\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.125\npolitically vulnerable\ncommunities for profit.\n\n00:14:01.149 --> 00:14:03.997\nThat it continues is a shame upon us all,\n\n00:14:04.021 --> 00:14:06.962\nbecause we are all responsible\nfor the future that we create.\n\n00:14:06.986 --> 00:14:10.233\nBut one of the things I do\nto remind myself of greater possibilities,\n\n00:14:10.257 --> 00:14:12.391\nis to learn from visionaries\nin other cities.\n\n00:14:12.415 --> 00:14:14.447\nThis is my version of globalization.\n\n00:14:14.471 --> 00:14:16.004\nLet's take Bogota.\n\n00:14:16.028 --> 00:14:19.821\nPoor, Latino, surrounded by\nrunaway gun violence and drug trafficking;\n\n00:14:19.845 --> 00:14:22.683\na reputation not unlike\nthat of the South Bronx.\n\n00:14:22.707 --> 00:14:25.934\nHowever, this city was blessed\nin the late 1990s\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:29.982\nwith a highly-influential\nmayor named Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa.\n\n00:14:30.006 --> 00:14:31.787\nHe looked at the demographics.\n\n00:14:31.811 --> 00:14:33.542\nFew Bogotanos own cars,\n\n00:14:33.566 --> 00:14:37.604\nyet a huge portion of the

00:15:24.390\nBut the bottom line is:\ntheir people-first agenda\n\n00:15:24.414 --> 00:15:28.328\nwas not meant to penalize\nthose who could actually afford cars,\n\n00:15:28.352 --> 00:15:32.217\nbut rather, to provide opportunities\nfor all Bogotanos to participate\n\n00:15:32.241 --> 00:15:33.863\nin the city's resurgence.\n\n00:15:33.887 --> 00:15:36.047\nThat development

table,\n\n00:16:24.522 --> 00:16:27.871\nand insisting that comprehensive\nplanning can be addressed everywhere.\n\n00:16:27.895 --> 00:16:29.803\nOh good, glad I have a little more

understood\nthat I wasn't asking for funding.\n\n00:16:50.694 --> 00:16:52.466\nI was making him an offer.\n\n00:16:54.191 --> 00:17:00.703\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:01.941 --> 00:17:06.305\nWhat troubled me was that this\ntop-down approach is still around.\n\n00:17:07.218 --> 00:17:09.108\nNow, don't get me wrong, we need money.\n\n00:17:09.132 --> 00:17:10.544\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:10.568 -->

10 years ago, I took on the task to teach global development to Swedish undergraduate students. That was after having spent about 20 years together with African institutions studying hunger in Africa, so I was sort of expected to know a little about the world. And I started in our medical university, Karolinska Institute, an undergraduate course called Global Health. But when you get that opportunity, you get a little nervous. I thought, these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in Swedish college systems \u2014 so I thought, maybe they know everything I'm going to teach them about. So I did a pre-test when they came. And one of the questions from which I learned a lot was this one: \"Which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs?\"I put them together, so that in each pair of country, one has twice the child mortality of the other. And this means that it's much bigger a difference than the uncertainty of the data. I won't put you at a test here, but it's Turkey, which is highest there, Poland, Russia, Pakistan and South Africa. And these were the results of the Swedish students. I did it so I got the confidence interval, which is pretty narrow, and I got happy, of course: a 1.8 right answer out of five possible. That means that there was a place for a professor of international health and for my course.(Laughter)But one late night, when I was compiling the report, I really realized my discovery. I have shown that Swedish top students know statistically significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees.(Laughter)Because the chimpanzee would score half right if I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey. They would be right half of the cases. But the students are not there. The problem for me was not ignorance; it was preconceived ideas.I did also an unethical study of the professors of the Karolinska Institute, that hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine, and they are on par with the chimpanzee there.(Laughter)This is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate, because the data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware.We did this software which displays it like this: every bubble here is a country. This country over here is China. This is India. The size of the bubble is the population, and on this axis here, I put fertility rate. Because my students, what they said when they looked upon the world, and I asked them, \"What do you really think about the world?\" Well, I first discovered that the textbook was Tintin, mainly.(Laughter)And they said, \"The world is still 'we' and 'them.' And 'we' is Western world and 'them' is Third World.\" \"And what do you mean with Western world?\" I said. \"Well, that's long life and small family, and Third World is short life and large family.\"So this is what I could display here. I put fertility rate here: number of children per woman: one, two, three, four, up to about eight children per woman. We have very good data since 1962 \u2014 1960 about \u2014 on the size of families in all countries. The error margin is narrow. Here, I put life expectancy at birth, from 30 years in some countries up to about 70 years. And 1962, there was really a group of countries here that was industrialized countries, and they had small families and long lives. And these were the developing countries: they had large families and they had relatively short lives. Now, what has happened since 1962? We want to see the change. Are the students right? Is it still two types of countries? Or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here? Or have they got longer lives and live up there?Let's see. We stopped the world then. This is all U.N. statistics that have been available. Here we go. Can you see there? It's China there, moving against better health there, improving there. All the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families. Your yellow ones here are the Arabic countries, and they get longer life, but not larger families. The Africans are the green here. They still remain here. This is India; Indonesia is moving on pretty fast.(Laughter)In the '80s here, you have Bangladesh still among the African countries. But now, Bangladesh \u2014 it's a miracle that happens in the '80s: the imams start to promote family planning. They move up into that corner. And in the '90s, we have the terrible HIV epidemic that takes down the life expectancy of the African countries and all the rest of them move up into the corner, where we have long lives and small family, and we have a completely new world.(Applause)(Applause ends)Let me make a comparison directly between the United States of America and Vietnam. 1964. America had small families and long life; Vietnam had large families and short lives. And this is what happens: the data during the war indicate that even with all the death, there was an improvement of life expectancy. By the end of the year, the family planning started in Vietnam; they went for smaller families. And the United States up there is getting for longer life, keeping family size. And in the '80s now, they give up Communist planning and they go for market economy, and it moves faster even than social life. And today, we have in Vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size here in Vietnam, 2003, as in United States, 1974, by the end of the war. If we don't look in the data, I think we all underestimate the tremendous change in Asia, which was in social change before we saw the economical change.Let's move over to another way here in which we could display the distribution in the world of the income. This is the world distribution of income of people. One dollar, 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day. There's no gap between rich and poor any longer. This is a myth. There's a little hump here. But there are people all the way. And if we look where the income ends up, this is 100 percent the world's annual income. And the richest 20 percent, they take out of that about 74 percent. And the poorest 20 percent, they take about two percent. And this shows that the concept of developing countries is extremely doubtful. We think about aid, like these people here giving aid to these people here. But in the middle, we have most of the world population, and they have now 24 percent of the income.We heard it in other forms. And who are these? Where are the different countries? I can show you Africa. This is Africa. 10% the world population, most in poverty. This is OECD. The rich country. The country club of the U.N. And they are over here on this side. Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD. And this is Latin America. It has everything on this Earth, from the poorest to the richest in Latin America. And on top of that, we can put East Europe, we can put East Asia, and we put South Asia.And how did it look like if we go back in time, to about 1970? Then there was more of a hump. And we have most who lived in absolute poverty were Asians. The problem in the world was the poverty in Asia. And if I now let the world move forward, you will see that while population increases, there are hundreds of millions in Asia getting out of poverty and some others getting into poverty, and this is the pattern we have today. And the best projection from the World Bank is that this will happen, and we will not have a divided world. We'll have most people in the middle.Of course it's a logarithmic scale here, but our concept of economy is growth with percent. We look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase. If I change this, and take GDP per capita instead of family income, and I turn these individual data into regional data of gross domestic product, and I take the regions down here, the size of the bubble is still the population. And you have the OECD there, and you have sub-Saharan Africa there, and we take off the Arab states there, coming both from Africa and from Asia, and we put them separately, and we can expand this axis, and I can give it a new dimension here, by adding the social values there, child survival. Now I have money on that axis, and I have the possibility of children to survive there. In some countries, 99.7% of children survive to five years of age; others, only 70. And here, it seems, there is a gap between OECD, Latin America, East Europe, East Asia, Arab states, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The linearity is very strong between child survival and money.But let me split sub-Saharan Africa. Health is there and better health is up there. I can go here and I can split sub-Saharan Africa into its countries. And when it burst, the size of its country bubble is the size of the population. Sierra Leone down there. Mauritius is up there. Mauritius was the first country to get away with trade barriers, and they could sell their sugar \u2014 they could sell their textiles \u2014 on equal terms as the people in Europe and North America.There's a huge difference between Africa. And Ghana is here in the middle. In Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid. Here in Uganda, development aid. Here, time to invest; there, you can go for a holiday. It's a tremendous variation within Africa which we rarely often make \u2014 that it's equal everything. I can split South Asia here. India's the big bubble in the middle. But a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. I can split Arab states. How are they? Same climate, same culture, same religion \u2014 huge difference. Even between neighbors. Yemen, civil war. United Arab Emirates, money, which was quite equally and well used. Not as the myth is. And that includes all the children of the foreign workers who are in the country.Data is often better than you think. Many people say data is bad. There is an uncertainty margin, but we can see the difference here: Cambodia, Singapore. The differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data. East Europe: Soviet economy for a long time, but they come out after 10 years very, very differently. And there is Latin America. Today, we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America. Chile will have a lower child mortality than Cuba within some few years from now. Here, we have high-income countries in the OECD.And we get the whole pattern here of the world, which is more or less like this. And if we look at it, how the world looks, in 1960, it starts to move. This is Mao Tse-tung. He brought health to China. And then he died. And then Deng Xiaoping came and brought money to China, and brought them into the mainstream again. And we have seen how countries move in different directions like this, so it's sort of difficult to get an example country which shows the pattern of the world.But I would like to bring you back to about here, at 1960. I would like to compare South Korea, which is this one, with Brazil, which is this one. The label went away for me here. And I would like to compare Uganda, which is there. And I can run it forward, like this. And you can see how South Korea is making a very, very fast advancement, whereas Brazil is much slower.And if we move back again, here, and we put on trails on them, like this, you can see again that the speed of development is very, very different, and the countries are moving more or less in the same rate as money and health, but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first. And to show that, you can put on the way of United Arab Emirates. They came from here, a mineral country. They cached all the oil; they got all the money; but health cannot be bought at the supermarket. You have to invest in health. You have to get kids into schooling. You have to train health staff. You have to educate the population. And Sheikh Zayed did that in a fairly good way. In spite of falling oil prices, he brought this country up here. So we've got a much more mainstream appearance of the world, where all countries tend to use their money better than they used in the past.Now, this is, more or less, if you look at the average data of the countries \u2014 they are like this. Now that's dangerous, to use average data, because there is such a lot of difference within countries. So if I go and look here, we can see that Uganda today is where South Korea was in 1960. If I split Uganda, there's quite a difference within Uganda. These are the quintiles of Uganda. The richest 20 percent of Ugandans are there. The poorest are down there. If I split South Africa, it's like this. And if I go down and look at Niger, where there was such a terrible famine, lastly, it's like this. The 20 percent poorest of Niger is out here, and the 20 percent richest of South Africa is there, and yet we tend to discuss on what solutions there should be in Africa. Everything in this world exists in Africa. And you can't discuss universal access to HIV [medicine] for that quintile up here with the same strategy as down here. The improvement of the world must be highly contextualized, and it's not relevant to have it on regional level. We must be much more detailed. We find that students get very excited when they can use this.And even more, policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see how the world is changing. Now, why doesn't this take place? Why are we not using the data we have? We have data in the United Nations, in the national statistical agencies and in universities and other non-governmental organizations. Because the data is hidden down in the databases. And the public is there, and the Internet is there, but we have still not used it effectively.All that information we saw changing in the world does not include publicly-funded statistics. There are some web pages like this, you know, but they take some nourishment down from the databases, but people put prices on them, stupid passwords and boring statistics.(Laughter)And this won't work.(Applause)So what is needed? We have the databases. It's not the new database you need. We have wonderful design tools, and more and more are added up here. So we started a nonprofit venture which, linking data to design, we called Gapminder, from the London Underground, where they warn you, \"mind the gap.\" So we thought Gapminder was appropriate. And we started to write software which could link the data like this. And it wasn't that difficult. It took some person years, and we have produced animations. You can take a data set and put it there. We are liberating U.N. data, some few U.N. organization.Some countries accept that their databases can go out on the world, but what we really need is, of course, a search function. A search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world. And what do we hear when we go around? I've done anthropology on the main statistical units. Everyone says, \"It's impossible. This can't be done. Our information is so peculiar in detail, so that cannot be searched as others can be searched. We cannot give the data free to the students, free to the entrepreneurs of the world.\"But this is what we would like to see, isn't it? The publicly-funded data is down here. And we would like flowers to grow out on the Net. And one of the crucial points is to make them searchable, and then people can use the different design tool to animate it there. And I have pretty good news for you. I have good news that the present, new Head of U.N. Statistics, he doesn't say it's impossible. He only says, \"We can't do it.\"(Laughter)And that's a quite clever guy, huh?(Laughter)So we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years. We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways. This is the income distribution of China, 1970. This is the income distribution of the United States, 1970. Almost no overlap. And what has happened? What has happened is this: that China is growing, it's not so equal any longer, and it's appearing here, overlooking the United States. Almost like a ghost, isn't it?(Laughter)It's pretty scary.(Laughter)But I think it's very important to have all this information. We need really to see it. And instead of looking at this, I would like to end up by showing the Internet users per 1,000. In this software, we access about 500 variables from all the countries quite easily. It takes some time to change for this, but on the axises, you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have. And the thing would be to get up the databases free, to get them searchable, and with a second click, to get them into the graphic formats, where you can instantly understand them. Now, statisticians don't like it, because they say that this will not show the reality; we have to have statistical, analytical methods. But this is hypothesis-generating.I end now with the world. There, the Internet is coming. The number of Internet users are going up like this. This is the GDP per capita. And it's a new technology coming in, but then amazingly, how well it fits to the economy of the countries. That's why the $100 computer will be so important. But it's a nice tendency. It's as if the world is flattening off, isn't it? These countries are lifting more than the economy and will be very interesting to follow this over the year, as I would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded data.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 92, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.584 --> 00:00:16.939\nAbout 10 years ago, I took on the task\nto teach global

won't put you at a test here,\nbut it's Turkey,\n\n00:01:13.714 --> 00:01:17.934\nwhich is highest there, Poland,\nRussia, Pakistan and South Africa.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.614\nAnd these were the results\nof the Swedish students.\n\n00:01:20.638 --> 00:01:24.543\nI did it so I got the confidence interval,\nwhich is pretty narrow, and I got happy,\n\n00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:27.358\nof course: a 1.8 right answer\nout of five possible.\n\n00:01:27.382 --> 00:01:30.934\nThat means that there was a place\nfor a professor of international health\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.065\nand for my course.\n\n00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:33.207\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:36.934\nBut one late night,\nwhen I was compiling the report,\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.790\nI really realized my discovery.\n\n00:01:39.814 --> 00:01:42.921\nI have shown that Swedish top students\n\n00:01:42.945 --> 00:01:47.934\nknow statistically significantly less\nabout the world than the chimpanzees.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:53.188\nBecause the chimpanzee\nwould score half right\n\n00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:56.071\nif I gave them two bananas\nwith Sri Lanka and Turkey.\n\n00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:59.517\nThey would be right half of the cases.\nBut the students are not there.\n\n00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:03.756\nThe problem for me was not ignorance;\nit was preconceived ideas.\n\n00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.517\nI did also an unethical study\n\n00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:08.764\nof the professors\nof the Karolinska Institute,\n\n00:02:08.788 --> 00:02:11.149\nthat hands out\nthe Nobel Prize in Medicine,\n\n00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:13.364\nand they are on par\nwith the chimpanzee there.\n\n00:02:13.388 --> 00:02:16.412\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:20.619\nThis is where I realized that\nthere was really a need to communicate,\n\n00:02:20.643 --> 00:02:23.545\nbecause the data\nof what's happening in the world\n\n00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.740\nand the child health\nof every country is very well aware.\n\n00:02:26.764 --> 00:02:29.684\nWe did this software\nwhich displays it like this:\n\n00:02:29.708 --> 00:02:31.489\nevery bubble here is a country.\n\n00:02:31.513 --> 00:02:36.530\nThis country over here is China.\n\n00:02:36.554 --> 00:02:37.555\nThis is India.\n\n00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.843\nThe size of the bubble is the population,\n\n00:02:39.867 --> 00:02:43.648\nand on this axis here,\nI put fertility rate.\n\n00:02:43.672 --> 00:02:45.934\nBecause my students, what they said\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.767\nwhen they looked upon the world,\nand I asked them,\n\n00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:51.137\n\"What do you really\nthink about the world?\"\n\n00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:54.703\nWell, I first discovered\nthat the textbook was Tintin, mainly.\n\n00:02:54.727 --> 00:02:55.876\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.415\nAnd they said, \"The world\nis still 'we' and 'them.'\n\n00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.407\nAnd 'we' is Western world\nand 'them' is Third World.\"\n\n00:03:02.286 --> 00:03:04.849\n\"And what do you mean\nwith Western world?\" I said.\n\n00:03:04.873 --> 00:03:06.850\n\"Well, that's long life and small family,\n\n00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:09.206\nand Third World is short life\nand large family.\"\n\n00:03:10.016 --> 00:03:12.394\nSo this is what I could display here.\n\n00:03:12.418 --> 00:03:15.794\nI put fertility rate here:\nnumber of children per woman:\n\n00:03:15.818 --> 00:03:18.934\none, two, three, four,\nup to about eight children per woman.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:23.303\nWe have very good data\nsince 1962 -- 1960 about --\n\n00:03:23.327 --> 00:03:25.360\non the size of families in all countries.\n\n00:03:25.384 --> 00:03:26.759\nThe error margin is narrow.\n\n00:03:26.783 --> 00:03:28.630\nHere, I put life expectancy at birth,\n\n00:03:28.654 --> 00:03:31.934\nfrom 30 years in some countries\nup to about 70 years.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.934\nAnd 1962, there was really\na group of countries here\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:38.211\nthat was industrialized countries,\n\n00:03:38.235 --> 00:03:40.559\nand they had small families\nand long lives.\n\n00:03:40.583 --> 00:03:42.597\nAnd these were the developing countries:\n\n00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:45.699\nthey had large families\nand they had relatively short lives.\n\n00:03:45.723 --> 00:03:49.602\nNow, what has happened since 1962?\nWe want to see the change.\n\n00:03:49.626 --> 00:03:52.563\nAre the students right?\nIs it still two types of countries?\n\n00:03:52.587 --> 00:03:56.146\nOr have these developing countries\ngot smaller families and they live here?\n\n00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.645\nOr have they got longer lives\nand live up there?\n\n00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:00.510\nLet's see. We stopped the world then.\n\n00:04:00.534 --> 00:04:03.020\nThis is all U.N. statistics\nthat have been available.\n\n00:04:03.044 --> 00:04:04.545\nHere we go. Can you see there?\n\n00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.856\nIt's China there, moving against\nbetter health there, improving there.\n\n00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.525\nAll the green Latin American countries\nare moving towards smaller families.\n\n00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.971\nYour yellow ones here\nare the Arabic countries,\n\n00:04:13.995 --> 00:04:17.896\nand they get longer life,\nbut not larger families.\n\n00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.542\nThe Africans are the green here.\nThey still remain here.\n\n00:04:20.566 --> 00:04:22.944\nThis is India; Indonesia\nis moving on pretty fast.\n\n00:04:22.968 --> 00:04:23.997\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:24.021 --> 00:04:27.456\nIn the '80s here, you have Bangladesh\nstill among the African countries.\n\n00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.433\nBut now, Bangladesh --\nit's a miracle that happens in the '80s:\n\n00:04:30.457 --> 00:04:32.934\nthe imams start to promote\nfamily planning.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.797\nThey move up into that corner.\n\n00:04:34.821 --> 00:04:38.022\nAnd in the '90s, we have\nthe terrible HIV epidemic\n\n00:04:38.046 --> 00:04:41.652\nthat takes down the life expectancy\nof the African countries\n\n00:04:41.676 --> 00:04:44.934\nand all the rest of them\nmove up into the corner,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:49.872\nwhere we have long lives and small family,\nand we have a completely new world.\n\n00:04:49.896 --> 00:04:53.110\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:00.837 --> 00:05:01.934\n(Applause ends)\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.338\nLet me make a comparison directly\n\n00:05:04.362 --> 00:05:07.289\nbetween the United States\nof America and Vietnam.\n\n00:05:07.313 --> 00:05:08.512\n1964.\n\n00:05:09.496 --> 00:05:12.107\nAmerica had small families and long life;\n\n00:05:12.131 --> 00:05:15.257\nVietnam had large families\nand short lives.\n\n00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:16.949\nAnd this is what happens:\n\n00:05:16.973 --> 00:05:21.934\nthe data during the war indicate\nthat even with all the death,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.111\nthere was an improvement\nof life expectancy.\n\n00:05:24.135 --> 00:05:27.099\nBy the end of the year,\nthe family planning started in Vietnam;\n\n00:05:27.123 --> 00:05:28.690\nthey went for smaller families.\n\n00:05:28.714 --> 00:05:31.605\nAnd the United States up there\nis getting for longer life,\n\n00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:32.736\nkeeping family size.\n\n00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.796\nAnd in the '80s now,\nthey give up Communist planning\n\n00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.779\nand they go for market economy,\n\n00:05:37.803 --> 00:05:39.804\nand it moves faster even than social life.\n\n00:05:39.828 --> 00:05:42.109\nAnd today, we have in Vietnam\n\n00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:46.804\nthe same life expectancy\nand the same family size\n\n00:05:46.828 --> 00:05:49.903\nhere in Vietnam, 2003,\n\n00:05:49.927 --> 00:05:53.663\nas in United States, 1974,\nby the end of the war.\n\n00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.767\nIf we don't look in the data,\n\n00:05:57.791 --> 00:06:00.934\nI think we all underestimate\nthe tremendous change in Asia,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:05.727\nwhich was in social change\nbefore we saw the economical change.\n\n00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:09.934\nLet's move over to another way here\nin which we could display\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:13.835\nthe distribution\nin the world of the income.\n\n00:06:13.859 --> 00:06:17.326\nThis is the world distribution\nof income of people.\n\n00:06:18.457 --> 00:06:21.934\nOne dollar, 10 dollars\nor 100 dollars per day.\n\n00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:26.370\nThere's no gap between rich\nand poor any longer. This is a myth.\n\n00:06:26.394 --> 00:06:28.409\nThere's a little hump here.\n\n00:06:29.077 --> 00:06:30.934\nBut there are people all the way.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:34.934\nAnd if we look where the income ends up,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:39.280\nthis is 100 percent\nthe world's annual income.\n\n00:06:39.304 --> 00:06:41.767\nAnd the richest 20 percent,\n\n00:06:41.791 --> 00:06:45.665\nthey take out of that about 74 percent.\n\n00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:50.840\nAnd the poorest 20 percent,\nthey take about two percent.\n\n00:06:50.864 --> 00:06:53.773\nAnd this shows that the concept\nof developing countries\n\n00:06:53.797 --> 00:06:55.152\nis extremely doubtful.\n\n00:06:55.176 --> 00:06:56.934\nWe think about aid,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.906\nlike these people here giving aid\nto these people here.\n\n00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.568\nBut in the middle, we have\nmost of the world population,\n\n00:07:03.592 --> 00:07:06.683\nand they have now\n24 percent of the income.\n\n00:07:06.707 --> 00:07:10.477\nWe heard it in other forms.\nAnd who are these?\n\n00:07:10.501 --> 00:07:14.902\nWhere are the different countries?\nI can show you Africa.\n\n00:07:14.926 --> 00:07:16.350\nThis is Africa.\n\n00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.744\n10% the world population, most in poverty.\n\n00:07:19.768 --> 00:07:21.781\nThis is OECD.\n\n00:07:21.805 --> 00:07:24.388\nThe rich country.\nThe country club of the U.N.\n\n00:07:24.412 --> 00:07:29.828\nAnd they are over here on this side.\nQuite an overlap between Africa and OECD.\n\n00:07:29.852 --> 00:07:31.200\nAnd this is Latin America.\n\n00:07:31.224 --> 00:07:34.579\nIt has everything on this Earth,\nfrom the poorest to the richest\n\n00:07:34.603 --> 00:07:35.851\nin Latin America.\n\n00:07:35.875 --> 00:07:38.893\nAnd on top of that,\nwe can put East Europe,\n\n00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:42.306\nwe can put East Asia,\nand we put South Asia.\n\n00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.460\nAnd how did it look like\nif we go back in time,\n\n00:07:45.484 --> 00:07:47.387\nto about 1970?\n\n00:07:47.411 --> 00:07:49.933\nThen there was more of a hump.\n\n00:07:51.112 --> 00:07:54.520\nAnd we have most who lived\nin absolute poverty were Asians.\n\n00:07:54.544 --> 00:07:57.736\nThe problem in the world\nwas the poverty in Asia.\n\n00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.934\nAnd if I now let the world move forward,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.708\nyou will see that\nwhile population increases,\n\n00:08:03.732 --> 00:08:06.801\nthere are hundreds of millions\nin Asia getting out of poverty\n\n00:08:06.825 --> 00:08:09.034\nand some others getting into poverty,\n\n00:08:09.058 --> 00:08:10.959\nand this is the pattern we have today.\n\n00:08:10.983 --> 00:08:13.054\nAnd the best projection\nfrom the World Bank\n\n00:08:13.078 --> 00:08:14.812\nis that this will happen,\n\n00:08:14.836 --> 00:08:16.864\nand we will not have a divided world.\n\n00:08:16.888 --> 00:08:18.783\nWe'll have most people in the middle.\n\n00:08:18.807 --> 00:08:20.712\nOf course it's a logarithmic scale here,\n\n00:08:20.736 --> 00:08:24.255\nbut our concept of economy\nis growth with percent.\n\n00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:29.327\nWe look upon it as a possibility\nof percentile increase.\n\n00:08:29.351 --> 00:08:34.278\nIf I change this, and take GDP per capita\ninstead of family income,\n\n00:08:34.302 --> 00:08:38.028\nand I turn these individual data\n\n00:08:38.052 --> 00:08:41.094\ninto regional data\nof gross domestic product,\n\n00:08:41.118 --> 00:08:43.419\nand I take the regions down here,\n\n00:08:43.443 --> 00:08:45.682\nthe size of the bubble\nis still the population.\n\n00:08:45.706 --> 00:08:48.904\nAnd you have the OECD there,\nand you have sub-Saharan Africa there,\n\n00:08:48.928 --> 00:08:50.934\nand we take off the Arab states there,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:54.934\ncoming both from Africa and from Asia,\nand we put them separately,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:59.934\nand we can expand this axis,\nand I can give it a new dimension here,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:03.320\nby adding the social values\nthere, child survival.\n\n00:09:03.344 --> 00:09:05.508\nNow I have money on that axis,\n\n00:09:05.532 --> 00:09:08.225\nand I have the possibility\nof children to survive there.\n\n00:09:08.249 --> 00:09:12.395\nIn some countries, 99.7% of children\nsurvive to five years of age;\n\n00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:14.144\nothers, only 70.\n\n00:09:14.168 --> 00:09:17.243\nAnd here, it seems,\nthere is a gap between OECD,\n\n00:09:17.267 --> 00:09:20.512\nLatin America, East Europe, East Asia,\n\n00:09:20.536 --> 00:09:24.428\nArab states, South Asia\nand sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n00:09:24.452 --> 00:09:29.330\nThe linearity is very strong\nbetween child survival and money.\n\n00:09:29.354 --> 00:09:32.378\nBut let me split sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n00:09:32.402 --> 00:09:37.623\nHealth is there\nand better health is up there.\n\n00:09:37.647 --> 00:09:41.934\nI can go here and I can split\nsub-Saharan Africa into its countries.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.535\nAnd when it burst,\n\n00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:47.205\nthe size of its country bubble\nis the size of the population.\n\n00:09:47.229 --> 00:09:49.769\nSierra Leone down there.\nMauritius is up there.\n\n00:09:49.793 --> 00:09:51.860\nMauritius was the first country\n\n00:09:51.884 --> 00:09:55.285\nto get away with trade barriers,\nand they could sell their sugar --\n\n00:09:55.309 --> 00:09:56.897\nthey could sell their textiles --\n\n00:09:56.921 --> 00:10:00.561\non equal terms as the people\nin Europe and North America.\n\n00:10:00.585 --> 00:10:04.062\nThere's a huge difference between Africa.\nAnd Ghana is here in the middle.\n\n00:10:04.086 --> 00:10:06.934\nIn Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:10.884\nHere in Uganda, development aid.\n\n00:10:10.908 --> 00:10:13.432\nHere, time to invest;\nthere, you can go for a holiday.\n\n00:10:13.456 --> 00:10:16.819\nIt's a tremendous variation within Africa\n\n00:10:16.843 --> 00:10:19.934\nwhich we rarely often make\n-- that it's equal everything.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:23.934\nI can split South Asia here.\nIndia's the big bubble in the middle.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:28.420\nBut a huge difference\nbetween Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.\n\n00:10:28.444 --> 00:10:30.598\nI can split Arab states. How are they?\n\n00:10:30.622 --> 00:10:34.758\nSame climate, same culture,\nsame religion -- huge difference.\n\n00:10:34.782 --> 00:10:36.115\nEven between neighbors.\n\n00:10:36.139 --> 00:10:37.455\nYemen, civil war.\n\n00:10:37.479 --> 00:10:41.822\nUnited Arab Emirates, money,\nwhich was quite equally and well used.\n\n00:10:41.846 --> 00:10:43.331\nNot as the myth is.\n\n00:10:43.355 --> 00:10:46.528\nAnd that includes all the children\nof the foreign workers\n\n00:10:46.552 --> 00:10:48.439\nwho are in the country.\n\n00:10:49.242 --> 00:10:52.934\nData is often better than you think.\nMany people say data is bad.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:56.101\nThere is an uncertainty margin,\nbut we can see the difference here:\n\n00:10:56.125 --> 00:10:57.487\nCambodia, Singapore.\n\n00:10:57.511 --> 00:11:00.482\nThe differences are much bigger\nthan the weakness of the data.\n\n00:11:00.506 --> 00:11:05.153\nEast Europe: Soviet economy\nfor a long time,\n\n00:11:05.177 --> 00:11:08.389\nbut they come out after 10 years\nvery, very differently.\n\n00:11:08.413 --> 00:11:11.035\nAnd there is Latin America.\n\n00:11:11.059 --> 00:11:12.780\nToday, we don't have to go to Cuba\n\n00:11:12.804 --> 00:11:14.868\nto find a healthy country\nin Latin America.\n\n00:11:14.892 --> 00:11:19.526\nChile will have a lower child mortality\nthan Cuba within some few years from now.\n\n00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.605\nHere, we have high-income\ncountries in the OECD.\n\n00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:26.338\nAnd we get the whole pattern\nhere of the world,\n\n00:11:26.362 --> 00:11:28.408\nwhich is more or less like this.\n\n00:11:28.432 --> 00:11:33.523\nAnd if we look at it, how the world looks,\n\n00:11:33.575 --> 00:11:36.934\nin 1960, it starts to move.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.527\nThis is Mao Tse-tung.\nHe brought health to China.\n\n00:11:39.551 --> 00:11:40.685\nAnd then he died.\n\n00:11:40.709 --> 00:11:43.416\nAnd then Deng Xiaoping came\nand brought money to China,\n\n00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.494\nand brought them\ninto the mainstream again.\n\n00:11:45.518 --> 00:11:49.676\nAnd we have seen how countries\nmove in different directions like this,\n\n00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:55.065\nso it's sort of difficult to get\nan example country\n\n00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:57.748\nwhich shows the pattern of the world.\n\n00:11:57.798 --> 00:12:04.130\nBut I would like to bring you back\nto about here, at 1960.\n\n00:12:05.041 --> 00:12:08.331\nI would like to compare\n\n00:12:08.355 --> 00:12:15.045\nSouth Korea, which is this one,\nwith Brazil, which is this one.\n\n00:12:16.145 --> 00:12:17.926\nThe label went away for me here.\n\n00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.546\nAnd I would like to compare Uganda,\nwhich is there.\n\n00:12:21.649 --> 00:12:24.688\nAnd I can run it forward, like this.\n\n00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:33.338\nAnd you can see how South Korea is making\na very, very fast advancement,\n\n00:12:33.362 --> 00:12:35.934\nwhereas Brazil is much slower.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:42.292\nAnd if we move back again, here,\nand we put on trails on them, like this,\n\n00:12:42.316 --> 00:12:45.934\nyou can see again\nthat the speed of development\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.772\nis very, very different,\n\n00:12:48.796 --> 00:12:55.497\nand the countries are moving more or less\nin the same rate as money and health,\n\n00:12:55.521 --> 00:12:57.395\nbut it seems you can move much faster\n\n00:12:57.419 --> 00:13:00.078\nif you are healthy first\nthan if you are wealthy first.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:04.934\nAnd to show that, you can put\non the way of United Arab Emirates.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.814\nThey came from here, a mineral country.\n\n00:13:07.838 --> 00:13:10.163\nThey cached all the oil;\nthey got all the money;\n\n00:13:10.187 --> 00:13:12.426\nbut health cannot be bought\nat the supermarket.\n\n00:13:13.474 --> 00:13:16.570\nYou have to invest in health.\nYou have to get kids into schooling.\n\n00:13:16.594 --> 00:13:19.737\nYou have to train health staff.\nYou have to educate the population.\n\n00:13:19.761 --> 00:13:22.215\nAnd Sheikh Zayed did that\nin a fairly good way.\n\n00:13:22.239 --> 00:13:25.934\nIn spite of falling oil prices,\nhe brought this country up here.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:29.934\nSo we've got a much more mainstream\nappearance of the world,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.485\nwhere all countries tend\nto use their money\n\n00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:34.620\nbetter than they used in the past.\n\n00:13:35.713 --> 00:13:42.685\nNow, this is, more or less, if you look\nat the average data of the countries --\n\n00:13:42.709 --> 00:13:44.357\nthey are like this.\n\n00:13:44.381 --> 00:13:47.723\nNow that's dangerous, to use average data,\n\n00:13:47.747 --> 00:13:51.518\nbecause there is such\na lot of difference within countries.\n\n00:13:51.542 --> 00:13:57.961\nSo if I go and look here,\nwe can see that Uganda today\n\n00:13:57.985 --> 00:14:00.934\nis where South Korea was in 1960.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:04.624\nIf I split Uganda, there's quite\na difference within Uganda.\n\n00:14:04.648 --> 00:14:06.826\nThese are the quintiles of Uganda.\n\n00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.034\nThe richest 20 percent\nof Ugandans are there.\n\n00:14:09.058 --> 00:14:10.443\nThe poorest are down there.\n\n00:14:10.467 --> 00:14:13.343\nIf I split South Africa, it's like this.\n\n00:14:13.367 --> 00:14:16.110\nAnd if I go down and look at Niger,\n\n00:14:16.134 --> 00:14:20.778\nwhere there was such\na terrible famine, lastly, it's like this.\n\n00:14:20.802 --> 00:14:23.696\nThe 20 percent poorest\nof Niger is out here,\n\n00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.489\nand the 20 percent richest\nof South Africa is there,\n\n00:14:26.513 --> 00:14:28.531\nand yet we tend to discuss\n\n00:14:28.555 --> 00:14:30.934\non what solutions\nthere should be in Africa.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.525\nEverything in this world exists in Africa.\n\n00:14:33.549 --> 00:14:36.824\nAnd you can't discuss\nuniversal access to HIV [medicine]\n\n00:14:36.848 --> 00:14:41.220\nfor that quintile up here\nwith the same strategy as down here.\n\n00:14:41.244 --> 00:14:44.782\nThe improvement of the world\nmust be highly contextualized,\n\n00:14:44.806 --> 00:14:48.736\nand it's not relevant to have it\non regional level.\n\n00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.290\nWe must be much more detailed.\n\n00:14:51.028 --> 00:14:54.354\nWe find that students get\nvery excited when they can use this.\n\n00:14:54.378 --> 00:14:57.996\nAnd even more, policy makers\nand the corporate sectors\n\n00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.681\nwould like to see\nhow the world is changing.\n\n00:15:01.705 --> 00:15:03.393\nNow, why doesn't this take place?\n\n00:15:03.417 --> 00:15:05.907\nWhy are we not using the data we have?\n\n00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:09.741\nWe have data in the United Nations,\nin the national statistical agencies\n\n00:15:09.765 --> 00:15:12.934\nand in universities and other\nnon-governmental organizations.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.292\nBecause the data is hidden\ndown in the databases.\n\n00:15:15.316 --> 00:15:18.248\nAnd the public is there,\nand the Internet is there,\n\n00:15:18.273 --> 00:15:20.434\nbut we have still not used it effectively.\n\n00:15:20.457 --> 00:15:22.934\nAll that information\nwe saw changing in the world\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:26.097\ndoes not include\npublicly-funded statistics.\n\n00:15:26.121 --> 00:15:28.275\nThere are some web pages\nlike this, you know,\n\n00:15:28.299 --> 00:15:32.934\nbut they take some nourishment\ndown from the databases,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:37.934\nbut people put prices on them,\nstupid passwords and boring statistics.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.347\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:39.371 --> 00:15:40.546\nAnd this won't work.\n\n00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:43.373\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:43.397 --> 00:15:45.819\nSo what is needed? We have the databases.\n\n00:15:45.843 --> 00:15:47.620\nIt's not the new database you need.\n\n00:15:47.644 --> 00:15:51.370\nWe have wonderful design tools,\nand more and more are added up here.\n\n00:15:51.394 --> 00:15:54.265\nSo we started a nonprofit venture\n\n00:15:54.289 --> 00:15:58.660\nwhich, linking data to design,\nwe called Gapminder,\n\n00:15:58.684 --> 00:16:00.037\nfrom the London Underground,\n\n00:16:00.061 --> 00:16:01.838\nwhere they warn you, \"mind the gap.\"\n\n00:16:01.862 --> 00:16:03.802\nSo we thought Gapminder was appropriate.\n\n00:16:03.826 --> 00:16:08.182\nAnd we started to write software\nwhich could link the data like this.\n\n00:16:08.206 --> 00:16:09.753\nAnd it wasn't that difficult.\n\n00:16:09.777 --> 00:16:13.328\nIt took some person years,\nand we have produced animations.\n\n00:16:13.352 --> 00:16:15.685\nYou can take a data set and put it there.\n\n00:16:15.709 --> 00:16:19.934\nWe are liberating U.N. data,\nsome few U.N. organization.\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:24.458\nSome countries accept that\ntheir databases can go out on the world,\n\n00:16:24.482 --> 00:16:27.553\nbut what we really need is,\nof course, a search function.\n\n00:16:27.577 --> 00:16:31.934\nA search function where we can copy\nthe data up to a searchable format\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.690\nand get it out in the world.\n\n00:16:33.714 --> 00:16:36.085\nAnd what do we hear when we go around?\n\n00:16:36.109 --> 00:16:39.116\nI've done anthropology\non the main statistical units.\n\n00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.260\nEveryone says, \"It's impossible.\nThis can't be done.\n\n00:16:42.284 --> 00:16:44.794\nOur information is so peculiar in detail,\n\n00:16:44.818 --> 00:16:47.922\nso that cannot be searched\nas others can be searched.\n\n00:16:47.946 --> 00:16:50.301\nWe cannot give the data\nfree to the students,\n\n00:16:50.325 --> 00:16:52.230\nfree to the entrepreneurs of the world.\"\n\n00:16:53.214 --> 00:16:56.109\nBut this is what we would\nlike to see, isn't it?\n\n00:16:56.133 --> 00:16:58.557\nThe publicly-funded data is down here.\n\n00:16:58.581 --> 00:17:01.616\nAnd we would like flowers\nto grow out on the Net.\n\n00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.807\nAnd one of the crucial points\nis to make them searchable,\n\n00:17:04.831 --> 00:17:09.075\nand then people can use the different\ndesign tool to animate it there.\n\n00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:11.539\nAnd I have pretty good news for you.\n\n00:17:11.563 --> 00:17:13.757\nI have good news that the present,\n\n00:17:13.781 --> 00:17:16.934\nnew Head of U.N. Statistics,\nhe doesn't say it's impossible.\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.730\nHe only says, \"We can't do it.\"\n\n00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:22.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.934\nAnd that's a quite clever guy, huh?\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:26.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:30.934\nSo we can see a lot happening\nin data in the coming years.\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:35.618\nWe will be able to look at income\ndistributions in completely new ways.\n\n00:17:35.642 --> 00:17:40.934\nThis is the income distribution\nof China, 1970.\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:45.754\nThis is the income distribution\nof the United States, 1970.\n\n00:17:45.778 --> 00:17:48.827\nAlmost no overlap.\n\n00:17:48.851 --> 00:17:50.301\nAnd what has happened?\n\n00:17:50.631 --> 00:17:52.309\nWhat has happened is this:\n\n00:17:52.333 --> 00:17:55.305\nthat China is growing,\nit's not so equal any longer,\n\n00:17:55.329 --> 00:17:58.934\nand it's appearing here,\noverlooking the United States.\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:01.616\nAlmost like a ghost, isn't it?\n\n00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:04.545\nIt's pretty scary.\n\n00:18:04.569 --> 00:18:06.830\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.530\nBut I think it's very important\nto have all this information.\n\n00:18:13.554 --> 00:18:16.167\nWe need really to see it.\n\n00:18:16.191 --> 00:18:18.934\nAnd instead of looking at this,\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:24.606\nI would like to end up by showing\nthe Internet users per 1,000.\n\n00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.512\nIn this software, we access\nabout 500 variables\n\n00:18:27.536 --> 00:18:29.937\nfrom all the countries quite easily.\n\n00:18:29.961 --> 00:18:32.934\nIt takes some time to change for this,\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:38.813\nbut on the axises, you can quite easily\nget any variable you would like to have.\n\n00:18:38.837 --> 00:18:43.344\nAnd the thing would be\nto get up the databases free,\n\n00:18:43.368 --> 00:18:45.934\nto get them searchable,\nand with a second click,\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:50.934\nto get them into the graphic formats,\nwhere you can instantly understand them.\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:53.060\nNow, statisticians don't like it,\n\n00:18:53.084 --> 00:19:00.052\nbecause they say\nthat this will not show the reality;\n\n00:19:00.076 --> 00:19:03.797\nwe have to have statistical,\nanalytical methods.\n\n00:19:03.821 --> 00:19:05.934\nBut this is hypothesis-generating.\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.863\nI end now with the world.\n\n00:19:08.979 --> 00:19:10.464\nThere, the Internet is coming.\n\n00:19:10.488 --> 00:19:12.971\nThe number of Internet users\nare going up like this.\n\n00:19:12.995 --> 00:19:14.964\nThis is the GDP per capita.\n\n00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:18.473\nAnd it's a new technology coming in,\nbut then amazingly,\n\n00:19:18.497 --> 00:19:22.216\nhow well it fits to the economy\nof the countries.\n\n00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.697\nThat's why the $100 computer\nwill be so important.\n\n00:19:25.721 --> 00:19:27.126\nBut it's a nice tendency.\n\n00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:30.054\nIt's as if the world\nis flattening off, isn't it?\n\n00:19:30.078 --> 00:19:32.483\nThese countries are lifting more\nthan the economy\n\n00:19:32.507 --> 00:19:35.292\nand will be very interesting\nto follow this over the year,\n\n00:19:35.316 --> 00:19:38.677\nas I would like you to be able to do\nwith all the publicly funded data.\n\n00:19:38.701 --> 00:19:39.934\nThank you very much.\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:42.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why we do what we do", "duration": "1305", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/tony_robbins_asks_why_we_do_what_we_do", "transcript": "Thank you. I have to tell you I'm both challenged and excited. My excitement is: I get a chance to give something back. My challenge is: the shortest seminar I usually do is 50 hours.(Laughter)I'm not exaggerating. I do weekends \u2014 I do more, obviously, I also coach people \u2014 but I'm into immersion, because how did you learn language? Not just by learning principles, you got in it and you did it so often that it became real.The bottom line of why I'm here, besides being a crazy mofo, is that \u2014 I'm not here to motivate you, you don't need that, obviously. Often that's what people think I do, and it's the furthest thing from it. What happens, though, is people say to me, \"I don't need any motivation.\" But that's not what I do. I'm the \"why\" guy. I want to know why you do what you do.What is your motive for action? What is it that drives you in your life today? Not 10 years ago. Are you running the same pattern? Because I believe that the invisible force of internal drive, activated, is the most important thing. I'm here because I believe emotion is the force of life. All of us here have great minds. Most of us here have great minds, right? We all know how to think. With our minds we can rationalize anything. We can make anything happen.I agree with what was described a few days ago, that people work in their self-interest. But we know that that's bullshit at times. You don't work in your self-interest all the time, because when emotion comes into it, the wiring changes in the way it functions. So it's wonderful to think intellectually about how the life of the world is, especially those who are very smart can play this game in our head. But I really want to know what's driving you.What I would like to invite you to do by the end of this talk is explore where you are today, for two reasons. One: so that you can contribute more. And two: that hopefully we can not just understand other people more, but appreciate them more, and create the kinds of connections that can stop some of the challenges that we face today. They're only going to get magnified by the very technology that connects us, because it's making us intersect. That intersection doesn't always create a view of \"everybody now understands everybody, and everybody appreciates everybody.\"I've had an obsession basically for 30 years, \"What makes the difference in the quality of people's lives? What in their performance?\" I got hired to produce the result now. I've done it for 30 years. I get the phone call when the athlete is burning down on national television, and they were ahead by five strokes and now they can't get back on the course. I've got to do something right now or nothing matters. I get the phone call when the child is going to commit suicide, I've got to do something. In 29 years, I'm very grateful to tell you I've never lost one. It doesn't mean I won't some day, but I haven't yet. The reason is an understanding of these human needs.When I get those calls about performance, that's one thing. How do you make a change? I'm also looking to see what is shaping the person's ability to contribute, to do something beyond themselves. Maybe the real question is, I look at life and say there's two master lessons. One is: there's the science of achievement, which almost everyone here has mastered amazingly. \"How do you take the invisible and make it visible,\" How do you make your dreams happen? Your business, your contribution to society, money \u2014 whatever, your body, your family.The other lesson that is rarely mastered is the art of fulfillment. Because science is easy, right? We know the rules, you write the code and you get the results. Once you know the game, you just up the ante, don't you? But when it comes to fulfillment \u2014 that's an art. The reason is, it's about appreciation and contribution. You can only feel so much by yourself.I've had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the real question how somebody's life changes if you look at them like those people that you've given everything to? Like all the resources they say they need. You gave not a 100-dollar computer, but the best computer. You gave them love, joy, were there to comfort them. Those people very often \u2014 you know some of them \u2014 end up the rest of their life with all this love, education, money and background going in and out of rehab. Some people have been through ultimate pain, psychologically, sexually, spiritually, emotionally abused \u2014 and not always, but often, they become some of the people that contribute the most to society.The question we've got to ask ourselves really is, what is it? What is it that shapes us? We live in a therapy culture. Most of us don't do that, but the culture's a therapy culture, the mindset that we are our past. And you wouldn't be in this room if you bought that, but most of society thinks biography is destiny. The past equals the future. Of course it does if you live there. But what we know and what we have to remind ourselves \u2014 because you can know something intellectually and then not use it, not apply it.We've got to remind ourselves that decision is the ultimate power. When you ask people, have you failed to achieve something significant in your life?Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye.TR: Thanks for the interaction on a high level there. But if you ask people, why didn't you achieve something? Somebody who's working for you, or a partner, or even yourself. When you fail to achieve, what's the reason people say? What do they tell you? Didn't have the knowledge, didn't have the money, didn't have the time, didn't have the technology. I didn't have the right manager.Al Gore: Supreme Court. TR: The Supreme Court.(Laughter)(Applause) (Cheering)(Applause continues)TR: And \u2014(Applause)What do all those, including the Supreme Court, have in common?(Laughter)They are a claim to you missing resources, and they may be accurate. You may not have the money, or the Supreme Court, but that is not the defining factor.(Applause) (Laughter)And you correct me if I'm wrong. The defining factor is never resources; it's resourcefulness. And what I mean specifically, rather than just some phrase, is if you have emotion, human emotion, something that I experienced from you the day before yesterday at a level that is as profound as I've ever experienced and I believe with that emotion you would have beat his ass and won.Audience: Yeah!(Applause) (Cheering)How easy for me to tell him what he should do.(Laughter)Idiot, Robbins. But I know when we watched the debate at that time, there were emotions that blocked people's ability to get this man's intellect and capacity. And the way that it came across to some people on that day \u2014 because I know people that wanted to vote in your direction and didn't, and I was upset. But there was emotion there. Do you know what I'm talking about?Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye.TR: So, emotion is it. And if we get the right emotion, we can get ourselves to do anything. If you're creative, playful, fun enough, can you get through to anybody, yes or no?If you don't have the money, but you're creative and determined, you find the way. This is the ultimate resource. But this is not the story that people tell us. They tell us a bunch of different stories. They tell us we don't have the resources, but ultimately, if you take a look here, they say, what are all the reasons they haven't accomplished that? He's broken my pattern, that son-of-a-bitch.(Laughter)But I appreciated the energy, I'll tell you that.(Laughter)What determines your resources? We've said decisions shape destiny, which is my focus here. If decisions shape destiny, what determines it is three decisions. What will you focus on? You have to decide what you're going to focus on. Consciously or unconsciously. the minute you decide to focus, you must give it a meaning, and that meaning produces emotion. Is this the end or the beginning? Is God punishing me or rewarding me, or is this the roll of the dice? An emotion creates what we're going to do, or the action.So, think about your own life, the decisions that have shaped your destiny. And that sounds really heavy, but in the last five or 10 years, have there been some decisions that if you'd made a different decision, your life would be completely different? How many can think about it? Better or worse. Say, \"Aye.\"Audience: Aye.So the bottom line is, maybe it was where to go to work, and you met the love of your life there, a career decision. I know the Google geniuses I saw here \u2014 I mean, I understand that their decision was to sell their technology. What if they made that decision versus to build their own culture? How would the world or their lives be different, their impact? The history of our world is these decisions. When a woman stands up and says, \"No, I won't go to the back of the bus.\" She didn't just affect her life. That decision shaped our culture. Or someone standing in front of a tank. Or being in a position like Lance Armstrong, \"You've got testicular cancer.\" That's pretty tough for any male, especially if you ride a bike.(Laughter)You've got it in your brain; you've got it in your lungs. But what was his decision of what to focus on? Different than most people. What did it mean? It wasn't the end; it was the beginning. He goes off and wins seven championships he never once won before the cancer, because he got emotional fitness, psychological strength. That's the difference in human beings that I've seen of the three million I've been around.In my lab, I've had three million people from 80 countries over the last 29 years. And after a while, patterns become obvious. You see that South America and Africa may be connected in a certain way, right? Others say, \"Oh, that sounds ridiculous.\" It's simple. So, what shaped Lance? What shapes you? Two invisible forces. Very quickly. One: state. We all have had times, you did something, and after, you thought to yourself, \"I can't believe I said or did that, that was so stupid.\" Who's been there? Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye.Or after you did something, you go, \"That was me!\"(Laughter)It wasn't your ability; it was your state. Your model of the world is what shapes you long term. Your model of the world is the filter. That's what's shaping us. It makes people make decisions. To influence somebody, we need to know what already influences them. It's made up of three parts. First, what's your target? What are you after? It's not your desires. You can get your desires or goals. Who has ever got a goal or desire and thought, is this all there is?Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye.It's needs we have. I believe there are six human needs. Second, once you know what the target that's driving you is and you uncover it for the truth \u2014 you don't form it \u2014 then you find out what's your map, what's the belief systems that tell you how to get those needs. Some people think the way to get them is to destroy the world, some people, to build, create something, love someone. There's the fuel you pick. So very quickly, six needs.Let me tell you what they are. First one: certainty. These are not goals or desires, these are universal. Everyone needs certainty they can avoid pain and at least be comfortable. Now, how do you get it? Control everybody? Develop a skill? Give up? Smoke a cigarette? And if you got totally certain, ironically, even though we need that \u2014 you're not certain about your health, or your children, or money. If you're not sure the ceiling will hold up, you won't listen to any speaker. While we go for certainty differently, if we get total certainty, we get what? What do you feel if you're certain? You know what will happen, when and how it will happen, what would you feel? Bored out of your minds. So, God, in Her infinite wisdom, gave us a second human need, which is uncertainty. We need variety. We need surprise. How many of you here love surprises? Say, \"Aye.\"Audience: Aye.TR: Bullshit. You like the surprises you want. The ones you don't want, you call problems, but you need them. So, variety is important. Have you ever rented a video or a film that you've already seen? Who's done this? Get a fucking life.(Laughter)Why are you doing it? You're certain it's good because you read or saw it before, but you're hoping it's been long enough you've forgotten, and there's variety.Third human need, critical: significance. We all need to feel important, special, unique. You can get it by making more money or being more spiritual. You can do it by getting yourself in a situation where you put more tattoos and earrings in places humans don't want to know. Whatever it takes. The fastest way to do this, if you have no background, no culture, no belief and resources or resourcefulness, is violence. If I put a gun to your head and I live in the 'hood, instantly I'm significant. Zero to 10. How high? 10. How certain am I that you're going to respond to me? 10. How much uncertainty? Who knows what's going to happen next? Kind of exciting. Like climbing up into a cave and doing that stuff all the way down there. Total variety and uncertainty. And it's significant, isn't it? So you want to risk your life for it. So that's why violence has always been around and will be around unless we have a consciousness change as a species. You can get significance a million ways, but to be significant, you've got to be unique and different.Here's what we really need: connection and love, fourth need. We all want it; most settle for connection, love's too scary. Who here has been hurt in an intimate relationship? If you don't raise your hand, you've had other shit, too. And you're going to get hurt again. Aren't you glad you came to this positive visit? Here's what's true: we need it. We can do it through intimacy, friendship, prayer, through walking in nature. If nothing else works for you, don't get a cat, get a dog, because if you leave for two minutes, it's like you've been gone six months, when you come back 5 minutes later.These first four needs, every human finds a way to meet. Even if you lie to yourself, you need to have split personalities. I call the first four needs the needs of the personality. The last two are the needs of the spirit. And this is where fulfillment comes. You won't get it from the first four. You'll figure a way, smoke, drink, do whatever, meet the first four. But number five, you must grow. We all know the answer. If you don't grow, you're what? If a relationship or business is not growing, if you're not growing, doesn't matter how much money or friends you have, how many love you, you feel like hell. And I believe the reason we grow is so we have something to give of value.Because the sixth need is to contribute beyond ourselves. Because we all know, corny as that sounds, the secret to living is giving. We all know life is not about me, it's about we. This culture knows that, this room knows that. It's exciting. When you see Nicholas talking about his $100 computer, the most exciting thing is: here's a genius, but he's got a calling now. You can feel the difference in him, and it's beautiful. And that calling can touch other people.My life was touched because when I was 11 years old, Thanksgiving, no money, no food, we were not going to starve, but my father was totally messed up, my mom was letting him know how bad he messed up, and somebody came to the door and delivered food. My father made three decisions, I know what they were, briefly. His focus was \"This is charity. What does it mean? I'm worthless. What do I have to do? Leave my family,\" which he did. It was one of the most painful experiences of life. My three decisions gave me a different path. I set focus on \"There's food.\" What a concept!(Laughter)But this is what changed my life, shaped me as a human being. Somebody's gift, I don't even know who it is. My father always said, \"No one gives a shit.\" And now somebody I don't know, they're not asking for anything, just giving us food, looking out for us. It made me believe this: that strangers care. And that made me decide, if strangers care about me and my family, I care about them. I'm going to do something to make a difference. So when I was 17, I went out on Thanksgiving, it was my target for years to have enough money to feed two families. The most fun and moving thing I ever did in my life. Next year, I did four, then eight. I didn't tell anybody what I was doing, I wasn't doing it for brownie points. But after eight, I thought I could use some help.So I went out, got my friends involved, then I grew companies, got 11, and I built the foundation. 18 years later, I'm proud to tell you last year we fed 2 million people in 35 countries through our foundation. All during the holidays, Thanksgiving, Christmas, in different countries around the world.(Applause)Thank you. I don't tell you that to brag, but because I'm proud of human beings because they get excited to contribute once they've had the chance to experience it, not talk about it.So, finally \u2014 I'm about out of time. The target that shapes you \u2014 Here's what's different about people. We have the same needs. But are you a certainty freak, is that what you value most, or uncertainty? This man couldn't be a certainty freak if he climbed through those caves. Are you driven by significance or love? We all need all six, but what your lead system is tilts you in a different direction. And as you move in a direction, you have a destination or destiny. The second piece is the map. The operating system tells you how to get there, and some people's map is, \"I'm going to save lives even if I die for other people,\" and they're a fireman, and somebody else says, \"I'm going to kill people to do it.\" They're trying to meet the same needs of significance. They want to honor God or honor their family. But they have a different map.And there are seven different beliefs; I can't go through them, because I'm done. The last piece is emotion. One of the parts of the map is like time. Some people's idea of a long time is 100 years. Somebody else's is three seconds, which is what I have. And the last one I've already mentioned that fell to you. If you've got a target and a map \u2014 I can't use Google because I love Macs, and they haven't made it good for Macs yet. So if you use MapQuest \u2014 how many have made this fatal mistake of using it? You use this thing and you don't get there. Imagine if your beliefs guarantee you can never get to where you want to go.(Laughter)The last thing is emotion. Here's what I'll tell you about emotion. There are 6,000 emotions that we have words for in the English language, which is just a linguistic representation that changes by language. But if your dominant emotions \u2014 If I have 20,000 people or 1,000 and I have them write down all the emotions that they experience in an average week, and I give them as long as they need, and on one side they write empowering emotions, the other's disempowering, guess how many emotions they experience? Less than 12. And half of those make them feel like shit. They have six good feelings. Happy, happy, excited, oh shit, frustrated, frustrated, overwhelmed, depressed. How many of you know somebody who, no matter what happens, finds a way to get pissed off?(Laughter)Or no matter what happens, they find a way to be happy or excited. How many of you know somebody like this?When 9/11 happened, I'll finish with this, I was in Hawaii. I was with 2,000 people from 45 countries, we were translating four languages simultaneously for a program I was conducting, for a week. The night before was called Emotional Mastery. I got up, had no plan for this, and I said \u2014 we had fireworks, I do crazy shit, fun stuff, and at the end, I stopped. I had this plan, but I never know what I'm going to say. And all of a sudden, I said, \"When do people really start to live? When they face death.\" And I went through this whole thing about, if you weren't going to get off this island, if nine days from now, you were going to die, who would you call, what would you say, what would you do? That night is when 9/11 happened.One woman had come to the seminar, and when she came there, her previous boyfriend had been kidnapped and murdered. Her new boyfriend wanted to marry her, and she said no.He said, \"If you go to that Hawaii thing, it's over with us.\" She said, \"It's over.\" When I finished that night, she called him and left a message at the top of the World Trade Center where he worked, saying, \"I love you, I want you to know I want to marry you. It was stupid of me.\" She was asleep, because it was 3 a.m. for us, when he called her back, and said, \"Honey, I can't tell you what this means. I don't know how to tell you this, but you gave me the greatest gift, because I'm going to die.\" And she played the recording for us in the room. She was on Larry King later. And he said, \"You're probably wondering how on Earth this could happen to you twice. All I can say is this must be God's message to you. From now on, every day, give your all, love your all. Don't let anything ever stop you.\" She finishes, and a man stands up, and he says, \"I'm from Pakistan, I'm a Muslim. I'd love to hold your hand and say I'm sorry, but frankly, this is retribution.\" I can't tell you the rest, because I'm out of time.(Laughter)Are you sure?(Laughter)10 seconds!(Laughter and applause)10 seconds, I want to be respectful. All I can tell you is, I brought this man on stage with a man from New York who worked in the World Trade Center, because I had about 200 New Yorkers there. More than 50 lost their entire companies, friends, marking off their Palm Pilots. One financial trader, woman made of steel, bawling \u2014 30 friends crossing off that all died. And I said, \"What are we going to focus on? What does this mean and what are we going to do?\"And I got the group to focus on: if you didn't lose somebody today, your focus is going to be how to serve somebody else. Then one woman stood up and was so angry, screaming and yelling. I found out she wasn't from New York, she's not an American, doesn't know anybody here. I asked, \"Do you always get angry?\" She said, \"Yes.\" Guilty people got guilty, sad people got sad. I took these two men and I did an indirect negotiation. Jewish man with family in the occupied territory, someone in New York who would have died if he was at work that day, and this man who wanted to be a terrorist, and I made it very clear. This integration is on a film, which I'd be happy to send you, instead of my verbalization, but the two of them not only came together and changed their beliefs and models of the world, but worked together to bring, for almost four years now, through various mosques and synagogues, the idea of how to create peace. And he wrote a book, called \"My Jihad, My Way of Peace.\" So, transformation can happen.My invitation to you is: explore your web, the web in here \u2014 the needs, the beliefs, the emotions that are controlling you, for two reasons: so there's more of you to give, and achieve, too, but I mean give, because that's what's going to fill you up. And secondly, so you can appreciate \u2014 not just understand, that's intellectual, that's the mind, but appreciate what's driving other people. It's the only way our world's going to change.God bless you, thank you. I hope this was of service.(Applause)", "id": 96, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:17.436\nThank you. I have to tell you\nI'm both challenged and excited.\n\n00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.372\nMy excitement is: I get a chance\nto give something back.\n\n00:00:20.396 --> 00:00:23.934\nMy challenge is: the shortest seminar\nI usually do is 50 hours.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.583\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:25.607 --> 00:00:27.837\nI'm not exaggerating. I do weekends --\n\n00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.096\nI do more, obviously,\nI also coach people --\n\n00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.891\nbut I'm into immersion,\nbecause how did you learn language?\n\n00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:34.520\nNot just by learning principles,\n\n00:00:34.544 --> 00:00:37.397\nyou got in it and you did it\nso often that it became real.\n\n00:00:37.421 --> 00:00:40.898\nThe bottom line of why I'm here,\nbesides being a crazy mofo, is that --\n\n00:00:40.922 --> 00:00:44.661\nI'm not here to motivate you,\nyou don't need that, obviously.\n\n00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:46.708\nOften that's what people think I do,\n\n00:00:46.732 --> 00:00:48.447\nand it's the furthest thing from it.\n\n00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:50.516\nWhat happens, though, is people say to me,\n\n00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.008\n\"I don't need any motivation.\"\n\n00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:53.575\nBut that's not what I do.\n\n00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:55.466\nI'm the \"why\" guy.\n\n00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.562\nI want to know why you do what you do.\n\n00:00:57.586 --> 00:00:59.411\nWhat is your motive for action?\n\n00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:03.271\nWhat is it that drives you\nin your life today? Not 10 years ago.\n\n00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:05.000\nAre you running the same pattern?\n\n00:01:05.024 --> 00:01:08.936\nBecause I believe that the invisible force\nof internal drive, activated,\n\n00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.768\nis the most important thing.\n\n00:01:10.792 --> 00:01:14.371\nI'm here because I believe\nemotion is the force of life.\n\n00:01:14.395 --> 00:01:16.212\nAll of us here have great minds.\n\n00:01:16.236 --> 00:01:18.664\nMost of us here have great minds, right?\n\n00:01:18.688 --> 00:01:21.048\nWe all know how to think.\n\n00:01:21.072 --> 00:01:23.161\nWith our minds we can\nrationalize anything.\n\n00:01:23.185 --> 00:01:24.527\nWe can make anything happen.\n\n00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:27.329\nI agree with what was described\na few days ago,\n\n00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:29.680\nthat people work in their self-interest.\n\n00:01:29.704 --> 00:01:32.322\nBut we know that that's bullshit at times.\n\n00:01:32.346 --> 00:01:34.710\nYou don't work in your\nself-interest all the time,\n\n00:01:34.734 --> 00:01:36.601\nbecause when emotion comes into it,\n\n00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:38.668\nthe wiring changes\nin the way it functions.\n\n00:01:38.692 --> 00:01:42.643\nSo it's wonderful to think intellectually\nabout how the life of the world is,\n\n00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:45.826\nespecially those who are very smart\ncan play this game in our head.\n\n00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.952\nBut I really want to know\nwhat's driving you.\n\n00:01:47.976 --> 00:01:49.834\nWhat I would like to invite you to do\n\n00:01:49.858 --> 00:01:53.364\nby the end of this talk is explore\nwhere you are today, for two reasons.\n\n00:01:53.388 --> 00:01:55.269\nOne: so that you can contribute more.\n\n00:01:55.293 --> 00:01:58.563\nAnd two: that hopefully we can not just\nunderstand other people more,\n\n00:01:58.587 --> 00:02:01.477\nbut appreciate them more,\nand create the kinds of connections\n\n00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:04.424\nthat can stop some of the challenges\nthat we face today.\n\n00:02:04.448 --> 00:02:08.193\nThey're only going to get magnified\nby the very technology that connects us,\n\n00:02:08.217 --> 00:02:10.003\nbecause it's making us intersect.\n\n00:02:10.027 --> 00:02:12.253\nThat intersection\ndoesn't always create a view\n\n00:02:12.277 --> 00:02:14.463\nof \"everybody now understands everybody,\n\n00:02:14.487 --> 00:02:16.851\nand everybody appreciates everybody.\"\n\n00:02:16.875 --> 00:02:19.466\nI've had an obsession\nbasically for 30 years,\n\n00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.805\n\"What makes the difference\nin the quality of people's lives?\n\n00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:25.286\nWhat in their performance?\"\n\n00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.488\nI got hired to produce the result now.\n\n00:02:27.512 --> 00:02:29.008\nI've done it for 30 years.\n\n00:02:29.032 --> 00:02:30.579\nI get the phone call\n\n00:02:30.603 --> 00:02:33.345\nwhen the athlete is burning down\non national television,\n\n00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:35.055\nand they were ahead by five strokes\n\n00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.079\nand now they can't get back on the course.\n\n00:02:37.103 --> 00:02:39.789\nI've got to do something right now\nor nothing matters.\n\n00:02:39.813 --> 00:02:42.785\nI get the phone call when the child\nis going to commit suicide,\n\n00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:44.256\nI've got to do something.\n\n00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.934\nIn 29 years, I'm very grateful\nto tell you I've never lost one.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.462\nIt doesn't mean I won't some day,\nbut I haven't yet.\n\n00:02:50.486 --> 00:02:53.862\nThe reason is an understanding\nof these human needs.\n\n00:02:53.886 --> 00:02:56.997\nWhen I get those calls\nabout performance, that's one thing.\n\n00:02:57.021 --> 00:02:58.507\nHow do you make a change?\n\n00:02:58.531 --> 00:03:02.526\nI'm also looking to see what is shaping\nthe person's ability to contribute,\n\n00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.060\nto do something beyond themselves.\n\n00:03:06.084 --> 00:03:08.192\nMaybe the real question is,\n\n00:03:08.216 --> 00:03:10.587\nI look at life and say\nthere's two master lessons.\n\n00:03:10.611 --> 00:03:12.690\nOne is: there's the science\nof achievement,\n\n00:03:12.714 --> 00:03:15.484\nwhich almost everyone here\nhas mastered amazingly.\n\n00:03:15.508 --> 00:03:18.003\n\"How do you take the invisible\nand make it visible,\"\n\n00:03:18.027 --> 00:03:19.744\nHow do you make your dreams happen?\n\n00:03:19.768 --> 00:03:22.355\nYour business, your contribution\nto society, money --\n\n00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.091\nwhatever, your body, your family.\n\n00:03:24.115 --> 00:03:27.618\nThe other lesson that is rarely\nmastered is the art of fulfillment.\n\n00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:30.051\nBecause science is easy, right?\n\n00:03:30.075 --> 00:03:32.980\nWe know the rules, you write the code\nand you get the results.\n\n00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:36.148\nOnce you know the game,\nyou just up the ante, don't you?\n\n00:03:36.172 --> 00:03:38.605\nBut when it comes\nto fulfillment -- that's an art.\n\n00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.825\nThe reason is, it's about\nappreciation and contribution.\n\n00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.934\nYou can only feel so much by yourself.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.894\nI've had an interesting laboratory\nto try to answer the real question\n\n00:03:47.918 --> 00:03:49.474\nhow somebody's life changes\n\n00:03:49.498 --> 00:03:52.809\nif you look at them like those people\nthat you've given everything to?\n\n00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:54.957\nLike all the resources they say they need.\n\n00:03:54.981 --> 00:03:57.767\nYou gave not a 100-dollar computer,\nbut the best computer.\n\n00:03:57.791 --> 00:04:00.313\nYou gave them love, joy,\nwere there to comfort them.\n\n00:04:00.337 --> 00:04:02.933\nThose people very often --\nyou know some of them --\n\n00:04:02.957 --> 00:04:04.398\nend up the rest of their life\n\n00:04:04.422 --> 00:04:06.847\nwith all this love, education,\nmoney and background\n\n00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:08.255\ngoing in and out of rehab.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.934\nSome people have been\nthrough ultimate pain,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.333\npsychologically, sexually,\nspiritually, emotionally abused --\n\n00:04:15.357 --> 00:04:17.013\nand not always, but often,\n\n00:04:17.037 --> 00:04:20.241\nthey become some of the people\nthat contribute the most to society.\n\n00:04:20.265 --> 00:04:24.197\nThe question we've got to ask\nourselves really is, what is it?\n\n00:04:24.221 --> 00:04:25.564\nWhat is it that shapes us?\n\n00:04:25.588 --> 00:04:27.199\nWe live in a therapy culture.\n\n00:04:27.223 --> 00:04:30.265\nMost of us don't do that,\nbut the culture's a therapy culture,\n\n00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.278\nthe mindset that we are our past.\n\n00:04:32.302 --> 00:04:34.934\nAnd you wouldn't be in this room\nif you bought that,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:38.136\nbut most of society\nthinks biography is destiny.\n\n00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.803\nThe past equals the future.\n\n00:04:39.827 --> 00:04:41.542\nOf course it does if you live there.\n\n00:04:41.566 --> 00:04:44.234\nBut what we know and what\nwe have to remind ourselves --\n\n00:04:44.258 --> 00:04:46.452\nbecause you can know\nsomething intellectually\n\n00:04:46.476 --> 00:04:48.324\nand then not use it, not apply it.\n\n00:04:48.878 --> 00:04:52.586\nWe've got to remind ourselves\nthat decision is the ultimate power.\n\n00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.314\nWhen you ask people,\n\n00:04:55.338 --> 00:04:59.211\nhave you failed to achieve\nsomething significant in your life?\n\n00:04:59.235 --> 00:05:00.934\nSay, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.934\nTR: Thanks for the interaction\non a high level there.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.934\nBut if you ask people,\nwhy didn't you achieve something?\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:10.213\nSomebody who's working for you,\nor a partner, or even yourself.\n\n00:05:10.237 --> 00:05:13.333\nWhen you fail to achieve,\nwhat's the reason people say?\n\n00:05:13.357 --> 00:05:14.500\nWhat do they tell you?\n\n00:05:14.524 --> 00:05:18.833\nDidn't have the knowledge,\ndidn't have the money,\n\n00:05:18.857 --> 00:05:23.094\ndidn't have the time,\ndidn't have the technology.\n\n00:05:23.118 --> 00:05:24.952\nI didn't have the right manager.\n\n00:05:24.976 --> 00:05:27.665\nAl Gore: Supreme Court.\nTR: The Supreme Court.\n\n00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:29.919\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:29.943 --> 00:05:32.491\n(Applause) (Cheering)\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.934\n(Applause continues)\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.013\nTR: And --\n\n00:05:45.037 --> 00:05:47.935\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:51.055\nWhat do all those, including\nthe Supreme Court, have in common?\n\n00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:52.453\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:57.277\nThey are a claim to you missing\nresources, and they may be accurate.\n\n00:05:57.301 --> 00:05:59.934\nYou may not have the money,\nor the Supreme Court,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.934\nbut that is not the defining factor.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:07.915\n(Applause) (Laughter)\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.482\nAnd you correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n00:06:10.672 --> 00:06:13.934\nThe defining factor is never resources;\nit's resourcefulness.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.762\nAnd what I mean specifically,\nrather than just some phrase,\n\n00:06:16.786 --> 00:06:19.998\nis if you have emotion, human emotion,\n\n00:06:20.022 --> 00:06:24.051\nsomething that I experienced from you\nthe day before yesterday\n\n00:06:24.075 --> 00:06:26.666\nat a level that is as profound\nas I've ever experienced\n\n00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.928\nand I believe with that emotion\nyou would have beat his ass and won.\n\n00:06:29.952 --> 00:06:31.009\nAudience: Yeah!\n\n00:06:31.033 --> 00:06:35.700\n(Applause) (Cheering)\n\n00:06:35.724 --> 00:06:37.934\nHow easy for me to tell him\nwhat he should do.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.845\nIdiot, Robbins.\n\n00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:48.125\nBut I know when we watched\nthe debate at that time,\n\n00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:50.436\nthere were emotions\nthat blocked people's ability\n\n00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.437\nto get this man's intellect and capacity.\n\n00:06:52.461 --> 00:06:55.357\nAnd the way that it came across\nto some people on that day --\n\n00:06:55.381 --> 00:06:58.756\nbecause I know people that wanted\nto vote in your direction and didn't,\n\n00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.123\nand I was upset.\n\n00:07:00.147 --> 00:07:01.586\nBut there was emotion there.\n\n00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.315\nDo you know what I'm talking about?\n\n00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:04.673\nSay, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye.\n\n00:07:04.697 --> 00:07:05.837\nTR: So, emotion is it.\n\n00:07:05.861 --> 00:07:09.611\nAnd if we get the right emotion,\nwe can get ourselves to do anything.\n\n00:07:09.635 --> 00:07:11.555\nIf you're creative, playful, fun enough,\n\n00:07:11.579 --> 00:07:13.649\ncan you get through to anybody, yes or no?\n\n00:07:13.673 --> 00:07:15.117\nIf you don't have the money,\n\n00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:17.670\nbut you're creative and determined,\nyou find the way.\n\n00:07:17.694 --> 00:07:19.177\nThis is the ultimate resource.\n\n00:07:19.201 --> 00:07:21.434\nBut this is not the story\nthat people tell us.\n\n00:07:21.458 --> 00:07:23.534\nThey tell us a bunch of different stories.\n\n00:07:23.558 --> 00:07:26.267\nThey tell us we don't have\nthe resources, but ultimately,\n\n00:07:26.291 --> 00:07:27.855\nif you take a look here,\n\n00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:31.221\nthey say, what are all the reasons\nthey haven't accomplished that?\n\n00:07:31.245 --> 00:07:33.506\nHe's broken my pattern,\nthat son-of-a-bitch.\n\n00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.857\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:36.881 --> 00:07:39.235\nBut I appreciated the energy,\nI'll tell you that.\n\n00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:40.336\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.877\nWhat determines your resources?\n\n00:07:41.901 --> 00:07:45.038\nWe've said decisions shape destiny,\nwhich is my focus here.\n\n00:07:45.062 --> 00:07:48.158\nIf decisions shape destiny,\nwhat determines it is three decisions.\n\n00:07:48.182 --> 00:07:49.335\nWhat will you focus on?\n\n00:07:49.359 --> 00:07:51.810\nYou have to decide\nwhat you're going to focus on.\n\n00:07:51.834 --> 00:07:53.295\nConsciously or unconsciously.\n\n00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:56.230\nthe minute you decide to focus,\nyou must give it a meaning,\n\n00:07:56.254 --> 00:07:58.143\nand that meaning produces emotion.\n\n00:07:58.167 --> 00:07:59.993\nIs this the end or the beginning?\n\n00:08:00.017 --> 00:08:03.916\nIs God punishing me or rewarding me,\nor is this the roll of the dice?\n\n00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.934\nAn emotion creates\nwhat we're going to do, or the action.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.934\nSo, think about your own life,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.006\nthe decisions that\nhave shaped your destiny.\n\n00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.016\nAnd that sounds really heavy,\nbut in the last five or 10 years,\n\n00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.587\nhave there been some decisions\n\n00:08:15.611 --> 00:08:19.448\nthat if you'd made a different decision,\nyour life would be completely different?\n\n00:08:19.472 --> 00:08:22.166\nHow many can think about it?\nBetter or worse. Say, \"Aye.\"\n\n00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.222\nAudience: Aye.\n\n00:08:23.246 --> 00:08:25.910\nSo the bottom line is,\nmaybe it was where to go to work,\n\n00:08:25.934 --> 00:08:28.787\nand you met the love of your life there,\na career decision.\n\n00:08:28.811 --> 00:08:30.777\nI know the Google geniuses I saw here --\n\n00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:34.189\nI mean, I understand that their decision\nwas to sell their technology.\n\n00:08:34.213 --> 00:08:37.354\nWhat if they made that decision\nversus to build their own culture?\n\n00:08:37.378 --> 00:08:40.307\nHow would the world or their lives\nbe different, their impact?\n\n00:08:40.331 --> 00:08:42.448\nThe history of our world\nis these decisions.\n\n00:08:42.472 --> 00:08:46.034\nWhen a woman stands up and says,\n\"No, I won't go to the back of the bus.\"\n\n00:08:46.058 --> 00:08:49.577\nShe didn't just affect her life.\nThat decision shaped our culture.\n\n00:08:49.601 --> 00:08:52.120\nOr someone standing in front of a tank.\n\n00:08:52.144 --> 00:08:54.934\nOr being in a position\nlike Lance Armstrong,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.502\n\"You've got testicular cancer.\"\n\n00:08:56.526 --> 00:08:59.565\nThat's pretty tough for any male,\nespecially if you ride a bike.\n\n00:08:59.589 --> 00:09:00.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.667\nYou've got it in your brain;\nyou've got it in your lungs.\n\n00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:05.883\nBut what was his decision\nof what to focus on?\n\n00:09:05.907 --> 00:09:08.046\nDifferent than most people.\nWhat did it mean?\n\n00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.021\nIt wasn't the end; it was the beginning.\n\n00:09:10.045 --> 00:09:12.836\nHe goes off and wins\nseven championships he never once won\n\n00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:16.742\nbefore the cancer, because he got\nemotional fitness, psychological strength.\n\n00:09:16.766 --> 00:09:19.257\nThat's the difference\nin human beings that I've seen\n\n00:09:19.281 --> 00:09:21.140\nof the three million I've been around.\n\n00:09:21.164 --> 00:09:26.949\nIn my lab, I've had three million people\nfrom 80 countries over the last 29 years.\n\n00:09:26.973 --> 00:09:29.437\nAnd after a while,\npatterns become obvious.\n\n00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:33.460\nYou see that South America and Africa\nmay be connected in a certain way, right?\n\n00:09:33.484 --> 00:09:36.102\nOthers say, \"Oh, that sounds\nridiculous.\" It's simple.\n\n00:09:36.126 --> 00:09:38.410\nSo, what shaped Lance? What shapes you?\n\n00:09:38.434 --> 00:09:42.756\nTwo invisible forces.\nVery quickly. One: state.\n\n00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:43.934\nWe all have had times,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.751\nyou did something, and after,\nyou thought to yourself,\n\n00:09:46.775 --> 00:09:49.934\n\"I can't believe I said or did that,\nthat was so stupid.\"\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.053\nWho's been there? Say, \"Aye.\"\nAudience: Aye.\n\n00:09:52.077 --> 00:09:54.473\nOr after you did something,\nyou go, \"That was me!\"\n\n00:09:54.497 --> 00:09:55.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.792\nIt wasn't your ability; it was your state.\n\n00:09:58.816 --> 00:10:01.736\nYour model of the world\nis what shapes you long term.\n\n00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.292\nYour model of the world is the filter.\nThat's what's shaping us.\n\n00:10:05.316 --> 00:10:06.916\nIt makes people make decisions.\n\n00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.196\nTo influence somebody, we need to know\nwhat already influences them.\n\n00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.029\nIt's made up of three parts.\n\n00:10:12.053 --> 00:10:14.392\nFirst, what's your target?\nWhat are you after?\n\n00:10:14.416 --> 00:10:15.934\nIt's not your desires.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.593\nYou can get your desires or goals.\n\n00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:20.831\nWho has ever got a goal or desire\nand thought, is this all there is?\n\n00:10:20.855 --> 00:10:22.108\nSay, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye.\n\n00:10:22.132 --> 00:10:25.000\nIt's needs we have.

Develop a skill?\nGive up? Smoke a cigarette?\n\n00:10:56.892 --> 00:10:58.934\nAnd if you got totally\ncertain, ironically,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.244\neven though we need that --\n\n00:11:00.268 --> 00:11:03.461\nyou're not certain about your health,\nor your children, or money.\n\n00:11:03.485 --> 00:11:05.700\nIf you're not sure\nthe ceiling will hold up,\n\n00:11:05.724 --> 00:11:07.343\nyou won't listen to any speaker.\n\n00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:11.116\nWhile we go for certainty differently,\nif we get total certainty, we get what?\n\n00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.834\nWhat do you feel if you're certain?\n\n00:11:12.858 --> 00:11:15.511\nYou know what will happen,\nwhen and how it will happen,\n\n00:11:15.535 --> 00:11:16.634\nwhat would you feel?\n\n00:11:16.658 --> 00:11:19.334\nBored out of your minds.\nSo, God, in Her infinite wisdom,\n\n00:11:19.358 --> 00:11:21.934\ngave us a second human need,\nwhich is uncertainty.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.934\nWe need variety.

00:15:26.363\nSo I went out, got my friends involved,\n\n00:15:26.387 --> 00:15:29.564\nthen I grew companies, got 11,\nand I built the foundation.\n\n00:15:29.588 --> 00:15:30.782\n18 years later,\n\n00:15:30.806 --> 00:15:34.252\nI'm proud to tell you last year we fed\n2 million people in 35 countries\n\n00:15:34.276 --> 00:15:35.460\nthrough our foundation.\n\n00:15:35.484 -->

contribute\n\n00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:50.799\nonce they've had the chance\nto experience it, not talk about it.\n\n00:15:50.823 --> 00:15:52.614\nSo, finally -- I'm about out of time.\n\n00:15:52.638 --> 00:15:55.497\nThe target that shapes you --\n\n00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:57.380\nHere's what's different about people.\n\n00:15:57.404 --> 00:15:58.589\nWe have the same needs.\n\n00:15:58.613 --> 00:16:01.480\nBut are you a certainty freak,\nis that what you value most,\n\n00:16:01.504 --> 00:16:02.681\nor uncertainty?\n\n00:16:02.705 --> 00:16:06.246\nThis man couldn't be a certainty

00:16:12.559\nbut what your lead system is\ntilts you in a different direction.\n\n00:16:12.583 --> 00:16:15.719\nAnd as you move in a direction,\nyou have a destination or destiny.\n\n00:16:15.743 --> 00:16:17.168\nThe second piece is the map.\n\n00:16:17.192 --> 00:16:19.468\nThe operating system\ntells you how to get there,\n\n00:16:19.492 --> 00:16:20.773\nand some people's map is,\n\n00:16:20.797 --> 00:16:23.568\n\"I'm going to save lives\neven if I die for other people,\"\n\n00:16:23.592 --> 00:16:24.768\nand they're a fireman,\n\n00:16:24.792 --> 00:16:27.708\nand somebody else says,\n\"I'm going to kill people to do it.\"\n\n00:16:27.732 --> 00:16:30.310\nThey're trying to meet\nthe same needs of significance.\n\n00:16:30.334 --> 00:16:32.527\nThey want to honor God\nor honor their family.\n\n00:16:32.551 --> 00:16:34.073\nBut they have a different map.\n\n00:16:34.097 --> 00:16:37.976\nAnd there are seven different beliefs;\nI can't go through them, because I'm done.\n\n00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.329\nThe last piece is emotion.\n\n00:16:39.353 --> 00:16:41.354\nOne of the parts of the map is like time.\n\n00:16:41.378 --> 00:16:43.667\nSome people's idea\nof a long time is 100 years.\n\n00:16:43.691 --> 00:16:46.366\nSomebody else's is three seconds,\nwhich is what I have.\n\n00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.161\nAnd the last one I've already mentioned\nthat fell to you.\n\n00:16:49.185 --> 00:16:50.908\nIf you've got a target and a map --\n\n00:16:50.932 --> 00:16:52.865\nI can't use Google because I love Macs,\n\n00:16:52.889 --> 00:16:54.985\nand they haven't made it\ngood for Macs yet.\n\n00:16:55.009 --> 00:16:56.290\nSo if you use MapQuest --\n\n00:16:56.314 --> 00:16:58.729\nhow many have made\nthis fatal mistake of using it?\n\n00:16:58.753 --> 00:17:00.849\nYou use this thing\nand you don't get there.\n\n00:17:00.873 --> 00:17:04.509\nImagine if your beliefs guarantee\nyou can never get to where you want to go.\n\n00:17:04.533 --> 00:17:05.610\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:05.634 --> 00:17:06.968\nThe last thing is emotion.\n\n00:17:06.992 --> 00:17:08.996\nHere's what I'll tell you about emotion.\n\n00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.495\nThere are 6,000 emotions\n\n00:17:10.519 --> 00:17:12.808\nthat we have words for\nin the English language,\n\n00:17:12.832 --> 00:17:15.988\nwhich is just a linguistic representation\nthat changes by language.\n\n00:17:16.012 --> 00:17:18.312\nBut if your dominant emotions --\n\n00:17:18.336 --> 00:17:21.063\nIf I have 20,000 people or 1,000\n\n00:17:21.087 --> 00:17:24.139\nand I have them write down\nall the emotions that they experience\n\n00:17:24.163 --> 00:17:25.164\nin an average week,\n\n00:17:25.188 --> 00:17:27.118\nand I give them as long as they need,\n\n00:17:27.142 --> 00:17:29.431\nand on one side\nthey write empowering emotions,\n\n00:17:29.455 --> 00:17:30.770\nthe other's disempowering,\n\n00:17:30.794 --> 00:17:33.321\nguess how many emotions\nthey experience? Less than 12.\n\n00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:35.441\nAnd half of those\nmake them feel like shit.\n\n00:17:35.465 --> 00:17:36.890\nThey have six good feelings.\n\n00:17:36.914 --> 00:17:38.554\nHappy, happy, excited, oh shit,\n\n00:17:38.578 --> 00:17:40.821\nfrustrated, frustrated,\noverwhelmed, depressed.\n\n00:17:40.845 --> 00:17:42.318\nHow many of you know somebody\n\n00:17:42.342 --> 00:17:45.113\nwho, no matter what happens,\nfinds a way to get pissed off?\n\n00:17:45.137 --> 00:17:46.317\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:46.341 --> 00:17:50.682\nOr no matter what happens,\nthey find a way to be happy or excited.\n\n00:17:50.706 --> 00:17:52.710\nHow many of you know somebody like this?\n\n00:17:52.734 --> 00:17:55.680\nWhen 9/11 happened, I'll finish\nwith this, I was in Hawaii.\n\n00:17:55.998 --> 00:17:58.367\nI was with 2,000 people from 45 countries,\n\n00:17:58.391 --> 00:18:00.777\nwe were translating\nfour languages simultaneously\n\n00:18:00.801 --> 00:18:02.921\nfor a program I was conducting,\nfor a week.\n\n00:18:03.233 --> 00:18:05.474\nThe night before was called\nEmotional Mastery.\n\n00:18:05.498 --> 00:18:07.883\nI got up, had no plan\nfor this, and I said --\n\n00:18:07.907 --> 00:18:11.005\nwe had fireworks,\nI do crazy shit, fun stuff,\n\n00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:12.310\nand at the end, I stopped.\n\n00:18:12.334 --> 00:18:15.057\nI had this plan, but I never know\nwhat I'm going to say.\n\n00:18:15.081 --> 00:18:16.506\nAnd all of a sudden, I said,\n\n00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.578\n\"When do people really start to live?\nWhen they face death.\"\n\n00:18:19.602 --> 00:18:21.310\nAnd I went through this whole thing\n\n00:18:21.334 --> 00:18:23.816\nabout, if you weren't going\nto get off this island,\n\n00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.033\nif nine days from now,\nyou were going to die,\n\n00:18:26.057 --> 00:18:28.876\nwho would you call,\nwhat would you say, what would you do?\n\n00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.568\nThat night is when 9/11 happened.\n\n00:18:30.592 --> 00:18:33.458\nOne woman had come to the seminar,\nand when she came there,\n\n00:18:33.482 --> 00:18:36.157\nher previous boyfriend had been\nkidnapped and murdered.\n\n00:18:36.181 --> 00:18:38.856\nHer new boyfriend wanted to marry her,\nand she said no.\n\n00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.237\nHe said, \"If you go to that Hawaii thing,\nit's over with us.\"\n\n00:18:42.261 --> 00:18:43.497\nShe said, \"It's over.\"\n\n00:18:43.521 --> 00:18:46.486\nWhen I finished that night,\nshe called him and left a message\n\n00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:49.474\nat the top of the World Trade Center\nwhere he worked, saying,\n\n00:18:49.498 --> 00:18:52.027\n\"I love you, I want you to know\nI want to marry you.\n\n00:18:52.051 --> 00:18:53.455\nIt was stupid of me.\"\n\n00:18:53.479 --> 00:18:56.877\nShe was asleep, because it was 3 a.m.\nfor us, when he called her back,\n\n00:18:56.901 --> 00:18:59.781\nand said, \"Honey, I can't tell you\nwhat this means.\n\n00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:03.154\nI don't know how to tell you this,\nbut you gave me the greatest gift,\n\n00:19:03.178 --> 00:19:04.535\nbecause I'm going to die.\"\n\n00:19:05.122 --> 00:19:07.460\nAnd she played the recording\nfor us in the room.\n\n00:19:07.484 --> 00:19:08.909\nShe was on Larry King later.\n\n00:19:08.933 --> 00:19:10.889\nAnd he said, \"You're probably wondering\n\n00:19:10.913 --> 00:19:13.005\nhow on Earth this could\nhappen to you twice.\n\n00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:15.511\nAll I can say is this must be\nGod's message to you.\n\n00:19:15.535 --> 00:19:18.066\nFrom now on, every day,\ngive your all, love your all.\n\n00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.069\nDon't let anything ever stop you.\"\n\n00:19:20.665 --> 00:19:22.908\nShe finishes, and a man\nstands up, and he says,\n\n00:19:22.932 --> 00:19:24.508\n\"I'm from Pakistan, I'm a Muslim.\n\n00:19:24.532 --> 00:19:26.725\nI'd love to hold your hand\nand say I'm sorry,\n\n00:19:26.749 --> 00:19:28.963\nbut frankly, this is retribution.\"\n\n00:19:30.088 --> 00:19:32.571\nI can't tell you the rest,\nbecause I'm out of time.\n\n00:19:32.595 --> 00:19:39.253\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:39.277 --> 00:19:40.453\nAre you sure?\n\n00:19:40.477 --> 00:19:44.773\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:44.797 --> 00:19:45.973\n10 seconds!\n\n00:19:45.997 --> 00:19:49.305\n(Laughter and applause)\n\n00:19:49.329 --> 00:19:51.276\n10 seconds, I want to be respectful.\n\n00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:52.436\nAll I can tell you is,\n\n00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.067\nI brought this man on stage\n\n00:19:54.091 --> 00:19:57.032\nwith a man from New York who worked\nin the World Trade Center,\n\n00:19:57.056 --> 00:19:59.056\nbecause I had about 200 New Yorkers there.\n\n00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.515\nMore than 50 lost\ntheir entire companies, friends,\n\n00:20:01.539 --> 00:20:03.061\nmarking off their Palm Pilots.\n\n00:20:03.085 --> 00:20:05.663\nOne financial trader,\nwoman made of steel, bawling --\n\n00:20:05.687 --> 00:20:07.512\n30 friends crossing off that all died.\n\n00:20:07.536 --> 00:20:10.842\nAnd I said, \"What are we\ngoing to focus on?\n\n00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:13.868\nWhat does this mean\nand what are we going to do?\"\n\n00:20:13.892 --> 00:20:15.964\nAnd I got the group to focus on:\n\n00:20:15.988 --> 00:20:17.704\nif you didn't lose somebody today,\n\n00:20:17.728 --> 00:20:20.306\nyour focus is going to be\nhow to serve somebody else.\n\n00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.438\nThen one woman stood up\nand was so angry, screaming and yelling.\n\n00:20:23.462 --> 00:20:26.378\nI found out she wasn't from New York,\nshe's not an American,\n\n00:20:26.402 --> 00:20:27.731\ndoesn't know anybody here.\n\n00:20:27.755 --> 00:20:29.517\nI asked, \"Do you always get angry?\"\n\n00:20:29.541 --> 00:20:30.718\nShe said, \"Yes.\"\n\n00:20:30.742 --> 00:20:32.934\nGuilty people got guilty,\nsad people got sad.\n\n00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:35.633\nI took these two men\nand I did an indirect negotiation.\n\n00:20:35.657 --> 00:20:38.042\nJewish man with family\nin the occupied territory,\n\n00:20:38.066 --> 00:20:41.320\nsomeone in New York who would have died\nif he was at work that day,\n\n00:20:41.344 --> 00:20:43.444\nand this man who wanted to be a terrorist,\n\n00:20:43.468 --> 00:20:44.748\nand I made it very clear.\n\n00:20:44.772 --> 00:20:47.689\nThis integration is on a film,\nwhich I'd be happy to send you,\n\n00:20:47.713 --> 00:20:49.139\ninstead of my verbalization,\n\n00:20:49.163 --> 00:20:51.263\nbut the two of them not only came together\n\n00:20:51.287 --> 00:20:53.721\nand changed their beliefs\nand models of the world,\n\n00:20:53.745 --> 00:20:56.467\nbut worked together to bring,\nfor almost four years now,\n\n00:20:56.491 --> 00:20:58.370\nthrough various mosques and synagogues,\n\n00:20:58.394 --> 00:21:00.012\nthe idea of how to create peace.\n\n00:21:00.036 --> 00:21:02.699\nAnd he wrote a book, called\n\"My Jihad, My Way of Peace.\"\n\n00:21:02.723 --> 00:21:04.246\nSo, transformation can happen.\n\n00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:05.494\nMy invitation to you is:\n\n00:21:05.518 --> 00:21:07.049\nexplore your web,\n\n00:21:07.073 --> 00:21:08.623\nthe web in here --\n\n00:21:08.647 --> 00:21:12.235\nthe needs, the beliefs, the emotions\nthat are controlling you,\n\n00:21:12.259 --> 00:21:13.436\nfor two reasons:\n\n00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.757\nso there's more of you to give,\nand achieve, too,\n\n00:21:15.781 --> 00:21:17.069\nbut I mean give,\n\n00:21:17.093 --> 00:21:19.146\nbecause that's what's\ngoing to fill you up.\n\n00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:20.998\nAnd secondly, so you can appreciate --\n\n00:21:21.022 --> 00:21:23.841\nnot just understand,\nthat's intellectual, that's the mind,\n\n00:21:23.865 --> 00:21:25.963\nbut appreciate\nwhat's driving other people.\n\n00:21:25.987 --> 00:21:28.228\nIt's the only way\nour world's going to change.\n\n00:21:28.252 --> 00:21:30.830\nGod bless you, thank you.\nI hope this was of service.\n\n00:21:30.854 -->

seventh birthday, I came downstairs to the kitchen, where my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading the paper or something, and I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway, and they said, \"Hey, happy birthday!\" And I said, \"I'm seven.\" And my father smiled and said, \"Well, you know what that means, don't you?\" And I said, \"Yeah, that I'm going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents?\" And my dad said, \"Well, yes. But more importantly, being seven means that you've reached the age of reason, and you're now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man.\"(Laughter)Now, I had heard this phrase, \"age of reason,\" before. Sister Mary Kevin had been bandying it about my second-grade class at school. But when she said it, the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations for our first communion and our first confession, and everybody knew that was really all about the white dress and the white veil. And anyway, I hadn't really paid all that much attention to that phrase, \"age of reason.\" So, I said, \"Yeah, yeah, age of reason. What does that mean again?\" And my dad said, \"Well, we believe, in the Catholic Church, that God knows that little kids don't know the difference between right and wrong, but when you're seven, you're old enough to know better. So, you've grown up and reached the age of reason, and now God will start keeping notes on you, and begin your permanent record.\"(Laughter)And I said, \"Oh ... Wait a minute. You mean all that time, up till today, all that time I was so good, God didn't notice it?\" And my mom said, \"Well, I noticed it.\"(Laughter)And I thought, \"How could I not have known this before? How could it not have sunk in when they'd been telling me? All that being good and no real credit for it. And worst of all, how could I not have realized this very important information until the very day that it was basically useless to me?\" So I said, \"Well, Mom and Dad, what about Santa Claus? I mean, Santa Claus knows if you're naughty or nice, right?\" And my dad said, \"Yeah, but, honey, I think that's technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas.\" And my mother said, \"Oh, Bob, stop it. Let's just tell her. I mean, she's seven. Julie, there is no Santa Claus.\"(Laughter)Now, this was actually not that upsetting to me. My parents had this whole elaborate story about Santa Claus: how they had talked to Santa Claus himself and agreed that instead of Santa delivering our presents over the night of Christmas Eve, like he did for every other family who got to open their surprises first thing Christmas morning, our family would give Santa more time. Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass on Christmas morning, but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss. Which made me very suspicious. It was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents. I mean, my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style, and my mother's handwriting was so close to Santa's.(Laughter)Plus, why would Santa save time by having to loop back to our house after he'd gone to everybody else's? There was only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence: our family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit, and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment, this humiliation of rejection by Santa, who was jolly \u2014 but let's face it, he was also very judgmental. So to find out that there was no Santa Claus at all was actually sort of a relief.I left the kitchen not really in shock about Santa, but rather, I was just dumbfounded about how I could have missed this whole age of reason thing. It was too late for me, but maybe I could help someone else, someone who could use the information. They had to fit two criteria: they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason, and not yet seven. The answer was clear: my brother Bill. He was six. Well, I finally found Bill about a block away from our house at this public school playground. It was a Saturday, and he was all by himself, just kicking a ball against the side of a wall. I ran up to him and said, \"Bill! I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven, and then you're capable of committing any and all sins against God and man.\" And Bill said, \"So?\" And I said, \"So, you're six. You have a whole year to do anything you want to and God won't notice it.\" And he said, \"So?\" And I said, \"So? So everything!\" And I turned to run. I was so angry with him. But when I got to the top of the steps, I turned around dramatically and said, \"Oh, by the way, Bill \u2014 there is no Santa Claus.\"(Laughter)Now, I didn't know it at the time, but I really wasn't turning seven on September 10th. For my 13th birthday, I planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends, but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said, \"I need to speak to you privately. September 10th is not your birthday. It's October 10th.\" And I said, \"What?\"(Laughter)And she said ...(Laughter)\"Listen. The cut-off date to start kindergarten was September 15th.\"(Laughter)\"So I told them that your birthday was September 10th, and then I wasn't sure that you weren't just going to go blab it all over the place, so I started to tell you your birthday was September 10th. But, Julie, you were so ready to start school, honey. You were so ready.\" I thought about it, and when I was four, I was already the oldest of four children, and my mother even had another child to come, so what I think she \u2014 understandably \u2014 really meant was that she was so ready, she was so ready. Then she said, \"Don't worry, Julie. Every year on October 10th, when it was your birthday but you didn't realize it, I made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day.\"(Laughter)Which was comforting, but troubling. My mother had been celebrating my birthday with me, without me.(Laughter)What was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that I had to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends. What was most upsetting was that this meant I was not a Virgo. I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom. And I read my horoscope every single day, and it was so totally me.(Laughter)And this meant that I was a Libra? So, I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster. The Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair, sort of lounging by some water, but the Libra poster is just a huge scale. This was around the time that I started filling out physically, and I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls, and frankly, the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing.(Laughter)But I got the new Libra poster, and I started to read my new Libra horoscope, and I was astonished to find that it was also totally me.(Laughter)It wasn't until years later, looking back on this whole age-of-reason, change-of-birthday thing, that it dawned on me: I wasn't turning seven when I thought I turned seven. I had a whole other month to do anything I wanted to before God started keeping tabs on me. Oh, life can be so cruel. One day, two Mormon missionaries came to my door. Now, I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles, and my block is \u2014 well, it's a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door. Sometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven. And sometimes I get teenagers who promise me that they won't join a gang and just start robbing people, if I only buy some magazine subscriptions from them. So normally, I just ignore the doorbell, but on this day, I answered. And there stood two boys, each about 19, in white, starched short-sleeved shirts, and they had little name tags that identified them as official representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and they said they had a message for me, from God. I said, \"A message for me? From God?\" And they said, \"Yes.\" Now, I was raised in the Pacific Northwest, around a lot of Church of Latter-day Saints people and, you know, I've worked with them and even dated them, but I never really knew the doctrine, or what they said to people when they were out on a mission, and I guess I was sort of curious, so I said, \"Well, please, come in.\" And they looked really happy, because I don't think this happens to them all that often.(Laughter)And I sat them down, and I got them glasses of water \u2014 Ok, I got it, I got it. I got them glasses of water. Don't touch my hair, that's the thing.(Laughter)You can't put a video of myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair. Ok.(Laughter)So I sat them down and I got them glasses of water, and after niceties, they said, \"Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart?\" And I thought, \"Well, of course I believe in God, but you know, I don't like that word 'heart,' because it anthropomorphizes God, and I don't like the word, 'his,' either, because that sexualizes God.\" But I didn't want to argue semantics with these boys, so after a very long, uncomfortable pause, I said, \"Yes, yes, I do. I feel very loved.\" And they looked at each other and smiled, like that was the right answer. And then they said, \"Do you believe that we're all brothers and sisters on this planet?\" And I said, \"Yes, I do.\" And I was so relieved that it was a question I could answer so quickly. And they said, \"Well, then we have a story to tell you.\"And they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi, who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC. Now, apparently in Jerusalem in 600 BC, everyone was completely bad and evil. Every single one of them: man, woman, child, infant, fetus. And God came to Lehi and said to him, \"Put your family on a boat and I will lead you out of here.\" And God did lead them. He led them to America. I said, \"America?(Laughter)From Jerusalem to America by boat in 600 BC?\" And they said, \"Yes.\"(Laughter)Then they told me how Lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced, and over the course of 600 years, there were two great races of them, the Nephites and the Lamanites, and the Nephites were totally good \u2014 each and every one of them \u2014 and the Lamanites were totally bad and evil \u2014 every single one of them just bad to the bone.Then, after Jesus died on the cross for our sins, on his way up to heaven, he stopped by America and visited the Nephites.(Laughter)And he told them that if they all remained totally, totally good \u2014 each and every one of them \u2014 they would win the war against the evil Lamanites. But apparently somebody blew it, because the Lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites. All but one guy, this guy named Mormon, who managed to survive by hiding in the woods. And he made sure this whole story was written down in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates, which he then buried near Palmyra, New York.(Laughter)Well, I was just on the edge of my seat.(Laughter)I said, \"What happened to the Lamanites?\" And they said, \"Well, they became our Native Americans, here in the U.S.\" And I said, \"So, you believe the Native Americans are descended from a people who were totally evil?\" And they said, \"Yes.\" Then they told me how this guy named Joseph Smith found those buried gold plates right in his backyard, and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat and then buried his face into, and this allowed him to translate the gold plates from the reformed Egyptian into English.Well, at this point I just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch.(Laughter)I wanted to say \u2014(Applause)\"Ok, don't start with this story.\"(Laughter)I mean, even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start \u2014(Applause)telling people all about Xenu, the evil intergalactic overlord. Then, they said, \"Do you believe that God speaks to us through his righteous prophets?\" And I said, \"No, I don't,\" because I was sort of upset about this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story, but the truth was, I hadn't really thought this through, so I backpedaled a little and I said, \"Well, what exactly do you mean by 'righteous'? And what do you mean by prophets? Like, could the prophets be women?\" And they said, \"No.\" And I said, \"Why?\" And they said, \"Well, it's because God gave women a gift that is so spectacular, it is so wonderful, that the only gift he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy.\" What is this wonderful gift God gave women, I wondered? Maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt?(Laughter)Women's longer lifespan? The fact that women tend to be much less violent than men? But no \u2014 it wasn't any of these gifts. They said, \"Well, it's her ability to bear children.\" I said, \"Oh, come on. I mean, even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45, assuming they didn't die from exhaustion, it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of God.\" And they said, \"No.\"(Laughter)Well, then they didn't look so fresh-faced and cute to me any more, but they had more to say. They said, \"Well, we also believe that if you're a Mormon, and if you're in good standing with the church, when you die, you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity.\" And I said, \"Oh, dear.(Laughter)That wouldn't be such a good incentive for me.\"(Laughter)And they said, \"Oh.(Laughter)Hey! Well, we also believe that when you go to heaven, you get your body restored to you in its best original state. Like, if you'd lost a leg, well, you get it back. Or, if you'd gone blind, you could see.\" I said, \"Oh. Now, I don't have a uterus, because I had cancer a few years ago. So does this mean that if I went to heaven, I would get my old uterus back?\" And they said, \"Sure.\" And I said, \"I don't want it back. I'm happy without it.\" Gosh. What if you had a nose job and you liked it?(Laughter)Would God force you to get your old nose back? Then they gave me this Book of Mormon, told me to read this chapter and that chapter, and said they'd come back and check in on me, and I think I said something like, \"Please don't hurry,\" or maybe just, \"Please don't,\" and they were gone.Ok, so I initially felt really superior to these boys, and smug in my more conventional faith. But then the more I thought about it, the more I had to be honest with myself. If someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology and dogma for the very first time, and they said, \"We believe that God impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse, and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us.\"(Laughter)\"And she had a baby, and that's the son of God,\" I mean, I would think that's equally ridiculous. I'm just so used to that story.(Laughter)So, I couldn't let myself feel condescending towards these boys. But the question they asked me when they first arrived really stuck in my head: Did I believe that God loved me with all his heart? Because I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about that question. Now, if they had asked me, \"Do you feel that God loves you with all his heart?\" Well, that would have been much different, I think I would have instantly answered, \"Yes, yes, I feel it all the time. I feel God's love when I'm hurt and confused, and I feel consoled and cared for. I take shelter in God's love when I don't understand why tragedy hits, and I feel God's love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see.\" But since they asked me that question with the word \"believe\" in it, somehow it was all different, because I wasn't exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt.", "id": 86, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:15.862\nOn September 10, the morning\nof my seventh birthday,\n\n00:00:15.886 --> 00:00:19.277\nI came downstairs to the kitchen,\nwhere my mother was washing the dishes\n\n00:00:19.301 --> 00:00:21.934\nand my father was reading\nthe paper or something,\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:25.244\nand I sort of presented myself to them\nin the doorway, and they said,\n\n00:00:25.268 --> 00:00:29.934\n\"Hey, happy birthday!\"\nAnd I said, \"I'm seven.\"\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.934\nAnd my father smiled and said,\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.344\n\"Well, you know\nwhat that means, don't you?\"\n\n00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:37.194\nAnd I said, \"Yeah,\nthat I'm going to have a party\n\n00:00:37.218 --> 00:00:39.441\nand a cake and get a lot of presents?\"\n\n00:00:39.465 --> 00:00:41.676\nAnd my dad said, \"Well, yes.\n\n00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.860\nBut more importantly,\n\n00:00:42.884 --> 00:00:45.829\nbeing seven means that\nyou've reached the age of reason,\n\n00:00:45.853 --> 00:00:50.380\nand you're now capable of committing\nany and all sins against God and man.\"\n\n00:00:50.404 --> 00:00:53.256\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.506\nNow, I had heard this phrase,\n\"age of reason,\" before.\n\n00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.781\nSister Mary Kevin\nhad been bandying it about\n\n00:00:58.805 --> 00:01:00.502\nmy second-grade class at school.\n\n00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:01.678\nBut when she said it,\n\n00:01:01.702 --> 00:01:04.763\nthe phrase seemed all caught up\nin the excitement of preparations\n\n00:01:04.787 --> 00:01:07.094\nfor our first communion\nand our first confession,\n\n00:01:07.118 --> 00:01:09.944\nand everybody knew that was really\nall about the white dress\n\n00:01:09.968 --> 00:01:11.119\nand the white veil.\n\n00:01:11.143 --> 00:01:13.783\nAnd anyway, I hadn't really paid\nall that much attention\n\n00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:15.646\nto that phrase, \"age of reason.\"\n\n00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.858\nSo, I said, \"Yeah, yeah, age of reason.\nWhat does that mean again?\"\n\n00:01:19.882 --> 00:01:23.512\nAnd my dad said, \"Well, we believe,\nin the Catholic Church,\n\n00:01:23.536 --> 00:01:27.413\nthat God knows that little kids don't know\nthe difference between right and wrong,\n\n00:01:27.437 --> 00:01:30.075\nbut when you're seven,\nyou're old enough to know better.\n\n00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:32.714\nSo, you've grown up\nand reached the age of reason,\n\n00:01:32.738 --> 00:01:35.355\nand now God will start\nkeeping notes on you,\n\n00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:37.335\nand begin your permanent record.\"\n\n00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:38.369\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:38.393 --> 00:01:41.074\nAnd I said, \"Oh ...\n\n00:01:42.725 --> 00:01:43.940\nWait a minute.\n\n00:01:43.964 --> 00:01:47.138\nYou mean all that time, up till today,\n\n00:01:47.162 --> 00:01:51.310\nall that time I was so good,\nGod didn't notice it?\"\n\n00:01:51.334 --> 00:01:53.934\nAnd my mom said, \"Well, I noticed it.\"\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.543\nAnd I thought, \"How could\nI not have known this before?\n\n00:01:58.567 --> 00:02:01.297\nHow could it not have sunk in\nwhen they'd been telling me?\n\n00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:03.489\nAll that being good\nand no real credit for it.\n\n00:02:03.513 --> 00:02:05.722\nAnd worst of all,\nhow could I not have realized\n\n00:02:05.746 --> 00:02:07.230\nthis very important information\n\n00:02:07.254 --> 00:02:10.176\nuntil the very day\nthat it was basically useless to me?\"\n\n00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.566\nSo I said, \"Well, Mom and Dad,\nwhat about Santa Claus?\n\n00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.934\nI mean, Santa Claus knows\nif you're naughty or nice, right?\"\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.934\nAnd my dad said, \"Yeah, but, honey,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:22.223\nI think that's technically just\nbetween Thanksgiving and Christmas.\"\n\n00:02:22.247 --> 00:02:26.659\nAnd my mother said, \"Oh, Bob, stop it.\nLet's just tell her.

He was six.\n\n00:04:06.235 --> 00:04:07.497\nWell, I finally found Bill\n\n00:04:07.521 --> 00:04:10.730\nabout a block away from our house\nat this public school playground.\n\n00:04:10.754 --> 00:04:12.870\nIt was a Saturday,\nand he was all by himself,\n\n00:04:12.894 --> 00:04:15.100\njust kicking a ball\nagainst the side of a wall.\n\n00:04:15.124 --> 00:04:16.934\nI ran up to him and said, \"Bill!\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:20.101\nI just realized that the age of reason\nstarts when you turn seven,\n\n00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:22.671\nand then you're capable\nof committing any and all sins\n\n00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:23.846\nagainst God and man.\"\n\n00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.497\nAnd Bill said, \"So?\"\n\n00:04:25.882 --> 00:04:27.868\nAnd I said, \"So, you're six.\n\n00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:31.930\nYou have a whole year to do anything\nyou want to and God won't notice it.\"\n\n00:04:31.954 --> 00:04:33.696\nAnd he said, \"So?\"\n\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.291\nAnd I said, \"So?

his descendants\n\n00:10:33.125 --> 00:10:36.000\nreproduced and reproduced,\nand over the course of 600 years,\n\n00:10:36.024 --> 00:10:39.278\nthere were two great races of them,\nthe Nephites and the Lamanites,\n\n00:10:39.302 --> 00:10:42.752\nand the Nephites were totally good --\neach and every one of them --\n\n00:10:42.776 --> 00:10:44.943\nand the Lamanites\nwere totally bad and evil --\n\n00:10:44.967 --> 00:10:47.118\nevery single one of them\njust bad to the bone.\n\n00:10:47.142 --> 00:10:50.650\nThen, after Jesus died\non the cross for our sins,\n\n00:10:50.674 --> 00:10:51.841\non his way up to heaven,\n\n00:10:51.865 --> 00:10:54.438\nhe stopped by America\nand visited the Nephites.\n\n00:10:54.462 --> 00:10:55.488\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:55.512 --> 00:10:59.000\nAnd he told them that if they all remained\ntotally, totally good --\n\n00:10:59.024 --> 00:11:00.406\neach and every one of them --\n\n00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.131\nthey would win the war\nagainst the evil Lamanites.\n\n00:11:03.155 --> 00:11:05.656\nBut apparently somebody blew it,\n\n00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.417\nbecause the Lamanites\nwere able to kill all the Nephites.\n\n00:11:08.441 --> 00:11:10.707\nAll but one guy, this guy named Mormon,\n\n00:11:10.731 --> 00:11:13.477\nwho managed to survive\nby hiding in the woods.\n\n00:11:13.501 --> 00:11:16.211\nAnd he made sure\nthis whole story was written down\n\n00:11:16.235 --> 00:11:20.603\nin reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics\nchiseled onto gold plates,\n\n00:11:20.627 --> 00:11:23.408\nwhich he then buried\nnear Palmyra, New York.\n\n00:11:23.718 --> 00:11:29.193\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:29.217 --> 00:11:31.934\nWell, I was just on the edge of my seat.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.300\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:35.324 --> 00:11:38.176\nI said, \"What happened to the Lamanites?\"\n\n00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.042\nAnd they said, \"Well, they became\nour Native Americans, here in the U.S.\"\n\n00:11:42.066 --> 00:11:45.252\nAnd I said, \"So, you believe\nthe Native Americans are descended\n\n00:11:45.276 --> 00:11:47.317\nfrom a people who were totally evil?\"\n\n00:11:47.341 --> 00:11:49.198\nAnd they said, \"Yes.\"\n\n00:11:49.585 --> 00:11:52.641\nThen they told me\nhow this guy named Joseph Smith\n\n00:11:52.665 --> 00:11:56.300\nfound those buried gold plates\nright in his backyard,\n\n00:11:56.324 --> 00:12:00.046\nand he also found this magic stone\nback there that he put into his hat\n\n00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.568\nand then buried his face into,\n\n00:12:01.592 --> 00:12:03.952\nand this allowed him\nto translate the gold plates\n\n00:12:03.976 --> 00:12:06.411\nfrom the reformed Egyptian into English.\n\n00:12:06.848 --> 00:12:10.223\nWell, at this point I just wanted to give\nthese two boys some advice\n\n00:12:10.247 --> 00:12:11.676\nabout their pitch.\n\n00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.541\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:14.565

00:12:20.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.001\nI mean, even the Scientologists\n\n00:12:23.025 --> 00:12:26.310\nknow to start with a personality test\nbefore they start --\n\n00:12:26.334 --> 00:12:27.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:32.412\ntelling people all about Xenu,\nthe evil intergalactic overlord.\n\n00:12:33.096 --> 00:12:35.683\nThen, they said, \"Do you believe\nthat God speaks to us\n\n00:12:35.707 --> 00:12:37.247\nthrough his righteous prophets?\"\n\n00:12:37.271 --> 00:12:38.524\nAnd I said, \"No, I don't,\"\n\n00:12:38.548 -->

00:13:01.397\nAnd they said, \"Well, it's because\nGod gave women a gift\n\n00:13:01.421 --> 00:13:03.392\nthat is so spectacular,\n\n00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:08.193\nit is so wonderful, that the only gift\nhe had left over to give men\n\n00:13:08.217 --> 00:13:09.836\nwas the gift of prophecy.\"\n\n00:13:10.614 --> 00:13:13.937\nWhat is this wonderful gift\nGod gave women, I wondered?\n\n00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:17.300\nMaybe their greater ability\nto cooperate and adapt?\n\n00:13:17.324 --> 00:13:18.336\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.737\nWomen's longer lifespan?\n\n00:13:19.761 --> 00:13:22.965\nThe fact that women tend to be\nmuch less violent than men?\n\n00:13:22.989 --> 00:13:25.247\nBut no -- it wasn't any of these gifts.\n\n00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:28.335\nThey said, \"Well, it's her ability\nto bear children.\"\n\n00:13:28.359 --> 00:13:29.787\nI said, \"Oh, come on.\n\n00:13:29.811 --> 00:13:32.630\nI mean, even if women\ntried to have a baby every single year\n\n00:13:32.654 --> 00:13:35.591\nfrom the time they were 15\nto the time they were 45,\n\n00:13:35.615 --> 00:13:37.611\nassuming they didn't die from exhaustion,\n\n00:13:37.635 --> 00:13:40.523\nit still seems like some women\nwould have some time left over\n\n00:13:40.547 --> 00:13:41.993\nto hear the word of God.\"\n\n00:13:42.017 --> 00:13:43.934\nAnd they said, \"No.\"\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:50.122\nWell, then they didn't look so\nfresh-faced and cute to me any more,\n\n00:13:50.146 --> 00:13:51.351\nbut they had more to say.\n\n00:13:51.375 --> 00:13:54.109\nThey said, \"Well, we also believe\nthat if you're a Mormon,\n\n00:13:54.133 --> 00:13:56.347\nand if you're in good standing\nwith the church,\n\n00:13:56.371 --> 00:13:58.507\nwhen you die, you get to go to heaven\n\n00:13:58.531 --> 00:14:01.312\nand be with your family for all eternity.\"\n\n00:14:01.336 --> 00:14:03.394\nAnd I said, \"Oh, dear.\n\n00:14:03.418 --> 00:14:10.322\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:10.346 --> 00:14:12.545\nThat wouldn't be\nsuch a good incentive for me.\"\n\n00:14:12.569 --> 00:14:13.869\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:13.893 --> 00:14:15.378\nAnd they said, \"Oh.\n\n00:14:15.402 --> 00:14:16.761\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:16.785 --> 00:14:19.830\nHey! Well, we also believe\nthat when you go to heaven,\n\n00:14:19.854 --> 00:14:22.741\nyou get your body restored to you\nin its best original state.\n\n00:14:22.765 --> 00:14:25.195\nLike, if you'd lost a leg,\nwell, you get it back.\n\n00:14:25.219 --> 00:14:27.195\nOr, if you'd gone blind, you could see.\"\n\n00:14:27.219 --> 00:14:30.188\nI said, \"Oh. Now, I don't have a uterus,\n\n00:14:30.212 --> 00:14:32.303\nbecause I had cancer a few years ago.\n\n00:14:32.327 --> 00:14:34.373\nSo does this mean\nthat if I went to heaven,\n\n00:14:34.397 --> 00:14:36.429\nI would get my old uterus back?\"\n\n00:14:36.453 --> 00:14:38.509\nAnd they said, \"Sure.\"\n\n00:14:38.533 --> 00:14:44.298\nAnd I said, \"I don't want it back.\nI'm happy without it.\" Gosh.\n\n00:14:44.322 --> 00:14:47.289\nWhat if you had a nose job\nand you liked it?\n\n00:14:47.313 --> 00:14:49.019\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:49.043 --> 00:14:51.934\nWould God force you\nto get your old nose back?\n\n00:14:52.782 --> 00:14:54.703\nThen they gave me this Book of Mormon,\n\n00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:56.880\ntold me to read\nthis chapter and that chapter,\n\n00:14:56.904 --> 00:14:59.182\nand said they'd come back\nand check in on me,\n\n00:14:59.206 --> 00:15:01.871\nand I think I said something\nlike, \"Please don't hurry,\"\n\n00:15:01.895 --> 00:15:04.273\nor maybe just, \"Please don't,\"\nand they were gone.\n\n00:15:04.297 --> 00:15:06.885\nOk, so I initially felt\nreally superior to these boys,\n\n00:15:06.909 --> 00:15:09.892\nand smug in my more conventional faith.\n\n00:15:10.375 --> 00:15:14.054\nBut then the more I thought about it,\nthe more I had to be honest with myself.\n\n00:15:14.078 --> 00:15:15.381\nIf someone came to my door\n\n00:15:15.405 --> 00:15:18.750\nand I was hearing Catholic theology\nand dogma for the very first time,\n\n00:15:18.774 --> 00:15:22.348\nand they said, \"We believe that God\nimpregnated a very young girl\n\n00:15:22.372 --> 00:15:23.934\nwithout the use of intercourse,\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:27.149\nand the fact that she was a virgin\nis maniacally important to us.\"\n\n00:15:27.173 --> 00:15:28.475\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:28.499 --> 00:15:31.646\n\"And she had a baby,\nand that's the son of God,\"\n\n00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.934\nI mean, I would think\nthat's equally ridiculous.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:35.820\nI'm just so used to that story.\n\n00:15:35.844 --> 00:15:36.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:40.414\nSo, I couldn't let myself feel\ncondescending towards these boys.\n\n00:15:40.438 --> 00:15:42.998\nBut the question they asked me\nwhen they first arrived\n\n00:15:43.022 --> 00:15:44.482\nreally stuck in my head:\n\n00:15:44.506 --> 00:15:47.381\nDid I believe that God\nloved me with all his heart?\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:51.112\nBecause I wasn't exactly sure\nhow I felt about that question.\n\n00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.775\nNow, if they had asked me,\n\n00:15:52.799 --> 00:15:56.025\n\"Do you feel that God loves\nyou with all his heart?\"\n\n00:15:56.049 --> 00:16:00.055\nWell, that would have been much different,\nI think I would have instantly answered,\n\n00:16:00.079 --> 00:16:01.704\n\"Yes, yes, I feel it all the time.\n\n00:16:01.728 --> 00:16:04.473\nI feel God's love\nwhen I'm hurt and confused,\n\n00:16:04.497 --> 00:16:07.125\nand I feel consoled and cared for.\n\n00:16:07.149 --> 00:16:11.217\nI take shelter in God's love when\nI don't understand why tragedy hits,\n\n00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:14.934\nand I feel God's love when I look\nwith gratitude at all the beauty I see.\"\n\n00:16:15.506 --> 00:16:18.708\nBut since they asked me that question\nwith the word \"believe\" in it,\n\n00:16:18.732 --> 00:16:20.190\nsomehow it was all different,\n\n00:16:20.214 --> 00:16:25.958\nbecause I wasn't exactly sure\nif I believed what I so clearly felt."}, {"title": "Behind the design of Seattle's library", "duration": "1198", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/joshua_prince_ramus_on_seattle_s_library", "transcript": "I'm going to present three projects in rapid fire. I don't have much time to do it. And I want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid-fire presentation.The first is what I like to call a hyper-rational process. It's a process that takes rationality almost to an absurd level, and it transcends all the baggage that normally comes with what people would call, sort of a rational conclusion to something. And it concludes in something that you see here, that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality.The second \u2014 the second is that this process does not have a signature. There is no authorship. Architects are obsessed with authorship. This is something that has editing and it has teams, but in fact, we no longer see within this process, the traditional master architect creating a sketch that his minions carry out.And the third is that it challenges \u2014 and this is, in the length of this, very hard to support why, connect all these things \u2014 but it challenges the high modernist notion of flexibility. High modernists said we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic, almost anything can happen within them. I call it sort of \"shotgun flexibility\" \u2014 turn your head this way; shoot; and you're bound to kill something. So, this is the promise of high modernism: within a single space, actually, any kind of activity can happen. But as we're seeing, operational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs in terms of design parameters. And so, with this sort of idea, what happens is, whatever actually is in the building on opening day, or whatever seems to be the most immediate need, starts to dwarf the possibility and sort of subsume it, of anything else could ever happen. And so we're proposing a different kind of flexibility, something that we call \"compartmentalized flexibility.\" And the idea is that you, within that continuum, identify a series of points, and you design specifically to them. They can be pushed off-center a little bit, but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum as you originally had hoped. With high modernist flexibility, that doesn't really work.Now I'm going to talk about \u2014 I'm going to build up the Seattle Central Library in this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams, and I truly mean this is the design process that you'll see. With the library staff and the library board, we settled on two core positions. This is the first one, and this is showing, over the last 900 years, the evolution of the book, and other technologies. This diagram was our sort of position piece about the book, and our position was, books are technology \u2014 that's something people forget \u2014 but it's a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media.The second premise \u2014 and this was something that was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of at first \u2014 is that libraries, since the inception of Carnegie Library tradition in America, had a second responsibility, and that was for social roles. Ok, now, this I'll come back to later, but something \u2014 actually, the librarians at first said, \"No, this isn't our mandate. Our mandate is media, and particularly the book.\"So what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building. The upper diagram is what we had seen in a whole host of contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility. Sort of, any activity could happen anywhere. We don't know the future of the library; we don't know the future of the book; and so, we'll use this approach.And what we saw were buildings that were very generic, and worse \u2014 not only were they very generic \u2014 so, not only does the reading room look like the copy room look like the magazine area \u2014 but it meant that whatever issue was troubling the library at that moment was starting to engulf every other activity that was happening in it. And in this case, what was getting engulfed were these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book. And so we proposed what's at the lower diagram. Very dumb approach: simply compartmentalize. Put those things whose evolution we could predict \u2014 and I don't mean that we could say what would actually happen in the future, but we have some certainty of the spectrum of what would happen in the future \u2014 put those in boxes designed specifically for it, and put the things that we can't predict on the rooftops. So that was the core idea.Now, we had to convince the library that social roles were equally important to media, in order to get them to accept this. What you're seeing here is actually their program on the left. That's as it was given to us in all of its clarity and glory. Our first operation was to re-digest it back to them, show it to them and say, \"You know what? We haven't touched it, but only one-third of your own program is dedicated to media and books. Two-thirds of it is already dedicated \u2014 that's the white band below, the thing you said isn't important \u2014 is already dedicated to social functions.\" So once we had presented that back to them, they agreed that this sort of core concept could work. We got the right to go back to first principles \u2014 that's the third diagram. We recombined everything. And then we started making new decisions.What you're seeing on the right is the design of the library, specifically in terms of square footage. On the left of that diagram, here, you'll see a series of five platforms \u2014 sort of combs, collective programs. And on the right are the more indeterminate spaces; things like reading rooms, whose evolution in 20, 30, 40 years we can't predict. So that literally was the design of the building. They signed it, and to their chagrin, we came back a week later, and we presented them this. And as you can see, it is literally the diagram on the right.(Laughter)We just sized \u2014 no, really, I mean that, literally. The things on the left-hand side of the diagram, those are the boxes. We sized them into five compartments. They're super-efficient. We had a very low budget to work with. We pushed them around on the site to make very literal contextual relationships. The reading room should be able to see the water. The main entrance should have a public plaza in front of it to abide by the zoning code, and so forth.So, you see the five platforms, those are the boxes. within each one, a very discrete thing is happening. The area in between is sort of an urban continuum, these things that we can't predict their evolution to the same degree. To give you some sense of the power of this idea, the biggest block is what we call the book spiral. It's literally built in a very inexpensive way \u2014 it is a parking garage for books. It just so happens to be on the 6th through 10th floors of the building, but that is not necessarily an expensive approach. And it allows us to organize the entire Dewey Decimal System on one continuous run; no matter how it grows or contracts within the building, it will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tears that we've all experienced in public libraries.(Laughter)And so this was the final operation, which was to take these blocks as they were all pushed off kilter, and to hold onto them with a skin. That skin serves double duty, again, for economics. One, it is the lateral stability for the entire building; it's a structural element. But its dimensions were designed not only for structure, but also for holding on every piece of glass. The glass was then \u2014 I'll use the word impregnated \u2014 but it had a layer of metal that was called \"stretched metal.\" That metal acts as a microlouver, so from the exterior of the building, the sun sees it as totally opaque, but from the interior, it's entirely transparent.So now I'm going to take you on a tour of the building. Let me see if I can find it. For anyone who gets motion sickness, I apologize. So, this is the building. And I think what's important is, when we first unveiled the building, the public saw it as being totally about our whim and ego. And it was defended, believe it or not, by the librarians. They said, \"Look, we don't know what it is, but we know it's everything that we need it to be, based on the observations that we've done about the program.\" This is going into one of the entries. So, it's an unusual building for a public library, obviously.So now we're going into what we call the living room. This is actually a program that we invented with the library. It was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space. There are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain in downtown Seattle, but there are not so many free places that allow you to get out of the rain. So this was an unprogrammed area where people could pretty much do anything, including eat, yell, play chess and so forth.Now we're moving up into what we call the mixing chamber. That was the main technology area in the building. You'll have to tell me if I'm going too fast for you. And now up. This is actually the place that we put into the building so I could propose to my wife, right there.(Laughter)She said yes.(Laughter)I'm running out of time, so I'm actually going to stop. I can show this to you later. But let's see if I can very quickly get into the book spiral, because I think it's, as I said, the most \u2014 this is the main reading room \u2014 the most unique part of the building. You dizzy yet? Ok, so here, this is the book spiral. So, it's very indiscernible, but it's actually a continuous stair-stepping. It allows you to, on one city block, go up one full floor, so that it's on a continuum.Ok, now I'm going to go back, and I'm going to hit a second project. I'm going to go very, very quickly through this. Now this is the Dallas Theater. It was an unusual client for us, because they came to us and they said, \"We need you to do a new building. We've been working in a temporary space for 30 years, but because of that temporary space, we've become an infamous theater company. Theater is really focused in New York, Chicago and Seattle, with the exception of the Dallas Theater Company.\" And the very fact that they worked in a provisional space meant that for Beckett, they could blow out a wall; they could do \"Cherry Orchard\" and blow a hole through the floor, and so forth.So it was a very daunting task for us to do a brand-new building that could be a pristine building, but keep this kind of experimental nature. And the second is, they were what we call a multi-form theater, they do different kinds of performances in repertory. So they in the morning will do something in arena, then they'll do something in proscenium and so forth. And so they needed to be able to quickly transform between different theater organizations, and for operational budget reasons, this actually no longer happens in pretty much any multi-form theater in the United States, so we needed to figure out a way to overcome that.So our thought was to literally put the theater on its head: to take those things that were previously defined as front-of-house and back-of-house and stack them above house and below house, and to create what we called a theater machine. We invest the money in the operation of the building. It's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere, wherever you place it, the area under it is charged for theatrical performances. And it allowed us to go back to first principles, and redefine fly tower, acoustic enclosure, light enclosure and so forth. And at the push of a button, it allows the artistic director to move between proscenium, thrust, and in fact, arena and traverse and flat floor, in a very quick transfiguration.So in fact, using operational budget, we can \u2014 sorry, capital cost \u2014 we can actually achieve what was no longer achievable in operational cost. And that means that the artistic director now has a palette that he or she can choose from, between a series of forms and a series of processions, because that enclosure around the theater that is normally trapped with front-of-house and back-of-house spaces has been liberated. So an artistic director has the ability to have a performance that enters in a Wagnerian procession, shows the first act in thrust, the intermission in a Greek procession, second act in arena, and so forth.So I'm going to show you what this actually means. This is the theater up close. Any portion around the theater actually can be opened discretely. The light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure, so you can do Beckett with Dallas as the backdrop. Portions can be opened, so you can now actually have motorcycles drive directly into the performance, or you can even just have an open-air performance, or for intermissions. The balconies all move to go between those configurations, but they also disappear. The proscenium line can also disappear. You can bring enormous objects in, so in fact, the Dallas Theater Company \u2014 their first show will be a play about Charles Lindbergh, and they'll want to bring in a real aircraft. And then it also provides them, in the off-season, the ability to actually rent out their space for entirely different things. This is it from a distance. Open up entire portions for different kinds of events. And at night. Again, remove the light enclosure; keep the acoustic enclosure. This is a monster truck show.I'm going to show now the last project. This also is an unusual client. They inverted the whole idea of development. They came to us and they said \u2014 unlike normal developers \u2014 they said, \"We want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in Louisville. That's our main goal.\" And so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money, they saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown. And the fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma, so they worked in reverse. And that pro forma led us to a mixed-use building that was very large, in order to support their aspirations of the art, but it also opened up opportunities for the art itself to collaborate, interact with commercial spaces that actually artists more and more want to work within. And it also charged us with thinking about how to have something that was both a single building and a credible sort of sub-building.So this is Louisville's skyline, and I'm going to take you through the various constraints that led to the project. First: the physical constraints. We actually had to operate on three discrete sites, all of them well smaller than the size of the building. We had to operate next to the new Muhammad Ali Center, and respect it. We had to operate within the 100-year floodplain. Now, this area floods three to four times a year, and there's a levee behind our site, similar to the ones that broke in New Orleans. Had to operate behind the I-64 corridor, a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites. So we're starting to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub. Underneath the bathtub are the city's main power lines. And there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add, that would link a series of cultural buildings, and a view corridor \u2014 because this is the historic district \u2014 that they didn't want to obstruct with a new building.(Laughter)And now we're going to add 1.1 million square feet. And if we did the traditional thing, that 1.1 million square feet \u2014 these are the different programs \u2014 the traditional thing would be to identify the public elements, place them on sites, and now we'd have a really terrible situation: a public thing in the middle of a bathtub that floods. And then we would size all the other elements \u2014 the different commercial elements: hotel, luxury housing, offices and so forth \u2014 and dump it on top. And we would create something that was unviable. In fact \u2014 and you know this \u2014 this is called the Time Warner Building.(Laughter)So our strategy was very simple. Just lift the entire block, flip some of the elements over, reposition them so they have appropriate views and relationships to downtown, and make circulation connections and reroute the road. So that's the basic concept, and now I'm going to show you what it leads to.Ok, it seems a very formal, willful gesture, but something derived entirely out of the constraints. And again, when we unveiled it, there was a sort of nervousness that this was about an architect making a statement, not an architect who was attempting to solve a series of problems. Now, within that center zone, as I said, we have the ability to mix a series of things. So here, this is sort of an x-ray \u2014 the towers are totally developer-driven. They told us the dimensions, the sizes and so forth, and we focused on taking all the public components \u2014 the lobbies, the bars \u2014 everything that different commercial elements would have, and combined it in the center, in the sort of subway map, in the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum.So it creates a situation like this, where you have artists who can operate within an art space that also has an amazing view on the 22nd floor, but it also has proximity that the curator can either open or close. It allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen, or to see the art, and so forth. It also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool, they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool, so they're not forced to always work within the confines of a contemporary gallery space.So, how to build this. It's very simple: it's a chair. So, we begin by building the cores. As we're building the cores, we build the contemporary art museum at grade. That allows us to have incredible efficiency and cost efficiency. This is not a high-budget building. The moment the cores get to mid level, we finish the art museum; we put all the mechanical equipment in it; and then we jack it up into the air. This is how they build really large aircraft hangars, for instance, the ones that they did for the A380. Finish the cores, finish the meat and you get something that looks like this.Now I only have about 30 seconds, so I want to start an animation, and we'll conclude with that.Thank you.(Applause)Chris asked me to add \u2014 the theater is under construction, and this project will start construction in about a year, and finish in 2010.[identify public elements][insert public elements at

process.\n\n00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:28.213\nIt's a process that takes rationality\nalmost to an absurd level,\n\n00:00:28.237 --> 00:00:30.142\nand it transcends all the baggage\n\n00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.810\nthat normally comes\nwith what people would call,\n\n00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:34.934\nsort of a rational\nconclusion to something.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.244\nAnd it concludes in something\nthat you see here,\n\n00:00:37.268 --> 00:00:41.049\nthat you actually wouldn't expect\nas being the result of rationality.\n\n00:00:42.028 --> 00:00:44.724\nThe second --\n\n00:00:44.748 --> 00:00:49.738\nthe second is that this process\ndoes not have a signature.\n\n00:00:49.762 --> 00:00:51.138\nThere is no authorship.\n\n00:00:51.162 --> 00:00:53.174\nArchitects are obsessed with authorship.\n\n00:00:53.198 --> 00:00:55.682\nThis is something that has\nediting and it has teams,\n\n00:00:55.706 --> 00:00:58.069\nbut in fact, we no longer\nsee within this process,\n\n00:00:58.093 --> 00:00:59.623\nthe traditional master architect\n\n00:00:59.647 --> 00:01:02.363\ncreating a sketch\nthat his minions carry out.\n\n00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:05.533\nAnd the third is that it challenges --\n\n00:01:05.557 --> 00:01:08.934\nand this is, in the length of this,\nvery hard to support why,\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.260\nconnect all these things --\n\n00:01:10.284 --> 00:01:13.487\nbut it challenges the high modernist\nnotion of flexibility.\n\n00:01:13.511 --> 00:01:17.151\nHigh modernists said we will create\nsort of singular spaces that are generic,\n\n00:01:17.175 --> 00:01:19.064\nalmost anything can happen within them.\n\n00:01:19.088 --> 00:01:21.114\nI call it sort of \"shotgun flexibility\" --\n\n00:01:21.138 --> 00:01:24.299\nturn your head this way; shoot;\nand you're bound to kill something.\n\n00:01:24.323 --> 00:01:26.398\nSo, this is the promise of high modernism:\n\n00:01:26.422 --> 00:01:29.645\nwithin a single space, actually,\nany kind of activity can happen.\n\n00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:31.934\nBut as we're seeing,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.934\noperational costs are starting\nto dwarf capital costs\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.997\nin terms of design parameters.\n\n00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:38.741\nAnd so, with this sort of idea,\n\n00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:42.023\nwhat happens is, whatever actually\nis in the building on opening day,\n\n00:01:42.047 --> 00:01:44.310\nor whatever seems to be\nthe most immediate need,\n\n00:01:44.334 --> 00:01:47.606\nstarts to dwarf the possibility\nand sort of subsume it,\n\n00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.558\nof anything else could ever happen.\n\n00:01:49.582 --> 00:01:52.179\nAnd so we're proposing\na different kind of flexibility,\n\n00:01:52.203 --> 00:01:56.337\nsomething that we call\n\"compartmentalized flexibility.\"\n\n00:01:56.361 --> 00:01:58.700\nAnd the idea is that you,\nwithin that continuum,\n\n00:01:58.724 --> 00:02:01.852\nidentify a series of points,\nand you design specifically to them.\n\n00:02:01.876 --> 00:02:03.893\nThey can be pushed\noff-center a little bit,\n\n00:02:03.917 --> 00:02:06.030\nbut in the end you actually\nstill get as much\n\n00:02:06.054 --> 00:02:08.934\nof that original spectrum\nas you originally had hoped.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.934\nWith high modernist flexibility,\nthat doesn't really work.\n\n00:02:12.421 --> 00:02:13.863\nNow I'm going to talk about --\n\n00:02:13.887 --> 00:02:16.196\nI'm going to build up\nthe Seattle Central Library\n\n00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.001\nin this way before your eyes\nin about five or six diagrams,\n\n00:02:19.025 --> 00:02:21.842\nand I truly mean this is the design\nprocess that you'll see.\n\n00:02:21.866 --> 00:02:24.170\nWith the library staff\nand the library board,\n\n00:02:24.194 --> 00:02:25.934\nwe settled on two core positions.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:29.403\nThis is the first one, and this\nis showing, over the last 900 years,\n\n00:02:29.427 --> 00:02:33.046\nthe evolution of the book,\nand other technologies.\n\n00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.934\nThis diagram was our sort\nof position piece about the book,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.474\nand our position was,\nbooks are technology --\n\n00:02:38.498 --> 00:02:40.086\nthat's something people forget --\n\n00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.272\nbut it's a form of technology\nthat will have to share its dominance\n\n00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:46.715\nwith any other form of truly potent\ntechnology or media.\n\n00:02:47.088 --> 00:02:48.240\nThe second premise --\n\n00:02:48.264 --> 00:02:50.755\nand this was something\nthat was very difficult for us\n\n00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:52.745\nto convince the librarians of at first --\n\n00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.552\nis that libraries, since the inception\nof Carnegie Library tradition in America,\n\n00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:59.459\nhad a second responsibility,\nand that was for social roles.\n\n00:02:59.483 --> 00:03:02.071\nOk, now, this I'll come back\nto later, but something --\n\n00:03:02.095 --> 00:03:05.302\nactually, the librarians at first said,\n\"No, this isn't our mandate.\n\n00:03:05.326 --> 00:03:08.032\nOur mandate is media,\nand particularly the book.\"\n\n00:03:09.421 --> 00:03:12.491\nSo what you're seeing now\nis actually the design of the building.\n\n00:03:12.515 --> 00:03:14.967\nThe upper diagram is what we had seen\n\n00:03:14.991 --> 00:03:19.532\nin a whole host of contemporary libraries\nthat used high modernist flexibility.\n\n00:03:19.556 --> 00:03:21.958\nSort of, any activity\ncould happen anywhere.\n\n00:03:22.637 --> 00:03:26.339\nWe don't know the future of the library;\nwe don't know the future of the book;\n\n00:03:26.363 --> 00:03:27.942\nand so, we'll use this approach.\n\n00:03:27.966 --> 00:03:31.146\nAnd what we saw were buildings\nthat were very generic, and worse --\n\n00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.868\nnot only were they very generic --\n\n00:03:32.892 --> 00:03:35.634\nso, not only does the reading room\nlook like the copy room\n\n00:03:35.658 --> 00:03:37.156\nlook like the magazine area --\n\n00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.906\nbut it meant that whatever issue\nwas troubling the library at that moment\n\n00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.445\nwas starting to engulf every other\nactivity that was happening in it.\n\n00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:46.718\nAnd in this case,\nwhat was getting engulfed\n\n00:03:46.742 --> 00:03:49.758\nwere these social responsibilities\nby the expansion of the book.\n\n00:03:49.782 --> 00:03:51.997\nAnd so we proposed\nwhat's at the lower diagram.\n\n00:03:52.021 --> 00:03:55.108\nVery dumb approach:\nsimply compartmentalize.\n\n00:03:55.132 --> 00:03:57.585\nPut those things whose evolution\nwe could predict --\n\n00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.192\nand I don't mean that we could say\nwhat would actually happen in the future,\n\n00:04:01.216 --> 00:04:05.102\nbut we have some certainty of the spectrum\nof what would happen in the future --\n\n00:04:05.126 --> 00:04:07.376\nput those in boxes designed\nspecifically for it,\n\n00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.094\nand put the things that we can't\npredict on the rooftops.\n\n00:04:10.118 --> 00:04:11.365\nSo that was the core idea.\n\n00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.083\nNow, we had to convince the library\n\n00:04:13.107 --> 00:04:16.773\nthat social roles were\nequally important to media,\n\n00:04:16.797 --> 00:04:18.576\nin order to get them to accept this.\n\n00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.600\nWhat you're seeing here is actually\ntheir program on the left.\n\n00:04:21.624 --> 00:04:25.661\nThat's as it was given to us\nin all of its clarity and glory.\n\n00:04:25.685 --> 00:04:29.973\nOur first operation was to re-digest it\nback to them, show it to them and say,\n\n00:04:29.997 --> 00:04:31.934\n\"You know what? We haven't touched it,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:35.345\nbut only one-third of your own program\nis dedicated to media and books.\n\n00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:37.318\nTwo-thirds of it is already dedicated --\n\n00:04:37.342 --> 00:04:40.453\nthat's the white band below,\nthe thing you said isn't important --\n\n00:04:40.477 --> 00:04:42.486\nis already dedicated to social functions.\"\n\n00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.691\nSo once we had presented\nthat back to them,\n\n00:04:44.715 --> 00:04:47.286\nthey agreed that this sort\nof core concept could work.\n\n00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.664\nWe got the right to go back\nto first principles --\n\n00:04:49.688 --> 00:04:50.898\nthat's the third diagram.\n\n00:04:50.922 --> 00:04:52.128\nWe recombined everything.\n\n00:04:52.152 --> 00:04:54.110\nAnd then we started making new decisions.\n\n00:04:54.134 --> 00:04:57.007\nWhat you're seeing on the right\nis the design of the library,\n\n00:04:57.031 --> 00:04:58.952\nspecifically in terms of square footage.\n\n00:04:58.976 --> 00:05:03.934\nOn the left of that diagram, here,\nyou'll see a series of five platforms --\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.934\nsort of combs, collective programs.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.363\nAnd on the right are the more\nindeterminate spaces;\n\n00:05:08.387 --> 00:05:09.638\nthings like reading rooms,\n\n00:05:09.662 --> 00:05:12.347\nwhose evolution in 20, 30, 40 years\nwe can't predict.\n\n00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:14.680\nSo that literally was the design\nof the building.\n\n00:05:14.704 --> 00:05:16.839\nThey signed it, and to their chagrin,\n\n00:05:16.863 --> 00:05:19.934\nwe came back a week later,\nand we presented them this.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.855\nAnd as you can see, it is literally\nthe diagram on the right.\n\n00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:23.880\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:23.904 --> 00:05:26.334\nWe just sized -- no, really,\nI mean that, literally.\n\n00:05:26.358 --> 00:05:28.720\nThe things on the left-hand side\nof the diagram,\n\n00:05:28.744 --> 00:05:29.934\nthose are the boxes.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.887\nWe sized them into five compartments.\nThey're super-efficient.\n\n00:05:32.911 --> 00:05:34.783\nWe had a very low budget to work with.\n\n00:05:34.807 --> 00:05:36.387\nWe pushed them around on the site\n\n00:05:36.411 --> 00:05:38.624\nto make very literal\ncontextual relationships.\n\n00:05:38.648 --> 00:05:40.961\nThe reading room\nshould be able to see the water.\n\n00:05:40.985 --> 00:05:43.766\nThe main entrance should have\na public plaza in front of it\n\n00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.911\nto abide by the zoning code, and so forth.\n\n00:05:46.355 --> 00:05:48.808\nSo, you see the five platforms,\nthose are the boxes.\n\n00:05:48.832 --> 00:05:51.261\nwithin each one, a very discrete\nthing is happening.\n\n00:05:51.285 --> 00:05:53.632\nThe area in between\nis sort of an urban continuum,\n\n00:05:53.656 --> 00:05:57.006\nthese things that we can't predict\ntheir evolution to the same degree.\n\n00:05:57.448 --> 00:05:59.934\nTo give you some sense\nof the power of this idea,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.934\nthe biggest block\nis what we call the book spiral.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.292\nIt's literally built\nin a very inexpensive way --\n\n00:06:05.316 --> 00:06:07.934\nit is a parking garage for books.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:11.445\nIt just so happens to be on the 6th\nthrough 10th floors of the building,\n\n00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:14.744\nbut that is not necessarily\nan expensive approach.\n\n00:06:14.768 --> 00:06:17.594\nAnd it allows us to organize\nthe entire Dewey Decimal System\n\n00:06:17.618 --> 00:06:21.489\non one continuous run; no matter how it\ngrows or contracts within the building,\n\n00:06:21.513 --> 00:06:25.934\nit will always have its clarity\nto end the sort of trail of tears\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.687\nthat we've all experienced\nin public libraries.\n\n00:06:28.711 --> 00:06:29.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.689\nAnd so this was the final operation,\n\n00:06:31.713 --> 00:06:34.834\nwhich was to take these blocks\nas they were all pushed off kilter,\n\n00:06:34.858 --> 00:06:36.934\nand to hold onto them with a skin.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.934\nThat skin serves double duty,\nagain, for economics.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.934\nOne, it is the lateral stability\nfor the entire building;\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.220\nit's a structural element.\n\n00:06:44.244 --> 00:06:46.871\nBut its dimensions were designed\nnot only for structure,\n\n00:06:46.895 --> 00:06:49.146\nbut also for holding on\nevery piece of glass.\n\n00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.934\nThe glass was then --\nI'll use the word impregnated --\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:55.370\nbut it had a layer of metal\nthat was called \"stretched metal.\"\n\n00:06:55.394 --> 00:06:57.232\nThat metal acts as a microlouver,\n\n00:06:57.256 --> 00:07:00.637\nso from the exterior of the building,\nthe sun sees it as totally opaque,\n\n00:07:00.661 --> 00:07:03.335\nbut from the interior,\nit's entirely transparent.\n\n00:07:03.359 --> 00:07:06.106\nSo now I'm going to take you\non a tour of the building.\n\n00:07:06.829 --> 00:07:08.203\nLet me see if I can find it.\n\n00:07:08.227 --> 00:07:11.496\nFor anyone who gets\nmotion sickness, I apologize.\n\n00:07:12.191 --> 00:07:13.619\nSo, this is the building.\n\n00:07:15.987 --> 00:07:19.844\nAnd I think what's important is,\nwhen we first unveiled the building,\n\n00:07:19.868 --> 00:07:23.934\nthe public saw it as being\ntotally about our whim and ego.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.800\nAnd it was defended,\nbelieve it or not, by the librarians.\n\n00:07:26.824 --> 00:07:28.848\nThey said, \"Look,\nwe don't know what it is,\n\n00:07:28.872 --> 00:07:31.237\nbut we know it's everything\nthat we need it to be,\n\n00:07:31.261 --> 00:07:34.397\nbased on the observations\nthat we've done about the program.\"\n\n00:07:37.043 --> 00:07:39.027\nThis is going into one of the entries.\n\n00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:42.412\nSo, it's an unusual building\nfor a public library, obviously.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:49.559\nSo now we're going\ninto what we call the living room.\n\n00:07:49.583 --> 00:07:52.455\nThis is actually a program\nthat we invented with the library.\n\n00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:54.396\nIt was recognizing that public libraries\n\n00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.205\nare the last vestige of public free space.\n\n00:07:57.229 --> 00:08:00.657\nThere are plenty of shopping malls\nthat allow you to get out of the rain\n\n00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:01.837\nin downtown Seattle,\n\n00:08:01.861 --> 00:08:04.788\nbut there are not so many free places\n\n00:08:04.812 --> 00:08:06.633\nthat allow you to get out of the rain.\n\n00:08:06.657 --> 00:08:10.243\nSo this was an unprogrammed area where\npeople could pretty much do anything,\n\n00:08:10.267 --> 00:08:12.376\nincluding eat, yell,\nplay chess and so forth.\n\n00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.406\nNow we're moving up into what we call\nthe mixing chamber.\n\n00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.358\nThat was the main\ntechnology area in the building.\n\n00:08:19.382 --> 00:08:21.958\nYou'll have to tell me\nif I'm going too fast for you.\n\n00:08:26.159 --> 00:08:27.309\nAnd now up.\n\n00:08:32.524 --> 00:08:35.153\nThis is actually the place\nthat we put into the building\n\n00:08:35.177 --> 00:08:37.210\nso I could propose\nto my wife, right there.\n\n00:08:37.234 --> 00:08:39.353\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.117\nShe said yes.\n\n00:08:41.141 --> 00:08:43.141\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:44.551 --> 00:08:47.132\nI'm running out of time,\nso I'm actually going to stop.\n\n00:08:47.156 --> 00:08:48.934\nI can show this to you later.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:52.241\nBut let's see if I can very quickly\nget into the book spiral,\n\n00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:54.329\nbecause I think it's,\nas I said, the most --\n\n00:08:54.353 --> 00:08:57.670\nthis is the main reading room --\nthe most unique part of the building.\n\n00:08:58.726 --> 00:08:59.892\nYou dizzy yet?\n\n00:09:01.099 --> 00:09:02.924\nOk, so here, this is the book spiral.\n\n00:09:08.353 --> 00:09:10.286\nSo, it's very indiscernible,\n\n00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.811\nbut it's actually\na continuous stair-stepping.\n\n00:09:13.835 --> 00:09:15.827\nIt allows you to, on one city block,\n\n00:09:15.851 --> 00:09:18.546\ngo up one full floor,\nso that it's on a continuum.\n\n00:09:23.449 --> 00:09:26.934\nOk, now I'm going to go back,\nand I'm going to hit a second project.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.221\nI'm going to go very,\nvery quickly through this.\n\n00:09:29.245 --> 00:09:30.925\nNow this is the Dallas Theater.\n\n00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:34.297\nIt was an unusual client for us,\nbecause they came to us and they said,\n\n00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:36.027\n\"We need you to do a new building.\n\n00:09:36.051 --> 00:09:39.477\nWe've been working\nin a temporary space for 30 years,\n\n00:09:39.501 --> 00:09:41.224\nbut because of that temporary space,\n\n00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:44.111\nwe've become an infamous theater company.\n\n00:09:44.135 --> 00:09:47.096\nTheater is really focused in New York,\nChicago and Seattle,\n\n00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.217\nwith the exception\nof the Dallas Theater Company.\"\n\n00:09:50.241 --> 00:09:52.937\nAnd the very fact that they worked\nin a provisional space\n\n00:09:52.961 --> 00:09:55.404\nmeant that for Beckett,\nthey could blow out a wall;\n\n00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:59.170\nthey could do \"Cherry Orchard\" and blow\na hole through the floor, and so forth.\n\n00:09:59.194 --> 00:10:02.226\nSo it was a very daunting task\nfor us to do a brand-new building\n\n00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.304\nthat could be a pristine building,\n\n00:10:04.328 --> 00:10:06.347\nbut keep this kind of experimental nature.\n\n00:10:06.371 --> 00:10:07.569\nAnd the second is,\n\n00:10:07.593 --> 00:10:10.471\nthey were what we call\na multi-form theater,\n\n00:10:10.495 --> 00:10:13.101\nthey do different kinds\nof performances in repertory.\n\n00:10:13.125 --> 00:10:15.934\nSo they in the morning\nwill do something in arena,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.451\nthen they'll do something\nin proscenium and so forth.\n\n00:10:18.475 --> 00:10:20.824\nAnd so they needed to be able\nto quickly transform\n\n00:10:20.848 --> 00:10:22.774\nbetween different theater organizations,\n\n00:10:22.798 --> 00:10:24.483\nand for operational budget reasons,\n\n00:10:24.507 --> 00:10:26.670\nthis actually no longer\nhappens in pretty much\n\n00:10:26.694 --> 00:10:28.934\nany multi-form theater\nin the United States,\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.433\nso we needed to figure out\na way to overcome that.\n\n00:10:31.457 --> 00:10:34.280\nSo our thought was to literally\nput the theater on its head:\n\n00:10:34.304 --> 00:10:36.614\nto take those things\nthat were previously defined\n\n00:10:36.638 --> 00:10:38.313\nas front-of-house and back-of-house\n\n00:10:38.337 --> 00:10:40.345\nand stack them above house\nand below house,\n\n00:10:40.369 --> 00:10:42.568\nand to create what we called\na theater machine.\n\n00:10:42.592 --> 00:10:45.075\nWe invest the money\nin the operation of the building.\n\n00:10:45.099 --> 00:10:47.921\nIt's almost as though the building\ncould be placed anywhere,\n\n00:10:47.945 --> 00:10:49.097\nwherever you place it,\n\n00:10:49.121 --> 00:10:51.851\nthe area under it is charged\nfor theatrical performances.\n\n00:10:51.875 --> 00:10:54.197\nAnd it allowed us to go back\nto first principles,\n\n00:10:54.221 --> 00:10:57.803\nand redefine fly tower, acoustic\nenclosure, light enclosure and so forth.\n\n00:10:57.827 --> 00:10:59.297\nAnd at the push of a button,\n\n00:10:59.321 --> 00:11:02.948\nit allows the artistic director\nto move between proscenium, thrust,\n\n00:11:02.972 --> 00:11:06.763\nand in fact, arena\nand traverse and flat floor,\n\n00:11:06.787 --> 00:11:09.182\nin a very quick transfiguration.\n\n00:11:09.206 --> 00:11:12.628\nSo in fact, using\noperational budget, we can --\n\n00:11:12.652 --> 00:11:14.844\nsorry, capital cost --\nwe can actually achieve\n\n00:11:14.868 --> 00:11:17.339\nwhat was no longer achievable\nin operational cost.\n\n00:11:17.856 --> 00:11:19.809\nAnd that means that the artistic director\n\n00:11:19.833 --> 00:11:22.198\nnow has a palette that he or she\ncan choose from,\n\n00:11:22.222 --> 00:11:25.720\nbetween a series of forms\nand a series of processions,\n\n00:11:25.744 --> 00:11:28.868\nbecause that enclosure around the theater\nthat is normally trapped\n\n00:11:28.892 --> 00:11:31.934\nwith front-of-house and back-of-house\nspaces has been liberated.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.227\nSo an artistic director has the ability\nto have a performance\n\n00:11:35.251 --> 00:11:37.366\nthat enters in a Wagnerian procession,\n\n00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.725\nshows the first act in thrust,\n\n00:11:39.749 --> 00:11:42.934\nthe intermission in a Greek procession,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.776\nsecond act in arena, and so forth.\n\n00:11:45.212 --> 00:11:47.563\nSo I'm going to show you\nwhat this actually means.\n\n00:11:47.587 --> 00:11:49.355\nThis is the theater up close.\n\n00:11:49.379 --> 00:11:52.465\nAny portion around the theater\nactually can be opened discretely.\n\n00:11:54.473 --> 00:11:58.371\nThe light enclosure can be lifted\nseparate to the acoustic enclosure,\n\n00:11:58.395 --> 00:12:00.879\nso you can do Beckett\nwith Dallas as the backdrop.\n\n00:12:02.104 --> 00:12:03.269\nPortions can be opened,\n\n00:12:03.293 --> 00:12:06.936\nso you can now actually have motorcycles\ndrive directly into the performance,\n\n00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.362\nor you can even just have\nan open-air performance,\n\n00:12:09.386 --> 00:12:10.552\nor for intermissions.\n\n00:12:11.052 --> 00:12:13.785\nThe balconies all move to go\nbetween those configurations,\n\n00:12:13.809 --> 00:12:15.094\nbut they also disappear.\n\n00:12:15.475 --> 00:12:17.595\nThe proscenium line can also disappear.\n\n00:12:18.087 --> 00:12:19.928\nYou can bring enormous objects in,\n\n00:12:19.952 --> 00:12:21.943\nso in fact, the Dallas Theater Company --\n\n00:12:21.967 --> 00:12:24.618\ntheir first show will be a play\nabout Charles Lindbergh,\n\n00:12:24.642 --> 00:12:26.934\nand they'll want to bring in\na real aircraft.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.569\nAnd then it also provides them,\nin the off-season,\n\n00:12:29.593 --> 00:12:34.799\nthe ability to actually rent out\ntheir space for entirely different things.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.613\nThis is it from a distance.\n\n00:12:40.879 --> 00:12:43.867\nOpen up entire portions\nfor different kinds of events.\n\n00:12:43.891 --> 00:12:45.042\nAnd at night.\n\n00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:50.928\nAgain, remove the light enclosure;\nkeep the acoustic enclosure.\n\n00:12:51.634 --> 00:12:53.512\nThis is a monster truck show.\n\n00:12:53.536 --> 00:12:55.427\nI'm going to show now the last project.\n\n00:12:55.451 --> 00:12:56.934\nThis also is an unusual client.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.431\nThey inverted the whole idea\nof development.\n\n00:12:59.455 --> 00:13:02.282\nThey came to us and they said --\nunlike normal developers --\n\n00:13:02.306 --> 00:13:03.843\nthey said, \"We want to start out\n\n00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:06.616\nby providing a contemporary\nart museum in Louisville.\n\n00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.844\nThat's our main goal.\"\n\n00:13:07.868 --> 00:13:11.463\nAnd so instead of being a developer\nthat sees an opportunity to make money,\n\n00:13:11.487 --> 00:13:14.508\nthey saw an ability to be\na catalyst in their downtown.\n\n00:13:14.532 --> 00:13:18.112\nAnd the fact that they wanted to support\nthe contemporary art museum\n\n00:13:18.136 --> 00:13:19.693\nactually built their pro forma,\n\n00:13:19.717 --> 00:13:21.034\nso they worked in reverse.\n\n00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:22.934\nAnd that pro forma led us\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.934\nto a mixed-use building\nthat was very large,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.262\nin order to support\ntheir aspirations of the art,\n\n00:13:28.286 --> 00:13:30.833\nbut it also opened up opportunities\nfor the art itself\n\n00:13:30.857 --> 00:13:33.077\nto collaborate, interact\nwith commercial spaces\n\n00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:35.861\nthat actually artists more\nand more want to work within.\n\n00:13:36.314 --> 00:13:39.339\nAnd it also charged us\nwith thinking about how to have\n\n00:13:39.363 --> 00:13:41.327\nsomething that was both a single building\n\n00:13:41.351 --> 00:13:43.934\nand a credible sort of sub-building.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.501\nSo this is Louisville's skyline,\n\n00:13:46.525 --> 00:13:49.205\nand I'm going to take\nyou through the various constraints\n\n00:13:49.229 --> 00:13:50.422\nthat led to the project.\n\n00:13:50.446 --> 00:13:51.985\nFirst: the physical constraints.\n\n00:13:52.009 --> 00:13:54.410\nWe actually had to operate\non three discrete sites,\n\n00:13:54.434 --> 00:13:57.315\nall of them well smaller\nthan the size of the building.\n\n00:13:57.339 --> 00:14:01.022\nWe had to operate next to the new\nMuhammad Ali Center, and respect it.\n\n00:14:01.046 --> 00:14:03.344\nWe had to operate\nwithin the 100-year floodplain.\n\n00:14:03.368 --> 00:14:05.683\nNow, this area floods\nthree to four times a year,\n\n00:14:05.707 --> 00:14:07.444\nand there's a levee behind our site,\n\n00:14:07.468 --> 00:14:09.748\nsimilar to the ones\nthat broke in New Orleans.\n\n00:14:10.645 --> 00:14:14.847\nHad to operate behind the I-64 corridor,\n\n00:14:14.871 --> 00:14:17.787\na street that cuts through the middle\nof these separate sites.\n\n00:14:17.811 --> 00:14:22.377\nSo we're starting to build a sort of\nnightmare of constraints in a bathtub.\n\n00:14:22.401 --> 00:14:25.790\nUnderneath the bathtub\nare the city's main power lines.\n\n00:14:26.657 --> 00:14:29.458\nAnd there is a pedestrian corridor\nthat they wanted to add,\n\n00:14:29.482 --> 00:14:32.432\nthat would link a series\nof cultural buildings,\n\n00:14:32.456 --> 00:14:35.422\nand a view corridor --\nbecause this is the historic district --\n\n00:14:35.446 --> 00:14:37.994\nthat they didn't want to obstruct\nwith a new building.\n\n00:14:38.018 --> 00:14:39.058\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:39.082 --> 00:14:41.655\nAnd now we're going to add\n1.1 million square feet.\n\n00:14:42.083 --> 00:14:45.298\nAnd if we did the traditional thing,\nthat 1.1 million square feet --\n\n00:14:45.322 --> 00:14:46.994\nthese are the different programs --\n\n00:14:47.018 --> 00:14:50.982\nthe traditional thing would be to identify\nthe public elements, place them on sites,\n\n00:14:51.006 --> 00:14:53.181\nand now we'd have a really\nterrible situation:\n\n00:14:53.205 --> 00:14:55.934\na public thing in the middle\nof a bathtub that floods.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.555\nAnd then we would size\nall the other elements --\n\n00:14:59.579 --> 00:15:01.234\nthe different commercial elements:\n\n00:15:01.258 --> 00:15:03.401\nhotel, luxury housing,\noffices and so forth --\n\n00:15:03.425 --> 00:15:04.630\nand dump it on top.\n\n00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:07.618\nAnd we would create\nsomething that was unviable.\n\n00:15:07.642 --> 00:15:11.387\nIn fact -- and you know this -- this\nis called the Time Warner Building.\n\n00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:13.085\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:13.109 --> 00:15:14.934\nSo our strategy was very simple.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:18.069\nJust lift the entire block,\n\n00:15:18.093 --> 00:15:19.728\nflip some of the elements over,\n\n00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:22.562\nreposition them\nso they have appropriate views\n\n00:15:22.586 --> 00:15:24.222\nand relationships to downtown,\n\n00:15:24.246 --> 00:15:27.699\nand make circulation connections\nand reroute the road.\n\n00:15:27.723 --> 00:15:29.250\nSo that's the basic concept,\n\n00:15:29.274 --> 00:15:31.604\nand now I'm going to show you\nwhat it leads to.\n\n00:15:32.874 --> 00:15:35.429\nOk, it seems a very formal,\nwillful gesture,\n\n00:15:35.453 --> 00:15:38.001\nbut something derived entirely\nout of the constraints.\n\n00:15:38.025 --> 00:15:41.006\nAnd again, when we unveiled it,\nthere was a sort of nervousness\n\n00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:43.467\nthat this was about an architect\nmaking a statement,\n\n00:15:43.491 --> 00:15:47.083\nnot an architect who was attempting\nto solve a series of problems.\n\n00:15:47.107 --> 00:15:49.401\nNow, within that center zone, as I said,\n\n00:15:49.425 --> 00:15:51.580\nwe have the ability to mix\na series of things.\n\n00:15:51.604 --> 00:15:54.327\nSo here, this is sort of an x-ray --\n\n00:15:54.351 --> 00:15:56.286\nthe towers are totally developer-driven.\n\n00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:58.760\nThey told us the dimensions,\nthe sizes and so forth,\n\n00:15:58.784 --> 00:16:01.281\nand we focused on taking\nall the public components --\n\n00:16:01.305 --> 00:16:02.597\nthe lobbies, the bars --\n\n00:16:02.621 --> 00:16:05.934\neverything that different commercial\nelements would have,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.934\nand combined it in the center,\nin the sort of subway map,\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.676\nin the transfer zone that would also\ninclude the contemporary art museum.\n\n00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.765\nSo it creates a situation like this,\nwhere you have artists who can operate\n\n00:16:16.789 --> 00:16:20.667\nwithin an art space that also has\nan amazing view on the 22nd floor,\n\n00:16:20.691 --> 00:16:24.148\nbut it also has proximity that the curator\ncan either open or close.\n\n00:16:24.172 --> 00:16:27.378\nIt allows people\non exercise bicycles to be seen,\n\n00:16:27.402 --> 00:16:29.077\nor to see the art, and so forth.\n\n00:16:29.101 --> 00:16:32.821\nIt also means that if an artist wants\nto invade something like a swimming pool,\n\n00:16:32.845 --> 00:16:35.555\nthey can begin to do their exhibition\nin a swimming pool,\n\n00:16:35.579 --> 00:16:38.216\nso they're not forced to always\nwork within the confines\n\n00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.775\nof a contemporary gallery space.\n\n00:16:39.799 --> 00:16:40.966\nSo, how to build this.\n\n00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:42.934\nIt's very simple: it's a chair.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:46.390\nSo, we begin by building the cores.\n\n00:16:46.414 --> 00:16:49.958\nAs we're building the cores, we build\nthe contemporary art museum at grade.\n\n00:16:49.982 --> 00:16:53.048\nThat allows us to have\nincredible efficiency and cost efficiency.\n\n00:16:53.072 --> 00:16:54.773\nThis is not a high-budget building.\n\n00:16:54.797 --> 00:16:56.646\nThe moment the cores get to mid level,\n\n00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:59.865\nwe finish the art museum; we put\nall the mechanical equipment in it;\n\n00:16:59.889 --> 00:17:01.634\nand then we jack it up into the air.\n\n00:17:01.658 --> 00:17:04.147\nThis is how they build\nreally large aircraft hangars,\n\n00:17:04.171 --> 00:17:06.531\nfor instance, the ones\nthat they did for the A380.\n\n00:17:06.555 --> 00:17:08.395\nFinish the cores, finish the meat\n\n00:17:08.419 --> 00:17:10.432\nand you get something\nthat looks like this.\n\n00:17:10.456 --> 00:17:12.034\nNow I only have about 30 seconds,\n\n00:17:12.058 --> 00:17:13.956\nso I want to start an animation,\n\n00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.375\nand we'll conclude with that.\n\n00:17:15.399 --> 00:17:16.787\nThank you.\n\n00:17:16.811 --> 00:17:20.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.934\nChris asked me to add --\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.734\nthe theater is under construction,\n\n00:17:24.758 --> 00:17:27.482\nand this project will start\nconstruction in about a

I love this wonderful gathering. And you must be wondering, \"What on earth? Have they put up the wrong slide?\" No, no. Look at this magnificent beast, and ask the question: Who designed it?This is TED; this is Technology, Entertainment, Design, and there's a dairy cow. It's a quite wonderfully designed animal. And I was thinking, how do I introduce this? And I thought, well, maybe that old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer, you know: \"Poems are made by fools like me, but only God can make a tree.\" And you might say, \"Well, God designed the cow.\"But, of course, God got a lot of help. This is the ancestor of cattle. This is the aurochs. And it was designed by natural selection, the process of natural selection, over many millions of years. And then it became domesticated, thousands of years ago. And human beings became its stewards, and, without even knowing what they were doing, they gradually redesigned it and redesigned it and redesigned it. And then more recently, they really began to do reverse engineering on this beast and figure out just what the parts were, how they worked and how they might be optimized \u2014 how they might be made better.Now, why am I talking about cows? Because I want to say that much the same thing is true of religions. Religions are natural phenomena \u2014 they're just as natural as cows. They have evolved over millennia. They have a biological base, just like the aurochs. They have become domesticated, and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years. This is TED, and I want to talk about design. Because what I've been doing for the last four years \u2014 really since the first time you saw me \u2014 some of you saw me at TED when I was talking about religion \u2014 and in the last four years, I've been working just about non-stop on this topic. And you might say it's about the reverse engineering of religions. Now that very idea, I think, strikes terror in many people, or anger, or anxiety of one sort or another. And that is the spell that I want to break.I want to say, no, religions are an important natural phenomenon. We should study them with the same intensity that we study all the other important natural phenomena, like global warming, as we heard so eloquently last night from Al Gore. Today's religions are brilliantly designed \u2014 brilliantly designed. They are immensely powerful social institutions and many of their features can be traced back to earlier features that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering. And, as with the cow, there's a mixture of evolutionary design \u2014 designed by natural selection itself \u2014 and intelligent design \u2014 more or less intelligent design \u2014 and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions.You don't do book talks at TED, but I'm going to have just one slide about my book, because there is one message in it which I think this group really needs to hear. And I would be very interested to get your responses to this. It's the one policy proposal that I make in the book, at this time, when I claim not to know enough about religion to know what other policy proposals to make. And it's one that echoes remarks that you've heard already today.Here's my proposal, I'm going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it: Education on world religions for all of our children \u2014 in primary school, in high school, in public schools, in private schools and in home schooling. So what I'm proposing is, just as we require reading, writing, arithmetic, American history, so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world \u2014 about their history, about their creeds, about their texts, their music, their symbolisms, their prohibitions, their requirements. And this should be presented factually, straightforwardly, with no particular spin, to all of the children in the country. And as long as you teach them that, you can teach them anything else you like. That, I think, is maximal tolerance for religious freedom. As long as you inform your children about other religions, then you may \u2014 and as early as you like and whatever you like \u2014 teach them whatever creed you want them to learn. But also let them know about other religions.Now, why do I say that? Because democracy depends on an informed citizenship. Informed consent is the very bedrock of our understanding of democracy. Misinformed consent is not worth it. It's like a coin flip; it doesn't count, really. Democracy depends on informed consent. This is the way we treat people as responsible adults. Now, children below the age of consent are a special case. Parents \u2014 I'm going to use a word that Pastor Rick just used \u2014 parents are stewards of their children. They don't own them. You can't own your children. You have a responsibility to the world, to the state, to them, to take care of them right. You may teach them whatever creed you think is most important, but I say you have a responsibility to let them be informed about all the other creeds in the world, too.The reason I've taken this time is I've been fascinated to hear some of the reactions to this. One reviewer for a Roman Catholic newspaper called it \"totalitarian.\" It strikes me as practically libertarian. Is it totalitarian to require reading, writing and arithmetic? I don't think so. All I'm saying is \u2014 and facts, facts only; no values, just facts \u2014 about all the world's religions. Another reviewer called it \"hilarious.\" Well, I'm really bothered by the fact that anybody would think that was hilarious. It seems to me to be such a plausible, natural extension of the democratic principles we already have that I'm shocked to think anybody would find that just ridiculous. I know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths. I don't think that's defensible. But I'd really be pleased to get your answers on that \u2014 any reactions to that \u2014 later.But now I'm going to move on. Back to the cow. This picture, which I pulled off the web \u2014 the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture. That's the steward. Cows couldn't live without human stewards \u2014 they're domesticated. They're a sort of ectosymbiont. They depend on us for their survival. And Pastor Rick was just talking about sheep. I'm going to talk about sheep, too. There's a lot of serendipitous convergence here. How clever it was of sheep to acquire shepherds!(Laughter)Think of what this got them. They could outsource all their problems: protection from predators, food-finding ...(Laughter)... health maintenance.(Laughter)The only cost in most flocks \u2014 not even this \u2014 a loss of free mating. What a deal! \"How clever of sheep!\" you might say. Except, of course, it wasn't the sheep's cleverness. We all know sheep are not exactly rocket scientists \u2014 they're not very smart. It wasn't the cleverness of the sheep at all. They were clueless. But it was a very clever move. Whose clever move was it? It was the clever move of natural selection itself.Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA with Jim Watson, once joked about what he called Orgel's Second Rule. Leslie Orgel is a molecular biologist, brilliant guy, and Orgel's Second Rule is: Evolution is cleverer than you are. Now, that is not Intelligent Design \u2014 not from Francis Crick. Evolution is cleverer than you are. If you understand Orgel's Second Rule, then you understand why the Intelligent Design movement is basically a hoax.The designs discovered by the process of natural selection are brilliant, unbelievably brilliant. Again and again biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what's discovered. But the process itself is without purpose, without foresight, without design. When I was here four years ago, I told the story about an ant climbing a blade of grass. And why the ant was doing it was because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce. So it was sort of a spooky story.And I think some people may have misunderstood. Lancet flukes aren't smart. I submit that the intelligence of a lancet fluke is down there, somewhere between petunia and carrot. They're not really bright. They don't have to be. The lesson we learn from this is: you don't have to have a mind to be a beneficiary. The design is there in nature, but it's not in anybody's head. It doesn't have to be. That's the way evolution works. Question: Was domestication good for sheep? It was great for their genetic fitness.And here I want to remind you of a wonderful point that Paul MacCready made at TED three years ago. Here's what he said: \"Ten thousand years ago, at the dawn of agriculture, human population, plus livestock and pets, was approximately a tenth of one percent of the terrestrial vertebrate landmass.\" That was just 10,000 years ago. Yesterday, in biological terms. What is it today? Does anybody remember what he told us? 98 percent. That is what we have done on this planet.Now, I talked to Paul afterwards \u2014 I wanted to check to find out how he'd calculated this, and get the sources and so forth \u2014 and he also gave me a paper that he had written on this. And there was a passage in it which he did not present here and I think it is so good, I'm going to read it to you: \"Over billions of years on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life: complex, improbable, wonderful and fragile. Suddenly, we humans \u2014 a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature \u2014 have grown in population, technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush.\" We heard about the atmosphere as a thin layer of varnish. Life itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet. And we're the ones that hold the paintbrush. And how can we do that?The key to our domination of the planet is culture. And the key to culture is religion. Suppose Martian scientists came to Earth. They would be puzzled by many things. Anybody know what this is? I'll tell you what it is. This is a million people gathering on the banks of the Ganges in 2001, perhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever, as seen from satellite photograph. Here's a big crowd. Here's another crowd in Mecca. Martians would be amazed by this. They'd want to know how it originated, what it was for and how it perpetuates itself.Actually, I'm going to pass over this. The ant isn't alone. There's all sorts of wonderful cases of species which \u2014 in that case \u2014 A parasite gets into a mouse and needs to get into the belly of a cat. And it turns the mouse into Mighty Mouse, makes it fearless, so it runs out in the open, where it'll be eaten by a cat. True story. In other words, we have these hijackers \u2014 you've seen this slide before, from four years ago \u2014 a parasite that infects the brain and induces even suicidal behavior, on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness.Does that ever happen to us? Yes, it does \u2014 quite wonderfully. The Arabic word \"Islam\" means \"submission.\" It means \"surrender of self-interest to the will of Allah.\" But I'm not just talking about Islam. I'm talking also about Christianity. This is a parchment music page that I found in a Paris bookstall 50 years ago. And on it, it says, in Latin: \"Semen est verbum Dei. Sator autem Christus.\" The word of God is the seed and the sower of the seed is Christ. Same idea. Well, not quite. But in fact, Christians, too ... glory in the fact that they have surrendered to God. I'll give you a few quotes. \"The heart of worship is surrender. Surrendered people obey God's words, even if it doesn't make sense.\" Those words are by Rick Warren. Those are from \"The Purpose Driven Life.\"And I want to turn now, briefly, to talk about that book, which I've read. You've all got a copy, and you've just heard the man. And what I want to do now is say a bit about this book from the design standpoint, because I think it's actually a brilliant book. First of all, the goal \u2014 and you heard just now what the goal is \u2014 it's to bring purpose to the lives of millions, and he has succeeded. Is it a good goal? In itself, I'm sure we all agree, it is a wonderful goal. He's absolutely right. There are lots of people out there who don't have purpose in their life, and bringing purpose to their life is a wonderful goal. I give him an A+ on this.(Laughter)Is the goal achieved? Yes. Thirty million copies of this book. Al Gore, eat your heart out.(Laughter)Just exactly what Al is trying to do, Rick is doing. This is a fantastic achievement. And the means \u2014 how does he do it?It's a brilliant redesign of traditional religious themes \u2014 updating them, quietly dropping obsolete features, putting new interpretations on other features. This is the evolution of religion that's been going on for thousands of years, and he's just the latest brilliant practitioner of it. I don't have to tell you this; you just heard the man. Excellent insights into human psychology, wise advice on every page. Moreover, he invites us to look under the hood. I really appreciated that. For instance, he has an appendix where he explains his choice of translations of different Bible verses. The book is clear, vivid, accessible, beautifully formatted. Just enough repetition. That's really important. Every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain. Every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain.(Laughter)With me, everybody \u2014(Audience and Dan Dennett) Every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain.Thank you.And now we come to my problem. Because I'm absolutely sincere in my appreciation of all that I said about this book. But I wish it were better. I have some problems with the book. And it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems. I wish he could do this with a revision, a Mark 2 version of his book. \"The truth will set you free.\" That's what it says in the Bible, and it's something that I want to live by, too.My problem is, some of the bits in it I don't think are true. Now some of this is a difference of opinion. And that's not my main complaint, that's worth mentioning. Here's a passage \u2014 it's very much what he said, anyway: \"If there was no God we would all be accidents, the result of astronomical random chance in the Universe. You could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose or meaning or significance. There would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond your brief years on Earth.\" Now, I just do not believe that. By the way, I find \u2014 Homer Groening's film presented a beautiful alternative to that very claim. Yes, there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong. We don't need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us. But that, as I said, is just a difference of opinion. That's not what I'm really worried about.How about this: \"God designed this planet's environment just so we could live in it.\" I'm afraid that a lot of people take that sentiment to mean that we don't have to do the sorts of things that Al Gore is trying so hard to get us to do. I am not happy with that sentiment at all. And then I find this: \"All the evidence available in the biological sciences supports the core proposition that the cosmos is a specially designed whole with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose, a whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning and explanation in this central fact.\" Well, that's Michael Denton. He's a creationist. And here, I think, \"Wait a minute.\" I read this again. I read it three or four times and I think, \"Is he really endorsing Intelligent Design? Is he endorsing creationism here?\" And you can't tell. So I'm sort of thinking, \"Well, I don't know, I don't know if I want to get upset with this yet.\"But then I read on, and I read this: \"First, Noah had never seen rain, because prior to the Flood, God irrigated the earth from the ground up.\" I wish that sentence weren't in there, because I think it is false. And I think that thinking this way about the history of the planet, after we've just been hearing about the history of the planet over millions of years, discourages people from scientific understanding. Now, Rick Warren uses scientific terms and scientific factoids and information in a very interesting way.Here's one: \"God deliberately shaped and formed you to serve him in a way that makes your ministry unique. He carefully mixed the DNA cocktail that created you.\" I think that's false. Now, maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical. Here's another one: \"For instance, your brain can store 100 trillion facts. Your mind can handle 15,000 decisions a second.\" Well, it would be interesting to find the interpretation where I would accept that. There might be some way of treating that as true. \"Anthropologists have noted that worship is a universal urge, hardwired by God into the very fiber of our being \u2014 an inbuilt need to connect with God.\" Well, the sense of which I agree with him, except I think it has an evolutionary explanation.And what I find deeply troubling in this book is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral, if you want to have meaning in your life, you have to be an Intelligent Designer, you have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection. And I think, on the contrary, that it is very important to solving the world's problems that we take evolutionary biology seriously. Whose truth are we going to listen to? Well, this is from \"The Purpose Driven Life\": \"The Bible must become the authoritative standard for my life: the compass I rely on for direction, the counsel I listen to for making wise decisions, and the benchmark I use for evaluating everything.\" Well maybe, OK, but what's going to follow from this?And here's one that does concern me. Remember I quoted him before with this line: \"Surrendered people obey God's word, even if it doesn't make sense.\" And that's a problem.(Sighs)\"Don't ever argue with the Devil. He's better at arguing than you are, having had thousands of years to practice.\" Now, Rick Warren didn't invent this clever move. It's an old move. It's a very clever adaptation of religions. It's a wild card for disarming any reasonable criticism. \"You don't like my interpretation? You've got a reasonable objection to it? Don't listen, don't listen! That's the Devil speaking.\" This discourages the sort of reasoning citizenship it seems to me that we want to have.I've got one more problem, then I'm through. And I'd really like to get a response if Rick is able to do it. \"In the Great Commission, Jesus said, 'Go to all people of all nations and make them my disciples. Baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, and teach them to do everything I've told you.'\" The Bible says Jesus is the only one who can save the world. We've seen many wonderful maps of the world in the last day or so. Here's one, not as beautiful as the others; it simply shows the religions of the world. Here's one that shows the sort of current breakdown of the different religions.Do we really want to commit ourselves to engulfing all the other religions, when their holy books are telling them, \"Don't listen to the other side, that's just Satan talking!\"? It seems to me that that's a very problematic ship to get on for the future. I found this sign as I was driving to Maine recently, in front of a church: \"Good without God becomes zero.\" Sort of cute. A very clever little meme. I don't believe it and I think this idea, popular as it is \u2014 not in this guise, but in general \u2014 is itself one of the main problems that we face.If you are like me, you know many wonderful, committed, engaged atheists, agnostics, who are being very good without God. And you also know many religious people who hide behind their sanctity instead of doing good works. So, I wish we could drop this meme. I wish this meme would go extinct.Thanks very much for your attention.(Applause)", "id": 94, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.981 -->

religions.\n\n00:02:38.548 --> 00:02:44.111\nNow that very idea, I think,\nstrikes terror in many people,\n\n00:02:44.135 --> 00:02:48.735\nor anger, or anxiety\nof one sort or another.\n\n00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:52.128\nAnd that is the spell\nthat I want to break.\n\n00:02:52.152 --> 00:02:55.867\nI want to say, no, religions\nare an important natural phenomenon.\n\n00:02:55.891 --> 00:02:59.139\nWe should study them\nwith the same intensity\n\n00:02:59.163 --> 00:03:02.330\nthat we study all the other\nimportant natural phenomena,\n\n00:03:02.354 --> 00:03:05.934\nlike global warming, as we heard\nso eloquently last night from Al Gore.\n\n00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:10.934\nToday's religions are brilliantly\ndesigned -- brilliantly designed.\n\n00:03:11.578 --> 00:03:15.911\nThey are immensely powerful\nsocial institutions\n\n00:03:15.935 --> 00:03:21.215\nand many of their features\ncan be traced back to earlier features\n\n00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.498\nthat we can really make sense of\nby reverse engineering.\n\n00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:31.663\nAnd, as with the cow, there's a mixture\nof evolutionary design --\n\n00:03:31.687 --> 00:03:33.656\ndesigned by natural selection itself --\n\n00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.787\nand intelligent design --\n\n00:03:36.811 --> 00:03:38.625\nmore or less intelligent design --\n\n00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:40.347\nand redesigned by human beings\n\n00:03:40.371 --> 00:03:43.251\nwho are trying\nto redesign their religions.\n\n00:03:44.522 --> 00:03:48.102\nYou don't do book talks at TED,\n\n00:03:48.126 --> 00:03:52.250\nbut I'm going to have\njust one slide about my book,\n\n00:03:52.274 --> 00:03:54.947\nbecause there is one message in it\n\n00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:57.135\nwhich I think this group\nreally needs to hear.\n\n00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.691\nAnd I would be very interested\nto get your responses to this.\n\n00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:06.653\nIt's the one policy proposal\nthat I make in the book,\n\n00:04:06.677 --> 00:04:10.040\nat this time, when I claim\nnot to know enough about religion\n\n00:04:10.064 --> 00:04:12.683\nto know what other\npolicy proposals to make.\n\n00:04:12.707 --> 00:04:17.255\nAnd it's one that echoes remarks\nthat you've heard already today.\n\n00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.438\nHere's my proposal,\n\n00:04:18.462 --> 00:04:21.392\nI'm going to just take a couple\nof minutes to explain it:\n\n00:04:21.416 --> 00:04:26.960\nEducation on world religions\nfor all of our children --\n\n00:04:26.984 --> 00:04:29.127\nin primary school, in high school,\n\n00:04:29.151 --> 00:04:32.416\nin public schools, in private schools\nand in home schooling.\n\n00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.137\nSo what I'm proposing is,\n\n00:04:35.161 --> 00:04:41.021\njust as we require reading, writing,\narithmetic, American history,\n\n00:04:41.045 --> 00:04:48.045\nso we should have a curriculum on facts\nabout all the religions of the world --\n\n00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:52.934\nabout their history,\nabout their creeds, about their texts,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:57.619\ntheir music, their symbolisms,\ntheir prohibitions, their requirements.\n\n00:04:58.952 --> 00:05:03.771\nAnd this should be presented\nfactually, straightforwardly,\n\n00:05:03.795 --> 00:05:09.259\nwith no particular spin,\nto all of the children in the country.\n\n00:05:10.465 --> 00:05:13.758\nAnd as long as you teach them that,\n\n00:05:13.782 --> 00:05:15.934\nyou can teach them anything else you like.\n\n00:05:16.671 --> 00:05:20.663\nThat, I think, is maximal tolerance\nfor religious freedom.\n\n00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:25.934\nAs long as you inform your children\nabout other religions,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:29.104\nthen you may -- and as early as you like\nand whatever you like --\n\n00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:32.327\nteach them whatever creed\nyou want them to learn.\n\n00:05:32.914 --> 00:05:35.550\nBut also let them know\nabout other religions.\n\n00:05:35.574 --> 00:05:37.958\nNow, why do I say that?\n\n00:05:39.323 --> 00:05:45.129\nBecause democracy depends\non an informed citizenship.\n\n00:05:46.208 --> 00:05:51.958\nInformed consent is the very bedrock\nof our understanding of democracy.\n\n00:05:53.888 --> 00:05:56.934\nMisinformed consent is not worth it.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:06:00.181\nIt's like a coin flip;\nit doesn't count, really.\n\n00:06:00.205 --> 00:06:02.934\nDemocracy depends on informed consent.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:08.291\nThis is the way we treat people\nas responsible adults.\n\n00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:15.508\nNow, children below the age of consent\nare a special case.\n\n00:06:17.566 --> 00:06:23.157\nParents -- I'm going to use a word\nthat Pastor Rick just used --\n\n00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:25.323\nparents are stewards of their children.\n\n00:06:26.117 --> 00:06:27.442\nThey don't own them.\n\n00:06:28.244 --> 00:06:30.146\nYou can't own your children.\n\n00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.853\nYou have a responsibility to the world,\n\n00:06:33.877 --> 00:06:37.618\nto the state, to them,\nto take care of them right.\n\n00:06:39.801 --> 00:06:45.848\nYou may teach them whatever creed\nyou think is most important,\n\n00:06:45.872 --> 00:06:50.698\nbut I say you have a responsibility\nto let them be informed\n\n00:06:50.722 --> 00:06:53.254\nabout all the other creeds\nin the world, too.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:58.426\nThe reason I've taken this time\nis I've been fascinated to hear\n\n00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:59.958\nsome of the reactions to this.\n\n00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:06.737\nOne reviewer for a Roman Catholic\nnewspaper called it \"totalitarian.\"\n\n00:07:08.807 --> 00:07:11.958\nIt strikes me as practically libertarian.\n\n00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:16.052\nIs it totalitarian to require\nreading, writing and arithmetic?\n\n00:07:16.076 --> 00:07:17.235\nI don't think so.\n\n00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:19.238\nAll I'm saying is --\n\n00:07:19.262 --> 00:07:25.186\nand facts, facts only;\nno values, just facts --\n\n00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:26.958\nabout all the world's religions.\n\n00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:30.564\nAnother reviewer called it \"hilarious.\"\n\n00:07:31.858 --> 00:07:35.515\nWell, I'm really bothered by the fact\n\n00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:38.158\nthat anybody would think\nthat was hilarious.\n\n00:07:38.182 --> 00:07:42.163\nIt seems to me to be such a plausible,\n\n00:07:42.187 --> 00:07:46.583\nnatural extension of the democratic\nprinciples we already have\n\n00:07:46.607 --> 00:07:51.627\nthat I'm shocked to think anybody\nwould find that just ridiculous.\n\n00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.477\nI know many religions\n\n00:07:55.501 --> 00:08:02.138\nare so anxious about preserving the purity\nof their faith among their children\n\n00:08:02.162 --> 00:08:07.650\nthat they are intent on keeping\ntheir children ignorant of other faiths.\n\n00:08:09.103 --> 00:08:10.952\nI don't think that's defensible.\n\n00:08:12.142 --> 00:08:14.776\nBut I'd really be pleased\nto get your answers on that --\n\n00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.327\nany reactions to that -- later.\n\n00:08:16.351 --> 00:08:17.816\nBut now I'm going to move on.\n\n00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:19.934\nBack to the cow.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:23.322\nThis picture, which I pulled\noff the web --\n\n00:08:23.346 --> 00:08:26.651\nthe fellow on the left is really\nan important part of this picture.\n\n00:08:26.675 --> 00:08:27.934\nThat's the steward.\n\n00:08:28.263 --> 00:08:33.772\nCows couldn't live without human\nstewards -- they're domesticated.\n\n00:08:33.796 --> 00:08:36.534\nThey're a sort of ectosymbiont.\n\n00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:41.732\nThey depend on us for their survival.\n\n00:08:42.338 --> 00:08:45.681\nAnd Pastor Rick\nwas just talking about sheep.\n\n00:08:45.705 --> 00:08:47.404\nI'm going to talk about sheep, too.\n\n00:08:47.428 --> 00:08:50.411\nThere's a lot of serendipitous\nconvergence here.\n\n00:08:50.965 --> 00:08:54.874\nHow clever it was of sheep\nto acquire shepherds!\n\n00:08:54.898 --> 00:08:57.231\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:57.255 --> 00:08:59.040\nThink of what this got them.\n\n00:08:59.396 --> 00:09:01.934\nThey could outsource all their problems:\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.569\nprotection from predators,\nfood-finding ...\n\n00:09:04.593 --> 00:09:05.600\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:05.624 --> 00:09:06.959\n... health maintenance.\n\n00:09:06.983 --> 00:09:08.876\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:14.458\nThe only cost in most flocks --\nnot even this -- a loss of free mating.\n\n00:09:16.623 --> 00:09:17.789\nWhat a deal!\n\n00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:20.507\n\"How clever of sheep!\" you might say.\n\n00:09:20.531 --> 00:09:23.032\nExcept, of course,\nit wasn't the sheep's cleverness.\n\n00:09:23.056 --> 00:09:27.445\nWe all know sheep are not exactly rocket\nscientists -- they're not very smart.\n\n00:09:28.385 --> 00:09:30.508\nIt wasn't the cleverness\nof the sheep at all.\n\n00:09:30.532 --> 00:09:31.934\nThey were clueless.\n\n00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:35.093\nBut it was a very clever move.\n\n00:09:35.117 --> 00:09:36.440\nWhose clever move was it?\n\n00:09:36.464 --> 00:09:39.934\nIt was the clever move\nof natural selection itself.\n\n00:09:40.776 --> 00:09:46.559\nFrancis Crick, the co-discoverer\nof the structure of DNA\n\n00:09:46.583 --> 00:09:48.346\nwith Jim Watson,\n\n00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.187\nonce joked about what he called\nOrgel's Second Rule.\n\n00:09:51.536 --> 00:09:56.787\nLeslie Orgel is a molecular\nbiologist, brilliant guy,\n\n00:09:56.811 --> 00:09:58.181\nand Orgel's Second Rule is:\n\n00:09:58.205 --> 00:09:59.982\nEvolution is cleverer than you are.\n\n00:10:01.918 --> 00:10:07.321\nNow, that is not Intelligent Design --\nnot from Francis Crick.\n\n00:10:08.437 --> 00:10:10.128\nEvolution is cleverer than you are.\n\n00:10:10.152 --> 00:10:13.286\nIf you understand Orgel's Second Rule,\nthen you understand\n\n00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:18.213\nwhy the Intelligent Design movement\nis basically a hoax.\n\n00:10:20.174 --> 00:10:24.588\nThe designs discovered\nby the process of natural selection\n\n00:10:24.612 --> 00:10:26.992\nare brilliant, unbelievably brilliant.\n\n00:10:27.016 --> 00:10:31.934\nAgain and again biologists are fascinated\nwith the brilliance of what's discovered.\n\n00:10:32.241 --> 00:10:35.406\nBut the process itself is without purpose,\n\n00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:37.605\nwithout foresight, without design.\n\n00:10:38.316 --> 00:10:39.847\nWhen I was here four years ago,\n\n00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:42.792\nI told the story about an ant\nclimbing a blade of grass.\n\n00:10:42.816 --> 00:10:46.682\nAnd why the ant was doing it\nwas because its brain had been infected\n\n00:10:46.706 --> 00:10:51.878\nwith a lancet fluke that was needed\nto get into the belly of a sheep or a cow\n\n00:10:51.902 --> 00:10:54.276\nin order to reproduce.\n\n00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.934\nSo it was sort of a spooky story.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.704\nAnd I think some people\nmay have misunderstood.\n\n00:10:58.728 --> 00:11:00.332\nLancet flukes aren't smart.\n\n00:11:00.832 --> 00:11:05.066\nI submit that the intelligence\nof a lancet fluke is down there,\n\n00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:07.270\nsomewhere between petunia and carrot.\n\n00:11:07.294 --> 00:11:09.596\nThey're not really bright.\nThey don't have to be.\n\n00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.207\nThe lesson we learn from this is:\n\n00:11:11.231 --> 00:11:13.934\nyou don't have to have a mind\nto be a beneficiary.\n\n00:11:14.755 --> 00:11:19.247\nThe design is there in nature,\nbut it's not in anybody's head.\n\n00:11:19.708 --> 00:11:20.934\nIt doesn't have to be.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.641\nThat's the way evolution works.\n\n00:11:23.593 --> 00:11:25.720\nQuestion: Was domestication\ngood for sheep?\n\n00:11:26.181 --> 00:11:28.228\nIt was great for their genetic fitness.\n\n00:11:28.252 --> 00:11:30.934\nAnd here I want to remind you\nof a wonderful point\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.934\nthat Paul MacCready made\nat TED three years ago.\n\n00:11:34.955 --> 00:11:36.113\nHere's what he said:\n\n00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.601\n\"Ten thousand years ago,\nat the dawn of agriculture,\n\n00:11:39.625 -->

In itself, I'm sure\nwe all agree, it is a wonderful goal.\n\n00:15:30.697 --> 00:15:31.848\nHe's absolutely right.\n\n00:15:31.872 --> 00:15:35.680\nThere are lots of people out there\nwho don't have purpose in their life,\n\n00:15:35.704 --> 00:15:38.514\nand bringing purpose to their life\nis a wonderful goal.\n\n00:15:38.538 --> 00:15:40.130\nI give him an A+ on this.\n\n00:15:40.154 --> 00:15:41.978\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:42.002 --> 00:15:43.605\nIs the goal achieved?\n\n00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:46.934\nYes.\n\n00:15:48.224 --> 00:15:50.958\nThirty million copies of this book.\n\n00:15:52.477 --> 00:15:53.934\nAl Gore, eat your heart out.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:57.615\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:57.639 --> 00:16:01.260\nJust exactly what Al is trying\nto do, Rick is doing.\n\n00:16:01.284 --> 00:16:04.225\nThis is a fantastic achievement.\n\n00:16:04.986 --> 00:16:08.101\nAnd the means -- how does he do it?\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.934\nIt's a brilliant redesign\nof traditional religious themes --\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:15.259\nupdating them, quietly dropping\nobsolete features,\n\n00:16:15.283 --> 00:16:17.441\nputting new interpretations\non other features.\n\n00:16:17.465 --> 00:16:21.156\nThis is the evolution of religion that's\nbeen going on for thousands of years,\n\n00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.973\nand he's just the latest\nbrilliant practitioner of it.\n\n00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:28.347\nI don't have to tell you this;\nyou just heard the man.\n\n00:16:28.371 --> 00:16:32.934\nExcellent insights into human psychology,\nwise advice on every page.\n\n00:16:34.037 --> 00:16:37.365\nMoreover, he invites us\nto look under the hood.\n\n00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:38.738\nI really appreciated that.\n\n00:16:38.762 --> 00:16:41.206\nFor instance, he has an appendix\nwhere he explains\n\n00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.290\nhis choice of translations\nof different Bible verses.\n\n00:16:44.957 --> 00:16:49.958\nThe book is clear, vivid, accessible,\nbeautifully formatted.\n\n00:16:51.281 --> 00:16:52.934\nJust enough repetition.\n\n00:16:53.486 --> 00:16:54.772\nThat's really important.\n\n00:16:55.526 --> 00:16:59.218\nEvery time you read it or say it,\nyou make another copy in your brain.\n\n00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:04.574\nEvery time you read it or say it,\nyou make another copy in your brain.\n\n00:17:04.598 --> 00:17:05.606\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:06.874\nWith me, everybody --\n\n00:17:06.898 --> 00:17:09.874\n(Audience and Dan Dennett)\nEvery time you read it or say it,\n\n00:17:09.898 --> 00:17:12.199\nyou make another copy in your brain.\n\n00:17:12.223 --> 00:17:13.384\nThank you.\n\n00:17:13.408 --> 00:17:15.701\nAnd now we come to my problem.\n\n00:17:15.725 --> 00:17:18.934\nBecause I'm absolutely sincere\nin my appreciation\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.934\nof all that I said about this book.\n\n00:17:21.518 --> 00:17:23.176\nBut I wish it were better.\n\n00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.136\nI have some problems with the book.\n\n00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.939\nAnd it would just be insincere of me\nnot to address those problems.\n\n00:17:29.304 --> 00:17:33.067\nI wish he could do this with a revision,\n\n00:17:33.091 --> 00:17:35.522\na Mark 2 version of his book.\n\n00:17:37.558 --> 00:17:39.074\n\"The truth will set you free.\"\n\n00:17:39.494 --> 00:17:41.401\nThat's what it says in the Bible,\n\n00:17:41.425 --> 00:17:43.933\nand it's something\nthat I want to live by, too.\n\n00:17:44.376 --> 00:17:49.039\nMy problem is, some of the bits in it\nI don't think are true.\n\n00:17:49.706 --> 00:17:52.417\nNow some of this\nis a difference of opinion.\n\n00:17:54.131 --> 00:17:56.996\nAnd that's not my main complaint,\nthat's worth mentioning.\n\n00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:00.209\nHere's a passage -- it's very much\nwhat he said, anyway:\n\n00:18:00.233 --> 00:18:02.732\n\"If there was no God\nwe would all be accidents,\n\n00:18:02.756 --> 00:18:05.867\nthe result of astronomical\nrandom chance in the Universe.\n\n00:18:05.891 --> 00:18:09.269\nYou could stop reading this book\nbecause life would have no purpose\n\n00:18:09.293 --> 00:18:10.777\nor meaning or significance.\n\n00:18:10.801 --> 00:18:12.383\nThere would be no right or wrong\n\n00:18:12.407 --> 00:18:14.553\nand no hope beyond\nyour brief years on Earth.\"\n\n00:18:14.577 --> 00:18:16.486\nNow, I just do not believe that.\n\n00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:22.690\nBy the way, I find -- Homer Groening's\nfilm presented a beautiful alternative\n\n00:18:22.714 --> 00:18:24.055\nto that very claim.\n\n00:18:24.819 --> 00:18:28.224\nYes, there is meaning and a reason\nfor right or wrong.\n\n00:18:28.248 --> 00:18:34.482\nWe don't need a belief in God\nto be good or to have meaning in us.\n\n00:18:34.506 --> 00:18:38.767\nBut that, as I said,\nis just a difference of opinion.\n\n00:18:38.791 --> 00:18:40.934\nThat's not what I'm really worried about.\n\n00:18:41.608 --> 00:18:44.537\nHow about this: \"God designed\nthis planet's environment\n\n00:18:44.561 --> 00:18:46.068\njust so we could live in it.\"\n\n00:18:47.171 --> 00:18:51.613\nI'm afraid that a lot of people\ntake that sentiment to mean\n\n00:18:51.637 --> 00:18:54.257\nthat we don't have to do\nthe sorts of things\n\n00:18:54.281 --> 00:18:56.669\nthat Al Gore is trying so hard\nto get us to do.\n\n00:18:56.693 --> 00:18:58.934\nI am not happy with that sentiment at all.\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:03.530\nAnd then I find this: \"All the evidence\navailable in the biological sciences\n\n00:19:03.554 --> 00:19:07.238\nsupports the core proposition that\nthe cosmos is a specially designed whole\n\n00:19:07.262 --> 00:19:10.541\nwith life and mankind\nas its fundamental goal and purpose,\n\n00:19:10.565 --> 00:19:13.249\na whole in which all facets\nof reality have their meaning\n\n00:19:13.273 --> 00:19:15.290\nand explanation in this central fact.\"\n\n00:19:15.314 --> 00:19:17.573\nWell, that's Michael Denton.\nHe's a creationist.\n\n00:19:18.791 --> 00:19:21.934\nAnd here, I think, \"Wait a minute.\"\nI read this again.\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:23.997\nI read it three or four times and I think,\n\n00:19:24.021 --> 00:19:26.565\n\"Is he really endorsing\nIntelligent Design?\n\n00:19:26.589 --> 00:19:28.576\nIs he endorsing creationism here?\"\n\n00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.835\nAnd you can't tell.\n\n00:19:29.859 --> 00:19:31.964\nSo I'm sort of thinking,\n\"Well, I don't know,\n\n00:19:31.988 --> 00:19:34.385\nI don't know if I want\nto get upset with this yet.\"\n\n00:19:34.409 --> 00:19:38.493\nBut then I read on, and I read this:\n\"First, Noah had never seen rain,\n\n00:19:38.517 --> 00:19:42.374\nbecause prior to the Flood, God irrigated\nthe earth from the ground up.\"\n\n00:19:43.572 --> 00:19:47.934\nI wish that sentence weren't in there,\nbecause I think it is false.\n\n00:19:48.495 --> 00:19:51.662\nAnd I think that thinking this way\nabout the history of the planet,\n\n00:19:51.686 --> 00:19:55.409\nafter we've just been hearing\nabout the history of the planet\n\n00:19:55.433 --> 00:19:58.565\nover millions of years,\n\n00:19:58.589 --> 00:20:01.776\ndiscourages people\nfrom scientific understanding.\n\n00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:08.345\nNow, Rick Warren uses scientific terms\n\n00:20:08.369 --> 00:20:12.475\nand scientific factoids and information\nin a very interesting way.\n\n00:20:12.499 --> 00:20:15.863\nHere's one: \"God deliberately shaped\nand formed you to serve him\n\n00:20:15.887 --> 00:20:17.932\nin a way that makes your ministry unique.\n\n00:20:17.956 --> 00:20:21.599\nHe carefully mixed the DNA cocktail\nthat created you.\"\n\n00:20:24.766 --> 00:20:26.934\nI think that's false.\n\n00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:29.656\nNow, maybe we want to treat it\nas metaphorical.\n\n00:20:30.576 --> 00:20:34.155\nHere's another one: \"For instance,\nyour brain can store 100 trillion facts.\n\n00:20:34.179 --> 00:20:37.224\nYour mind can handle\n15,000 decisions a second.\"\n\n00:20:37.922 --> 00:20:40.596\nWell, it would be interesting\nto find the interpretation\n\n00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.001\nwhere I would accept that.\n\n00:20:42.025 --> 00:20:44.691\nThere might be some way\nof treating that as true.\n\n00:20:45.469 --> 00:20:48.777\n\"Anthropologists have noted\nthat worship is a universal urge,\n\n00:20:48.801 --> 00:20:51.456\nhardwired by God into\nthe very fiber of our being --\n\n00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.369\nan inbuilt need to connect with God.\"\n\n00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.518\nWell, the sense of which I agree with him,\n\n00:20:57.542 --> 00:20:59.922\nexcept I think it has\nan evolutionary explanation.\n\n00:20:59.946 --> 00:21:03.767\nAnd what I find\ndeeply troubling in this book\n\n00:21:03.791 --> 00:21:07.544\nis that he seems to be arguing\nthat if you want to be moral,\n\n00:21:07.568 --> 00:21:09.737\nif you want to have meaning in your life,\n\n00:21:09.761 --> 00:21:12.228\nyou have to be an Intelligent Designer,\n\n00:21:12.252 --> 00:21:15.773\nyou have to deny the theory of evolution\nby natural selection.\n\n00:21:15.797 --> 00:21:17.276\nAnd I think, on the contrary,\n\n00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.241\nthat it is very important\nto solving the world's problems\n\n00:21:20.265 --> 00:21:23.125\nthat we take evolutionary\nbiology seriously.\n\n00:21:24.385 --> 00:21:26.296\nWhose truth are we going to listen

about the book?\" And I say, \"That I got to write it.\" I would have never imagined that. Not in my wildest dreams did I think \u2014 I don't even consider myself to be an author. And I'm often asked, \"Why do you think so many people have read this? This thing's selling still about a million copies a month.\"And I think it's because spiritual emptiness is a universal disease. I think inside at some point, we put our heads down on the pillow and we go, \"There's got to be more to life than this.\" Get up in the morning, go to work, come home and watch TV, go to bed, get up in the morning, go to work, come home, watch TV, go to bed, go to parties on weekends. A lot of people say, \"I'm living.\" No, you're not living \u2014 that's just existing. Just existing. I really think that there's this inner desire. I do believe what Chris said; I believe that you're not an accident. Your parents may not have planned you, but I believe God did. I think there are accidental parents; there's no doubt about that. I don't think there are accidental kids. And I think you matter.I think you matter to God; I think you matter to history; I think you matter to this universe. And I think that the difference between what I call the survival level of living, the success level of living, and the significance level of living is: Do you figure out, \"What on Earth am I here for?\" I meet a lot of people who are very smart, and say, \"But why can't I figure out my problems?\" And I meet a lot of people who are very successful, who say, \"Why don't I feel more fulfilled? Why do I feel like a fake? Why do I feel like I've got to pretend that I'm more than I really am?\" I think that comes down to this issue of meaning, of significance, of purpose. I think it comes down to this issue of: \"Why am I here? What am I here for? Where am I going?\" These are not religious issues. They're human issues.I wanted to tell Michael before he spoke that I really appreciate what he does, because it makes my life work a whole lot easier. As a pastor, I do see a lot of kooks. And I have learned that there are kooks in every area of life. Religion doesn't have a monopoly on that, but there are plenty of religious kooks. There are secular kooks; there are smart kooks, dumb kooks. There are people \u2014 a lady came up to me the other day, and she had a white piece of paper \u2014 Michael, you'll like this one \u2014 and she said, \"What do you see in it?\" And I looked at it and I said, \"Oh, I don't see anything.\" And she goes, \"Well, I see Jesus,\" and started crying and left. I'm going, \"OK,\" you know? \"Fine.\"(Laughter)Good for you.When the book became the best-selling book in the world for the last three years, I kind of had my little crisis. And that was: What is the purpose of this? Because it brought in enormous amounts of money. When you write the best-selling book in the world, it's tons and tons of money. And it brought in a lot of attention, neither of which I wanted. When I started Saddleback Church, I was 25 years old. I started it with one other family in 1980. And I decided that I was never going to go on TV, because I didn't want to be a celebrity. I didn't want to be a, quote, \"evangelist, televangelist\" \u2014 that's not my thing. And all of the sudden, it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention. I don't think \u2014 now, this is a worldview, and I will tell you, everybody's got a worldview.Everybody's betting their life on something. You're betting your life on something, you just better know why you're betting what you're betting on. So, everybody's betting their life on something. And when I, you know, made a bet, I happened to believe that Jesus was who he said he was. And I believe in a pluralistic society, everybody's betting on something. And when I started the church, you know, I had no plans to do what it's doing now. And then when I wrote this book, and all of a sudden, it just took off, and I started saying, now, what's the purpose of this? Because as I started to say, I don't think you're given money or fame for your own ego, ever. I just don't believe that. And when you write a book that the first sentence of the book is, \"It's not about you,\" then, when all of a sudden it becomes the best-selling book in history, you've got to figure, well, I guess it's not about me. That's kind of a no-brainer. So, what is it for?And I began to think about what I call the \"stewardship of affluence\" and the \"stewardship of influence.\" So I believe, essentially, leadership is stewardship. That if you are a leader in any area \u2014 in business, in politics, in sports, in art, in academics, in any area \u2014 you don't own it. You are a steward of it. For instance, that's why I believe in protecting the environment. This is not my planet. It wasn't mine before I was born, it's not going to be mine after I die, I'm just here for 80 years and then that's it.I was debating the other day on a talk show, and the guy was challenging me and he'd go, \"What's a pastor doing on protecting the environment?\" And I asked this guy, I said, \"Well, do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation? Do you think we have a stewardship here, to take the environment seriously?\" And he said, \"No.\" I said, \"Oh, you don't?\" I said, \"Let me make this clear again: Do you believe that as human beings \u2014 I'm not talking about religion \u2014 do you believe that as human beings, it is our responsibility to take care of this planet, and make it just a little bit better for the next generation?\" And he said, \"No. Not any more than any other species.\" When he said the word \"species,\" he was revealing his worldview. And he was saying, \"I'm no more responsible to take care of this environment than a duck is.\" Well now, I know a lot of times we act like ducks, but you're not a duck. You're not a duck. And you are responsible \u2014 that's my worldview. And so, you need to understand what your worldview is.The problem is most people never really think it through. They never really ... codify it or qualify it or quantify it, and say, \"This is what I believe in. This is why I believe what I believe.\" I don't personally have enough faith to be an atheist. But you may, you may. Your worldview, though, does determine everything else in your life, because it determines your decisions; it determines your relationships; it determines your level of confidence. It determines, really, everything in your life. What we believe, obviously \u2014 and you know this \u2014 determines our behavior, and our behavior determines what we become in life.So all of this money started pouring in, and all of this fame started pouring in. And I'm going, what do I do with this? My wife and I first made five decisions on what to do with the money. We said, \"First, we're not going to use it on ourselves.\" I didn't go out and buy a bigger house. I don't own a guesthouse. I still drive the same four year-old Ford that I've driven. We just said, we're not going to use it on us. The second thing was, I stopped taking a salary from the church that I pastor. Third thing is, I added up all that the church had paid me over the last 25 years, and I gave it back. And I gave it back because I didn't want anybody thinking that I do what I do for money \u2014 I don't. In fact, personally, I've never met a priest or a pastor or a minister who does it for money. I know that's the stereotype; I've never met one of them. Believe me, there's a whole lot easier ways to make money.Pastors are like on 24 hours-a-day call, they're like doctors. I left late today \u2014 I'd hoped to be here yesterday \u2014 because my father-in-law is in his last, probably, 48 hours before he dies of cancer. And I'm watching a guy who's lived his life \u2014 he's now in his mid-80s \u2014 and he's dying with peace. You know, the test of your worldview is not how you act in the good times. The test of your worldview is how you act at the funeral. And having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of funerals, it makes a difference. It makes a difference what you believe.So, we gave it all back, and then we set up three foundations, working on some of the major problems of the world: illiteracy, poverty, pandemic diseases \u2014 particularly HIV/AIDS \u2014 and set up these three foundations, and put the money into that. The last thing we did is we became what I call \"reverse tithers.\" And that is, when my wife and I got married 30 years ago, we started tithing. Now, that's a principle in the Bible that says give 10 percent of what you get back to charity, give it away to help other people. So, we started doing that, and each year we would raise our tithe one percent. So, our first year of marriage we went to 11 percent, second year we went to 12 percent, and the third year we went to 13 percent, and on and on and on. Why did I do that? Because every time I give, it breaks the grip of materialism in my life.Materialism is all about getting \u2014 get, get, get, get all you can, can all you get, sit on the can and spoil the rest. It's all about more, having more. And we think that the good life is actually looking good \u2014 that's most important of all \u2014 looking good, feeling good and having the goods. But that's not the good life. I meet people all the time who have those, and they're not necessarily happy. If money actually made you happy, then the wealthiest people in the world would be the happiest. And that I know, personally, I know, is not true. It's just not true.So, the good life is not about looking good, feeling good or having the goods, it's about being good and doing good. Giving your life away. Significance in life doesn't come from status, because you can always find somebody who's got more than you. It doesn't come from sex. It doesn't come from salary. It comes from serving. It is in giving our lives away that we find meaning, we find significance. That's the way we were wired, I believe, by God. And so we began to give away, and now after 30 years, my wife and I are reverse tithers \u2014 we give away 90 percent and live on 10. That, actually, was the easy part. The hard part is, what do I do with all this attention? Because I started getting all kinds of invitations. I just came off a nearly month-long speaking tour on three different continents, and I won't go into that, but it was an amazing thing. And I'm going, what do I do with this notoriety that the book has brought?And, being a pastor, I started reading the Bible. There's a chapter in the Bible called Psalm 72, and it's Solomon's prayer for more influence. When you read this prayer, it sounds incredibly selfish, self-centered. He says, \"God, I want you to make me famous.\" That's what he prays. He said, \"I want you to make me famous. I want you to spread the fame of my name through every land, I want you to give me power. I want you to make me famous, I want you to give me influence.\" And it just sounds like the most egotistical request you could make, if you were going to pray. Until you read the whole psalm, the whole chapter. And then he says, \"So that the king ...\" \u2014 he was the king of Israel at that time, at its apex in power \u2014 \"... so that the king may care for the widow and orphan, support the oppressed, defend the defenseless, care for the sick, assist the poor, speak up for the foreigner, those in prison.\" Basically, he's talking about all the marginalized in society.And as I read that, I looked at it, and I thought, you know, what this is saying is that the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. The purpose of influence is not to build your ego. Or your net worth. And, by the way, your net worth is not the same thing as your self-worth. Your value is not based on your valuables. It's based on a whole different set of things. And so the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. And I had to admit: I can't think of the last time I thought of widows and orphans. They're not on my radar. I pastor a church in one of the most affluent areas of America \u2014 a bunch of gated communities. I have a church full of CEOs and scientists. And I could go five years and never, ever see a homeless person. They're just not in my pathway. Now, they're 13 miles up the road in Santa Ana. So I had to say, ok, I would use whatever affluence and whatever influence I've got to help those who don't have either of those.You know, there's a story in the Bible about Moses, whether you believe it's true or not, it really doesn't matter to me. But Moses, if you saw the movie, \"The Ten Commandments,\" Moses goes out, and there's this burning bush, and God talks to him, and God says, \"Moses, what's in your hand?\" I think that's one of the most important questions you'll ever be asked: What's in your hand? Moses says, \"It's a staff. It's a shepherd's staff.\" And God says, \"Throw it down.\" And if you saw the movie, you know, he throws it down and it becomes a snake. And then God says, \"Pick it up.\" And he picks it back up again, and it becomes a staff again. Now, I'm reading this thing, and I'm going, what is that all about? OK. What's that all about? Well, I do know a couple of things. Number one, God never does a miracle to show off. It's not just, \"Wow, isn't that cool?\" And, by the way, my God doesn't have to show up on cheese bread. You know, if God's going to show up, he's not going to show up on cheese bread.(Laughter)Ok? I just, this is why I love what Michael does, because it's like, if he's debunking it, then I don't have to. But God \u2014 my God \u2014 doesn't show up on sprinkler images. He's got a few more powerful ways than that to do whatever he wants to do. But he doesn't do miracles just to show off.Second thing is, if God ever asks you a question, he already knows the answer. Obviously, if he's God, then that would mean that when he asks the question, it's for your benefit, not his. So he's going, \"What's in your hand?\" Now, what was in Moses' hand? Well, it was a shepherd's staff. Now, follow me on this.This staff represented three things about Moses' life. First, it represented his identity; he was a shepherd. It's the symbol of his own occupation: I am a shepherd. It's a symbol of his identity, his career, his job. Second, it's a symbol of not only his identity, it's a symbol of his income, because all of his assets are tied up in sheep. In those days, nobody had bank accounts, or American Express cards, or hedge funds. Your assets are tied up in your flocks. So it's a symbol of his identity, and it's a symbol of his income. And the third thing: it's a symbol of his influence. What do you do with a shepherd's staff? Well, you know, you move sheep from point A to point B with it, by hook or by crook. You pull them or you poke them. One or the other. So, he's saying, \"You're going to lay down your identity. What's in your hand? You've got identity, you've got income, you've got influence. What's in your hand?\" And he's saying, \"If you lay it down, I'll make it come alive. I'll do some things you could never imagine possible.\" And if you've watched that movie, \"Ten Commandments,\" all of those big miracles that happen in Egypt are done through this staff.Last year, I was invited to speak at the NBA All-Stars game. And so, I'm talking to the players, because most of the NBA teams, NFL teams and all the other teams have done this 40 Days of Purpose, based on the book. And I asked them, I said, \"What's in your hand? So, what's in your hand?\" I said, \"It's a basketball. And that basketball represents your identity, who you are: you're an NBA player. It represents your income: you're making a lot of money off that little ball. And it represents your influence. And even though you're only going to be in the NBA for a few years, you're going to be an NBA player for the rest of your life. And that gives you enormous influence. So, what are you going to do with what you've been given?\"And I guess that's the main reason I came up here today, to all of you very bright people at TED \u2014 it is to say, \"What's in your hand?\" What do you have that you've been given? Talent, background, education, freedom, networks, opportunities, wealth, ideas, creativity. What are you doing with what you've been given? That, to me, is the primary question about life. That, to me, is what being purpose-driven is all about. In the book, I talk about how you're wired to do certain things, you're \"SHAPED\" with \u2014 a little acrostic: Spiritual gifts, Heart, Ability, Personality and Experiences. These things shape you. And if you want to know what you ought to be doing with your life, you need to look at your shape \u2014 \"What am I wired to do?\" Why would God wire you to do something and then not have you do it? If you're wired to be an anthropologist, you'll be an anthropologist. If you're wired to be an undersea explorer, you'll be an undersea explorer. If you're wired to make deals, you make deals. If you're wired to paint, you paint.Did you know that God smiles when you be you? When my little kids \u2014 when my kids were little \u2014 they're all grown now, I have grandkids \u2014 I used to go in and sit on the side of their bed, and I used to watch my kids sleep. And I just watched their little bodies rise and lower, rise and lower. And I would look at them: \"This is not an accident.\" Rise and lower. And I got joy out of just watching them sleep. Some people have the misguided idea that God only gets excited when you're doing, quote, \"spiritual things,\" like going to church or helping the poor, or, you know, confessing or doing something like that. The bottom line is, God gets pleasure watching you be you. Why? He made you. And when you do what you were made to do, he goes, \"That's my boy! That's my girl! You're using the talent and ability that I gave you.\"So my advice to you is: look at what's in your hand \u2014 your identity, your influence, your income \u2014 and say, \"It's not about me. It's about making the world a better place.\"Thank you.", "id": 71, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.354 --> 00:00:15.782\nI'm often asked,\n\n00:00:15.806 --> 00:00:18.254\n\"What surprised you about the book?\"\n\n00:00:18.278 --> 00:00:20.435\nAnd I say, \"That I got to write it.\"\n\n00:00:20.459 --> 00:00:22.613\nI would have never imagined that.\n\n00:00:23.288 --> 00:00:25.838\nNot in my wildest dreams did I think --\n\n00:00:25.862 --> 00:00:28.140\nI don't even consider\nmyself to be an author.\n\n00:00:29.247 --> 00:00:31.445\nAnd I'm often asked,\n\n00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:33.934\n\"Why do you think so many\npeople have read this?\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:37.184\nThis thing's selling still\nabout a million copies a month.\"\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:43.934\nAnd I think it's because\nspiritual emptiness\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.846\nis a universal disease.\n\n00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.487\nI think inside at some point, we put\nour heads down on the pillow and we go,\n\n00:00:50.511 --> 00:00:52.650\n\"There's got to be more\nto life than this.\"\n\n00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.891\nGet up in the morning, go to work,\ncome home and watch TV,\n\n00:00:55.915 --> 00:00:59.575\ngo to bed, get up in the morning, go\nto work, come home, watch TV, go to bed,\n\n00:00:59.599 --> 00:01:00.958\ngo to parties on weekends.\n\n00:01:02.241 --> 00:01:06.928\nA lot of people say, \"I'm living.\" No,\nyou're not living -- that's just existing.\n\n00:01:06.952 --> 00:01:08.471\nJust existing.\n\n00:01:08.495 --> 00:01:11.527\nI really think that\nthere's this inner desire.\n\n00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:16.226\nI do believe what Chris said;\nI believe that you're not an accident.\n\n00:01:17.686 --> 00:01:21.136\nYour parents may not have planned you,\nbut I believe God did.\n\n00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.391\nI think there are accidental parents;\nthere's no doubt about that.\n\n00:01:24.415 --> 00:01:26.490\nI don't think there are accidental kids.\n\n00:01:27.656 --> 00:01:29.399\nAnd I think you matter.\n\n00:01:30.494 --> 00:01:33.511\nI think you matter to God;\nI think you matter to history;\n\n00:01:33.535 --> 00:01:35.502\nI think you matter to this universe.\n\n00:01:36.907 --> 00:01:39.130\nAnd I think that the difference\n\n00:01:39.154 --> 00:01:43.934\nbetween what I call the survival level\nof living, the success level of living,\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.934\nand the significance level of living is:\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.640\nDo you figure out,\n\"What on Earth am I here for?\"\n\n00:01:49.482 --> 00:01:52.852\nI meet a lot of people who are very smart,\n\n00:01:52.876 --> 00:01:55.339\nand say, \"But why can't I\nfigure out my problems?\"\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.599\nAnd I meet a lot of people\nwho are very successful,\n\n00:01:58.623 --> 00:02:00.638\nwho say, \"Why don't I feel more fulfilled?\n\n00:02:01.337 --> 00:02:02.979\nWhy do I feel like a fake?\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:09.695\nWhy do I feel like I've got to pretend\nthat I'm more than I really am?\"\n\n00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.266\nI think that comes down to this issue\nof meaning, of significance, of purpose.\n\n00:02:14.854 --> 00:02:17.309\nI think it comes down to this issue of:\n\n00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:20.872\n\"Why am I here? What am I here for?\nWhere am I going?\"\n\n00:02:20.896 --> 00:02:23.072\nThese are not religious issues.\n\n00:02:23.737 --> 00:02:26.070\nThey're human issues.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:30.934\nI wanted to tell Michael before he spoke\nthat I really appreciate what he does,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:34.108\nbecause it makes my life work\na whole lot easier.\n\n00:02:34.132 --> 00:02:37.934\nAs a pastor, I do see a lot of kooks.\n\n00:02:38.354 --> 00:02:41.759\nAnd I have learned that there are\nkooks in every area of life.\n\n00:02:42.402 --> 00:02:46.730\nReligion doesn't have a monopoly on that,\n\n00:02:46.754 --> 00:02:48.791\nbut there are plenty of religious kooks.\n\n00:02:48.815 --> 00:02:52.202\nThere are secular kooks;\nthere are smart kooks, dumb kooks.\n\n00:02:52.226 --> 00:02:54.837\nThere are people -- a lady\ncame up to me the other day,\n\n00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:58.176\nand she had a white piece of paper --\nMichael, you'll like this one --\n\n00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.026\nand she said, \"What do you see in it?\"\n\n00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.790\nAnd I looked at it and I said,\n\"Oh, I don't see anything.\"\n\n00:03:02.814 --> 00:03:05.786\nAnd she goes, \"Well, I see Jesus,\"\nand started crying and left.\n\n00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.314\nI'm going, \"OK,\" you know? \"Fine.\"\n\n00:03:10.338 --> 00:03:12.498\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:12.522 --> 00:03:13.672\nGood for you.\n\n00:03:16.408 --> 00:03:20.289\nWhen the book became the best-selling book\nin the world for the last three years,\n\n00:03:20.313 --> 00:03:22.468\nI kind of had my little crisis.\n\n00:03:23.344 --> 00:03:25.958\nAnd that was: What is the purpose of this?\n\n00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.514\nBecause it brought in\nenormous amounts of money.\n\n00:03:30.538 --> 00:03:32.959\nWhen you write the best-selling\nbook in the world,\n\n00:03:32.983 --> 00:03:34.725\nit's tons and tons of money.\n\n00:03:35.852 --> 00:03:39.127\nAnd it brought in a lot of attention,\nneither of which I wanted.\n\n00:03:39.151 --> 00:03:42.146\nWhen I started Saddleback Church,\nI was 25 years old.\n\n00:03:42.567 --> 00:03:46.973\nI started it with\none other family in 1980.\n\n00:03:47.632 --> 00:03:49.934\nAnd I decided that I was never\ngoing to go on TV,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.880\nbecause I didn't want to be a celebrity.\n\n00:03:51.904 --> 00:03:55.085\nI didn't want to be a, quote,\n\"evangelist, televangelist\" --\n\n00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.958\nthat's not my thing.\n\n00:03:57.854 --> 00:04:02.128\nAnd all of the sudden, it brought a lot\nof money and a lot of attention.\n\n00:04:02.152 --> 00:04:03.692\nI don't think --\n\n00:04:03.716 --> 00:04:04.957\nnow, this is a worldview,\n\n00:04:04.981 --> 00:04:07.431\nand I will tell you,\neverybody's got a worldview.\n\n00:04:07.995 --> 00:04:10.054\nEverybody's betting\ntheir life on something.\n\n00:04:10.078 --> 00:04:11.915\nYou're betting your life on something,\n\n00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.343\nyou just better know why\nyou're betting what you're betting on.\n\n00:04:15.367 --> 00:04:17.648\nSo, everybody's betting\ntheir life on something.\n\n00:04:18.616 --> 00:04:22.578\nAnd when I, you know, made a bet,\n\n00:04:22.602 --> 00:04:25.514\nI happened to believe\nthat Jesus was who he said he was.\n\n00:04:26.117 --> 00:04:29.076\nAnd I believe in a pluralistic society,\n\n00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.037\neverybody's betting on something.\n\n00:04:32.362 --> 00:04:35.460\nAnd when I started the church,\n\n00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:39.050\nyou know, I had no plans\nto do what it's doing now.\n\n00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:41.986\nAnd then when I wrote this book,\n\n00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.535\nand all of a sudden, it just took off,\n\n00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:49.146\nand I started saying, now,\nwhat's the purpose of this?\n\n00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.891\nBecause as I started to say,\n\n00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:53.111\nI don't think you're given money or fame\n\n00:04:53.135 --> 00:04:54.715\nfor your own ego, ever.\n\n00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:57.746\nI just don't believe that.\n\n00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:01.516\nAnd when you write a book\nthat the first sentence of the book is,\n\n00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.962\n\"It's not about you,\"\n\n00:05:03.986 --> 00:05:07.366\nthen, when all of a sudden it becomes\nthe best-selling book in history,\n\n00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.953\nyou've got to figure, well,\nI guess it's not about me.\n\n00:05:10.622 --> 00:05:12.265\nThat's kind of a no-brainer.\n\n00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:14.825\nSo, what is it for?\n\n00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:19.307\nAnd I began to think about what I call\nthe \"stewardship of affluence\"\n\n00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:21.934\nand the \"stewardship of influence.\"\n\n00:05:22.392 --> 00:05:25.062\nSo I believe, essentially,\nleadership is stewardship.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.383\nThat if you are a leader in any area --\n\n00:05:28.407 --> 00:05:31.923\nin business, in politics,\nin sports, in art,\n\n00:05:31.947 --> 00:05:34.015\nin academics, in any area --\n\n00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:35.341\nyou don't own it.\n\n00:05:36.722 --> 00:05:38.237\nYou are a steward of it.\n\n00:05:38.867 --> 00:05:41.938\nFor instance, that's why I believe\nin protecting the environment.\n\n00:05:41.962 --> 00:05:43.522\nThis is not my planet.\n\n00:05:43.546 --> 00:05:47.009\nIt wasn't mine before I was born,\nit's not going to be mine after I die,\n\n00:05:47.033 --> 00:05:50.204\nI'm just here for 80 years\nand then that's it.\n\n00:05:50.228 --> 00:05:54.325\nI was debating\nthe other day on a talk show,\n\n00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:56.362\nand the guy was challenging\nme and he'd go,\n\n00:05:56.386 --> 00:05:58.958\n\"What's a pastor doing\non protecting the environment?\"\n\n00:05:59.814 --> 00:06:03.591\nAnd I asked this guy, I said,\n\"Well, do you believe\n\n00:06:03.615 --> 00:06:07.498\nthat human beings are responsible\n\n00:06:07.522 --> 00:06:11.283\nto make the world a little bit better\nplace for the next generation?\n\n00:06:11.307 --> 00:06:15.538\nDo you think we have a stewardship here,\nto take the environment seriously?\"\n\n00:06:16.292 --> 00:06:17.570\nAnd he said, \"No.\"\n\n00:06:18.243 --> 00:06:19.397\nI said, \"Oh, you don't?\"\n\n00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:21.246\nI said, \"Let me make this clear again:\n\n00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.216\nDo you believe that as human beings --\nI'm not talking about religion --\n\n00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.112\ndo you believe that as human beings,\nit is our responsibility\n\n00:06:28.136 --> 00:06:29.478\nto take care of this planet,\n\n00:06:29.502 --> 00:06:32.425\nand make it just a little bit better\nfor the next generation?\"\n\n00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:35.958\nAnd he said, \"No. Not any more\nthan any other species.\"\n\n00:06:37.158 --> 00:06:40.745\nWhen he said the word \"species,\"\nhe was revealing his worldview.\n\n00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.534\nAnd he was saying,\n\n00:06:42.558 --> 00:06:46.573\n\"I'm no more responsible to take care\nof this environment than a duck is.\"\n\n00:06:47.845 --> 00:06:50.435\nWell now, I know a lot\nof times we act like ducks,\n\n00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:51.657\nbut you're not a duck.\n\n00:06:52.593 --> 00:06:53.763\nYou're not a duck.\n\n00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:57.379\nAnd you are responsible --\nthat's my worldview.\n\n00:06:58.355 --> 00:07:02.630\nAnd so, you need to understand\nwhat your worldview is.\n\n00:07:02.654 --> 00:07:06.154\nThe problem is most people\nnever really think it through.\n\n00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:10.680\nThey never really ...\n\n00:07:10.704 --> 00:07:14.037\ncodify it or qualify it or quantify it,\n\n00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:18.143\nand say, \"This is what I believe in.\nThis is why I believe what I believe.\"\n\n00:07:18.167 --> 00:07:21.165\nI don't personally have\nenough faith to be an atheist.\n\n00:07:22.117 --> 00:07:24.443\nBut you may, you may.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:29.047\nYour worldview, though, does determine\neverything else in your life,\n\n00:07:29.071 --> 00:07:31.793\nbecause it determines your decisions;\n\n00:07:31.817 --> 00:07:34.206\nit determines your relationships;\n\n00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.469\nit determines your level of confidence.\n\n00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.715\nIt determines, really,\neverything in your life.\n\n00:07:40.235 --> 00:07:42.012\nWhat we believe, obviously --\n\n00:07:42.036 --> 00:07:44.743\nand you know this --\ndetermines our behavior,\n\n00:07:44.767 --> 00:07:48.529\nand our behavior determines\nwhat we become in life.\n\n00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.934\nSo all of this money started pouring in,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.902\nand all of this fame started pouring in.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nAnd I'm going, what do I do with this?\n\n00:08:00.497 --> 00:08:03.958\nMy wife and I first made five decisions\non what to do with the money.\n\n00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:09.035\nWe said, \"First, we're not\ngoing to use it on ourselves.\"\n\n00:08:09.708 --> 00:08:11.712\nI didn't go out and buy a bigger house.\n\n00:08:12.057 --> 00:08:13.832\nI don't own a guesthouse.\n\n00:08:13.856 --> 00:08:16.958\nI still drive the same four year-old\nFord that I've driven.\n\n00:08:17.577 --> 00:08:19.760\nWe just said, we're not\ngoing to use it on us.\n\n00:08:20.617 --> 00:08:23.288\nThe second thing was,\n\n00:08:23.312 --> 00:08:26.740\nI stopped taking a salary\nfrom the church that I pastor.\n\n00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.979\nThird thing is, I added up\nall that the church had paid me\n\n00:08:30.003 --> 00:08:32.691\nover the last 25 years,\nand I gave it back.\n\n00:08:33.668 --> 00:08:36.358\nAnd I gave it back because\nI didn't want anybody thinking\n\n00:08:36.382 --> 00:08:38.690\nthat I do what I do for money -- I don't.\n\n00:08:38.714 --> 00:08:42.358\nIn fact, personally, I've never met\n\n00:08:42.382 --> 00:08:45.774\na priest or a pastor or a minister\nwho does it for money.\n\n00:08:45.798 --> 00:08:48.853\nI know that's the stereotype;\nI've never met one of them.\n\n00:08:48.877 --> 00:08:51.958\nBelieve me, there's a whole lot\neasier ways to make money.\n\n00:08:52.721 --> 00:08:56.539\nPastors are like on 24 hours-a-day call,\nthey're like doctors.\n\n00:08:56.563 --> 00:09:00.007\nI left late today -- I'd hoped\nto be here yesterday --\n\n00:09:00.031 --> 00:09:03.481\nbecause my father-in-law\nis in his last, probably, 48 hours\n\n00:09:03.505 --> 00:09:04.831\nbefore he dies of cancer.\n\n00:09:05.244 --> 00:09:07.934\nAnd I'm watching a guy\nwho's lived his life --\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:11.914\nhe's now in his mid-80s --\nand he's dying with peace.\n\n00:09:11.938 --> 00:09:17.019\nYou know, the test of your worldview\nis not how you act in the good times.\n\n00:09:17.513 --> 00:09:21.151\nThe test of your worldview\nis how you act at the funeral.\n\n00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:26.328\nAnd having been through literally\nhundreds if not thousands of funerals,\n\n00:09:26.352 --> 00:09:27.677\nit makes a difference.\n\n00:09:28.129 --> 00:09:30.161\nIt makes a difference what you believe.\n\n00:09:31.467 --> 00:09:35.332\nSo, we gave it all back,\n\n00:09:35.356 --> 00:09:38.194\nand then we set up three foundations,\n\n00:09:38.218 --> 00:09:40.615\nworking on some of the major\nproblems of the world:\n\n00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:46.489\nilliteracy, poverty, pandemic diseases --\nparticularly HIV/AIDS --\n\n00:09:46.513 --> 00:09:50.691\nand set up these three foundations,\nand put the money into that.\n\n00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:54.056\nThe last thing we did is we became\nwhat I call \"reverse tithers.\"\n\n00:09:54.493 --> 00:10:01.306\nAnd that is, when my wife\nand I got married 30 years ago,\n\n00:10:02.029 --> 00:10:04.873\nwe started tithing.\n\n00:10:04.897 --> 00:10:06.986\nNow, that's a principle in the Bible\n\n00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:10.093\nthat says give 10 percent\nof what you get back to charity,\n\n00:10:10.117 --> 00:10:11.958\ngive it away to help other people.\n\n00:10:12.823 --> 00:10:16.819\nSo, we started doing that, and each year\nwe would raise our tithe one percent.\n\n00:10:16.843 --> 00:10:19.341\nSo, our first year of marriage\nwe went to 11 percent,\n\n00:10:19.365 --> 00:10:21.002\nsecond year we went to 12 percent,\n\n00:10:21.026 --> 00:10:23.772\nand the third year we went to 13 percent,\n\n00:10:23.796 --> 00:10:25.051\nand on and on and on.\n\n00:10:26.297 --> 00:10:27.503\nWhy did I do that?\n\n00:10:27.527 --> 00:10:29.119\nBecause every time I give,\n\n00:10:29.143 --> 00:10:31.958\nit breaks the grip\nof materialism in my life.\n\n00:10:33.175 --> 00:10:37.779\nMaterialism is all about getting --\nget, get, get, get all you can,\n\n00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:40.526\ncan all you get, sit on the can\nand spoil the rest.\n\n00:10:41.557 --> 00:10:45.473\nIt's all about more, having more.\n\n00:10:45.497 --> 00:10:49.592\nAnd we think that the good life\nis actually looking good --\n\n00:10:49.616 --> 00:10:51.107\nthat's most important of all --\n\n00:10:51.131 --> 00:10:54.815\nlooking good, feeling good\nand having the goods.\n\n00:10:55.712 --> 00:10:57.108\nBut that's not the good life.\n\n00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:01.702\nI meet people all the time who have\nthose, and they're not necessarily happy.\n\n00:11:01.726 --> 00:11:03.934\nIf money actually made you happy,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.911\nthen the wealthiest people\nin the world would be the happiest.\n\n00:11:06.935 --> 00:11:09.339\nAnd that I know, personally,\nI know, is not true.\n\n00:11:09.841 --> 00:11:11.037\nIt's just not true.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:15.789\nSo, the good life is not about looking\ngood, feeling good or having the goods,\n\n00:11:15.813 --> 00:11:18.042\nit's about being good and doing good.\n\n00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.934\nGiving your life away.\n\n00:11:21.537 --> 00:11:25.205\nSignificance in life\ndoesn't come from status,\n\n00:11:25.229 --> 00:11:28.112\nbecause you can always find\nsomebody who's got more than you.\n\n00:11:28.136 --> 00:11:29.652\nIt doesn't come from sex.\n\n00:11:29.676 --> 00:11:31.492\nIt doesn't come from salary.\n\n00:11:32.262 --> 00:11:33.934\nIt comes from serving.\n\n00:11:34.616 --> 00:11:37.337\nIt is in giving our lives away\nthat we find meaning,\n\n00:11:37.361 --> 00:11:38.749\nwe find significance.\n\n00:11:39.448 --> 00:11:42.551\nThat's the way we were wired,\nI believe, by God.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.934\nAnd so we began to give away,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.934\nand now after 30 years,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.816\nmy wife and I are reverse tithers --\nwe give away 90 percent and live on 10.\n\n00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:55.883\nThat, actually, was the easy part.\n\n00:11:55.907 --> 00:11:58.636\nThe hard part is, what do I do\nwith all this attention?\n\n00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.261\nBecause I started getting\nall kinds of invitations.\n\n00:12:02.285 --> 00:12:06.222\nI just came off a nearly\nmonth-long speaking tour\n\n00:12:06.246 --> 00:12:08.051\non three different continents,\n\n00:12:08.075 --> 00:12:10.765\nand I won't go into that,\n\n00:12:10.789 --> 00:12:12.752\nbut it was an amazing thing.\n\n00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:17.281\nAnd I'm going, what do I do\nwith this notoriety\n\n00:12:17.305 --> 00:12:18.749\nthat the book has brought?\n\n00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:23.013\nAnd, being a pastor,\nI started reading the Bible.\n\n00:12:23.568 --> 00:12:26.337\nThere's a chapter in the Bible\ncalled Psalm 72,\n\n00:12:26.361 --> 00:12:30.106\nand it's Solomon's prayer\nfor more influence.\n\n00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:31.934\nWhen you read this prayer,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:35.918\nit sounds incredibly\nselfish, self-centered.\n\n00:12:35.981 --> 00:12:38.517\nHe says, \"God, I want you\nto make me famous.\"\n\n00:12:38.541 --> 00:12:39.981\nThat's what he prays.\n\n00:12:40.005 --> 00:12:41.872\nHe said, \"I want you to make me famous.\n\n00:12:41.896 --> 00:12:44.729\nI want you to spread the fame\nof my name through every land,\n\n00:12:44.753 --> 00:12:48.064\nI want you to give me power.\n\n00:12:48.088 --> 00:12:51.703\nI want you to make me famous,\nI want you to give me influence.\"\n\n00:12:51.727 --> 00:12:54.958\nAnd it just sounds like the most\negotistical request you could make,\n\n00:12:54.982 --> 00:12:56.306\nif you were going to pray.\n\n00:12:57.402 --> 00:13:00.051\nUntil you read the whole psalm,\nthe whole chapter.\n\n00:13:00.075 --> 00:13:02.693\nAnd then he says,\n\"So that the king ...\" --\n\n00:13:02.717 --> 00:13:07.504\nhe was the king of Israel\nat that time, at its apex in power --\n\n00:13:07.528 --> 00:13:11.267\n\"... so that the king may care\nfor the widow and orphan,\n\n00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:15.295\nsupport the oppressed, defend\nthe defenseless, care for the sick,\n\n00:13:15.319 --> 00:13:18.934\nassist the poor,\nspeak up for the foreigner,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.934\nthose in prison.\"\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.127\nBasically, he's talking about\nall the marginalized in society.\n\n00:13:24.715 --> 00:13:26.304\nAnd as I read that,\n\n00:13:26.328 --> 00:13:29.758\nI looked at it, and I thought, you know,\n\n00:13:29.782 --> 00:13:33.729\nwhat this is saying is that the purpose\nof influence is to speak up\n\n00:13:33.753 --> 00:13:35.824\nfor those who have no influence.\n\n00:13:37.721 --> 00:13:40.410\nThe purpose of influence\nis not to build your ego.\n\n00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:44.102\nOr your net worth.\n\n00:13:44.126 --> 00:13:47.778\nAnd, by the way, your net worth is not\nthe same thing as your self-worth.\n\n00:13:47.802 --> 00:13:51.522\nYour value is not based on your valuables.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.255\nIt's based on a whole\ndifferent set of things.\n\n00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:58.795\nAnd so the purpose\nof influence is to speak up\n\n00:13:58.819 --> 00:14:00.359\nfor those who have no influence.\n\n00:14:00.383 --> 00:14:02.297\nAnd I had to admit:\n\n00:14:02.321 --> 00:14:05.347\nI can't think of the last time\nI thought of widows and orphans.\n\n00:14:05.371 --> 00:14:07.471\nThey're not on my radar.\n\n00:14:08.219 --> 00:14:11.407\nI pastor a church in one of the most\naffluent areas of America --\n\n00:14:11.431 --> 00:14:13.288\na bunch of gated communities.\n\n00:14:13.312 --> 00:14:15.900\nI have a church full\nof CEOs and scientists.\n\n00:14:17.598 --> 00:14:21.934\nAnd I could go five years and never,\never see a homeless person.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.934\nThey're just not in my pathway.\n\n00:14:24.337 --> 00:14:27.152\nNow, they're 13 miles\nup the road in Santa Ana.\n\n00:14:28.825 --> 00:14:30.934\nSo I had to say, ok,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:34.743\nI would use whatever affluence\nand whatever influence I've got\n\n00:14:34.767 --> 00:14:38.337\nto help those who don't have\neither of those.\n\n00:14:39.568 --> 00:14:42.299\nYou know, there's a story\nin the Bible about Moses,\n\n00:14:42.323 --> 00:14:45.902\nwhether you believe it's true or not,\nit really doesn't matter to me.\n\n00:14:45.926 --> 00:14:48.566\nBut Moses, if you saw the movie,\n\"The Ten Commandments,\"\n\n00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:51.873\nMoses goes out, and there's this\nburning bush, and God talks to him,\n\n00:14:51.897 --> 00:14:55.652\nand God says,\n\"Moses, what's in your hand?\"\n\n00:14:57.219 --> 00:15:01.060\nI think that's one of the most important\nquestions you'll ever be asked:\n\n00:15:01.084 --> 00:15:02.411\nWhat's in your hand?\n\n00:15:03.374 --> 00:15:07.537\nMoses says, \"It's a staff.\nIt's a shepherd's staff.\"\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.824\nAnd God says, \"Throw it down.\"\n\n00:15:09.848 --> 00:15:14.561\nAnd if you saw the movie, you know,\nhe throws it down and it becomes a snake.\n\n00:15:16.188 --> 00:15:18.364\nAnd then God says, \"Pick it up.\"\n\n00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:20.934\nAnd he picks it back up again,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.578\nand it becomes a staff again.\n\n00:15:24.315 --> 00:15:28.077\nNow, I'm reading this thing,\nand I'm going, what is that all about?\n\n00:15:28.101 --> 00:15:31.414\nOK. What's that all about? Well,\nI do know a couple of things.\n\n00:15:31.438 --> 00:15:34.553\nNumber one, God never does\na miracle to show off.\n\n00:15:35.049 --> 00:15:37.092\nIt's not just, \"Wow, isn't that cool?\"\n\n00:15:37.116 --> 00:15:40.331\nAnd, by the way, my God doesn't\nhave to show up on cheese bread.\n\n00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:44.734\nYou know, if God's going to show up,\nhe's not going to show up on cheese bread.\n\n00:15:44.758 --> 00:15:45.951\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:45.975 --> 00:15:48.850\nOk? I just, this is why I love\nwhat Michael does,\n\n00:15:48.874 --> 00:15:53.532\nbecause it's like, if he's debunking it,\nthen I don't have to.\n\n00:15:53.556 --> 00:15:57.004\nBut God -- my God --\ndoesn't show up on sprinkler images.\n\n00:15:57.718 --> 00:16:01.934\nHe's got a few more powerful ways\nthan that to do whatever he wants to do.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:05.040\nBut he doesn't do miracles\njust to show off.\n\n00:16:05.064 --> 00:16:07.363\nSecond thing is,\nif God ever asks you a question,\n\n00:16:07.387 --> 00:16:08.960\nhe already knows the answer.\n\n00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.857\nObviously, if he's God,\nthen that would mean\n\n00:16:11.881 --> 00:16:15.561\nthat when he asks the question,\nit's for your benefit, not his.\n\n00:16:15.585 --> 00:16:17.446\nSo he's going, \"What's in your hand?\"\n\n00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:18.934\nNow, what was in Moses' hand?\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nWell, it was a shepherd's staff.\nNow, follow me on this.\n\n00:16:22.995 --> 00:16:26.400\nThis staff represented\nthree things about Moses' life.\n\n00:16:26.424 --> 00:16:29.963\nFirst, it represented his identity;\nhe was a shepherd.\n\n00:16:29.987 --> 00:16:33.286\nIt's the symbol of his own occupation:\n\n00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:34.611\nI am a shepherd.\n\n00:16:35.177 --> 00:16:37.934\nIt's a symbol of his identity,\nhis career, his job.\n\n00:16:38.327 --> 00:16:41.477\nSecond, it's a symbol\nof not only his identity,\n\n00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:45.656\nit's a symbol of his income, because all\nof his assets are tied up in sheep.\n\n00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.077\nIn those days, nobody had bank accounts,\nor American Express cards, or hedge funds.\n\n00:16:50.101 --> 00:16:52.815\nYour assets are tied up in your flocks.\n\n00:16:53.235 --> 00:16:56.917\nSo it's a symbol of his identity,\nand it's a symbol of his income.\n\n00:16:56.941 --> 00:16:59.584\nAnd the third thing:\nit's a symbol of his influence.\n\n00:17:00.306 --> 00:17:03.613\nWhat do you do with a shepherd's staff?\n\n00:17:03.637 --> 00:17:07.390\nWell, you know, you move sheep\nfrom point A to point B with it,\n\n00:17:07.414 --> 00:17:09.055\nby hook or by crook.\n\n00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:12.127\nYou pull them or you poke them.\nOne or the other.\n\n00:17:13.363 --> 00:17:15.291\nSo, he's saying,\n\n00:17:15.315 --> 00:17:17.354\n\"You're going to lay down your identity.\n\n00:17:17.378 --> 00:17:18.533\nWhat's in your hand?\n\n00:17:18.557 --> 00:17:21.430\nYou've got identity, you've got income,\nyou've got influence.\n\n00:17:21.454 --> 00:17:22.611\nWhat's in your hand?\"\n\n00:17:23.456 --> 00:17:26.385\nAnd he's saying, \"If you lay it down,\nI'll make it come alive.\n\n00:17:26.409 --> 00:17:28.984\nI'll do some things\nyou could never imagine possible.\"\n\n00:17:29.008 --> 00:17:31.502\nAnd if you've watched that movie,\n\"Ten Commandments,\"\n\n00:17:31.526 --> 00:17:36.006\nall of those big miracles that happen\nin Egypt are done through this staff.\n\n00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:43.165\nLast year, I was invited to speak\nat the NBA All-Stars game.\n\n00:17:43.898 --> 00:17:46.934\nAnd so, I'm talking to the players,\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:51.259\nbecause most of the NBA teams,\nNFL teams and all the other teams\n\n00:17:51.283 --> 00:17:54.132\nhave done this 40 Days of Purpose,\nbased on the book.\n\n00:17:54.466 --> 00:17:57.958\nAnd I asked them, I said,\n\"What's in your hand?\n\n00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:02.527\nSo, what's in your hand?\"\nI said, \"It's a basketball.\n\n00:18:03.369 --> 00:18:07.086\nAnd that basketball represents\nyour identity, who you are:\n\n00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.584\nyou're an NBA player.\n\n00:18:08.608 --> 00:18:10.180\nIt represents your income:\n\n00:18:10.204 --> 00:18:12.783\nyou're making a lot of money\noff that little ball.\n\n00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.958\nAnd it represents your influence.\n\n00:18:15.603 --> 00:18:18.910\nAnd even though you're only going\nto be in the NBA for a few years,\n\n00:18:18.934 --> 00:18:21.721\nyou're going to be an NBA player\nfor the rest of your life.\n\n00:18:21.745 --> 00:18:23.840\nAnd that gives you enormous influence.\n\n00:18:24.212 --> 00:18:27.487\nSo, what are you going to do\nwith what you've been given?\"\n\n00:18:28.743 --> 00:18:33.232\nAnd I guess that's the main reason\nI came up here today,\n\n00:18:33.256 --> 00:18:36.185\nto all of you very bright people at TED --\n\n00:18:36.209 --> 00:18:38.106\nit is to say, \"What's in your hand?\"\n\n00:18:40.114 --> 00:18:43.633\nWhat do you have that you've been given?\n\n00:18:44.564 --> 00:18:47.934\nTalent, background, education,\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:52.117\nfreedom, networks, opportunities,\n\n00:18:52.141 --> 00:18:55.684\nwealth, ideas, creativity.\n\n00:18:55.708 --> 00:18:59.757\nWhat are you doing\nwith what you've been given?\n\n00:18:59.781 --> 00:19:03.671\nThat, to me, is the primary\nquestion about life.\n\n00:19:03.695 --> 00:19:06.777\nThat, to me, is what being\npurpose-driven is all about.\n\n00:19:07.957 --> 00:19:11.161\nIn the book, I talk about\nhow you're wired to do certain things,\n\n00:19:11.185 --> 00:19:14.854\nyou're \"SHAPED\" with -- a little acrostic:\nSpiritual gifts, Heart,\n\n00:19:14.878 --> 00:19:17.266\nAbility, Personality and Experiences.\n\n00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.934\nThese things shape you.\n\n00:19:19.378 --> 00:19:22.502\nAnd if you want to know what you ought\nto be doing with your life,\n\n00:19:22.526 --> 00:19:25.263\nyou need to look at your shape --\n\"What am I wired to do?\"\n\n00:19:25.287 --> 00:19:28.605\nWhy would God wire you to do something\nand then not have you do it?\n\n00:19:28.629 --> 00:19:31.877\nIf you're wired to be an anthropologist,\nyou'll be an anthropologist.\n\n00:19:31.901 --> 00:19:33.909\nIf you're wired to be\nan undersea explorer,\n\n00:19:33.933 --> 00:19:35.425\nyou'll be an undersea explorer.\n\n00:19:35.449 --> 00:19:37.615\nIf you're wired to make deals,\nyou make deals.\n\n00:19:37.639 --> 00:19:39.598\nIf you're wired to paint, you paint.\n\n00:19:40.313 --> 00:19:42.958\nDid you know that God smiles\nwhen you be you?\n\n00:19:44.532 --> 00:19:46.879\nWhen my little kids --\nwhen my kids were little --\n\n00:19:46.903 --> 00:19:48.910\nthey're all grown now, I have grandkids --\n\n00:19:48.934 --> 00:19:51.246\nI used to go in and sit\non the side of their bed,\n\n00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:53.038\nand I used to watch my kids sleep.\n\n00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:59.556\nAnd I just watched their little bodies\nrise and lower, rise and lower.\n\n00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.435\nAnd I would look at them:\n\"This is not an accident.\"\n\n00:20:02.459 --> 00:20:04.165\nRise and lower.\n\n00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:08.958\nAnd I got joy out of just\nwatching them sleep.\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:14.525\nSome people have the misguided idea\nthat God only gets excited\n\n00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:16.669\nwhen you're doing, quote,\n\"spiritual things,\"\n\n00:20:16.693 --> 00:20:19.406\nlike going to church or helping the poor,\n\n00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.783\nor, you know, confessing\nor doing something like that.\n\n00:20:23.378 --> 00:20:27.736\nThe bottom line is, God gets pleasure\nwatching you be you.\n\n00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.164\nWhy? He made you.\n\n00:20:29.848 --> 00:20:32.245\nAnd when you do what you were made to do,\n\n00:20:32.269 --> 00:20:36.316\nhe goes, \"That's my boy! That's my girl!\n\n00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.725\nYou're using the talent\nand ability that I gave you.\"\n\n00:20:40.471 --> 00:20:42.351\nSo my advice to you is:\n\n00:20:42.375 --> 00:20:44.105\nlook at what's in your hand --\n\n00:20:44.129 --> 00:20:47.668\nyour identity, your influence,\nyour income --\n\n00:20:48.819 --> 00:20:51.322\nand say, \"It's not about me.\n\n00:20:51.346 --> 00:20:54.386\nIt's about making the world\na better place.\"\n\n00:20:55.392 --> 00:20:56.542\nThank you."}, {"title": "My wish: A call for open-source architecture", "duration": "1414", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/cameron_sinclair_on_open_source_architecture", "transcript": "I'm going to take you on a journey very quickly. To explain the wish, I'm going to have to take you somewhere where many people haven't been, and that's around the world. When I was about 24 years old, Kate Stohr and myself started an organization to get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work, not only about responding to natural disasters, but involved in systemic issues. We believe that where the resources and expertise are scarce, innovative, sustainable design can really make a difference in people's lives.So I started my life as an architect, or training as an architect, and I was always interested in socially responsible design, and how you can really make an impact. But when I went to architecture school, it seemed that I was a black sheep in the family. Many architects seemed to think that when you design, you design a jewel, and it's a jewel that you try and crave for; whereas I felt that when you design, you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which you're designing. So you're not just doing a building for the residents or for the people who are going to use it, but for the community as a whole.And in 1999, we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in Kosovo. And I didn't know what I was doing \u2014 like I said, mid-20s \u2014 and I'm the Internet generation, so we started a website. We put a call out there, and to my surprise, in a couple of months, we had hundreds of entries from around the world. That led to a number of prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas. Two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics in sub-Saharan Africa, responding to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. That led to 550 entries from 53 countries. We also have designers from around the world that participate. And we had an exhibit of work that followed that. 2004 was the tipping point for us. We started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in Iran, in Bam, also following up on our work in Africa.Working within the United States \u2014 most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner. But I live in Bozeman, Montana \u2014 go up to the north plains on the reservations, or go down to Alabama or Mississippi, pre-Katrina, and I could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries that I've been to. So we got involved in and worked in inner cities and elsewhere;and also, I will go into some more projects. 2005: Mother Nature kicked our ass. I think we can pretty much assume that 2005 was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters. And because of the Internet, and because of connections to blogs and so forth, within literally hours of the tsunami, we were already raising funds, getting involved, working with people on the ground. We run from a couple of laptops, and in the first couple of days, I had 4,000 emails from people needing help. So we began to get involved in projects there, and I'll talk about some others. And then of course, this year we've been responding to Katrina, as well as following up on our reconstruction work.So this is a brief overview. In 2004, I really couldn't manage the number of people who wanted to help, or the number of requests that I was getting. It was all coming into my laptop and cell phone. So we decided to embrace an open-source model of business \u2014 so that anyone, anywhere in the world, could start a local chapter, and they can get involved in local problems. Because I believe there is no such thing as Utopia. All problems are local. All solutions are local. So that means, you know, somebody who's based in Mississippi knows more about Mississippi than I do. So what happened is, we used Meetup and all these other Internet tools, and we ended up having 40 chapters starting up, thousands of architects in 104 countries. So the bullet point \u2014 sorry, I never do a suit, so I knew that I was going to take this off. OK, because I'm going to do it very quick.This isn't just about nonprofit. What it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on, of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller, and that we have the opportunity \u2014 not the responsibility, but the opportunity \u2014 to really get involved in making change.(Laughter)(Laughter)I'm adding that to my time.(Laughter)So what you don't know is, we've got these thousands of designers working around the world, connected basically by a website, and we have a staff of three. The fact that nobody told us we couldn't do it, we did it. And so there's something to be said about na\u00efvet\u00e9. So seven years later, we've developed so that we've got advocacy, instigation and implementation. We advocate for good design, not only through student workshops and lectures and public forums, op-eds; we have a book on humanitarian work; but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy. We can talk about FEMA, but that's another talk. Instigation, developing ideas with communities and NGOs, doing open-source design competitions. Referring, matchmaking with communities. And then implementing \u2014 actually going out there and doing the work, because when you invent, it's never a reality until it's built. So it's really important that if we're designing and trying to create change, we build that change.So here's a select number of projects. Kosovo. This is Kosovo in '99. We did an open design competition, like I said. It led to a whole variety of ideas. And this wasn't about emergency shelter, but transitional shelter that would last five to 10 years, that would be placed next to the land the resident lived in, and that they would rebuild their own home. This wasn't imposing an architecture on a community; this was giving them the tools and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow the way they want to. We had from the sublime to the ridiculous, but they worked. This is an inflatable hemp house. It was built; it works.This is a shipping container. Built and works. And a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt with architectural building, but also the issues of governance, and the idea of creating communities through complex networks.So we've engaged not just designers, but also a whole variety of technology-based professionals. Using rubble from destroyed homes to create new homes. Using straw bale construction, creating heat walls. And then something remarkable happened in '99.We went to Africa originally to look at the housing issue. Within three days, we realized the problem was not housing; it was the growing pandemic of HIV/AIDS. And it wasn't doctors telling us this; it was actual villagers that we were staying with. And so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk 10, 15 kilometers to see doctors, you get the doctors to the people. And we started engaging the medical community, and you know, we thought we were real bright sparks \u2014 \"We've come up with this great idea: mobile health clinics, widely distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa.\" And the medical community there said, \"We've said this for the last decade. We know this. We just don't know how to show this.\" So in a way, we had taken pre-existing needs and shown solutions. And so again, we had a whole variety of ideas that came in.This one I personally love, because the idea is that architecture is not just about solutions, but about raising awareness. This is a kenaf clinic. You get seed and you grow it in a plot of land, and it grows 14 feet in a month. And on the fourth week, the doctors come and they mow out an area, put a tensile structure on the top, and when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers, you cut down the clinic and you eat it. It's an eat-your-own-clinic.So it's dealing with the fact that if you have AIDS, you also need to have nutrition rates, and the idea of nutrition is as important as getting antiretrovirals out there. So you know, this is a serious solution. This one I love. The idea is it's not just a clinic, it's a community center. This looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community, so it can be a self-sustaining project.Every one of these projects is sustainable. That's not because I'm a tree-hugging green person. It's because when you live on four dollars a day, you're living on survival and you have to be sustainable. You have to know where your energy is coming from, you have to know where your resource is coming from, and you have to keep the maintenance down. So this is about getting an economic engine, and then at night, it turns into a movie theater. So it's not an AIDS clinic. It's a community center. So you can see ideas. And these ideas developed into prototypes, and they were eventually built. And currently, as of this year, there are clinics rolling out in Nigeria and Kenya.From that, we also developed Siyathemba. The community came to us and said, \"The problem is that the girls don't have education.\" And we're working in an area where young women between the ages of 16 and 24 have a 50 percent HIV/AIDS rate. And that's not because they're promiscuous, it's because there's no knowledge.And so we decided to look at the idea of sports, and create a youth sports center that doubled as an HIV/AIDS outreach center, and the coaches of the girls' team were also trained doctors. So that there would be a very slow way of developing confidence in health care. And we picked nine finalists, and then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region, and then the community picked their design. They said, this is our design, because it's not only about engaging a community; it's about empowering a community, and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process.So, the winning design is here. And then, of course, we actually go and work with the community and the clients.So this is the designer. He's out there working with the first ever women's soccer team in KwaZulu-Natal, Siyathemba. And they can tell it better.(A cappella singing in a South African language)Video: Well, my name is Cee Cee Mkhonza. I work at the Africa Centre, I'm an IT user consultant. I'm also the national football player for South Africa, Banyana Banyana. And I also play in the Vodacom League, for the team called Tembisa, which has now changed to Siyathemba. This is our home ground.Cameron Sinclair: I'm going to show that later because I'm running out of time. I can see Chris looking at me slyly.This was a connection, just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop Africa's first telemedicine center, in Tanzania. And we met, literally, a couple of months ago. We've already developed a design. The team is over there, working in partnership. This was a matchmaking, thanks to a couple of TEDsters \u2014 Sun [Microsystems], Cheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli, who connected me with this amazing African woman. And we start construction in June, and it will be opened by TEDGlobal. So when you come to TEDGlobal, you can check it out.But what we're known probably most for is dealing with disasters and development, and we've been involved in a lot of issues, such as the tsunami and also things like Hurricane Katrina. This is a 370-dollar shelter that can be easily assembled. This is a community-designed community center. And what that means is we actually live and work with the community, and they're part of the design process. The kids actually get involved in mapping out where the community center should be. And then eventually, the community, through skills training, end up building the building with us.Here is another school. This is what the UN gave these guys for six months \u2014 12 plastic tarps. This was in August. This was the replacement; that's supposed to last for two years. When the rain comes down, you can't hear a thing, and in the summer, it's about 140 degrees inside. So we said, if the rain's coming down, let's get fresh water. So every one of our schools has a rainwater collection system. Very low cost: three classrooms and rainwater collection is 5,000 dollars. This was raised by hot chocolate sales in Atlanta. It's built by the parents of the kids. The kids are out there on-site, building the buildings. And it opened a couple of weeks ago, and there's 600 kids that are now using the schools.(Applause)So, disaster hits home. We see the bad stories on CNN and Fox and all that, but we don't see the good stories. Here is a community that got together, and they said \"no\" to waiting. They formed a partnership, a diverse partnership of players, to actually map out East Biloxi, to figure out who's getting involved. We've had over 1,500 volunteers rebuilding, rehabbing homes. Figuring out what FEMA regulations are, not waiting for them to dictate to us how you should rebuild. Working with residents, getting them out of their homes, so they don't get ill. This is what they're cleaning up on their own. Designing housing. This house is going in in a couple of weeks. This is a rehabbed home, done in four days. This is a utility room for a woman who is on a walker. She's 70 years old. This is what FEMA gave her. 600 bucks, happened two days ago. We put together, very quickly, a washroom. It's built, it's running and she just started a business today, where she's washing other people's clothes.These are the Calhouns. They're photographers who had documented the Lower Ninth for the last 40 years. That was their home, and these are the photographs they took. And we're helping, working with them to create a new building. Projects we've done. Projects we've been a part of, support. Why don't aid agencies do this? This is the UN tent. This is the new UN tent, just introduced this year. Quick to assemble. It's got a flap \u2014 that's the invention. It took 20 years to design this and get it implemented in the field. I was 12 years old. There's a problem here.Luckily, we're not alone. There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of architects and designers and inventors around the world that are getting involved in humanitarian work. More hemp houses \u2014 it's a theme in Japan, apparently. I'm not sure what they're smoking.(Laughter)This is a Grip Clip, designed by somebody who said, \"All you need is some way to attach membrane structures to physical support beams.\" This guy designed for NASA, is now doing housing. I'm going to whip through this quickly, because I know I've got only a couple of minutes.So this is all done in the last two years. I showed you something that took 20 years to do. And this is just a selection of things that were built in the last couple of years. From Brazil to India, Mexico, Alabama, China, Israel, Palestine, Vietnam.The average age of a designer who gets involved in this project is 32 \u2014 that's how old I am. So it's a young \u2014 I just have to stop here, because Arup is in the room, and this is the best-designed toilet in the world. If you're ever, ever in India, go use this toilet.(Laughter)Chris Luebkeman will tell you why. I'm sure that's how he wanted to spend the party. But the future is not going to be the sky-scraping cities of New York, but this. And when you look at this, you see crisis. What I see is many, many inventors. One billion people live in abject poverty. We hear about them all the time. Four billion live in growing but fragile economies. One in seven live in unplanned settlements. If we do nothing about the housing crisis that's about to happen, in 20 years, one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp. Look left, look right: one of you will be there. How do we improve the living standards of five billion people? With 10 million solutions.So I wish to develop a community that actively embraces innovative and sustainable design to improve the living conditions for everyone.Chris Anderson: Wait a sec \u2014 that's your wish?CS: That's my wish.CA: That's his wish!(Applause)CS: We started Architecture for Humanity with 700 dollars and a website. So Chris somehow decided to give me 100,000. So why not this many people? Open-source architecture is the way to go. You have a diverse community of participants \u2014 and we're not just talking about inventors and designers, but we're talking about the funding model. My role is not as a designer; it's as a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world. And what we need is something that replicates me globally, because I haven't slept in seven years.(Laughter)Secondly, what will this thing be? Designers want to respond to issues of humanitarian crisis, but they don't want some company in the West taking their idea and basically profiting from it. So Creative Commons has developed the Developing Nations license. And what that means is that a designer can \u2014 The Siyathemba project I showed was the first ever building to have a Creative Commons license on it. As soon as that is built, anyone in Africa or any developing nation can take the construction documents and replicate it for free.(Applause)So why not allow designers the opportunity to do this, but still protect their rights here? We want to have a community where you can upload ideas, and those ideas can be tested in an earthquake, in flood, in all sorts of austere environments. The reason that's important is I don't want to wait for the next Katrina to find out if my house works. That's too late, we need to do it now. So doing that globally \u2014 and I want this whole thing to work multi-lingually. When you look at the face of an architect, most people think a gray-haired white guy. I don't see that; I see the face of the world. So I want everyone from all over the planet to be able to be a part of this design and development. The idea of needs-based competitions \u2014 XPRIZE for the other 98 percent, if you want to call it that.We also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together, and the idea of integrating manufacturers \u2014 fab labs in every country. When I hear about the $100 laptop and it's going to educate every child \u2014 educate every designer in the world. Put one in every favela, every slum settlement. Because you know what? Innovation will happen. And I need to know that. It's called the leap-back. We talk about leapfrog technologies.I write with Worldchanging, and the one thing we've been talking about is, I learn more on the ground than I've ever learned here. So let's take those ideas, adapt them, and we can use them. These ideas are supposed to be adaptable; they should have the potential for evolution; they should be developed by every nation in the world and useful for every nation in the world. What will it take?There should be a sheet. I don't have time to read this, because I'm going to be yanked off.CA: Let's just leave it up for a sec.CS: Well, what will it take? You guys are smart. So it's going to take a lot of computing power, because I want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate in developing these designs, but utilize the designs. Also, a process of reviewing the designs. I want every Arup engineer in the world to check and make sure that we're doing stuff that's standing, because those guys are the best in the world. Plug. And so, you know, I want these \u2014I just should note: I have two laptops and one of them is there, and that has 3000 designs on it. If I drop that laptop ... What happens? So it's important to have these proven ideas put up there, easy to use, easy to get ahold of. My mom once said, \"There's nothing worse than being all mouth and no trousers.\"(Laughter)I'm fed up of talking about making change. You only make it by doing it. We've changed FEMA guidelines; we've changed public policy; we've changed international response \u2014 based on building things. So for me, it's important that we create a real conduit for innovation, and that it's free innovation. Think of free culture \u2014 this is free innovation. Somebody said this a couple of years back. I will give points for those who know it. But I think the man was maybe 25 years too early.So let's do it.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 54, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 -->

clinics\nin sub-Saharan Africa,\n\n00:01:53.043 --> 00:01:55.594\nresponding to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n\n00:01:57.376 --> 00:02:03.760\nThat led to 550 entries from 53 countries.\n\n00:02:03.784 --> 00:02:08.534\nWe also have designers\nfrom around the world that participate.\n\n00:02:08.558 --> 00:02:12.204\nAnd we had an exhibit\nof work that followed that.\n\n00:02:12.228 --> 00:02:14.642\n2004 was the tipping point for us.\n\n00:02:14.666 --> 00:02:16.687\nWe started responding to natural disasters\n\n00:02:16.711 --> 00:02:19.332\nand getting involved in Iran, in Bam,\n\n00:02:19.356 --> 00:02:22.056\nalso following up on our work in Africa.\n\n00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.928\nWorking within the United States --\n\n00:02:23.952 --> 00:02:27.023\nmost people look at poverty\nand they see the face of a foreigner.\n\n00:02:27.047 --> 00:02:29.121\nBut I live in Bozeman, Montana --\n\n00:02:29.145 --> 00:02:31.363\ngo up to the north plains\non the reservations,\n\n00:02:31.387 --> 00:02:34.812\nor go down to Alabama\nor Mississippi, pre-Katrina,\n\n00:02:34.836 --> 00:02:37.868\nand I could have shown you\nplaces that have far worse conditions\n\n00:02:37.892 --> 00:02:40.198\nthan many developing countries\nthat I've been to.\n\n00:02:40.222 --> 00:02:43.710\nSo we got involved in and worked\nin inner cities and elsewhere;\n\n00:02:43.734 --> 00:02:47.151\nand also, I will go into\nsome more projects.\n\n00:02:47.175 --> 00:02:50.069\n2005: Mother Nature kicked our ass.\n\n00:02:50.093 --> 00:02:54.846\nI think we can pretty much assume\nthat 2005 was a horrific year\n\n00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.537\nwhen it comes to natural disasters.\n\n00:02:56.561 --> 00:02:58.051\nAnd because of the Internet,\n\n00:02:58.075 --> 00:03:01.464\nand because of connections\nto blogs and so forth,\n\n00:03:01.488 --> 00:03:05.940\nwithin literally hours of the tsunami,\nwe were already raising funds,\n\n00:03:05.964 --> 00:03:09.023\ngetting involved, working\nwith people on the ground.\n\n00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:12.746\nWe run from a couple of laptops,\nand in the first couple of days,\n\n00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.533\nI had 4,000 emails\nfrom people needing help.\n\n00:03:15.873 --> 00:03:18.746\nSo we began to get involved\nin projects there,\n\n00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.384\nand I'll talk about some others.\n\n00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:23.379\nAnd then of course, this year\nwe've been responding to Katrina,\n\n00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:25.847\nas well as following up\non our reconstruction work.\n\n00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:27.582\nSo this is a brief overview.\n\n00:03:28.558 --> 00:03:32.975\nIn 2004, I really couldn't manage\nthe number of people who wanted to help,\n\n00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:35.104\nor the number of requests\nthat I was getting.\n\n00:03:35.128 --> 00:03:37.659\nIt was all coming\ninto my laptop and cell phone.\n\n00:03:37.683 --> 00:03:43.056\nSo we decided to embrace\nan open-source model of business --\n\n00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.247\nso that anyone, anywhere in the world,\ncould start a local chapter,\n\n00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:48.337\nand they can get involved\nin local problems.\n\n00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:50.772\nBecause I believe there\nis no such thing as Utopia.\n\n00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:53.368\nAll problems are local.\nAll solutions are local.\n\n00:03:53.392 --> 00:03:58.026\nSo that means, you know,\nsomebody who's based in Mississippi\n\n00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.403\nknows more about Mississippi than I do.\n\n00:04:00.427 --> 00:04:06.534\nSo what happened is, we used Meetup\nand all these other Internet tools,\n\n00:04:06.558 --> 00:04:10.849\nand we ended up having\n40 chapters starting up,\n\n00:04:10.873 --> 00:04:13.664\nthousands of architects in 104 countries.\n\n00:04:14.966 --> 00:04:18.407\nSo the bullet point --\nsorry, I never do a suit,\n\n00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:20.826\nso I knew that I was going\nto take this off.\n\n00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.153\nOK, because I'm going to do it very quick.\n\n00:04:25.161 --> 00:04:27.184\nThis isn't just about nonprofit.\n\n00:04:27.208 --> 00:04:30.382\nWhat it showed me is that\nthere's a grassroots movement going on,\n\n00:04:30.406 --> 00:04:32.980\nof socially responsible designers\nwho really believe\n\n00:04:33.004 --> 00:04:36.916\nthat this world has got a lot smaller,\nand that we have the opportunity --\n\n00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.096\nnot the responsibility,\nbut the opportunity --\n\n00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.433\nto really get involved in making change.\n\n00:04:43.623 --> 00:04:46.705\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:52.923\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:52.947 --> 00:04:54.746\nI'm adding that to my time.\n\n00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.571\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:57.595 --> 00:04:59.534\nSo what you don't know is,\n\n00:04:59.558 --> 00:05:02.582\nwe've got these thousands of designers\nworking around the world,\n\n00:05:02.606 --> 00:05:05.637\nconnected basically by a website,\nand we have a staff of three.\n\n00:05:06.462 --> 00:05:10.876\nThe fact that nobody told us\nwe couldn't do it, we did it.\n\n00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.248\nAnd so there's something\nto be said about na\u00efvet\u00e9.\n\n00:05:13.272 --> 00:05:15.169\nSo seven years later, we've developed\n\n00:05:15.193 --> 00:05:18.607\nso that we've got advocacy,\ninstigation and implementation.\n\n00:05:18.631 --> 00:05:22.276\nWe advocate for good design,\nnot only through student workshops\n\n00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.622\nand lectures and public forums, op-eds;\n\n00:05:24.646 --> 00:05:26.867\nwe have a book on humanitarian work;\n\n00:05:26.891 --> 00:05:30.074\nbut also disaster mitigation\nand dealing with public policy.\n\n00:05:30.098 --> 00:05:33.312\nWe can talk about FEMA,\nbut that's another talk.\n\n00:05:33.994 --> 00:05:37.354\nInstigation, developing ideas\nwith communities and NGOs,\n\n00:05:37.378 --> 00:05:40.206\ndoing open-source design competitions.\n\n00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.738\nReferring, matchmaking with communities.\n\n00:05:42.762 --> 00:05:46.069\nAnd then implementing -- actually\ngoing out there and doing the work,\n\n00:05:46.093 --> 00:05:51.827\nbecause when you invent,\nit's never a reality until it's built.\n\n00:05:52.296 --> 00:05:55.037\nSo it's really important\nthat if we're designing\n\n00:05:55.061 --> 00:05:57.735\nand trying to create change,\nwe build that change.\n\n00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:59.819\nSo here's a select number of projects.\n\n00:06:01.422 --> 00:06:02.644\nKosovo.\n\n00:06:03.628 --> 00:06:05.300\nThis is Kosovo in '99.\n\n00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:08.515\nWe did an open design\ncompetition, like I said.\n\n00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:10.933\nIt led to a whole variety of ideas.\n\n00:06:10.957 --> 00:06:12.875\nAnd this wasn't about emergency shelter,\n\n00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:16.421\nbut transitional shelter\nthat would last five to 10 years,\n\n00:06:16.445 --> 00:06:20.454\nthat would be placed next to the land\nthe resident lived in,\n\n00:06:20.478 --> 00:06:22.605\nand that they would rebuild\ntheir own home.\n\n00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:25.307\nThis wasn't imposing\nan architecture on a community;\n\n00:06:25.331 --> 00:06:28.453\nthis was giving them\nthe tools and the space\n\n00:06:28.477 --> 00:06:32.166\nto allow them to rebuild and regrow\nthe way they want to.\n\n00:06:33.245 --> 00:06:36.165\nWe had from the sublime\nto the ridiculous, but they worked.\n\n00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:40.789\nThis is an inflatable hemp house.\nIt was built; it works.\n\n00:06:41.558 --> 00:06:43.473\nThis is a shipping container.\n\n00:06:44.638 --> 00:06:46.298\nBuilt and works.\n\n00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:47.672\nAnd a whole variety of ideas\n\n00:06:47.696 --> 00:06:51.203\nthat not only dealt with\narchitectural building,\n\n00:06:51.227 --> 00:06:52.901\nbut also the issues of governance,\n\n00:06:52.925 --> 00:06:56.336\nand the idea of creating communities\nthrough complex networks.\n\n00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.182\nSo we've engaged not just designers,\n\n00:06:58.206 --> 00:07:03.731\nbut also a whole variety\nof technology-based professionals.\n\n00:07:03.755 --> 00:07:07.362\nUsing rubble from destroyed homes\nto create new homes.\n\n00:07:07.386 --> 00:07:13.240\nUsing straw bale construction,\ncreating heat walls.\n\n00:07:13.692 --> 00:07:15.860\nAnd then something remarkable\nhappened in '99.\n\n00:07:15.884 --> 00:07:19.657\nWe went to Africa originally\nto look at the housing issue.\n\n00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:22.793\nWithin three days, we realized\nthe problem was not housing;\n\n00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:25.523\nit was the growing pandemic of HIV/AIDS.\n\n00:07:25.928 --> 00:07:27.781\nAnd it wasn't doctors telling us this;\n\n00:07:27.805 --> 00:07:30.472\nit was actual villagers\nthat we were staying with.\n\n00:07:30.829 --> 00:07:33.441\nAnd so we came up with the bright idea\n\n00:07:33.465 --> 00:07:37.660\nthat instead of getting people to walk\n10, 15 kilometers to see doctors,\n\n00:07:37.684 --> 00:07:39.523\nyou get the doctors to the people.\n\n00:07:39.547 --> 00:07:42.415\nAnd we started engaging\nthe medical community,\n\n00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:45.542\nand you know, we thought\nwe were real bright sparks --\n\n00:07:45.566 --> 00:07:47.312\n\"We've come up with this great idea:\n\n00:07:47.336 --> 00:07:51.918\nmobile health clinics, widely distributed\nthroughout sub-Saharan Africa.\"\n\n00:07:52.307 --> 00:07:54.751\nAnd the medical community there said,\n\n00:07:54.775 --> 00:07:57.241\n\"We've said this for the last decade.\n\n00:07:57.265 --> 00:08:00.343\nWe know this. We just don't know\nhow to show this.\"\n\n00:08:00.367 --> 00:08:05.611\nSo in a way, we had taken pre-existing\nneeds and shown solutions.\n\n00:08:06.135 --> 00:08:10.092\nAnd so again, we had a whole variety\nof ideas that came in.\n\n00:08:11.131 --> 00:08:12.974\nThis one I personally love,\n\n00:08:12.998 --> 00:08:16.299\nbecause the idea is that architecture\nis not just about solutions,\n\n00:08:16.323 --> 00:08:18.002\nbut about raising awareness.\n\n00:08:18.026 --> 00:08:20.440\nThis is a kenaf clinic.\n\n00:08:20.464 --> 00:08:23.534\nYou get seed and you grow it\nin a plot of land,\n\n00:08:23.558 --> 00:08:27.227\nand it grows 14 feet in a month.\n\n00:08:27.251 --> 00:08:30.403\nAnd on the fourth week, the doctors\ncome and they mow out an area,\n\n00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:32.506\nput a tensile structure on the top,\n\n00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.202\nand when the doctors\nhave finished treating\n\n00:08:35.226 --> 00:08:38.947\nand seeing patients and villagers,\n\n00:08:38.971 --> 00:08:40.843\nyou cut down the clinic and you eat it.\n\n00:08:40.867 --> 00:08:42.534\nIt's an eat-your-own-clinic.\n\n00:08:42.558 --> 00:08:45.912\nSo it's dealing with the fact\nthat if you have AIDS,\n\n00:08:45.936 --> 00:08:47.880\nyou also need to have nutrition rates,\n\n00:08:47.904 --> 00:08:50.760\nand the idea of nutrition is as important\n\n00:08:50.784 --> 00:08:52.618\nas getting antiretrovirals out there.\n\n00:08:52.642 --> 00:08:55.130\nSo you know, this is a serious solution.\n\n00:08:56.001 --> 00:08:57.157\nThis one I love.\n\n00:08:57.181 --> 00:09:00.006\nThe idea is it's not just a clinic,\nit's a community center.\n\n00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.053\nThis looked at setting up trade routes\n\n00:09:02.077 --> 00:09:04.142\nand economic engines within the community,\n\n00:09:04.166 --> 00:09:06.380\nso it can be a self-sustaining project.\n\n00:09:06.404 --> 00:09:08.721\nEvery one of these projects\nis sustainable.\n\n00:09:09.134 --> 00:09:12.438\nThat's not because\nI'm a tree-hugging green person.\n\n00:09:12.462 --> 00:09:14.786\nIt's because when you live\non four dollars a day,\n\n00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.833\nyou're living on survival\nand you have to be sustainable.\n\n00:09:18.185 --> 00:09:20.535\nYou have to know where\nyour energy is coming from,\n\n00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:23.011\nyou have to know where\nyour resource is coming from,\n\n00:09:23.035 --> 00:09:25.049\nand you have to keep the maintenance down.\n\n00:09:25.073 --> 00:09:27.161\nSo this is about getting\nan economic engine,\n\n00:09:27.185 --> 00:09:29.478\nand then at night,\nit turns into a movie theater.\n\n00:09:29.502 --> 00:09:34.629\nSo it's not an AIDS clinic.\nIt's a community center.\n\n00:09:34.653 --> 00:09:36.153\nSo you can see ideas.\n\n00:09:36.867 --> 00:09:39.534\nAnd these ideas developed into prototypes,\n\n00:09:39.558 --> 00:09:41.349\nand they were eventually built.\n\n00:09:41.373 --> 00:09:42.880\nAnd currently, as of this year,\n\n00:09:42.904 --> 00:09:47.165\nthere are clinics rolling out\nin Nigeria and Kenya.\n\n00:09:48.934 --> 00:09:52.497\nFrom that, we also developed Siyathemba.\n\n00:09:52.521 --> 00:09:54.182\nThe community came to us and said,\n\n00:09:54.206 --> 00:09:57.229\n\"The problem is that the girls\ndon't have education.\"\n\n00:09:57.253 --> 00:09:58.603\nAnd we're working in an area\n\n00:09:58.627 --> 00:10:00.856\nwhere young women\nbetween the ages of 16 and 24\n\n00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.156\nhave a 50 percent HIV/AIDS rate.\n\n00:10:04.275 --> 00:10:07.037\nAnd that's not\nbecause they're promiscuous,\n\n00:10:07.061 --> 00:10:08.711\nit's because there's no knowledge.\n\n00:10:08.735 --> 00:10:11.734\nAnd so we decided to look\nat the idea of sports,\n\n00:10:11.758 --> 00:10:13.600\nand create a youth sports center\n\n00:10:13.624 --> 00:10:16.422\nthat doubled as an HIV/AIDS\noutreach center,\n\n00:10:16.446 --> 00:10:20.279\nand the coaches of the girls' team\nwere also trained doctors.\n\n00:10:20.303 --> 00:10:27.114\nSo that there would be a very slow way\nof developing confidence in health care.\n\n00:10:27.472 --> 00:10:29.917\nAnd we picked nine finalists,\n\n00:10:29.941 --> 00:10:33.750\nand then those nine finalists were\ndistributed throughout the entire region,\n\n00:10:33.774 --> 00:10:35.901\nand then the community\npicked their design.\n\n00:10:35.925 --> 00:10:37.853\nThey said, this is our design,\n\n00:10:37.877 --> 00:10:40.177\nbecause it's not only\nabout engaging a community;\n\n00:10:40.201 --> 00:10:41.895\nit's about empowering a community,\n\n00:10:41.919 --> 00:10:45.141\nand about getting them to be\na part of the rebuilding process.\n\n00:10:46.696 --> 00:10:48.978\nSo, the winning design is here.\n\n00:10:50.558 --> 00:10:52.621\nAnd then, of course,\nwe actually go and work\n\n00:10:52.645 --> 00:10:54.328\nwith the community and the clients.\n\n00:10:54.352 --> 00:10:55.550\nSo this is the designer.\n\n00:10:55.574 --> 00:10:58.527\nHe's out there working\nwith the first ever women's soccer team\n\n00:10:58.551 --> 00:11:01.448\nin KwaZulu-Natal, Siyathemba.\n\n00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:04.203\nAnd they can tell it better.\n\n00:11:04.972 --> 00:11:07.737\n(A cappella singing\nin a South African language)\n\n00:11:26.463 --> 00:11:28.448\nVideo: Well, my name is Cee Cee Mkhonza.\n\n00:11:28.472 --> 00:11:31.418\nI work at the Africa Centre,\nI'm an IT user consultant.\n\n00:11:31.442 --> 00:11:35.926\nI'm also the national football player\nfor South Africa, Banyana Banyana.\n\n00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:42.685\nAnd I also play in the Vodacom League,\nfor the team called Tembisa,\n\n00:11:42.709 --> 00:11:44.856\nwhich has now changed to Siyathemba.\n\n00:11:46.019 --> 00:11:48.316\nThis is our home ground.\n\n00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:52.409\nCameron Sinclair: I'm going to show that\nlater because I'm running out of time.\n\n00:11:52.433 --> 00:11:54.754\nI can see Chris looking at me slyly.\n\n00:11:54.778 --> 00:11:57.715\nThis was a connection,\njust a meeting with somebody\n\n00:11:57.739 --> 00:12:02.487\nwho wanted to develop Africa's first\ntelemedicine center, in Tanzania.\n\n00:12:02.511 --> 00:12:04.749\nAnd we met, literally,\na couple of months ago.\n\n00:12:04.773 --> 00:12:06.360\nWe've already developed a design.\n\n00:12:06.384 --> 00:12:08.591\nThe team is over there,\nworking in partnership.\n\n00:12:08.615 --> 00:12:11.899\nThis was a matchmaking,\nthanks to a couple of TEDsters --\n\n00:12:11.923 --> 00:12:15.473\nSun [Microsystems],\nCheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli,\n\n00:12:15.497 --> 00:12:17.856\nwho connected me\nwith this amazing African woman.\n\n00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.400\nAnd we start construction in June,\nand it will be opened by TEDGlobal.\n\n00:12:21.424 --> 00:12:23.876\nSo when you come to TEDGlobal,\nyou can check it out.\n\n00:12:24.495 --> 00:12:28.521\nBut what we're known probably most for\nis dealing with disasters and development,\n\n00:12:28.545 --> 00:12:30.584\nand we've been involved\nin a lot of issues,\n\n00:12:30.608 --> 00:12:36.795\nsuch as the tsunami\nand also things like Hurricane Katrina.\n\n00:12:36.819 --> 00:12:40.435\nThis is a 370-dollar shelter\nthat can be easily assembled.\n\n00:12:44.862 --> 00:12:49.838\nThis is a community-designed\ncommunity center.\n\n00:12:49.862 --> 00:12:53.758\nAnd what that means is we actually\nlive and work with the community,\n\n00:12:53.782 --> 00:12:55.905\nand they're part of the design process.\n\n00:12:58.254 --> 00:13:00.792\nThe kids actually get\ninvolved in mapping out\n\n00:13:00.816 --> 00:13:03.482\nwhere the community center should be.\n\n00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.357\nAnd then eventually, the community,\nthrough skills training,\n\n00:13:07.381 --> 00:13:09.498\nend up building the building with us.\n\n00:13:09.942 --> 00:13:11.665\nHere is another school.\n\n00:13:12.054 --> 00:13:16.669\nThis is what the UN gave these guys\nfor six months -- 12 plastic tarps.\n\n00:13:17.094 --> 00:13:18.349\nThis was in August.\n\n00:13:18.373 --> 00:13:21.397\nThis was the replacement;\nthat's supposed to last for two years.\n\n00:13:21.421 --> 00:13:23.723\nWhen the rain comes down,\nyou can't hear a thing,\n\n00:13:23.747 --> 00:13:26.061\nand in the summer,\nit's about 140 degrees inside.\n\n00:13:26.085 --> 00:13:29.534\nSo we said, if the rain's coming\ndown, let's get fresh water.\n\n00:13:29.558 --> 00:13:32.588\nSo every one of our schools\nhas a rainwater collection system.\n\n00:13:32.612 --> 00:13:39.114\nVery low cost: three classrooms\nand rainwater collection is 5,000 dollars.\n\n00:13:39.138 --> 00:13:43.380\nThis was raised by hot chocolate\nsales in Atlanta.\n\n00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:46.194\nIt's built by the parents of the kids.\n\n00:13:46.218 --> 00:13:48.845\nThe kids are out there on-site,\nbuilding the buildings.\n\n00:13:48.869 --> 00:13:50.630\nAnd it opened a couple of weeks ago,\n\n00:13:50.654 --> 00:13:53.233\nand there's 600 kids\nthat are now using the schools.\n\n00:13:53.257 --> 00:14:00.061\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:00.085 --> 00:14:02.127\nSo, disaster hits home.\n\n00:14:03.048 --> 00:14:07.777\nWe see the bad stories\non CNN and Fox and all that,\n\n00:14:07.801 --> 00:14:09.585\nbut we don't see the good stories.\n\n00:14:09.609 --> 00:14:13.728\nHere is a community that got together,\nand they said \"no\" to waiting.\n\n00:14:13.752 --> 00:14:16.998\nThey formed a partnership,\na diverse partnership of players,\n\n00:14:17.022 --> 00:14:19.133\nto actually map out East Biloxi,\n\n00:14:19.157 --> 00:14:21.021\nto figure out who's getting involved.\n\n00:14:21.045 --> 00:14:24.966\nWe've had over 1,500 volunteers\nrebuilding, rehabbing homes.\n\n00:14:25.558 --> 00:14:27.743\nFiguring out what FEMA regulations are,\n\n00:14:27.767 --> 00:14:31.592\nnot waiting for them to dictate\nto us how you should rebuild.\n\n00:14:31.616 --> 00:14:32.855\nWorking with residents,\n\n00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:36.294\ngetting them out of their homes,\nso they don't get ill.\n\n00:14:36.318 --> 00:14:38.462\nThis is what they're\ncleaning up on their own.\n\n00:14:39.941 --> 00:14:41.094\nDesigning housing.\n\n00:14:41.118 --> 00:14:43.235\nThis house is going in\nin a couple of weeks.\n\n00:14:43.259 --> 00:14:45.280\nThis is a rehabbed home,\ndone in four days.\n\n00:14:46.391 --> 00:14:50.534\nThis is a utility room\nfor a woman who is on a walker.\n\n00:14:50.558 --> 00:14:52.770\nShe's 70 years old.\nThis is what FEMA gave her.\n\n00:14:53.984 --> 00:14:56.597\n600 bucks, happened two days ago.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.814\nWe put together, very quickly, a washroom.\n\n00:14:59.838 --> 00:15:02.831\nIt's built, it's running and she just\nstarted a business today,\n\n00:15:02.855 --> 00:15:04.878\nwhere she's washing\nother people's clothes.\n\n00:15:04.902 --> 00:15:08.534\nThese are the Calhouns.\n\n00:15:08.558 --> 00:15:12.550\nThey're photographers who had documented\nthe Lower Ninth for the last 40 years.\n\n00:15:12.899 --> 00:15:15.824\nThat was their home,\nand these are the photographs they took.\n\n00:15:15.848 --> 00:15:18.911\nAnd we're helping, working with them\nto create a new building.\n\n00:15:19.491 --> 00:15:20.689\nProjects we've done.\n\n00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:23.391\nProjects we've been a part of, support.\n\n00:15:23.938 --> 00:15:25.941\nWhy don't aid agencies do this?\n\n00:15:27.674 --> 00:15:29.007\nThis is the UN tent.\n\n00:15:30.364 --> 00:15:33.285\nThis is the new UN tent,\njust introduced this year.\n\n00:15:33.309 --> 00:15:34.788\nQuick to assemble.\n\n00:15:34.812 --> 00:15:37.088\nIt's got a flap -- that's the invention.\n\n00:15:38.384 --> 00:15:42.778\nIt took 20 years to design this\nand get it implemented in the field.\n\n00:15:42.802 --> 00:15:44.560\nI was 12 years old.\n\n00:15:45.726 --> 00:15:47.234\nThere's a problem here.\n\n00:15:48.686 --> 00:15:50.043\nLuckily, we're not alone.\n\n00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:53.534\nThere are hundreds and hundreds\nand hundreds and hundreds\n\n00:15:53.558 --> 00:15:57.534\nand hundreds of architects\nand designers and inventors\n\n00:15:57.558 --> 00:16:01.018\naround the world that are getting\ninvolved in humanitarian work.\n\n00:16:03.192 --> 00:16:06.232\nMore hemp houses -- it's a theme\nin Japan, apparently.\n\n00:16:06.256 --> 00:16:07.891\nI'm not sure what they're smoking.\n\n00:16:07.915 --> 00:16:09.525\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:14.336\nThis is a Grip Clip,\ndesigned by somebody who said,\n\n00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.367\n\"All you need is some way\nto attach membrane structures\n\n00:16:17.391 --> 00:16:20.687\nto physical support beams.\"\n\n00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:27.676\nThis guy designed for NASA,\nis now doing housing.\n\n00:16:28.272 --> 00:16:30.177\nI'm going to whip through this quickly,\n\n00:16:30.201 --> 00:16:32.628\nbecause I know I've got\nonly a couple of minutes.\n\n00:16:34.123 --> 00:16:36.268\nSo this is all done in the last two years.\n\n00:16:36.292 --> 00:16:38.919\nI showed you something\nthat took 20 years to do.\n\n00:16:38.943 --> 00:16:41.028\nAnd this is just a selection of things\n\n00:16:41.052 --> 00:16:43.707\nthat were built\nin the last couple of years.\n\n00:16:44.175 --> 00:16:45.957\nFrom Brazil to India,\n\n00:16:47.125 --> 00:16:48.276\nMexico,\n\n00:16:49.378 --> 00:16:50.531\nAlabama,\n\n00:16:53.284 --> 00:16:54.443\nChina,\n\n00:16:55.783 --> 00:16:56.937\nIsrael,\n\n00:16:56.961 --> 00:16:58.111\nPalestine,\n\n00:16:58.781 --> 00:16:59.931\nVietnam.\n\n00:17:00.264 --> 00:17:04.415\nThe average age of a designer\nwho gets involved in this project is 32 --\n\n00:17:04.439 --> 00:17:05.710\nthat's how old I am.\n\n00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:06.934\nSo it's a young --\n\n00:17:08.907 --> 00:17:11.555\nI just have to stop here,\nbecause Arup is in the room,\n\n00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:13.936\nand this is the best-designed\ntoilet in the world.\n\n00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.007\nIf you're ever, ever in India,\ngo use this toilet.\n\n00:17:17.031 --> 00:17:18.101\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:18.125 --> 00:17:20.093\nChris Luebkeman will tell you why.\n\n00:17:20.558 --> 00:17:23.110\nI'm sure that's how he wanted\nto spend the party.\n\n00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:31.816\nBut the future is not going to be\nthe sky-scraping cities of New York,\n\n00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.991\nbut this.\n\n00:17:33.015 --> 00:17:35.101\nAnd when you look at this, you see crisis.\n\n00:17:35.125 --> 00:17:37.792\nWhat I see is many, many inventors.\n\n00:17:38.427 --> 00:17:40.562\nOne billion people live in abject poverty.\n\n00:17:40.586 --> 00:17:42.230\nWe hear about them all the time.\n\n00:17:42.254 --> 00:17:45.439\nFour billion live in growing\nbut fragile economies.\n\n00:17:46.638 --> 00:17:49.396\nOne in seven live\nin unplanned settlements.\n\n00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:52.570\nIf we do nothing about the housing crisis\nthat's about to happen,\n\n00:17:52.594 --> 00:17:56.149\nin 20 years, one in three people\nwill live in an unplanned settlement\n\n00:17:56.173 --> 00:17:57.436\nor a refugee camp.\n\n00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.173\nLook left, look right:\none of you will be there.\n\n00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:04.396\nHow do we improve the living standards\nof five billion people?\n\n00:18:04.824 --> 00:18:06.665\nWith 10 million solutions.\n\n00:18:07.134 --> 00:18:08.837\nSo I wish to develop a community\n\n00:18:08.861 --> 00:18:12.434\nthat actively embraces\ninnovative and sustainable design\n\n00:18:12.458 --> 00:18:15.431\nto improve the living\nconditions for everyone.\n\n00:18:15.455 --> 00:18:17.773\nChris Anderson: Wait a sec --\nthat's your wish?\n\n00:18:17.797 --> 00:18:18.948\nCS: That's my wish.\n\n00:18:18.972 --> 00:18:20.123\nCA: That's his wish!\n\n00:18:20.147 --> 00:18:26.670\n(Applause)\n\n00:18:33.261 --> 00:18:37.110\nCS: We started Architecture for Humanity\nwith 700 dollars and a website.\n\n00:18:37.665 --> 00:18:41.384\nSo Chris somehow decided\nto give me 100,000.\n\n00:18:41.741 --> 00:18:43.566\nSo why not this many people?\n\n00:18:44.941 --> 00:18:47.386\nOpen-source architecture is the way to go.\n\n00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.497\nYou have a diverse community\nof participants --\n\n00:18:50.521 --> 00:18:53.394\nand we're not just talking\nabout inventors and designers,\n\n00:18:53.418 --> 00:18:55.537\nbut we're talking about the funding model.\n\n00:18:55.561 --> 00:18:57.339\nMy role is not as a designer;\n\n00:18:57.363 --> 00:19:00.848\nit's as a conduit between the design world\nand the humanitarian world.\n\n00:19:00.872 --> 00:19:05.626\nAnd what we need is something\nthat replicates me globally,\n\n00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.994\nbecause I haven't slept in seven years.\n\n00:19:08.018 --> 00:19:10.534\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:10.558 --> 00:19:13.387\nSecondly, what will this thing be?\n\n00:19:13.411 --> 00:19:17.291\nDesigners want to respond\nto issues of humanitarian crisis,\n\n00:19:17.315 --> 00:19:20.266\nbut they don't want\nsome company in the West\n\n00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:22.941\ntaking their idea\nand basically profiting from it.\n\n00:19:22.965 --> 00:19:27.114\nSo Creative Commons has developed\nthe Developing Nations license.\n\n00:19:27.138 --> 00:19:29.528\nAnd what that means\nis that a designer can --\n\n00:19:29.552 --> 00:19:31.385\nThe Siyathemba project I showed\n\n00:19:31.409 --> 00:19:35.377\nwas the first ever building to have\na Creative Commons license on it.\n\n00:19:35.401 --> 00:19:40.534\nAs soon as that is built, anyone\nin Africa or any developing nation\n\n00:19:40.558 --> 00:19:43.751\ncan take the construction documents\nand replicate it for free.\n\n00:19:45.615 --> 00:19:50.167\n(Applause)\n\n00:19:50.191 --> 00:19:53.110\nSo why not allow designers\nthe opportunity to do this,\n\n00:19:53.134 --> 00:19:55.412\nbut still protect their rights here?\n\n00:19:55.436 --> 00:19:59.441\nWe want to have a community\nwhere you can upload ideas,\n\n00:19:59.465 --> 00:20:03.665\nand those ideas can be tested\nin an earthquake, in flood,\n\n00:20:03.689 --> 00:20:06.009\nin all sorts of austere environments.\n\n00:20:06.033 --> 00:20:07.770\nThe reason that's important\n\n00:20:07.794 --> 00:20:09.851\nis I don't want to wait\nfor the next Katrina\n\n00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:11.484\nto find out if my house works.\n\n00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:15.106\nThat's too late, we need to do it now.\n\n00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.464\nSo doing that globally --\n\n00:20:16.488 --> 00:20:21.978\nand I want this whole thing\nto work multi-lingually.\n\n00:20:22.002 --> 00:20:26.085\nWhen you look at the face of an architect,\nmost people think a gray-haired white guy.\n\n00:20:26.109 --> 00:20:28.476\nI don't see that;\nI see the face of the world.\n\n00:20:28.848 --> 00:20:30.908\nSo I want everyone\nfrom all over the planet\n\n00:20:30.932 --> 00:20:34.534\nto be able to be a part\nof this design and development.\n\n00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.949\nThe idea of needs-based competitions --\n\n00:20:36.973 --> 00:20:40.374\nXPRIZE for the other 98 percent,\nif you want to call it that.\n\n00:20:41.707 --> 00:20:44.001\nWe also want to look\nat ways of matchmaking\n\n00:20:44.025 --> 00:20:46.142\nand putting funding partners together,\n\n00:20:46.166 --> 00:20:48.508\nand the idea of integrating\nmanufacturers --\n\n00:20:48.532 --> 00:20:50.127\nfab labs in every country.\n\n00:20:50.151 --> 00:20:53.966\nWhen I hear about the $100 laptop\nand it's going to educate every child

you know what?\nInnovation will happen.\n\n00:21:02.811 --> 00:21:05.193\nAnd I need to know that.\nIt's called the leap-back.\n\n00:21:05.217 --> 00:21:07.347\nWe talk about leapfrog technologies.\n\n00:21:07.371 --> 00:21:08.752\nI write with Worldchanging,\n\n00:21:08.776 --> 00:21:10.929\nand the one thing\nwe've been talking about is,\n\n00:21:10.953 --> 00:21:13.540\nI learn more on the ground\nthan I've ever learned here.\n\n00:21:13.564 --> 00:21:16.716\nSo let's take those ideas,\nadapt them, and we can use them.\n\n00:21:19.386 --> 00:21:22.807\nThese ideas are supposed to be adaptable;\n\n00:21:22.831 --> 00:21:26.568\nthey should have\nthe potential for evolution;\n\n00:21:26.592 --> 00:21:29.088\nthey should be developed\nby every nation in the world\n\n00:21:29.112 --> 00:21:31.208\nand useful for every nation in the world.\n\n00:21:31.795 --> 00:21:32.952\nWhat will it take?\n\n00:21:33.388 --> 00:21:34.562\nThere should be a sheet.\n\n00:21:34.586 --> 00:21:38.094\nI don't have time to read this,\nbecause I'm going to be yanked off.\n\n00:21:38.118 --> 00:21:40.388\nCA: Let's just leave it up for a sec.\n\n00:21:40.412 --> 00:21:42.838\nCS: Well, what will it take?\nYou guys are smart.\n\n00:21:44.052 --> 00:21:46.916\nSo it's going to take a lot\nof computing power,\n\n00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.039\nbecause I want the idea\nthat any laptop anywhere in the world\n\n00:21:50.063 --> 00:21:51.434\ncan plug into the system\n\n00:21:51.458 --> 00:21:55.020\nand be able to not only participate\nin developing these designs,\n\n00:21:55.044 --> 00:21:56.799\nbut utilize the designs.\n\n00:21:56.823 --> 00:22:00.580\nAlso, a process of reviewing the designs.\n\n00:22:00.604 --> 00:22:04.016\nI want every Arup engineer\nin the world to check and make sure\n\n00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.909\nthat we're doing stuff that's standing,\n\n00:22:05.933 --> 00:22:08.074\nbecause those guys\nare the best in the world.\n\n00:22:08.098 --> 00:22:09.248\nPlug.\n\n00:22:09.867 --> 00:22:13.424\nAnd so, you know, I want these --\n\n00:22:13.448 --> 00:22:17.202\nI just should note: I have two laptops\nand one of them is there,\n\n00:22:17.226 --> 00:22:19.709\nand that has 3000 designs on it.\n\n00:22:19.733 --> 00:22:22.686\nIf I drop that laptop ...\n\n00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:24.160\nWhat happens?\n\n00:22:24.184 --> 00:22:27.152\nSo it's important to have\nthese proven ideas put up there,\n\n00:22:27.176 --> 00:22:29.025\neasy to use, easy to get ahold of.\n\n00:22:33.002 --> 00:22:36.777\nMy mom once said, \"There's nothing worse\nthan being all mouth and no trousers.\"\n\n00:22:36.801 --> 00:22:38.308\n(Laughter)\n\n00:22:38.332 --> 00:22:41.483\nI'm fed up of talking about making change.\n\n00:22:41.507 --> 00:22:43.356\nYou only make it by doing it.\n\n00:22:43.801 --> 00:22:47.381\nWe've changed FEMA guidelines;\nwe've changed public policy;\n\n00:22:47.405 --> 00:22:51.819\nwe've changed international response --\nbased on building things.\n\n00:22:51.843 --> 00:22:56.192\nSo for me, it's important that we create\na real conduit for innovation,\n\n00:22:56.216 --> 00:22:57.860\nand that it's free innovation.\n\n00:22:57.884 --> 00:23:00.507\nThink of free culture --\nthis is free innovation.\n\n00:23:02.816 --> 00:23:05.604\nSomebody said this a couple of years back.\n\n00:23:07.096 --> 00:23:09.233\nI will give points for those who know it.\n\n00:23:09.257 --> 00:23:15.518\nBut I think the man was maybe\n25 years too early.\n\n00:23:15.542 --> 00:23:17.767\nSo let's do it.\n\n00:23:17.791 --> 00:23:18.944\nThank you.\n\n00:23:18.968 --> 00:23:22.950\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "My wish: A global day of film", "duration": "1538", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jehane_noujaim_inspires_a_global_day_of_film", "transcript": "I can't help but this wish: to think about when you're a little kid, and all your friends ask you, \"If a genie could give you one wish in the world, what would it be?\" And I always answered, \"Well, I'd want the wish to have the wisdom to know exactly what to wish for.\" Well, then you'd be screwed, because you'd know what to wish for, and you'd use up your wish, and now, since we only have one wish \u2014 unlike last year they had three wishes \u2014 I'm not going to wish for that.So let's get to what I would like, which is world peace. And I know what you're thinking: You're thinking, \"The poor girl up there, she thinks she's at a beauty pageant. She's not. She's at the TED Prize.\" (Laughter) But I really do think it makes sense. And I think that the first step to world peace is for people to meet each other. I've met a lot of different people over the years, and I've filmed some of them, from a dotcom executive in New York who wanted to take over the world, to a military press officer in Qatar, who would rather not take over the world. If you've seen the film \"Control Room\" that was sent out, you'd understand a little bit why. (Applause) Thank you. Wow! Some of you watched it. That's great. That's great.So basically what I'd like to talk about today is a way for people to travel, to meet people in a different way than \u2014 because you can't travel all over the world at the same time. And a long time ago \u2014 well, about 40 years ago \u2014 my mom had an exchange student. And I'm going to show you slides of the exchange student. This is Donna. This is Donna at the Statue of Liberty. This is my mother and aunt teaching Donna how to ride a bike. This is Donna eating ice cream. And this is Donna teaching my aunt how to do a Filipino dance. I really think as the world is getting smaller, it becomes more and more important that we learn each other's dance moves, that we meet each other, we get to know each other, we are able to figure out a way to cross borders, to understand each other, to understand people's hopes and dreams, what makes them laugh and cry. And I know that we can't all do exchange programs, and I can't force everybody to travel; I've already talked about that to Chris and Amy, and they said that there's a problem with this: You can't force people, free will. And I totally support that, so we're not forcing people to travel. But I'd like to talk about another way to travel that doesn't require a ship or an airplane, and just requires a movie camera, a projector and a screen. And that's what I'm going to talk to you about today.I was asked that I speak a little bit about where I personally come from, and Cameron, I don't know how you managed to get out of that one, but I think that building bridges is important to me because of where I come from. I'm the daughter of an American mother and an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian father. So I'm the living product of two cultures coming together. No pun intended. (Laughter) And I've also been called, as an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian American with a Persian name, the \"Middle East Peace Crisis.\"So maybe me starting to take pictures was some kind of way to bring both sides of my family together \u2014 a way to take the worlds with me, a way to tell stories visually. It all kind of started that way, but I think that I really realized the power of the image when I first went to the garbage-collecting village in Egypt, when I was about 16. My mother took me there. She's somebody who believes strongly in community service, and decided that this was something that I needed to do. And so I went there and I met some amazing women there. There was a center there, where they were teaching people how to read and write, and get vaccinations against the many diseases you can get from sorting through garbage. And I began teaching there. I taught English, and I met some incredible women there. I met people that live seven people to a room, barely can afford their evening meal, yet lived with this strength of spirit and sense of humor and just incredible qualities.I got drawn into this community and I began to take pictures there. I took pictures of weddings and older family members \u2014 things that they wanted memories of. About two years after I started taking these pictures, the UN Conference on Population and Development asked me to show them at the conference. So I was 18; I was very excited. It was my first exhibit of photographs and they were all put up there, and after about two days, they all came down except for three. People were very upset, very angry that I was showing these dirty sides of Cairo, and why didn't I cut the dead donkey out of the frame? And as I sat there, I got very depressed. I looked at this big empty wall with three lonely photographs that were, you know, very pretty photographs and I was like, \"I failed at this.\" But I was looking at this intense emotion and intense feeling that had come out of people just seeing these photographs. Here I was, this 18-year-old pipsqueak that nobody listened to, and all of a sudden, I put these photographs on the wall, and there were arguments, and they had to be taken down. And I saw the power of the image, and it was incredible. And I think the most important reaction that I saw there was actually from people that would never have gone to the garbage village themselves, that would never have seen that the human spirit could thrive in such difficult circumstances. And I think it was at that point that I decided I wanted to use photography and film to somehow bridge gaps, to bridge cultures, bring people together, cross borders. And so that's what really kind of started me off.Did a stint at MTV, made a film called \"Startup.com,\" and I've done a couple of music films. But in 2003, when the war in Iraq was about to start, it was a very surreal feeling for me, because before the war started, there was kind of this media war that was going on. And I was watching television in New York, and there seemed to be just one point of view that was coming across, and the coverage went from the US State Department to embedded troops. And what was coming across on the news was that there was going to be this clean war and precision bombings, and the Iraqis would be greeting the Americans as liberators, and throwing flowers at their feet in the streets of Baghdad. And I knew that there was a completely other story that was taking place in the Middle East, where my parents were. I knew that there was a completely other story being told, and I was thinking, \"How are people supposed to communicate with each other when they're getting completely different messages, and nobody knows what the other's being told? How are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding or know how to move together into the future? So I knew that I had to go there. I just wanted to be in the center. I had no plan. I had no funding. I didn't even have a camera at the time \u2014 I had somebody bring it there, because I wanted to get access to Al Jazeera, George Bush's favorite channel, and a place which I was very curious about because it's disliked by many governments across the Arab world, and also called the mouthpiece of Osama Bin Laden by some people in the US government.So I was thinking, this station that's hated by so many people has to be doing something right. I've got to go see what this is all about. And I also wanted to go see Central Command, which was 10 minutes away. And that way, I could get access to how this news was being created \u2014 on the Arab side, reaching the Arab world, and on the US and Western side, reaching the US.And when I went there and sat there, and met these people that were in the center of it, and sat with these characters, I met some surprising, very complex people. And I'd like to share with you a little bit of that experience of when you sit with somebody and you film them, and you listen to them, and you allow them more than a five-second sound bite. The amazing complexity of people emerges.Samir Khader: Business as usual. Iraq, and then Iraq, and then Iraq. But between us, if I'm offered a job with Fox, I'll take it. To change the Arab nightmare into the American dream. I still have that dream. Maybe I will never be able to do it, but I have plans for my children. When they finish high school, I will send them to America to study there. I will pay for their study. And they will stay there. Josh Rushing: The night they showed the POWs and the dead soldiers \u2014 Al Jazeera showed them \u2014 it was powerful, because America doesn't show those kinds of images. Most of the news in America won't show really gory images and this showed American soldiers in uniform, strewn about a floor, a cold tile floor. And it was revolting. It was absolutely revolting. It made me sick at my stomach. And then what hit me was, the night before, there had been some kind of bombing in Basra, and Al Jazeera had shown images of the people. And they were equally, if not more, horrifying \u2014 the images were. And I remember having seen it in the Al Jazeera office, and thought to myself, \"Wow, that's gross. That's bad.\" And then going away, and probably eating dinner or something. And it didn't affect me as much. So, the impact that had on me \u2014 me realizing that I just saw people on the other side, and those people in the Al Jazeera office must have felt the way I was feeling that night, and it upset me on a profound level that I wasn't as bothered as much the night before. It makes me hate war. But it doesn't make me believe that we're in a world that can live without war yet.Jehane Noujaim: I was overwhelmed by the response of the film. We didn't know whether it would be able to get out there. We had no funding for it. We were incredibly lucky that it got picked up. And when we showed the film in both the United States and the Arab world, we had such incredible reactions. It was amazing to see how people were moved by this film. In the Arab world \u2014 and it's not really by the film, it's by the characters \u2014 I mean, Josh Rushing was this incredibly complex person who was thinking about things. And when I showed the film in the Middle East, people wanted to meet Josh. He kind of redefined us as an American population. People started to ask me, \"Where is this guy now?\" Al Jazeera offered him a job. (Laughter) And Samir, on the other hand, was also quite an interesting character for the Arab world to see, because it brought out the complexities of this love-hate relationship that the Arab world has with the West.In the United States, I was blown away by the motivations, the positive motivations of the American people when they'd see this film. You know, we're criticized abroad for believing we're the saviors of the world in some way, but the flip side of it is that, actually, when people do see what is happening abroad and people's reactions to some of our policy abroad, we feel this power, that we need to \u2014 we feel like we have to get the power to change things. And I saw this with audiences. This woman came up to me after the screening and said, \"You know, I know this is crazy. I saw the bombs being loaded on the planes, I saw the military going out to war, but you don't understand people's anger towards us until you see the people in the hospitals and the victims of the war, and how do we get out of this bubble?How do we understand what the other person is thinking?\" Now, I don't know whether a film can change the world. But I know the power of it, I know that it starts people thinking about how to change the world.Now, I'm not a philosopher, so I feel like I shouldn't go into great depth on this, but let film speak for itself and take you to this other world. Because I believe that film has the ability to take you across borders, I'd like you to just sit back and experience for a couple of minutes being taken into another world. And these couple clips take you inside of two of the most difficult conflicts that we're faced with today. [The last 48 hours of two Palestinian suicide bombers.] [Paradise Now][Man: As long as there is injustice, someone must make a sacrifice!][Woman: That's no sacrifice, that's revenge!] [If you kill, there's no difference between victim and occupier.][Man: If we had airplanes, we wouldn't need martyrs, that's the difference.][Woman: The difference is that the Israeli military is still stronger.][Man: Then let us be equal in death.] [We still have Paradise.][Woman: There is no Paradise! It only exists in your head!][Man: God forbid!] [May God forgive you.] [If you were not Abu Azzam's daughter ...] [Anyway, I'd rather have Paradise in my head than live in this hell!] [In this life, we're dead anyway.][One only chooses bitterness when the alternative is even bitterer.][Woman: And what about us? The ones who remain?] [Will we win that way?] [Don't you see what you're doing is destroying us?] [And that you give Israel an alibi to carry on?][Man: So with no alibi, Israel will stop?][Woman: Perhaps. We have to turn it into a moral war.][Man: How, if Israel has no morals?][Woman: Be careful!] [And the real people building peace through non-violence] [Encounter Point] Video: (Ambulance siren) [Tel Aviv, Israel 1996][Tzvika: My wife Ayelet called me and said, ] [\"There was a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv.\"][Ayelet: What do you know about the casualties?] [Tzvika off-screen: We're looking for three girls.][We have no information.][Ayelet: One is wounded here, but we haven't heard from the other three.][Tzvika: I said, \"OK, that's Bat-Chen, that's my daughter.] [Are you sure she is dead?\"] [They said yes.] Video: (Police siren and shouting over megaphone) [Bethlehem, Occupied Palestinian Territories, 2003][George: On that day, at around 6:30] [I was driving with my wife and daughters to the supermarket.] [When we got to here ...] [we saw three Israeli military jeeps parked on the side of the road.] [When we passed by the first jeep ...] [they opened fire on us.] [And my 12-year-old daughter Christine] [was killed in the shooting.] [Bereaved Families Forum, Jerusalem][Tzvika: I'm the headmaster for all parts.][George: But there is a teacher that is in charge?] [Tzvika: Yes, I have assistants.] [I deal with children all the time.] [One year after their daughters' deaths both Tzvika and George join the forum][George: At first, I thought it was a strange idea.] [But after thinking logically about it, ] [I didn't find any reason why not to meet them] [and let them know of our suffering.][Tzvika: There were many things that touched me.] [We see that there are Palestinians who suffered a lot, who lost children,] [and still believe in the peace process and in reconciliation.] [If we who lost what is most precious can talk to each other,] [and look forward to a better future,] [then everyone else must do so, too.] [From South Africa: A Revolution Through Music] [Amandla] (Music)(Video) Man: Song is something that we communicated with people who otherwise would not have understood where we're coming from. You could give them a long political speech, they would still not understand. But I tell you, when you finish that song, people will be like, \"Damn, I know where you niggas are coming from. I know where you guys are coming from. Death unto apartheid!\"Narrator: It's about the liberation struggle. It's about those children who took to the streets \u2014 fighting, screaming, \"Free Nelson Mandela!\" It's about those unions who put down their tools and demanded freedom. Yes. Yes! (Music and singing) (Singing) Freedom! (Applause)Jehane Noujaim: I think everybody's had that feeling of sitting in a theater, in a dark room, with other strangers, watching a very powerful film, and they felt that feeling of transformation. And what I'd like to talk about is how can we use that feeling to actually create a movement through film? I've been listening to the talks in the conference, and Robert Wright said yesterday that if we have an appreciation for another person's humanity, then they will have an appreciation for ours. And that's what this is about. It's about connecting people through film, getting these independent voices out there. Now, Josh Rushing actually ended up leaving the military and taking a job with Al Jazeera. (Laughter) So his feeling is that he's at Al Jazeera International because he feels like he can actually use media to bridge the gap between East and West. And that's an amazing thing. But I've been trying to think about ways to give power to these independent voices, to give power to the filmmakers, to give power to people who are trying to use film for change. And there are incredible organizations that are out there doing this already. There's Witness, that you heard from earlier. There's Just Vision, that are working with Palestinians and Israelis who are working together for peace, and documenting that process and getting interviews out there and using this film to take to Congress to show that it's a powerful tool, to show that this is a woman who's had her daughter killed in an attack, and she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this. There's Working Films and there's Current TV, which is an incredible platform for people around the world to be able to put their \u2014 (Applause) Yeah, it's amazing. I've watched it and I'm blown away by it and its potential to bring voices from around the world \u2014 independent voices from around the world \u2014 and create a truly democratic, global television.So what can we do to create a platform for these organizations, to create some momentum, to get everybody in the world involved in this movement? I'd like for us to imagine for a second. Imagine a day when you have everyone coming together from around the world. You have towns and villages and theaters \u2014 all from around the world, getting together, and sitting in the dark, and sharing a communal experience of watching a film, or a couple of films, together. Watching a film which maybe highlights a character that is fighting to live, or just a character that defies stereotypes, makes a joke, sings a song. Comedies, documentaries, shorts. This amazing power can be used to change people and to bond people together; to cross borders, and have people feel like they're having a communal experience. So if you imagine this day when all around the world, you have theaters and places where we project films. If you imagine projecting from Times Square to Tahrir Square in Cairo, the same film in Ramallah, the same film in Jerusalem. You know, we've been talking to a friend of mine about using the side of the Great Pyramid and the Great Wall of China. It's endless what you can imagine, in terms of where you can project films and where you can have this communal experience. And I believe that this one day, if we can create it, this one day can create momentum for all of these independent voices. There isn't an organization which is connecting the independent voices of the world to get out there, and yet I'm hearing throughout this conference that the biggest challenge in our future is understanding the other, and having mutual respect for the other and crossing borders. And if film can do that, and if we can get all of these different locations in the world to watch these films together \u2014 this could be an incredible day.So we've already made a partnership, set up through somebody from the TED community, John Camen, who introduced me to Steven Apkon, from the Jacob Burns Film Center. And we started calling up everybody. And in the last week, there have been so many people that have responded to us, from as close as Palo Alto, to Mongolia and to India. There are people that want to be a part of this global day of film; to be able to provide a platform for independent voices and independent films to get out there. Now, we've thought about a name for this day, and I'd like to share this with you. Now, the most amazing part of this whole process has been sharing ideas and wishes, and so I invite you to give brainstorms onto how does this day echo into the future? How do we use technology to make this day echo into the future, so that we can build community and have these communities working together, through the Internet? There was a time, many, many years ago, when all of the continents were stuck together. And we call that landmass Pangea. So what we'd like to call this day of film is Pangea Cinema Day. And if you just imagine that all of these people in these towns would be watching, then I think that we can actually really make a movement towards people understanding each other better.I know that it's very intangible, touching people's hearts and souls, but the only way that I know how to do it, the only way that I know how to reach out to somebody's heart and soul all across the world, is by showing them a film. And I know that there are independent filmmakers and films out there that can really make this happen. And that's my wish. I guess I'm supposed to give you my one-sentence wish, but we're way out of time.Chris Anderson: That is an incredible wish. Pangea Cinema: The day the world comes together.JN: It's more tangible than world peace, and it's certainly more immediate. But it would be the day that the world comes together through film, the power of film.CA: Ladies and gentlemen, Jehane Noujaim.", "id": 55, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.188 --> 00:00:13.517\nI can't help but this wish:\n\n00:00:13.541 --> 00:00:17.974\nto think about when you're a little kid,\nand all your friends ask you,\n\n00:00:17.998 --> 00:00:20.586\n\"If a genie could give you\none wish in the world,\n\n00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.764\nwhat would it be?\"\n\n00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:23.530\nAnd I always answered,\n\n00:00:23.554 --> 00:00:24.864\n\"Well, I'd want the wish\n\n00:00:24.888 --> 00:00:28.376\nto have the wisdom to know\nexactly what to wish for.\"\n\n00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.081\nWell, then you'd be screwed,\n\n00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:33.120\nbecause you'd know what to wish for,\nand you'd use up your wish,\n\n00:00:33.144 --> 00:00:36.967\nand now, since we only have one wish --\nunlike last year they had three wishes --\n\n00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:38.477\nI'm not going to wish for that.\n\n00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:43.504\nSo let's get to what I would like,\nwhich is world peace.\n\n00:00:43.528 --> 00:00:45.560\nAnd I know what you're thinking:\n\n00:00:45.584 --> 00:00:47.548\nYou're thinking, \"The poor girl up there,\n\n00:00:47.572 --> 00:00:49.349\nshe thinks she's at a beauty pageant.\n\n00:00:49.373 --> 00:00:51.624\nShe's not. She's at the TED Prize.\"\n\n00:00:51.648 --> 00:00:54.234\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:54.782 --> 00:00:56.821\nBut I really do think it makes sense.\n\n00:00:57.202 --> 00:00:59.797\nAnd I think that\nthe first step to world peace\n\n00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:01.641\nis for people to meet each other.\n\n00:01:01.665 --> 00:01:04.153\nI've met a lot of different\npeople over the years,\n\n00:01:04.177 --> 00:01:05.579\nand I've filmed some of them,\n\n00:01:05.603 --> 00:01:10.499\nfrom a dotcom executive in New York\nwho wanted to take over the world,\n\n00:01:10.523 --> 00:01:12.934\nto a military press officer in Qatar,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.463\nwho would rather not take over the world.\n\n00:01:15.487 --> 00:01:18.172\nIf you've seen the film\n\"Control Room\" that was sent out,\n\n00:01:18.196 --> 00:01:19.821\nyou'd understand a little bit why.\n\n00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:20.996\n(Applause)\n\n00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.178\nThank you.\n\n00:01:22.202 --> 00:01:25.474\nWow! Some of you watched it.\nThat's great. That's great.\n\n00:01:25.498 --> 00:01:30.068\nSo basically what I'd like\nto talk about today\n\n00:01:30.092 --> 00:01:32.934\nis a way for people to travel,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:36.934\nto meet people in a different way than --\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.934\nbecause you can't travel\nall over the world at the same time.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:45.194\nAnd a long time ago --\nwell, about 40 years ago --\n\n00:01:45.218 --> 00:01:47.744\nmy mom had an exchange student.\n\n00:01:48.855 --> 00:01:51.673\nAnd I'm going to show you\nslides of the exchange student.\n\n00:01:51.697 --> 00:01:52.848\nThis is Donna.\n\n00:01:52.872 --> 00:01:54.903\nThis is Donna at the Statue of Liberty.\n\n00:01:56.404 --> 00:01:59.424\nThis is my mother and aunt\nteaching Donna how to ride a bike.\n\n00:02:00.496 --> 00:02:02.409\nThis is Donna eating ice cream.\n\n00:02:03.242 --> 00:02:07.555\nAnd this is Donna teaching my aunt\nhow to do a Filipino dance.\n\n00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.057\nI really think as the world\nis getting smaller,\n\n00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:13.724\nit becomes more and more important\n\n00:02:13.748 --> 00:02:15.610\nthat we learn each other's dance moves,\n\n00:02:15.634 --> 00:02:18.040\nthat we meet each other,\nwe get to know each other,\n\n00:02:18.064 --> 00:02:21.703\nwe are able to figure out\na way to cross borders,\n\n00:02:21.727 --> 00:02:24.851\nto understand each other, to understand\npeople's hopes and dreams,\n\n00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:26.331\nwhat makes them laugh and cry.\n\n00:02:26.355 --> 00:02:29.376\nAnd I know that we can't\nall do exchange programs,\n\n00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.225\nand I can't force everybody to travel;\n\n00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:33.568\nI've already talked about that\nto Chris and Amy,\n\n00:02:33.592 --> 00:02:35.794\nand they said that\nthere's a problem with this:\n\n00:02:35.818 --> 00:02:37.553\nYou can't force people, free will.\n\n00:02:37.577 --> 00:02:40.684\nAnd I totally support that,\nso we're not forcing people to travel.\n\n00:02:40.708 --> 00:02:42.962\nBut I'd like to talk\nabout another way to travel\n\n00:02:42.986 --> 00:02:45.934\nthat doesn't require\na ship or an airplane,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:50.934\nand just requires a movie camera,\na projector and a screen.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:55.791\nAnd that's what I'm going\nto talk to you about today.\n\n00:02:55.815 --> 00:03:00.546\nI was asked that I speak a little bit\nabout where I personally come from,\n\n00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.673\nand Cameron, I don't know how\nyou managed to get out of that one,\n\n00:03:03.697 --> 00:03:07.934\nbut I think that building bridges\nis important to me\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.105\nbecause of where I come from.\n\n00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.508\nI'm the daughter of an American mother\n\n00:03:13.532 --> 00:03:16.643\nand an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian father.\n\n00:03:16.667 --> 00:03:20.739\nSo I'm the living product\nof two cultures coming together.\n\n00:03:20.763 --> 00:03:21.915\nNo pun intended.\n\n00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:22.946\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.227\nAnd I've also been called,\n\n00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:27.100\nas an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian American\nwith a Persian name,\n\n00:03:27.124 --> 00:03:29.014\nthe \"Middle East Peace Crisis.\"\n\n00:03:29.038 --> 00:03:33.514\nSo maybe me starting to take\npictures was some kind of way\n\n00:03:33.538 --> 00:03:36.990\nto bring both sides\nof my family together --\n\n00:03:37.014 --> 00:03:41.839\na way to take the worlds with me,\na way to tell stories visually.\n\n00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:44.007\nIt all kind of started that way,\n\n00:03:44.031 --> 00:03:47.627\nbut I think that I really realized\nthe power of the image\n\n00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:50.863\nwhen I first went\nto the garbage-collecting village\n\n00:03:50.887 --> 00:03:52.887\nin Egypt, when I was about 16.\n\n00:03:53.284 --> 00:03:55.458\nMy mother took me there.\n\n00:03:55.863 --> 00:03:58.622\nShe's somebody who believes strongly\nin community service,\n\n00:03:58.646 --> 00:04:01.289\nand decided that this was something\nthat I needed to do.\n\n00:04:01.313 --> 00:04:04.934\nAnd so I went there and I met\nsome amazing women there.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.888\nThere was a center there,\n\n00:04:07.912 --> 00:04:10.950\nwhere they were teaching\npeople how to read and write,\n\n00:04:10.974 --> 00:04:13.188\nand get vaccinations\nagainst the many diseases\n\n00:04:13.212 --> 00:04:15.307\nyou can get from sorting through garbage.\n\n00:04:15.331 --> 00:04:16.896\nAnd I began teaching there.\n\n00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.934\nI taught English, and I met\nsome incredible women there.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:24.746\nI met people that live\nseven people to a room,\n\n00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.102\nbarely can afford their evening meal,\n\n00:04:27.126 --> 00:04:30.649\nyet lived with this strength\nof spirit and sense of humor\n\n00:04:30.673 --> 00:04:33.355\nand just incredible qualities.\n\n00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:37.133\nI got drawn into this community\nand I began to take pictures there.\n\n00:04:37.157 --> 00:04:43.934\nI took pictures of weddings\nand older family members --\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.067\nthings that they wanted memories of.\n\n00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:50.504\nAbout two years after I started\ntaking these pictures,\n\n00:04:50.528 --> 00:04:54.934\nthe UN Conference\non Population and Development\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.854\nasked me to show them at the conference.\n\n00:04:57.878 --> 00:05:00.826\nSo I was 18; I was very excited.\n\n00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.207\nIt was my first exhibit of photographs\nand they were all put up there,\n\n00:05:06.231 --> 00:05:12.196\nand after about two days,\nthey all came down except for three.\n\n00:05:12.747 --> 00:05:14.597\nPeople were very upset,\n\n00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:18.231\nvery angry that I was showing\nthese dirty sides of Cairo,\n\n00:05:18.255 --> 00:05:21.712\nand why didn't I cut\nthe dead donkey out of the frame?\n\n00:05:21.736 --> 00:05:23.973\nAnd as I sat there, I got very depressed.\n\n00:05:23.997 --> 00:05:29.595\nI looked at this big empty wall\nwith three lonely photographs\n\n00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:33.873\nthat were, you know,\nvery pretty photographs\n\n00:05:33.897 --> 00:05:36.788\nand I was like, \"I failed at this.\"\n\n00:05:36.812 --> 00:05:41.935\nBut I was looking at this intense\nemotion and intense feeling\n\n00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:45.412\nthat had come out of people\njust seeing these photographs.\n\n00:05:45.436 --> 00:05:48.417\nHere I was, this 18-year-old pipsqueak\nthat nobody listened to,\n\n00:05:48.441 --> 00:05:51.219\nand all of a sudden,\nI put these photographs on the wall,\n\n00:05:51.243 --> 00:05:53.875\nand there were arguments,\nand they had to be taken down.\n\n00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:57.247\nAnd I saw the power of the image,\nand it was incredible.\n\n00:05:57.271 --> 00:06:01.105\nAnd I think the most important reaction\nthat I saw there was actually from people\n\n00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:04.004\nthat would never have gone\nto the garbage village themselves,\n\n00:06:04.028 --> 00:06:06.893\nthat would never have seen\nthat the human spirit could thrive\n\n00:06:06.917 --> 00:06:09.001\nin such difficult circumstances.\n\n00:06:09.025 --> 00:06:10.557\nAnd I think it was at that point\n\n00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:14.843\nthat I decided I wanted to use\nphotography and film\n\n00:06:14.867 --> 00:06:17.309\nto somehow bridge gaps,\nto bridge cultures,\n\n00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:20.272\nbring people together, cross borders.\n\n00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:26.307\nAnd so that's what really\nkind of started me off.\n\n00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:29.636\nDid a stint at MTV, made a film\ncalled \"Startup.com,\"\n\n00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.934\nand I've done a couple of music films.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:37.934\nBut in 2003, when the war\nin Iraq was about to start,\n\n00:06:41.423 --> 00:06:43.635\nit was a very surreal feeling for me,\n\n00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:45.535\nbecause before the war started,\n\n00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:47.971\nthere was kind of this media war\nthat was going on.\n\n00:06:47.995 --> 00:06:50.011\nAnd I was watching television in New York,\n\n00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:53.672\nand there seemed to be just one\npoint of view that was coming across,\n\n00:06:53.696 --> 00:06:58.523\nand the coverage went\nfrom the US State Department\n\n00:06:58.547 --> 00:07:00.584\nto embedded troops.\n\n00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:03.665\nAnd what was coming across on the news\n\n00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:07.934\nwas that there was going to be this\nclean war and precision bombings,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:11.732\nand the Iraqis would be greeting\nthe Americans as liberators,\n\n00:07:11.756 --> 00:07:15.032\nand throwing flowers at their feet\nin the streets of Baghdad.\n\n00:07:15.056 --> 00:07:17.929\nAnd I knew that there\nwas a completely other story\n\n00:07:17.953 --> 00:07:20.971\nthat was taking place in the Middle East,\nwhere my parents were.\n\n00:07:20.995 --> 00:07:24.060\nI knew that there was\na completely other story being told,\n\n00:07:24.084 --> 00:07:27.616\nand I was thinking, \"How are people\nsupposed to communicate with each other\n\n00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.033\nwhen they're getting completely\ndifferent messages,\n\n00:07:30.057 --> 00:07:32.164\nand nobody knows\nwhat the other's being told?\n\n00:07:32.188 --> 00:07:35.205\nHow are people supposed to have\nany kind of common understanding\n\n00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:37.864\nor know how to move together\ninto the future?\n\n00:07:37.888 --> 00:07:40.136\nSo I knew that I had to go there.\n\n00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.200\nI just wanted to be in the center.\n\n00:07:42.224 --> 00:07:44.725\nI had no plan. I had no funding.\n\n00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:48.934\nI didn't even have a camera at the time --\nI had somebody bring it there,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.934\nbecause I wanted\nto get access to Al Jazeera,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.934\nGeorge Bush's favorite channel,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:59.199\nand a place which I was very curious\nabout because it's disliked\n\n00:07:59.223 --> 00:08:01.714\nby many governments across the Arab world,\n\n00:08:01.738 --> 00:08:05.340\nand also called the mouthpiece\nof Osama Bin Laden\n\n00:08:05.364 --> 00:08:07.545\nby some people in the US government.\n\n00:08:07.569 --> 00:08:11.843\nSo I was thinking, this station\nthat's hated by so many people\n\n00:08:11.867 --> 00:08:13.400\nhas to be doing something right.\n\n00:08:13.424 --> 00:08:16.933\nI've got to go see what this is all about.\n\n00:08:16.957 --> 00:08:19.054\nAnd I also wanted to go see\nCentral Command,\n\n00:08:19.078 --> 00:08:20.622\nwhich was 10 minutes away.\n\n00:08:20.646 --> 00:08:25.934\nAnd that way, I could get access\nto how this news was being created --\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.166\non the Arab side, reaching the Arab world,\n\n00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.949\nand on the US and Western side,\nreaching the US.\n\n00:08:30.973 --> 00:08:32.714\nAnd when I went there and sat there,\n\n00:08:32.738 --> 00:08:35.795\nand met these people\nthat were in the center of it,\n\n00:08:35.819 --> 00:08:39.425\nand sat with these characters,\n\n00:08:39.449 --> 00:08:43.726\nI met some surprising,\nvery complex people.\n\n00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:47.934\nAnd I'd like to share with you\na little bit of that experience\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.432\nof when you sit with somebody\n\n00:08:49.456 --> 00:08:51.480\nand you film them, and you listen to them,\n\n00:08:51.504 --> 00:08:54.474\nand you allow them more\nthan a five-second sound bite.\n\n00:08:55.272 --> 00:08:59.958\nThe amazing complexity of people emerges.\n\n00:09:03.659 --> 00:09:05.934\nSamir Khader: Business as usual.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:10.308\nIraq, and then Iraq, and then Iraq.\n\n00:09:12.855 --> 00:09:17.632\nBut between us, if I'm offered\na job with Fox, I'll take it.\n\n00:09:22.935 --> 00:09:27.228\nTo change the Arab nightmare\ninto the American dream.\n\n00:09:32.937 --> 00:09:35.163\nI still have that dream.\n\n00:09:35.187 --> 00:09:37.934\nMaybe I will never be able to do it,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.678\nbut I have plans for my children.\n\n00:09:42.482 --> 00:09:43.872\nWhen they finish high school,\n\n00:09:43.896 --> 00:09:45.912\nI will send them to America\nto study there.\n\n00:09:45.936 --> 00:09:47.681\nI will pay for their study.\n\n00:09:48.599 --> 00:09:50.548\nAnd they will stay there.\n\n00:09:57.133 --> 00:10:00.986\nJosh Rushing: The night they showed\nthe POWs and the dead soldiers --\n\n00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:02.226\nAl Jazeera showed them --\n\n00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.454\nit was powerful, because America\ndoesn't show those kinds of images.\n\n00:10:05.478 --> 00:10:08.163\nMost of the news in America\nwon't show really gory images\n\n00:10:08.187 --> 00:10:11.362\nand this showed American soldiers\nin uniform, strewn about a floor,\n\n00:10:11.386 --> 00:10:12.561\na cold tile floor.\n\n00:10:12.585 --> 00:10:15.321\nAnd it was revolting.\n\n00:10:15.345 --> 00:10:16.831\nIt was absolutely revolting.\n\n00:10:16.855 --> 00:10:18.307\nIt made me sick at my stomach.\n\n00:10:18.331 --> 00:10:21.657\nAnd then what hit me was,\nthe night before,\n\n00:10:21.681 --> 00:10:25.276\nthere had been some kind\nof bombing in Basra,\n\n00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:30.116\nand Al Jazeera had shown\nimages of the people.\n\n00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:34.334\nAnd they were equally, if not more,\nhorrifying -- the images were.\n\n00:10:34.358 --> 00:10:36.973\nAnd I remember having seen it\nin the Al Jazeera office,\n\n00:10:36.997 --> 00:10:40.186\nand thought to myself, \"Wow, that's gross.\n\n00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.001\nThat's bad.\"\n\n00:10:42.025 --> 00:10:44.935\nAnd then going away, and probably\neating dinner or something.\n\n00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:46.562\nAnd it didn't affect me as much.\n\n00:10:46.586 --> 00:10:49.409\nSo, the impact that had on me --\n\n00:10:49.433 --> 00:10:53.091\nme realizing that I just saw\npeople on the other side,\n\n00:10:53.115 --> 00:10:55.927\nand those people in the Al Jazeera office\n\n00:10:55.951 --> 00:10:58.238\nmust have felt the way\nI was feeling that night,\n\n00:10:58.262 --> 00:11:01.381\nand it upset me on a profound level\n\n00:11:01.405 --> 00:11:04.989\nthat I wasn't as bothered\nas much the night before.\n\n00:11:05.608 --> 00:11:07.180\nIt makes me hate war.\n\n00:11:07.608 --> 00:11:10.186\nBut it doesn't make me believe\nthat we're in a world\n\n00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:11.721\nthat can live without war yet.\n\n00:11:11.745 --> 00:11:14.838\nJehane Noujaim: I was overwhelmed\nby the response of the film.\n\n00:11:14.862 --> 00:11:17.545\nWe didn't know whether\nit would be able to get out there.\n\n00:11:17.569 --> 00:11:18.785\nWe had no funding for it.\n\n00:11:18.809 --> 00:11:22.099\nWe were incredibly lucky\nthat it got picked up.\n\n00:11:23.011 --> 00:11:25.492\nAnd when we showed the film\n\n00:11:25.516 --> 00:11:28.192\nin both the United States\nand the Arab world,\n\n00:11:28.216 --> 00:11:30.333\nwe had such incredible reactions.\n\n00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:33.365\nIt was amazing to see how people\nwere moved by this film.\n\n00:11:33.389 --> 00:11:35.552\nIn the Arab world --\n\n00:11:35.576 --> 00:11:38.413\nand it's not really by the film,\nit's by the characters --\n\n00:11:38.437 --> 00:11:42.468\nI mean, Josh Rushing was\nthis incredibly complex person\n\n00:11:42.492 --> 00:11:44.019\nwho was thinking about things.\n\n00:11:44.043 --> 00:11:46.312\nAnd when I showed the film\nin the Middle East,\n\n00:11:46.336 --> 00:11:48.934\npeople wanted to meet Josh.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.934\nHe kind of redefined us\nas an American population.\n\n00:11:52.852 --> 00:11:56.934\nPeople started to ask me,\n\"Where is this guy now?\"\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.957\nAl Jazeera offered him a job.\n\n00:11:58.981 --> 00:12:00.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.208\nAnd Samir, on the other hand,\n\n00:12:03.232 --> 00:12:06.566\nwas also quite an interesting character\nfor the Arab world to see,\n\n00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:10.247\nbecause it brought out the complexities\nof this love-hate relationship\n\n00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:12.389\nthat the Arab world has with the West.\n\n00:12:13.215 --> 00:12:18.406\nIn the United States, I was blown away\nby the motivations,\n\n00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.254\nthe positive motivations\nof the American people\n\n00:12:21.278 --> 00:12:23.348\nwhen they'd see this film.\n\n00:12:23.372 --> 00:12:24.967\nYou know, we're criticized abroad\n\n00:12:24.991 --> 00:12:28.482\nfor believing we're the saviors\nof the world in some way,\n\n00:12:28.506 --> 00:12:31.825\nbut the flip side of it is that, actually,\n\n00:12:31.849 --> 00:12:34.183\nwhen people do see\nwhat is happening abroad\n\n00:12:34.207 --> 00:12:36.934\nand people's reactions\nto some of our policy abroad,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.228\nwe feel this power, that we need to --\n\n00:12:39.252 --> 00:12:41.847\nwe feel like we have to get\nthe power to change things.\n\n00:12:41.871 --> 00:12:43.426\nAnd I saw this with audiences.\n\n00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:47.206\nThis woman came up to me\nafter the screening and said,\n\n00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.823\n\"You know, I know this is crazy.\n\n00:12:48.847 --> 00:12:50.870\nI saw the bombs being loaded\non the planes,\n\n00:12:50.894 --> 00:12:52.633\nI saw the military going out to

war,\n\n00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.175\nand how do we get out of this bubble?\n\n00:13:01.199 --> 00:13:05.130\nHow do we understand what\nthe other person is thinking?\"\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:10.029\nNow, I don't know whether\na film can change the world.\n\n00:13:10.053 --> 00:13:12.530\nBut I know the power of it,\n\n00:13:12.554 --> 00:13:15.934\nI know that it starts people thinking\nabout how to change the world.\n\n00:13:16.571 --> 00:13:18.261\nNow, I'm not a philosopher,\n\n00:13:18.285 --> 00:13:21.143\nso I feel like I shouldn't\ngo into great depth on

--> 00:20:10.934\nthat are out there doing this already.\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:13.934\nThere's Witness,\nthat you heard from earlier.\n\n00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:17.528\nThere's Just Vision, that are working\nwith Palestinians and Israelis\n\n00:20:17.552 --> 00:20:20.884\nwho are working together for peace,\nand documenting that process\n\n00:20:20.908 --> 00:20:23.684\nand getting interviews\nout there and using this film\n\n00:20:23.708 --> 00:20:26.656\nto take to Congress to show\nthat it's a powerful tool,\n\n00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:31.219\nto show that this is a woman who's had\nher daughter killed in an attack,\n\n00:20:31.243 --> 00:20:34.369\nand she believes that there\nare peaceful ways to solve this.\n\n00:20:34.393 --> 00:20:38.203\nThere's Working Films\nand there's Current TV,\n\n00:20:38.227 --> 00:20:41.534\nwhich is an incredible platform\nfor people around the world\n\n00:20:41.558 --> 00:20:42.806\nto be able to put their --\n\n00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:43.834\n(Applause)\n\n00:20:43.858 --> 00:20:45.009\nYeah, it's amazing.\n\n00:20:45.033 --> 00:20:48.460\nI've watched it and I'm blown away by it\n\n00:20:48.484 --> 00:20:51.768\nand its potential to bring voices\nfrom around the world --\n\n00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:53.800\nindependent voices\nfrom around the world --\n\n00:20:53.824 --> 00:20:57.260\nand create a truly democratic,\nglobal television.\n\n00:20:57.284 --> 00:21:01.035\nSo what can we do to create\na platform for these organizations,\n\n00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:02.934\nto create some momentum,\n\n00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:06.349\nto get everybody in the world\ninvolved in this movement?\n\n00:21:08.452 --> 00:21:11.467\nI'd like for us to imagine for a second.\n\n00:21:13.156 --> 00:21:19.987\nImagine a day when you have everyone\ncoming together from around the world.\n\n00:21:20.758 --> 00:21:27.666\nYou have towns and villages\nand theaters --\n\n00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:30.244\nall from around the world,\n\n00:21:30.268 --> 00:21:33.007\ngetting together, and sitting in the dark,\n\n00:21:33.031 --> 00:21:37.531\nand sharing a communal\nexperience of watching a film,\n\n00:21:37.555 --> 00:21:39.678\nor a couple of films, together.\n\n00:21:40.958 --> 00:21:46.440\nWatching a film which maybe highlights\na character that is fighting to live,\n\n00:21:46.464 --> 00:21:49.638\nor just a character\nthat defies stereotypes,\n\n00:21:49.662 --> 00:21:51.731\nmakes a joke, sings a song.\n\n00:21:51.755 --> 00:21:54.034\nComedies, documentaries, shorts.\n\n00:21:54.058 --> 00:21:56.737\nThis amazing power\ncan be used to change people\n\n00:21:56.761 --> 00:21:59.585\nand to bond people together;\nto cross borders,\n\n00:21:59.609 --> 00:22:03.124\nand have people feel like\nthey're having a communal experience.\n\n00:22:03.148 --> 00:22:06.094\nSo if you imagine this day\nwhen all around the world,\n\n00:22:06.118 --> 00:22:11.637\nyou have theaters and places\nwhere we project films.\n\n00:22:11.661 --> 00:22:15.256\nIf you imagine projecting\nfrom Times Square\n\n00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.058\nto Tahrir Square in Cairo,\n\n00:22:18.082 --> 00:22:21.758\nthe same film in Ramallah,\nthe same film in Jerusalem.\n\n00:22:21.782 --> 00:22:25.082\nYou know, we've been talking\nto a friend of mine\n\n00:22:25.106 --> 00:22:27.780\nabout using the side of the Great Pyramid\n\n00:22:27.804 --> 00:22:29.463\nand the Great Wall of China.\n\n00:22:32.133 --> 00:22:34.934\nIt's endless what you can imagine,\n\n00:22:34.958 --> 00:22:37.070\nin terms of where you can project films\n\n00:22:37.094 --> 00:22:39.818\nand where you can have\nthis communal experience.\n\n00:22:39.842 --> 00:22:42.934\nAnd I believe that this one day,\nif we can create it,\n\n00:22:42.958 --> 00:22:47.309\nthis one day can create momentum\nfor all of these independent voices.\n\n00:22:47.333 --> 00:22:52.362\nThere isn't an organization\nwhich is connecting the independent voices\n\n00:22:52.386 --> 00:22:53.934\nof the world to get out there,\n\n00:22:53.958 --> 00:22:56.138\nand yet I'm hearing\nthroughout this conference\n\n00:22:56.162 --> 00:22:58.192\nthat the biggest challenge in our future\n\n00:22:58.216 --> 00:22:59.828\nis understanding the other,\n\n00:22:59.852 --> 00:23:03.785\nand having mutual respect\nfor the other and crossing borders.\n\n00:23:03.809 --> 00:23:05.682\nAnd if film can do that,\n\n00:23:05.706 --> 00:23:08.884\nand if we can get all of these\ndifferent locations in the world\n\n00:23:08.908 --> 00:23:11.512\nto watch these films together --\n\n00:23:11.536 --> 00:23:13.693\nthis could be an incredible day.\n\n00:23:14.184 --> 00:23:17.498\nSo we've already made a partnership,\n\n00:23:17.522 --> 00:23:21.411\nset up through somebody\nfrom the TED community,\n\n00:23:21.435 --> 00:23:24.305\nJohn Camen, who introduced me\nto Steven Apkon,\n\n00:23:24.329 --> 00:23:26.934\nfrom the Jacob Burns Film Center.\n\n00:23:26.958 --> 00:23:28.848\nAnd we started calling up everybody.\n\n00:23:28.872 --> 00:23:30.231\nAnd in the last week,\n\n00:23:30.255 --> 00:23:33.934\nthere have been so many people\nthat have responded to us,\n\n00:23:33.958 --> 00:23:38.934\nfrom as close as Palo Alto,\nto Mongolia and to India.\n\n00:23:38.958 --> 00:23:43.514\nThere are people that want to be\na part of this global day of film;\n\n00:23:43.538 --> 00:23:46.934\nto be able to provide a platform\nfor independent voices\n\n00:23:46.958 --> 00:23:49.522\nand independent films to get out there.\n\n00:23:51.141 --> 00:23:54.804\nNow, we've thought\nabout a name for this day,\n\n00:23:54.828 --> 00:23:57.287\nand I'd like to share this with you.\n\n00:23:57.311 --> 00:23:59.572\nNow, the most amazing part\nof this whole process\n\n00:23:59.596 --> 00:24:02.924\nhas been sharing ideas and wishes,\n\n00:24:02.948 --> 00:24:05.934\nand so I invite you\nto give brainstorms onto\n\n00:24:05.958 --> 00:24:09.479\nhow does this day echo into the future?\n\n00:24:09.503 --> 00:24:14.234\nHow do we use technology to make\nthis day echo into the future,\n\n00:24:14.258 --> 00:24:15.934\nso that we can build community\n\n00:24:15.958 --> 00:24:19.958\nand have these communities working\ntogether, through the Internet?\n\n00:24:21.109 --> 00:24:23.648\nThere was a time, many, many years ago,\n\n00:24:23.672 --> 00:24:25.958\nwhen all of the continents\nwere stuck together.\n\n00:24:26.883 --> 00:24:29.828\nAnd we call that landmass Pangea.\n\n00:24:29.852 --> 00:24:34.445\nSo what we'd like to call this day of film\nis Pangea Cinema Day.\n\n00:24:35.572 --> 00:24:37.071\nAnd if you just imagine\n\n00:24:37.095 --> 00:24:40.578\nthat all of these people\nin these towns would be watching,\n\n00:24:40.602 --> 00:24:44.591\nthen I think that we can\nactually really make a movement\n\n00:24:44.615 --> 00:24:46.934\ntowards people understanding\neach other better.\n\n00:24:46.958 --> 00:24:50.777\nI know that it's very intangible,\ntouching people's hearts and souls,\n\n00:24:50.801 --> 00:24:52.834\nbut the only way that I know how to do it,\n\n00:24:52.858 --> 00:24:57.443\nthe only way that I know how to reach out\nto somebody's heart and soul\n\n00:24:57.467 --> 00:24:59.974\nall across the world,\nis by showing them a film.\n\n00:24:59.998 --> 00:25:03.359\nAnd I know that there are independent\nfilmmakers and films out there\n\n00:25:03.383 --> 00:25:05.447\nthat can really make this happen.\n\n00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:07.573\nAnd that's my wish.\n\n00:25:08.112 --> 00:25:12.559\nI guess I'm supposed to give you\nmy one-sentence wish,\n\n00:25:12.583 --> 00:25:14.361\nbut we're way out of time.\n\n00:25:14.958 --> 00:25:17.278\nChris Anderson:\nThat is an incredible wish.\n\n00:25:17.302 --> 00:25:19.934\nPangea Cinema: The day\nthe world comes together.\n\n00:25:19.958 --> 00:25:23.676\nJN: It's more tangible than world peace,\nand it's certainly more immediate.\n\n00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:29.418\nBut it would be the day that the world\ncomes together through film,\n\n00:25:29.442 --> 00:25:30.593\nthe power of film.\n\n00:25:30.617 --> 00:25:32.958\nCA: Ladies and gentlemen, Jehane Noujaim."}, {"title": "My wish: Help me stop pandemics", "duration": "1550", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/larry_brilliant_wants_to_stop_pandemics", "transcript": "I'm the luckiest guy in the world. I got to see the last case of killer smallpox in the world. I was in India this past year, and I may have seen the last cases of polio in the world. There's nothing that makes you feel more \u2014 the blessing and the honor of working in a program like that \u2014 than to know that something that horrible no longer exists. So I'm going to tell you \u2014 (Applause) so I'm going to show you some dirty pictures. They are difficult to watch, but you should look at them with optimism, because the horror of these pictures will be matched by the uplifting quality of knowing that they no longer exist.But first, I'm going to tell you a little bit about my own journey. My background is not exactly the conventional medical education that you might expect. When I was an intern in San Francisco, I heard about a group of Native Americans who had taken over Alcatraz Island, and a Native American who wanted to give birth on that island, and no other doctor wanted to go and help her give birth. I went out to Alcatraz, and I lived on the island for several weeks. She gave birth; I caught the baby; I got off the island; I landed in San Francisco; and all the press wanted to talk to me, because my three weeks on the island made me an expert in Indian affairs. (Laughter)I wound up on every television show. Someone saw me on television; they called me up; and they asked me if I'd like to be in a movie and to play a young doctor for a bunch of rock and roll stars who were traveling in a bus ride from San Francisco to England. And I said, yes, I would do that, so I became the doctor in an absolutely awful movie called \"Medicine Ball Caravan.\" (Laughter) Now, you know from the '60s, you're either on the bus or you're off the bus; I was on the bus. My wife of 37 years and I joined the bus. Our bus ride took us from San Francisco to London, then we switched buses at the big pond. We then got on two more buses and we drove through Turkey and Iran, Afghanistan, over the Khyber Pass into Pakistan, like every other young doctor. This is us at the Khyber Pass, and that's our bus. We had some difficulty getting over the Khyber Pass. But we wound up in India. And then, like everyone else in our generation, we went to live in a Himalayan monastery.(Laughter)This is just like a residency program, for those of you that are in medical school. (Laughter) And we studied with a wise man, a guru named Karoli Baba, who then told me to get rid of the dress, put on a three-piece suit, go join the United Nations as a diplomat and work for the World Health Organization. And he made an outrageous prediction that smallpox would be eradicated, and that this was God's gift to humanity, because of the hard work of dedicated scientists. And that prediction came true. This little girl is Rahima Banu, and she was the last case of killer smallpox in the world. And this document is the certificate that the global commission signed, certifying the world to have eradicated the first disease in history.The key to eradicating smallpox was early detection, early response. I'm going to ask you to repeat that: early detection, early response. Can you say that?Audience: Early detection, early response.Larry Brilliant: Smallpox was the worst disease in history. It killed more people than all the wars in history. In the last century, it killed 500 million people. You're reading about Larry Page already. Somebody reads very fast. (Laughter) In the year that Larry Page and Sergey Brin \u2014 with whom I have a certain affection and a new affiliation \u2014 in the year in which they were born, two million people died of smallpox. We declared smallpox eradicated in 1980. This is the most important slide that I've ever seen in public health, [Sovereigns killed by smallpox] because it shows you to be the richest and the strongest, and to be kings and queens of the world, did not protect you from dying of smallpox. Never can you doubt that we are all in this together.But to see smallpox from the perspective of a sovereign is the wrong perspective. You should see it from the perspective of a mother, watching her child develop this disease and standing by helplessly. Day one, day two, day three, day four, day five, day six. You're a mother and you're watching your child, and on day six, you see pustules that become hard. Day seven, they show the classic scars of smallpox umbilication. Day eight.And Al Gore said earlier that the most photographed image in the world, the most printed image in the world, was that of the Earth. But this was in 1974, and as of that moment, this photograph was the photograph that was the most widely printed, because we printed two billion copies of this photograph, and we took them hand to hand, door to door, to show people and ask them if there was smallpox in their house, because that was our surveillance system. We didn't have Google, we didn't have web crawlers, we didn't have computers.By day nine \u2014 you look at this picture and you're horrified; I look at this picture and I say, \"Thank God,\" because it's clear that this is only an ordinary case of smallpox, and I know this child will live. And by day 13, the lesions are scabbing, his eyelids are swollen, but you know this child has no other secondary infection. And by day 20, while he will be scarred for life, he will live.There are other kinds of smallpox that are not like that. This is confluent smallpox, in which there isn't a single place on the body where you could put a finger and not be covered by lesions. Flat smallpox, which killed 100 percent of people who got it. And hemorrhagic smallpox, the most cruel of all, which had a predilection for pregnant women. I've probably had 50 women die. They all had hemorrhagic smallpox. I've never seen anybody die from it who wasn't a pregnant woman.In 1967, the WHO embarked on what was an outrageous program to eradicate a disease. In that year, there were 34 countries affected with smallpox. By 1970, we were down to 18 countries. 1974, we were down to five countries. But in that year, smallpox exploded throughout India. And India was the place where smallpox made its last stand. In 1974, India had a population of 600 million. There are 21 linguistic states in India, which is like saying 21 different countries. There are 20 million people on the road at any time, in buses and trains, walking; 500,000 villages, 120 million households, and none of them wanted to report if they had a case of smallpox in their house, because they thought that smallpox was the visitation of a deity, Shitala Mata, the cooling mother, and it was wrong to bring strangers into your house when the deity was in the house. No incentive to report smallpox.It wasn't just India that had smallpox deities; smallpox deities were prevalent all over the world. So, how we eradicated smallpox was \u2014 mass vaccination wouldn't work. You could vaccinate everybody in India, but one year later there'd be 21 million new babies, which was then the population of Canada. It wouldn't do just to vaccinate everyone. You had to find every single case of smallpox in the world at the same time, and draw a circle of immunity around it. And that's what we did. In India alone, my 150,000 best friends and I went door to door, with that same picture, to every single house in India. We made over one billion house calls.And in the process, I learned something very important. Every time we did a house-to-house search, we had a spike in the number of reports of smallpox. When we didn't search, we had the illusion that there was no disease. When we did search, we had the illusion that there was more disease. A surveillance system was necessary, because what we needed was early detection, early response. So we searched and we searched, and we found every case of smallpox in India. We had a reward. We raised the reward. We continued to increase the reward. We had a scorecard that we wrote on every house. And as we did that, the number of reported cases in the world dropped to zero. And in 1980, we declared the globe free of smallpox.It was the largest campaign in United Nations history, until the Iraq war. 150,000 people from all over the world \u2014 doctors of every race, religion, culture and nation, who fought side by side, brothers and sisters, with each other, not against each other, in a common cause to make the world better. But smallpox was the fourth disease that was intended for eradication. We failed three other times. We failed against malaria, yellow fever and yaws. But soon we may see polio eradicated. But the key to eradicating polio is early detection, early response. This may be the year we eradicate polio. That will make it the second disease in history. And David Heymann, who's watching this on the webcast \u2014 David, keep on going. We're close! We're down to four countries.(Applause)I feel like Hank Aaron. Barry Bonds can replace me any time.Let's get another disease off the list of terrible things to worry about. I was just in India working on the polio program. The polio surveillance program is four million people going door to door. That is the surveillance system. But we need to have early detection, early response. Blindness, the same thing. The key to discovering blindness is doing epidemiological surveys and finding out the causes of blindness, so you can mount the correct response.The Seva Foundation was started by a group of alumni of the Smallpox Eradication Programme, who, having climbed the highest mountain, tasted the elixir of the success of eradicating a disease, wanted to do it again. And over the last 27 years, Seva's programs in 15 countries have given back sight to more than two million blind people. Seva got started because we wanted to apply these lessons of surveillance and epidemiology to something which nobody else was looking at as a public health issue: blindness, which heretofore had been thought of only as a clinical disease.In 1980, Steve Jobs gave me that computer, which is Apple number 12, and it's still in Kathmandu, and it's still working, and we ought to go get it and auction it off and make more money for Seva. And we conducted the first Nepal survey ever done for health, and the first nationwide blindness survey ever done, and we had astonishing results. Instead of finding out what we thought was the case \u2014 that blindness was caused mostly by glaucoma and trachoma \u2014 we were astounded to find out that blindness was caused instead by cataract. You can't cure or prevent what you don't know is there.In your TED packages there's a DVD, \"Infinite Vision,\" about Dr. V and the Aravind Eye Hospital. I hope that you will take a look at it. Aravind, which started as a Seva project, is now the world's largest and best eye hospital. This year, that one hospital will give back sight to more than 300,000 people in Tamil Nadu, India. (Applause) Bird flu. I stand here as a representative of all terrible things \u2014 this might be the worst. The key to preventing or mitigating pandemic bird flu is early detection and rapid response. We will not have a vaccine or adequate supplies of an antiviral to combat bird flu if it occurs in the next three years. WHO stages the progress of a pandemic. We are now at stage three on the pandemic alert stage, with just a little bit of human-to-human transmission, but no human-to-human-to-human sustained transmission.The moment WHO says we've moved to category four \u2014 this will not be like Katrina. The world as we know it will stop. There'll be no airplanes flying. Would you get in an airplane with 250 people you didn't know, coughing and sneezing, when you knew that some of them might carry a disease that could kill you, for which you had no antivirals or vaccine? I did a study of the top epidemiologists in the world in October. I asked them \u2014 these are all fluologists and specialists in influenza \u2014 and I asked them the questions you'd like to ask them: What do you think the likelihood is that there'll be a pandemic? If it happens, how bad do you think it will be?Fifteen percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic within three years. But much worse than that, 90 percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic within your children or your grandchildren's lifetime. And they thought that if there was a pandemic, a billion people would get sick. As many as 165 million people would die. There would be a global recession and depression as our just-in-time inventory system and the tight rubber band of globalization broke, and the cost to our economy of one to three trillion dollars would be far worse for everyone than merely 100 million people dying, because so many more people would lose their job and their healthcare benefits, that the consequences are almost unthinkable. And it's getting worse, because travel is getting so much better.Let me show you a simulation of what a pandemic looks like. So we know what we're talking about. Let's assume, for example, that the first case occurs in South Asia. It initially goes quite slowly. You get two or three discrete locations. Then there'll be secondary outbreaks, and the disease will spread from country to country so fast that you won't know what hit you. Within three weeks it will be everywhere in the world. Now, if we had an \"undo\" button, and we could go back and isolate it and grab it when it first started \u2014 if we could find it early, and we had early detection and early response, and we could put each one of those viruses in jail \u2014 that's the only way to deal with something like a pandemic. And let me show you why that is.We have a joke. This is an epidemic curve, and everyone in medicine, I think, ultimately gets to know what it is. But the joke is, an epidemiologist likes to arrive at an epidemic right here and ride to glory on the downhill curve. (Laughter) But you don't get to do that usually. You usually arrive right about here. What we really want is to arrive right here, so we can stop the epidemic. But you can't always do that. But there's an organization that has been able to find a way to learn when the first cases occur, and that is called GPHIN; it's the Global Public Health Information Network. And that simulation that I showed you that you thought was bird flu \u2014 that was SARS. And SARS is the pandemic that did not occur. And it didn't occur because GPHIN found the pandemic-to-be of SARS three months before WHO actually announced it, and because of that, we were able to stop the SARS pandemic. And I think we owe a great debt of gratitude to GPHIN and to Ron St. John, who I hope is in the audience some place \u2014 over there \u2014 who's the founder of GPHIN.(Applause)Hello, Ron!(Applause)And TED has flown Ron here from Ottawa, where GPHIN is located, because not only did GPHIN find SARS early, but you may have seen last week that Iran announced that they had bird flu in Iran, but GPHIN found the bird flu in Iran not February 14 \u2014 but last September. We need an early-warning system to protect us against the things that are humanity's worst nightmare. And so my TED wish is based on the common denominator of these experiences. Smallpox \u2014 early detection, early response. Blindness, polio \u2014 early detection, early response. Pandemic bird flu \u2014 early detection, early response. It is a litany. It is so obvious that our only way of dealing with these new diseases is to find them early and to kill them before they spread.So, my TED wish is for you to help build a global system \u2014 an early-warning system \u2014 to protect us against humanity's worst nightmares. And what I thought I would call it is \"Early Detection,\" But it should really be called ... \"Total Early Detection.\" [TED](Laughter) What?(Applause) What? (Applause)But in all seriousness, because this idea is birthed in TED, I would like it to be a legacy of TED, and I'd like to call it the \"International System for Total Early Disease Detection.\" [INSTEDD] And INSTEDD then becomes our mantra. So instead of a hidden pandemic of bird flu, we find it and immediately contain it. Instead of a novel virus caused by bio-terror or bio-error, or shift or drift, we find it and we contain it. Instead of industrial accidents like oil spills or the catastrophe in Bhopal, we find them, and we respond to them. Instead of famine, hidden until it is too late, we detect it, and we respond. And instead of a system which is owned by a government, and hidden in the bowels of government, let's build an early detection system that's freely available to anyone in the world in their own language.Let's make it transparent, non-governmental, not owned by any single country or company, housed in a neutral country, with redundant backup in a different time zone and a different continent. And let's build it on GPHIN. Let's start with GPHIN. Let's increase the websites that they crawl from 20,000 to 20 million. Let's increase the languages they crawl from seven to 70, or more. Let's build in outbound confirmation messages, using text messages or SMS or instant messaging to find out from people who are within 100 meters of the rumor that you hear, if it is, in fact, valid. And let's add satellite confirmation. And we'll add Gapminder's amazing graphics to the front end.And we'll grow it as a moral force in the world, finding out those terrible things before anybody else knows about them, and sending our response to them, so that next year, instead of us meeting here, lamenting how many terrible things there are in the world, we will have pulled together, used the unique skills and the magic of this community, and be proud that we have done everything we can to stop pandemics, other catastrophes, and change the world, beginning right now.(Applause)Chris Anderson: An amazing presentation. First of all, just so everyone understands: you're saying that by creating web crawlers, looking on the Internet for patterns, they can detect something suspicious before WHO, before anyone else can see it? Give an example of how that could possibly be true.Larry Brilliant: You're not mad about the copyright violation?CA: No. I love it.(Laughter)LB: Well, as Ron St. John \u2014 I hope you'll go and meet him in the dinner afterwards and talk to him. When he started GPHIN \u2014 In 1997, there was an outbreak of bird flu \u2014 H5N1. It was in Hong Kong. And a remarkable doctor in Hong Kong responded immediately, by slaughtering 1.5 million chickens and birds, and they stopped that outbreak in its tracks. Immediate detection, immediate response. Then a number of years went by, and there were a lot of rumors about bird flu. Ron and his team in Ottawa began to crawl the web \u2014 only crawling 20,000 different websites, mostly periodicals \u2014 and they read about and heard about a concern, of a lot of children who had high fever and symptoms of bird flu.They reported this to WHO.WHO took a little while taking action, because WHO will only receive a report from a government, because it's the United Nations. But they were able to point to WHO and let them know that there was this surprising and unexplained cluster of illnesses that looked like bird flu. That turned out to be SARS. That's how the world found out about SARS. And because of that, we were able to stop SARS. Now, what's really important is that, before there was GPHIN, 100 percent of all the world's reports of bad things \u2014 whether you're talking about famine or you're talking about bird flu or you're talking about Ebola \u2014 100 percent of all those reports came from nations.The moment these guys in Ottawa \u2014 on a budget of 800,000 dollars a year \u2014 got cracking, 75 percent of all the reports in the world came from GPHIN, 25 percent of all the reports in the world came from all the other 180 nations. Now, here's what's really interesting: after they'd been working for a couple years, what do you think happened to those nations? They felt pretty stupid. So they started sending in their reports early. And now, their reporting percentage is down to 50 percent, because other nations have started to report. So, can you find diseases early by crawling the web? Of course you can. Can you find it even earlier than GPHIN does now? Of course you can. You saw that they found SARS using their Chinese web crawler a full six weeks before they found it using their English web crawler. Well, they're only crawling in seven languages. These bad viruses really don't have any intention of showing up first in English or Spanish or French.(Laughter)So yes, I want to take GPHIN, I want to build on it. I want to add all the languages of the world that we possibly can. I want to make this open to everybody, so that the health officer in Nairobi or in Patna, Bihar will have as much access to it as the folks in Ottawa or in CDC. And I want to make it part of our culture that there is a community of people who are watching out for the worst nightmares of humanity, and that it's accessible to everyone.", "id": 58, "subtitle":

expect.\n\n00:01:13.188 --> 00:01:18.097\nWhen I was an intern in San Francisco,\n\n00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:21.933\nI heard about a group of Native Americans\nwho had taken over Alcatraz Island,\n\n00:01:21.957 --> 00:01:24.934\nand a Native American\nwho wanted to give birth on that island,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:29.099\nand no other doctor wanted\nto go and help her give birth.\n\n00:01:29.123 --> 00:01:32.720\nI went out to Alcatraz, and I lived\non the island for several weeks.\n\n00:01:33.546 --> 00:01:36.267\nShe gave birth; I caught\nthe baby; I got off the island;\n\n00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:38.147\nI landed in San Francisco;\n\n00:01:38.171 --> 00:01:40.059\nand all the press wanted to talk to me,\n\n00:01:40.083 --> 00:01:44.184\nbecause my three weeks on the island\nmade me an expert in Indian affairs.\n\n00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:45.212\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:45.236 --> 00:01:47.275\nI wound up on every television show.\n\n00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.411\nSomeone saw me on television;\nthey called me up; and they asked me\n\n00:01:50.435 --> 00:01:53.040\nif I'd like to be in a movie\nand to play a young doctor\n\n00:01:53.064 --> 00:01:56.214\nfor a bunch of rock and roll stars\nwho were traveling in a bus ride\n\n00:01:56.238 --> 00:01:58.312\nfrom San Francisco to England.\n\n00:01:58.336 --> 00:01:59.934\nAnd I said, yes, I would do that,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:04.214\nso I became the doctor\nin an absolutely awful movie\n\n00:02:04.238 --> 00:02:06.136\ncalled \"Medicine Ball Caravan.\"\n\n00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.206\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.702\nNow, you know from the '60s,\n\n00:02:08.726 --> 00:02:11.803\nyou're either on the bus\nor you're off the bus; I was on the bus.\n\n00:02:11.827 --> 00:02:14.824\nMy wife of 37 years and I joined the bus.\n\n00:02:14.848 --> 00:02:17.528\nOur bus ride took us\nfrom San Francisco to London,\n\n00:02:17.552 --> 00:02:19.751\nthen we switched buses at the big pond.\n\n00:02:19.775 --> 00:02:23.203\nWe then got on two more buses\n\n00:02:23.227 --> 00:02:26.299\nand we drove through Turkey\nand Iran, Afghanistan,\n\n00:02:26.323 --> 00:02:29.934\nover the Khyber Pass into Pakistan,\nlike every other young doctor.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.625\nThis is us at the Khyber Pass,\nand that's our bus.\n\n00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:35.304\nWe had some difficulty getting\nover the Khyber Pass.\n\n00:02:36.487 --> 00:02:37.958\nBut we wound up in India.\n\n00:02:38.423 --> 00:02:40.672\nAnd then, like everyone else\nin our generation,\n\n00:02:40.696 --> 00:02:42.981\nwe went to live in a Himalayan monastery.\n\n00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:46.378 --> 00:02:48.189\nThis is just like a residency program,\n\n00:02:48.213 --> 00:02:50.369\nfor those of you\nthat are in medical school.\n\n00:02:50.393 --> 00:02:52.026\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.250\nAnd we studied with a wise man,\na guru named Karoli Baba,\n\n00:02:57.274 --> 00:03:00.916\nwho then told me to get rid of the dress,\n\n00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.683\nput on a three-piece suit,\n\n00:03:02.707 --> 00:03:05.961\ngo join the United Nations as a diplomat\n\n00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:08.045\nand work for the World\nHealth Organization.\n\n00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.437\nAnd he made an outrageous prediction\nthat smallpox would be eradicated,\n\n00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:15.483\nand that this was God's gift to humanity,\n\n00:03:15.507 --> 00:03:18.012\nbecause of the hard work\nof dedicated scientists.\n\n00:03:18.618 --> 00:03:20.622\nAnd that prediction came true.\n\n00:03:21.462 --> 00:03:23.772\nThis little girl is Rahima Banu,\n\n00:03:23.796 --> 00:03:26.761\nand she was the last case\nof killer smallpox in the world.\n\n00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.166\nAnd this document is the certificate\nthat the global commission signed,\n\n00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.958\ncertifying the world to have eradicated\nthe first disease in history.\n\n00:03:38.294 --> 00:03:43.934\nThe key to eradicating smallpox\nwas early detection, early response.\n\n00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:48.626\nI'm going to ask you to repeat that:\nearly detection, early response.\n\n00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.802\nCan you say that?\n\n00:03:49.826 --> 00:03:52.248\nAudience: Early detection, early response.\n\n00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.829\nLarry Brilliant: Smallpox\nwas the worst disease in history.\n\n00:03:55.853 --> 00:03:58.371\nIt killed more people\nthan all the wars in history.\n\n00:03:58.395 --> 00:04:02.958\nIn the last century,\nit killed 500 million people.\n\n00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:06.807\nYou're reading about Larry Page already.\n\n00:04:06.831 --> 00:04:08.403\nSomebody reads very fast.\n\n00:04:08.427 --> 00:04:09.981\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:10.005 --> 00:04:12.179\nIn the year that Larry Page\nand Sergey Brin --\n\n00:04:12.203 --> 00:04:15.819\nwith whom I have a certain affection\nand a new affiliation --\n\n00:04:15.843 --> 00:04:18.023\nin the year in which they were born,\n\n00:04:18.047 --> 00:04:20.168\ntwo million people died of smallpox.\n\n00:04:21.017 --> 00:04:24.612\nWe declared smallpox eradicated in 1980.\n\n00:04:25.718 --> 00:04:29.014\nThis is the most important slide\nthat I've ever seen in public health,\n\n00:04:29.038 --> 00:04:31.522\n[Sovereigns killed by smallpox]\nbecause it shows you\n\n00:04:31.546 --> 00:04:33.417\nto be the richest and the strongest,\n\n00:04:33.441 --> 00:04:35.366\nand to be kings and queens of the world,\n\n00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.464\ndid not protect you\nfrom dying of smallpox.\n\n00:04:37.488 --> 00:04:41.300\nNever can you doubt\nthat we are all in this together.\n\n00:04:42.427 --> 00:04:46.337\nBut to see smallpox\nfrom the perspective of a sovereign\n\n00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:47.861\nis the wrong perspective.\n\n00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.934\nYou should see it\nfrom the perspective of a mother,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.775\nwatching her child develop\nthis disease and standing by helplessly.\n\n00:04:54.799 --> 00:05:00.530\nDay one, day two, day three,\n\n00:05:00.554 --> 00:05:06.159\nday four, day five, day six.\n\n00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:09.572\nYou're a mother and you're\nwatching your child,\n\n00:05:09.596 --> 00:05:14.572\nand on day six, you see\npustules that become hard.\n\n00:05:15.358 --> 00:05:20.082\nDay seven, they show the classic scars\nof smallpox umbilication.\n\n00:05:20.106 --> 00:05:21.416\nDay eight.\n\n00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.168\nAnd Al Gore said earlier\n\n00:05:23.192 --> 00:05:26.081\nthat the most photographed\nimage in the world,\n\n00:05:26.105 --> 00:05:27.852\nthe most printed image in the world,\n\n00:05:27.876 --> 00:05:29.036\nwas that of the Earth.\n\n00:05:29.474 --> 00:05:32.671\nBut this was in 1974,\nand as of that moment,\n\n00:05:32.695 --> 00:05:36.318\nthis photograph was the photograph\nthat was the most widely printed,\n\n00:05:36.342 --> 00:05:39.827\nbecause we printed two billion copies\nof this photograph,\n\n00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:43.005\nand we took them\nhand to hand, door to door,\n\n00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:47.910\nto show people and ask them\nif there was smallpox in their house,\n\n00:05:47.934 --> 00:05:50.040\nbecause that was our surveillance system.\n\n00:05:50.064 --> 00:05:52.619\nWe didn't have Google,\nwe didn't have web crawlers,\n\n00:05:52.643 --> 00:05:54.373\nwe didn't have computers.\n\n00:05:55.825 --> 00:05:59.682\nBy day nine -- you look at this picture\nand you're horrified;\n\n00:05:59.706 --> 00:06:02.239\nI look at this picture\nand I say, \"Thank God,\"\n\n00:06:02.263 --> 00:06:06.224\nbecause it's clear that this is only\nan ordinary case of smallpox,\n\n00:06:06.248 --> 00:06:08.239\nand I know this child will live.\n\n00:06:09.445 --> 00:06:14.788\nAnd by day 13, the lesions\nare scabbing, his eyelids are swollen,\n\n00:06:14.812 --> 00:06:18.641\nbut you know this child has\nno other secondary infection.\n\n00:06:19.022 --> 00:06:23.339\nAnd by day 20, while he will be\nscarred for life, he will live.\n\n00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:27.182\nThere are other kinds of smallpox\nthat are not like that.\n\n00:06:27.206 --> 00:06:29.594\nThis is confluent smallpox,\n\n00:06:29.618 --> 00:06:33.403\nin which there isn't a single place\non the body where you could put a finger\n\n00:06:33.427 --> 00:06:36.236\nand not be covered by lesions.\n\n00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.546\nFlat smallpox, which killed 100 percent\nof people who got it.\n\n00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.539\nAnd hemorrhagic smallpox,\nthe most cruel of all,\n\n00:06:43.563 --> 00:06:46.831\nwhich had a predilection\nfor pregnant women.\n\n00:06:46.855 --> 00:06:48.822\nI've probably had 50 women die.\n\n00:06:49.268 --> 00:06:51.370\nThey all had hemorrhagic smallpox.\n\n00:06:51.394 --> 00:06:54.718\nI've never seen anybody die from it\nwho wasn't a pregnant woman.\n\n00:06:55.416 --> 00:06:59.337\nIn 1967, the WHO embarked\non what was an outrageous program\n\n00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:00.845\nto eradicate a disease.\n\n00:07:01.162 --> 00:07:04.734\nIn that year, there were 34 countries\naffected with smallpox.\n\n00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:08.227\nBy 1970, we were down to 18 countries.\n\n00:07:08.806 --> 00:07:11.418\n1974, we were down to five countries.\n\n00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:16.120\nBut in that year,\nsmallpox exploded throughout India.\n\n00:07:17.112 --> 00:07:20.934\nAnd India was the place\nwhere smallpox made its last stand.\n\n00:07:21.506 --> 00:07:24.545\nIn 1974, India had\na population of 600 million.\n\n00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:27.587\nThere are 21 linguistic states in India,\n\n00:07:27.611 --> 00:07:29.803\nwhich is like saying\n21 different countries.\n\n00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.097\nThere are 20 million people\non the road at any time,\n\n00:07:33.121 --> 00:07:39.140\nin buses and trains, walking;\n500,000 villages, 120 million households,\n\n00:07:39.164 --> 00:07:41.468\nand none of them wanted to report\n\n00:07:41.492 --> 00:07:43.934\nif they had a case\nof smallpox in their house,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.322\nbecause they thought that smallpox\nwas the visitation of a deity,\n\n00:07:47.346 --> 00:07:49.369\nShitala Mata, the cooling mother,\n\n00:07:49.393 --> 00:07:53.569\nand it was wrong to bring\nstrangers into your house\n\n00:07:53.593 --> 00:07:55.340\nwhen the deity was in the house.\n\n00:07:56.006 --> 00:07:58.255\nNo incentive to report smallpox.\n\n00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:01.249\nIt wasn't just India\nthat had smallpox deities;\n\n00:08:01.273 --> 00:08:04.537\nsmallpox deities were\nprevalent all over the world.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:08.370\nSo, how we eradicated smallpox was --\n\n00:08:08.394 --> 00:08:10.668\nmass vaccination wouldn't work.\n\n00:08:10.692 --> 00:08:12.595\nYou could vaccinate everybody in India,\n\n00:08:12.619 --> 00:08:15.119\nbut one year later there'd be\n21 million new babies,\n\n00:08:15.143 --> 00:08:17.238\nwhich was then the population of Canada.\n\n00:08:17.651 --> 00:08:19.839\nIt wouldn't do just to vaccinate everyone.\n\n00:08:19.863 --> 00:08:22.934\nYou had to find every single\ncase of smallpox in the world\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.934\nat the same time, and draw\na circle of immunity around it.\n\n00:08:26.503 --> 00:08:27.958\nAnd that's what we did.\n\n00:08:29.273 --> 00:08:34.468\nIn India alone, my 150,000 best friends\nand I went door to door,\n\n00:08:34.492 --> 00:08:36.566\nwith that same picture,\n\n00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.161\nto every single house in India.\n\n00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:40.061\nWe made over one billion house calls.\n\n00:08:41.499 --> 00:08:45.015\nAnd in the process,\nI learned something very important.\n\n00:08:45.721 --> 00:08:49.979\nEvery time we did a house-to-house search,\n\n00:08:50.003 --> 00:08:54.727\nwe had a spike in the number\nof reports of smallpox.\n\n00:08:54.751 --> 00:08:59.886\nWhen we didn't search, we had\nthe illusion that there was no disease.\n\n00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:04.114\nWhen we did search, we had the illusion\nthat there was more disease.\n\n00:09:04.138 --> 00:09:06.377\nA surveillance system was necessary,\n\n00:09:06.401 --> 00:09:12.378\nbecause what we needed\nwas early detection, early response.\n\n00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.879\nSo we searched and we searched,\n\n00:09:15.903 --> 00:09:18.753\nand we found every case\nof smallpox in India.\n\n00:09:18.777 --> 00:09:21.738\nWe had a reward. We raised the reward.\n\n00:09:21.762 --> 00:09:23.818\nWe continued to increase the reward.\n\n00:09:23.842 --> 00:09:26.655\nWe had a scorecard\nthat we wrote on every house.\n\n00:09:27.384 --> 00:09:29.115\nAnd as we did that,\n\n00:09:29.139 --> 00:09:32.515\nthe number of reported cases\nin the world dropped to zero.\n\n00:09:33.921 --> 00:09:38.601\nAnd in 1980, we declared the globe\nfree of smallpox.\n\n00:09:38.625 --> 00:09:43.130\nIt was the largest campaign\nin United Nations history,\n\n00:09:43.154 --> 00:09:44.764\nuntil the Iraq war.\n\n00:09:45.615 --> 00:09:48.934\n150,000 people from all over the world --\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.874\ndoctors of every race,\nreligion, culture and nation,\n\n00:09:51.898 --> 00:09:56.793\nwho fought side by side,\nbrothers and sisters,\n\n00:09:56.817 --> 00:10:00.055\nwith each other, not against each other,\n\n00:10:00.079 --> 00:10:02.301\nin a common cause\nto make the world better.\n\n00:10:03.206 --> 00:10:07.002\nBut smallpox was the fourth disease\nthat was intended for eradication.\n\n00:10:07.026 --> 00:10:09.279\nWe failed three other times.\n\n00:10:09.303 --> 00:10:12.582\nWe failed against malaria,\nyellow fever and yaws.\n\n00:10:12.606 --> 00:10:15.934\nBut soon we may see polio eradicated.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:21.695\nBut the key to eradicating polio\nis early detection, early response.\n\n00:10:22.568 --> 00:10:25.417\nThis may be the year we eradicate polio.\n\n00:10:25.441 --> 00:10:28.131\nThat will make it\nthe second disease in history.\n\n00:10:28.155 --> 00:10:32.294\nAnd David Heymann, who's watching\nthis on the webcast --\n\n00:10:32.318 --> 00:10:35.278\nDavid, keep on going. We're close!\n\n00:10:35.302 --> 00:10:36.934\nWe're down to four countries.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:43.365\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:43.389 --> 00:10:44.604\nI feel like Hank Aaron.\n\n00:10:44.628 --> 00:10:46.631\nBarry Bonds can replace me any time.\n\n00:10:46.655 --> 00:10:50.789\nLet's get another disease off the list\nof terrible things to worry about.\n\n00:10:51.773 --> 00:10:55.022\nI was just in India working on\nthe polio program.\n\n00:10:55.046 --> 00:11:00.809\nThe polio surveillance program\nis four million people going door to door.\n\n00:11:00.833 --> 00:11:02.934\nThat is the surveillance system.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:07.084\nBut we need to have\nearly detection, early response.\n\n00:11:07.108 --> 00:11:08.735\nBlindness, the same thing.\n\n00:11:08.759 --> 00:11:13.711\nThe key to discovering blindness\nis doing epidemiological surveys\n\n00:11:13.735 --> 00:11:15.934\nand finding out the causes of blindness,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.616\nso you can mount the correct response.\n\n00:11:19.219 --> 00:11:23.832\nThe Seva Foundation\nwas started by a group of alumni\n\n00:11:23.856 --> 00:11:26.748\nof the Smallpox Eradication Programme,\n\n00:11:26.772 --> 00:11:29.463\nwho, having climbed the highest mountain,\n\n00:11:29.487 --> 00:11:33.934\ntasted the elixir of the success\nof eradicating a disease,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.934\nwanted to do it again.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:40.826\nAnd over the last 27 years,\nSeva's programs in 15 countries\n\n00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.934\nhave given back sight\nto more than two million blind people.\n\n00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.071\nSeva got started because we wanted\nto apply these lessons\n\n00:11:48.095 --> 00:11:50.690\nof surveillance and epidemiology\n\n00:11:50.714 --> 00:11:54.639\nto something which nobody else\nwas looking at as a public health issue:\n\n00:11:54.663 --> 00:11:58.649\nblindness, which heretofore had been\nthought of only as a clinical disease.\n\n00:11:59.792 --> 00:12:06.064\nIn 1980, Steve Jobs gave me\nthat computer, which is Apple number 12,\n\n00:12:06.088 --> 00:12:08.541\nand it's still in Kathmandu,\nand it's still working,\n\n00:12:08.565 --> 00:12:12.410\nand we ought to go get it and auction\nit off and make more money for Seva.\n\n00:12:13.172 --> 00:12:17.208\nAnd we conducted the first Nepal survey\never done for health,\n\n00:12:17.232 --> 00:12:20.089\nand the first nationwide\nblindness survey ever done,\n\n00:12:20.113 --> 00:12:21.934\nand we had astonishing results.\n\n00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.231\nInstead of finding out\nwhat we thought was the case --\n\n00:12:25.255 --> 00:12:28.934\nthat blindness was caused mostly\nby glaucoma and trachoma --\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.422\nwe were astounded to find out\n\n00:12:31.446 --> 00:12:35.121\nthat blindness was caused\ninstead by cataract.\n\n00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:40.177\nYou can't cure or prevent\nwhat you don't know is there.\n\n00:12:42.103 --> 00:12:46.299\nIn your TED packages\nthere's a DVD, \"Infinite Vision,\"\n\n00:12:46.323 --> 00:12:48.934\nabout Dr. V and the Aravind Eye Hospital.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.990\nI hope that you will take a look at it.\n\n00:12:51.014 --> 00:12:53.188\nAravind, which started as a Seva project,\n\n00:12:53.212 --> 00:12:56.160\nis now the world's largest\nand best eye hospital.\n\n00:12:56.184 --> 00:12:59.581\nThis year, that one hospital\nwill give back sight\n\n00:12:59.605 --> 00:13:03.156\nto more than 300,000 people\nin Tamil Nadu, India.\n\n00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:07.454\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:07.478 --> 00:13:08.630\nBird flu.\n\n00:13:08.654 --> 00:13:11.475\nI stand here as a representative\nof all terrible things --\n\n00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:12.958\nthis might be the worst.\n\n00:13:13.749 --> 00:13:18.503\nThe key to preventing\nor mitigating pandemic bird flu\n\n00:13:18.527 --> 00:13:20.934\nis early detection and rapid response.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:26.761\nWe will not have a vaccine\nor adequate supplies of an antiviral\n\n00:13:26.785 --> 00:13:29.934\nto combat bird flu if it occurs\nin the next three years.\n\n00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.934\nWHO stages the progress of a pandemic.\n\n00:13:34.304 --> 00:13:38.697\nWe are now at stage three\non the pandemic alert stage,\n\n00:13:38.721 --> 00:13:42.276\nwith just a little bit\nof human-to-human transmission,\n\n00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.934\nbut no human-to-human-to-human\nsustained transmission.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:50.186\nThe moment WHO says\nwe've moved to category four --\n\n00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:52.373\nthis will not be like Katrina.\n\n00:13:52.397 --> 00:13:54.476\nThe world as we know it will stop.\n\n00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.242\nThere'll be no airplanes flying.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:00.107\nWould you get in an airplane\nwith 250 people you didn't know,\n\n00:14:00.131 --> 00:14:01.283\ncoughing and sneezing,\n\n00:14:01.307 --> 00:14:04.800\nwhen you knew that some of them\nmight carry a disease that could kill you,\n\n00:14:04.824 --> 00:14:07.704\nfor which you had\nno antivirals or vaccine?\n\n00:14:08.835 --> 00:14:12.852\nI did a study of the top epidemiologists\nin the world in October.\n\n00:14:12.876 --> 00:14:16.934\nI asked them -- these are all fluologists\nand specialists in influenza --\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.794\nand I asked them the questions\nyou'd like to ask them:\n\n00:14:19.818 --> 00:14:23.006\nWhat do you think the likelihood\nis that there'll be a pandemic?\n\n00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:25.707\nIf it happens, how bad\ndo you think it will be?\n\n00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:30.671\nFifteen percent said they thought\nthere'd be a pandemic within three years.\n\n00:14:30.695 --> 00:14:32.631\nBut much worse than that,\n\n00:14:32.655 --> 00:14:36.117\n90 percent said they thought\nthere'd be a pandemic\n\n00:14:36.141 --> 00:14:39.062\nwithin your children\nor your grandchildren's lifetime.\n\n00:14:40.205 --> 00:14:43.729\nAnd they thought\nthat if there was a pandemic,\n\n00:14:43.753 --> 00:14:45.769\na billion people would get sick.\n\n00:14:46.681 --> 00:14:50.110\nAs many as 165 million people would die.\n\n00:14:50.808 --> 00:14:53.324\nThere would be a global\nrecession and depression\n\n00:14:53.348 --> 00:14:55.526\nas our just-in-time inventory system\n\n00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:59.368\nand the tight rubber band\nof globalization broke,\n\n00:14:59.392 --> 00:15:03.336\nand the cost to our economy\nof one to three trillion dollars\n\n00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.982\nwould be far worse for everyone\nthan merely 100 million people dying,\n\n00:15:09.006 --> 00:15:11.308\nbecause so many more people\nwould lose their job\n\n00:15:11.332 --> 00:15:12.934\nand their healthcare benefits,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.413\nthat the consequences\nare almost unthinkable.\n\n00:15:17.127 --> 00:15:20.958\nAnd it's getting worse,\nbecause travel is getting so much better.\n\n00:15:23.168 --> 00:15:28.867\nLet me show you a simulation\nof what a pandemic looks like.\n\n00:15:29.704 --> 00:15:31.704\nSo we know what we're talking about.\n\n00:15:32.351 --> 00:15:35.958\nLet's assume, for example,\nthat the first case occurs in South Asia.\n\n00:15:37.358 --> 00:15:39.708\nIt initially goes quite slowly.\n\n00:15:39.732 --> 00:15:42.348\nYou get two or three discrete locations.\n\n00:15:44.086 --> 00:15:48.699\nThen there'll be secondary outbreaks,\nand the disease will spread\n\n00:15:48.723 --> 00:15:52.934\nfrom country to country so fast\nthat you won't know what hit you.\n\n00:15:53.468 --> 00:15:56.934\nWithin three weeks\nit will be everywhere in the world.\n\n00:15:57.744 --> 00:16:03.095\nNow, if we had an \"undo\" button,\nand we could go back and isolate it\n\n00:16:03.119 --> 00:16:06.476\nand grab it when it first started --\nif we could find it early,\n\n00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.934\nand we had early detection\nand early response,\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.648\nand we could put each one\nof those viruses in jail --\n\n00:16:12.672 --> 00:16:17.553\nthat's the only way to deal with\nsomething like a pandemic.\n\n00:16:19.307 --> 00:16:20.958\nAnd let me show you why that is.\n\n00:16:22.053 --> 00:16:23.213\nWe have a joke.\n\n00:16:23.237 --> 00:16:26.061\nThis is an epidemic curve,\nand everyone in medicine,\n\n00:16:26.085 --> 00:16:28.508\nI think, ultimately gets\nto know what it is.\n\n00:16:28.532 --> 00:16:29.686\nBut the joke is,\n\n00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:32.819\nan epidemiologist likes to arrive\nat an epidemic right here\n\n00:16:32.843 --> 00:16:34.981\nand ride to glory on the downhill curve.\n\n00:16:35.005 --> 00:16:36.108\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:36.132 --> 00:16:37.934\nBut you don't get to do that usually.\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.936\nYou usually arrive right about here.\n\n00:16:40.483 --> 00:16:45.767\nWhat we really want is to arrive\nright here, so we can stop the epidemic.\n\n00:16:46.283 --> 00:16:47.714\nBut you can't always do that.\n\n00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.707\nBut there's an organization\nthat has been able to find a way\n\n00:16:51.731 --> 00:16:53.934\nto learn when the first cases occur,\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.307\nand that is called GPHIN;\n\n00:16:56.331 --> 00:16:58.854\nit's the Global Public Health\nInformation Network.\n\n00:16:59.204 --> 00:17:01.292\nAnd that simulation that I showed you\n\n00:17:01.316 --> 00:17:03.513\nthat you thought\nwas bird flu -- that was SARS.\n\n00:17:03.921 --> 00:17:06.721\nAnd SARS is the pandemic\nthat did not occur.\n\n00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:08.689\nAnd it didn't occur\n\n00:17:08.713 --> 00:17:15.024\nbecause GPHIN found\nthe pandemic-to-be of SARS\n\n00:17:15.048 --> 00:17:21.086\nthree months before WHO actually\nannounced it, and because of that,\n\n00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:24.276\nwe were able to stop the SARS pandemic.\n\n00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.381\nAnd I think we owe\na great debt of gratitude\n\n00:17:26.405 --> 00:17:28.562\nto GPHIN and to Ron St. John,\n\n00:17:28.586 --> 00:17:32.037\nwho I hope is in the audience\nsome place -- over there --\n\n00:17:32.061 --> 00:17:33.934\nwho's the founder of GPHIN.\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.441\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:35.465 --> 00:17:36.934\nHello, Ron!\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:43.758\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:45.568 --> 00:17:50.182\nAnd TED has flown Ron here\nfrom Ottawa, where GPHIN is located,\n\n00:17:50.206 --> 00:17:54.643\nbecause not only\ndid GPHIN find SARS early,\n\n00:17:54.667 --> 00:17:56.784\nbut you may have seen last week\n\n00:17:56.808 --> 00:18:01.139\nthat Iran announced\nthat they had bird flu in Iran,\n\n00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:04.855\nbut GPHIN found the bird flu\nin Iran not February 14 --\n\n00:18:04.879 --> 00:18:06.736\nbut last September.\n\n00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.420\nWe need an early-warning system\n\n00:18:09.444 --> 00:18:13.779\nto protect us against the things\nthat are humanity's worst nightmare.\n\n00:18:14.597 --> 00:18:18.399\nAnd so my TED wish is based on\nthe common denominator\n\n00:18:18.423 --> 00:18:19.789\nof these experiences.\n\n00:18:19.813 --> 00:18:22.699\nSmallpox -- early detection,\nearly response.\n\n00:18:22.723 --> 00:18:25.850\nBlindness, polio --\nearly detection, early response.\n\n00:18:26.207 --> 00:18:30.199\nPandemic bird flu --\nearly detection, early response.\n\n00:18:30.223 --> 00:18:31.610\nIt is a litany.\n\n00:18:31.634 --> 00:18:36.648\nIt is so obvious that our only way\nof dealing with these new diseases\n\n00:18:36.672 --> 00:18:40.999\nis to find them early\nand to kill them before they spread.\n\n00:18:41.023 --> 00:18:45.431\nSo, my TED wish is for you\nto help build a global system --\n\n00:18:45.455 --> 00:18:46.934\nan early-warning system --\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:50.689\nto protect us against\nhumanity's worst nightmares.\n\n00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:57.462\nAnd what I thought I would call it\nis \"Early Detection,\"\n\n00:18:58.682 --> 00:19:00.806\nBut it should really be called ...\n\n00:19:02.181 --> 00:19:03.830\n\"Total Early Detection.\"\n[TED]\n\n00:19:03.854 --> 00:19:04.937\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:04.961 --> 00:19:06.112\nWhat?\n\n00:19:06.136 --> 00:19:13.121\n(Applause)\n\n00:19:13.551 --> 00:19:14.701\nWhat?\n\n00:19:14.725 --> 00:19:17.208\n(Applause)\n\n00:19:18.177 --> 00:19:20.020\nBut in all seriousness,\n\n00:19:20.044 --> 00:19:23.567\nbecause this idea is birthed in TED,\n\n00:19:23.591 --> 00:19:28.934\nI would like it to be\na legacy of TED, and I'd like to call it\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:34.179\nthe \"International System for Total\nEarly Disease Detection.\"\n\n00:19:34.203 --> 00:19:35.401\n[INSTEDD]\n\n00:19:37.758 --> 00:19:42.344\nAnd INSTEDD then becomes our mantra.\n\n00:19:45.193 --> 00:19:47.698\nSo instead of a hidden\npandemic of bird flu,\n\n00:19:47.722 --> 00:19:49.722\nwe find it and immediately contain it.\n\n00:19:50.681 --> 00:19:55.556\nInstead of a novel virus\ncaused by bio-terror or bio-error,\n\n00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:59.567\nor shift or drift,\nwe find it and we contain it.\n\n00:20:00.226 --> 00:20:02.712\nInstead of industrial\naccidents like oil spills\n\n00:20:02.736 --> 00:20:04.934\nor the catastrophe in Bhopal,\n\n00:20:04.958 --> 00:20:08.168\nwe find them, and we respond to them.\n\n00:20:08.748 --> 00:20:11.871\nInstead of famine,\nhidden until it is too late,\n\n00:20:11.895 --> 00:20:14.837\nwe detect it, and we respond.\n\n00:20:16.019 --> 00:20:19.186\nAnd instead of a system\nwhich is owned by a government,\n\n00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:21.631\nand hidden in the bowels of government,\n\n00:20:21.655 --> 00:20:24.257\nlet's build an early detection system\n\n00:20:24.281 --> 00:20:28.110\nthat's freely available to anyone\nin the world in their own language.\n\n00:20:28.816 --> 00:20:33.584\nLet's make it transparent,\nnon-governmental,\n\n00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:36.664\nnot owned by any single\ncountry or company,\n\n00:20:36.688 --> 00:20:40.108\nhoused in a neutral country,\nwith redundant backup\n\n00:20:40.132 --> 00:20:43.299\nin a different time zone\nand a different continent.\n\n00:20:44.093 --> 00:20:46.086\nAnd let's build it on GPHIN.\n\n00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:47.492\nLet's start with GPHIN.\n\n00:20:48.008 --> 00:20:50.922\nLet's increase the websites\nthat they crawl\n\n00:20:50.946 --> 00:20:52.934\nfrom 20,000 to 20 million.\n\n00:20:53.456 --> 00:20:55.965\nLet's increase the languages they crawl\n\n00:20:55.989 --> 00:20:58.782\nfrom seven to 70, or more.\n\n00:20:59.131 --> 00:21:02.671\nLet's build in outbound\nconfirmation messages,\n\n00:21:02.695 --> 00:21:05.959\nusing text messages or SMS\nor instant messaging\n\n00:21:05.983 --> 00:21:08.793\nto find out from people\nwho are within 100 meters\n\n00:21:08.817 --> 00:21:10.568\nof the rumor that you hear,\n\n00:21:10.592 --> 00:21:11.934\nif it is, in fact, valid.\n\n00:21:11.958 --> 00:21:14.199\nAnd let's add satellite confirmation.\n\n00:21:14.572 --> 00:21:18.479\nAnd we'll add Gapminder's\namazing graphics to the front end.\n\n00:21:18.503 --> 00:21:22.421\nAnd we'll grow it\nas a moral force in the world,\n\n00:21:22.445 --> 00:21:24.537\nfinding out those terrible things\n\n00:21:24.561 --> 00:21:26.648\nbefore anybody else knows about them,\n\n00:21:26.672 --> 00:21:29.098\nand sending our response to them,\n\n00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:32.636\nso that next year,\ninstead of us meeting here,\n\n00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:36.214\nlamenting how many terrible things\nthere are in the world,\n\n00:21:36.238 --> 00:21:37.976\nwe will have pulled together,\n\n00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.879\nused the unique skills\nand the magic of this community,\n\n00:21:42.903 --> 00:21:46.325\nand be proud that we have done\neverything we can to stop

before anyone else can see it?\n\n00:22:31.436 --> 00:22:34.293\nGive an example of how\nthat could possibly be true.\n\n00:22:35.132 --> 00:22:38.069\nLarry Brilliant: You're not mad\nabout the

--> 00:22:45.499\nI hope you'll go and meet him\nin the dinner afterwards and talk to him.\n\n00:22:45.523 --> 00:22:48.076\nWhen he started GPHIN --\n\n00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:52.496\nIn 1997, there was an outbreak\nof bird flu -- H5N1.\n\n00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.807\nIt was in Hong Kong.\n\n00:22:53.831 --> 00:22:57.013\nAnd a remarkable doctor in Hong Kong\nresponded immediately,\n\n00:22:57.037 --> 00:23:01.854\nby slaughtering 1.5 million\nchickens and birds,\n\n00:23:01.878 --> 00:23:04.766\nand they stopped\nthat outbreak in its tracks.\n\n00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:08.002\nImmediate detection, immediate response.\n\n00:23:08.026 --> 00:23:09.520\nThen a number of years went by,\n\n00:23:09.544 --> 00:23:11.828\nand there were a lot\nof rumors about bird flu.\n\n00:23:12.542 --> 00:23:16.330\nRon and his team in Ottawa\nbegan to crawl the web --\n\n00:23:16.354 --> 00:23:21.544\nonly crawling 20,000 different websites,\nmostly periodicals --\n\n00:23:21.568 --> 00:23:24.791\nand they read about\nand heard about a concern,\n\n00:23:24.815 --> 00:23:28.634\nof a lot of children who had high fever\nand symptoms of bird flu.\n\n00:23:29.571 --> 00:23:31.472\nThey reported this to WHO.\n\n00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:34.131\nWHO took a little while taking action,\n\n00:23:34.155 --> 00:23:38.814\nbecause WHO will only receive\na report from a government,\n\n00:23:38.838 --> 00:23:40.504\nbecause it's the United Nations.\n\n00:23:41.354 --> 00:23:44.756\nBut they were able to point\nto WHO and let them know\n\n00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:49.245\nthat there was this surprising\nand unexplained cluster of illnesses\n\n00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:50.673\nthat looked like bird flu.\n\n00:23:51.038 --> 00:23:52.772\nThat turned out to be SARS.\n\n00:23:52.796 --> 00:23:55.168\nThat's how the world found out about SARS.\n\n00:23:55.763 --> 00:23:58.673\nAnd because of that,\nwe were able to stop SARS.\n\n00:23:58.697 --> 00:24:02.275\nNow, what's really important is that,\nbefore there was GPHIN,\n\n00:24:02.299 --> 00:24:06.514\n100 percent of all the world's\nreports of bad things --\n\n00:24:06.538 --> 00:24:08.206\nwhether you're talking about famine\n\n00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:11.308\nor you're talking about bird flu\nor you're talking about Ebola --\n\n00:24:11.332 --> 00:24:14.071\n100 percent of all those reports\ncame from nations.\n\n00:24:14.484 --> 00:24:16.143\nThe moment these guys in Ottawa --\n\n00:24:16.167 --> 00:24:20.548\non a budget of 800,000 dollars\na year -- got cracking,\n\n00:24:20.572 --> 00:24:24.704\n75 percent of all the reports\nin the world came from GPHIN,\n\n00:24:24.728 --> 00:24:27.092\n25 percent of all the reports in the world\n\n00:24:27.116 --> 00:24:29.173\ncame from all the other 180 nations.\n\n00:24:30.474 --> 00:24:32.442\nNow, here's what's really interesting:\n\n00:24:32.466 --> 00:24:35.109\nafter they'd been working\nfor a couple years,\n\n00:24:35.133 --> 00:24:37.231\nwhat do you think happened\nto those nations?\n\n00:24:37.255 --> 00:24:38.438\nThey felt pretty stupid.\n\n00:24:38.462 --> 00:24:40.675\nSo they started sending in\ntheir reports early.\n\n00:24:40.699 --> 00:24:44.555\nAnd now, their reporting percentage\nis down to 50 percent,\n\n00:24:44.579 --> 00:24:46.997\nbecause other nations\nhave started to report.\n\n00:24:47.021 --> 00:24:51.187\nSo, can you find diseases\nearly by crawling the web?\n\n00:24:51.211 --> 00:24:52.392\nOf course you can.\n\n00:24:52.783 --> 00:24:55.631\nCan you find it even earlier\nthan GPHIN does now?\n\n00:24:55.655 --> 00:24:56.806\nOf course you can.\n\n00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:01.435\nYou saw that they found SARS\nusing their Chinese web crawler\n\n00:25:01.459 --> 00:25:06.402\na full six weeks before they found it\nusing their English web crawler.\n\n00:25:06.751 --> 00:25:09.140\nWell, they're only crawling\nin seven languages.\n\n00:25:09.164 --> 00:25:11.670\nThese bad viruses really\ndon't have any intention\n\n00:25:11.694 --> 00:25:14.152\nof showing up first in English\nor Spanish or French.\n\n00:25:14.176 --> 00:25:16.175\n(Laughter)\n\n00:25:16.199 --> 00:25:20.683\nSo yes, I want to take GPHIN,\nI want to build on it.\n\n00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:24.622\nI want to add all the languages\nof the world that we possibly can.\n\n00:25:24.646 --> 00:25:26.934\nI want to make this open to everybody,\n\n00:25:26.958 --> 00:25:29.934\nso that the health officer\nin Nairobi or in Patna, Bihar\n\n00:25:29.958 --> 00:25:34.252\nwill have as much access to it\nas the folks in Ottawa or in CDC.\n\n00:25:34.682 --> 00:25:37.086\nAnd I want to make it part of our culture\n\n00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:40.697\nthat there is a community of people\nwho are watching out\n\n00:25:40.721 --> 00:25:42.934\nfor the worst nightmares of humanity,\n\n00:25:42.958 --> 00:25:44.958\nand that it's accessible to everyone."}, {"title": "The radical promise of the multi-touch interface", "duration": "527", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_han_demos_his_breakthrough_touchscreen", "transcript": "I'm really excited to be here today. I'll show you some stuff that's just ready to come out of the lab, literally, and I'm really glad that you guys are going to be among the first to see it in person, because I really think this is going to really change the way we interact with machines from this point on.Now, this is a rear-projected drafting table. It's about 36 inches wide and it's equipped with a multi-touch sensor. Normal touch sensors that you see, like on a kiosk or interactive whiteboards, can only register one point of contact at a time. This thing allows you to have multiple points at the same time. They can use both my hands; I can use chording actions; I can just go right up and use all 10 fingers if I wanted to. You know, like that.Now, multi-touch sensing isn't completely new. People like Bill Buxton have been playing around with it in the '80s. However, the approach I built here is actually high-resolution, low-cost, and probably most importantly, very scalable. So, the technology, you know, isn't the most exciting thing here right now, other than probably its newfound accessibility. What's really interesting here is what you can do with it and the kind of interfaces you can build on top of it. So let's see.So, for instance, we have a lava lamp application here. Now, you can see, I can use both of my hands to kind of squeeze and put the blobs together. I can inject heat into the system here, or I can pull it apart with two of my fingers. It's completely intuitive; there's no instruction manual. The interface just kind of disappears. This started out as a screensaver app that one of the Ph.D. students in our lab, Ilya Rosenberg, made. But I think its true identity comes out here.Now what's great about a multi-touch sensor is that, you know, I could be doing this with as many fingers here, but of course multi-touch also inherently means multi-user. Chris could be interacting with another part of Lava, while I play around with it here. You can imagine a new kind of sculpting tool, where I'm kind of warming something up, making it malleable, and then letting it cool down and solidifying in a certain state. Google should have something like this in their lobby.(Laughter)I'll show you a little more of a concrete example here, as this thing loads. This is a photographer's light-box application. Again, I can use both of my hands to interact and move photos around. But what's even cooler is that if I have two fingers, I can actually grab a photo and then stretch it out like that really easily. I can pan, zoom and rotate it effortlessly. I can do that grossly with both of my hands, or I can do it just with two fingers on each of my hands together. If I grab the canvas, I can do the same thing \u2014 stretch it out. I can do it simultaneously, holding this down, and gripping on another one, stretching this out.Again, the interface just disappears here. There's no manual. This is exactly what you expect, especially if you haven't interacted with a computer before. Now, when you have initiatives like the $100 laptop, I kind of cringe at the idea of introducing a whole new generation to computing with this standard mouse-and-windows-pointer interface. This is something that I think is really the way we should be interacting with machines from now on.(Applause)Now, of course, I can bring up a keyboard.(Laughter) And I can bring that around, put that up there. Obviously, this is a standard keyboard, but of course I can rescale it to make it work well for my hands. That's really important, because there's no reason in this day and age that we should be conforming to a physical device. That leads to bad things, like RSI. We have so much technology nowadays that these interfaces should start conforming to us. There's so little applied now to actually improving the way we interact with interfaces from this point on. This keyboard is probably actually the really wrong direction to go. You can imagine, in the future, as we develop this kind of technology, a keyboard that kind of automatically drifts as your hand moves away, and really intelligently anticipates which key you're trying to stroke. So \u2014 again, isn't this great?(Laughter)Audience: Where's your lab?Jeff Han: I'm a research scientist at NYU in New York.Here's an example of another kind of app. I can make these little fuzz balls. It'll remember the strokes I'm making. Of course I can do it with all my hands. It's pressure-sensitive. What's neat about that is, I showed that two-finger gesture that zooms in really quickly. Because you don't have to switch to a hand tool or the magnifying glass tool, you can just continuously make things in real multiple scales, all at the same time. I can create big things out here, but I can go back and really quickly go back to where I started, and make even smaller things here.This is going to be really important as we start getting to things like data visualization. For instance, I think we all enjoyed Hans Rosling's talk, and he really emphasized the fact I've been thinking about for a long time: We have all this great data, but for some reason, it's just sitting there. We're not accessing it. And one of the reasons why I think that is will be helped by things like graphics and visualization and inference tools, but I also think a big part of it is going to be having better interfaces, to be able to drill down into this kind of data, while still thinking about the big picture here.Let me show you another app here. This is called WorldWind. It's done by NASA. We've all seen Google Earth; this is an open-source version of that. There are plug-ins to be able to load in different data sets that NASA's collected over the years. As you can see, I can use the same two-fingered gestures to go down and go in really seamlessly. There's no interface, again. It really allows anybody to kind of go in \u2014 and it just does what you'd expect, you know? Again, there's just no interface here. The interface just disappears. I can switch to different data views. That's what's neat about this app here. NASA's really cool. These hyper-spectral images are false-colored so you can \u2014 it's really good for determining vegetative use. Well, let's go back to this.The great thing about mapping applications \u2014 it's not really 2D, it's 3D. So, again, with a multi-point interface, you can do a gesture like this \u2014 so you can be able to tilt around like that \u2014(Surprised laughter)It's not just simply relegated to a kind of 2D panning and motion. This gesture is just putting two fingers down \u2014 it's defining an axis of tilt \u2014 and I can tilt up and down that way. We just came up with that on the spot, it's probably not the right thing to do, but there's such interesting things you can do with this interface. It's just so much fun playing around with it, too.(Laughter)And so the last thing I want to show you is \u2014 I'm sure we can all think of a lot of entertainment apps that you can do with this thing. I'm more interested in the creative applications we can do with this. Now, here's a simple application here \u2014 I can draw out a curve. And when I close it, it becomes a character. But the neat thing about it is I can add control points. And then what I can do is manipulate them with both of my fingers at the same time. And you notice what it does. It's kind of a puppeteering thing, where I can use as many fingers as I have to draw and make \u2014Now, there's a lot of actual math going on under here for this to control this mesh and do the right thing. This technique of being able to manipulate a mesh here, with multiple control points, is actually state of the art. It was released at SIGGRAPH last year. It's a great example of the kind of research I really love: all this compute power to make things do the right things, intuitive things, to do exactly what you expect.So, multi-touch interaction research is a very active field right now in HCI. I'm not the only one doing it, a lot of other people are getting into it. This kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it, I'm looking forward to interacting with all of you over the next few days and seeing how it can apply to your respective fields.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 65, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:13.832\nI'm really excited to be here today.\n\n00:00:13.856 -->

machines from this point on.\n\n00:00:27.297 --> 00:00:29.972\nNow, this is a rear-projected\ndrafting table.\n\n00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:31.218\nIt's about 36 inches wide\n\n00:00:31.242 --> 00:00:33.325\nand it's equipped\nwith a multi-touch sensor.\n\n00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:34.993\nNormal touch sensors that you see,\n\n00:00:35.017 --> 00:00:37.154\nlike on a kiosk\nor interactive whiteboards,\n\n00:00:37.178 --> 00:00:39.761\ncan only register one point\nof contact at a time.\n\n00:00:40.095 --> 00:00:43.810\nThis thing allows you to have\nmultiple points at the same time.\n\n00:00:43.834 --> 00:00:47.148\nThey can use both my hands;\nI can use chording actions;\n\n00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:50.109\nI can just go right up and use\nall 10 fingers if I wanted to.\n\n00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:51.712\nYou know, like that.\n\n00:00:51.736 --> 00:00:56.279\nNow, multi-touch sensing\nisn't completely new.\n\n00:00:56.303 --> 00:00:59.556\nPeople like Bill Buxton have been\nplaying around with it in the '80s.\n\n00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.608\nHowever, the approach I built here\nis actually high-resolution,\n\n00:01:03.632 --> 00:01:06.608\nlow-cost, and probably\nmost importantly, very scalable.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.295\nSo, the technology, you know,\n\n00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.765\nisn't the most exciting thing\nhere right now,\n\n00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:14.107\nother than probably\nits newfound accessibility.\n\n00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:17.656\nWhat's really interesting here\nis what you can do with it\n\n00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.298\nand the kind of interfaces\nyou can build on top of it.\n\n00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:22.235\nSo let's see.\n\n00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:27.382\nSo, for instance, we have\na lava lamp application here.\n\n00:01:27.406 --> 00:01:29.108\nNow, you can see,\n\n00:01:29.132 --> 00:01:32.561\nI can use both of my hands to kind\nof squeeze and put the blobs together.\n\n00:01:32.585 --> 00:01:35.128\nI can inject heat into the system here,\n\n00:01:35.152 --> 00:01:37.334\nor I can pull it apart\nwith two of my fingers.\n\n00:01:37.358 --> 00:01:40.088\nIt's completely intuitive;\nthere's no instruction manual.\n\n00:01:40.112 --> 00:01:41.934\nThe interface just kind of disappears.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.878\nThis started out as a screensaver app\n\n00:01:43.902 --> 00:01:46.949\nthat one of the Ph.D. students\nin our lab, Ilya Rosenberg, made.\n\n00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:50.994\nBut I think its true identity\ncomes out here.\n\n00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:55.034\nNow what's great about a multi-touch\nsensor is that, you know,\n\n00:01:55.058 --> 00:01:57.795\nI could be doing this\nwith as many fingers here,\n\n00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.797\nbut of course multi-touch\nalso inherently means multi-user.\n\n00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:03.320\nChris could be interacting\nwith another part of Lava,\n\n00:02:03.344 --> 00:02:04.978\nwhile I play around with it here.\n\n00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:07.098\nYou can imagine\na new kind of sculpting tool,\n\n00:02:07.122 --> 00:02:10.101\nwhere I'm kind of warming something up,\nmaking it malleable,\n\n00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:13.383\nand then letting it cool down\nand solidifying in a certain state.\n\n00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.617\nGoogle should have\nsomething like this in their lobby.\n\n00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:25.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:29.230\nI'll show you a little more\nof a concrete example here,\n\n00:02:29.254 --> 00:02:30.587\nas this thing loads.\n\n00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:33.856\nThis is a photographer's\nlight-box application.\n\n00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.857\nAgain, I can use both of my hands\nto interact and move photos around.\n\n00:02:37.881 --> 00:02:41.436\nBut what's even cooler\nis that if I have two fingers,\n\n00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.590\nI can actually grab a photo and then\nstretch it out like that really easily.\n\n00:02:45.614 --> 00:02:49.080\nI can pan, zoom\nand rotate it effortlessly.\n\n00:02:49.104 --> 00:02:51.435\nI can do that grossly\nwith both of my hands,\n\n00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.663\nor I can do it just with two fingers\non each of my hands together.\n\n00:02:54.687 --> 00:02:57.714\nIf I grab the canvas, I can do\nthe same thing -- stretch it out.\n\n00:02:57.738 --> 00:02:59.897\nI can do it simultaneously,\nholding this down,\n\n00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:02.220\nand gripping on another one,\nstretching this out.\n\n00:03:02.244 --> 00:03:04.472\nAgain, the interface just disappears here.\n\n00:03:04.496 --> 00:03:05.529\nThere's no manual.\n\n00:03:05.553 --> 00:03:07.855\nThis is exactly what you expect,\n\n00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.934\nespecially if you haven't interacted\nwith a computer before.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.662\nNow, when you have initiatives\nlike the $100 laptop,\n\n00:03:13.686 --> 00:03:15.219\nI kind of cringe at the idea\n\n00:03:15.243 --> 00:03:17.820\nof introducing a whole new\ngeneration to computing\n\n00:03:17.844 --> 00:03:20.582\nwith this standard\nmouse-and-windows-pointer interface.\n\n00:03:20.606 --> 00:03:23.742\nThis is something that I think\nis really the way\n\n00:03:23.766 --> 00:03:26.407\nwe should be interacting\nwith machines from now on.\n\n00:03:26.431 --> 00:03:32.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nNow, of course, I can bring up a keyboard.\n\n00:03:34.982 --> 00:03:37.280\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.703\nAnd I can bring that around,\nput that up there.\n\n00:03:43.171 --> 00:03:45.029\nObviously, this is a standard keyboard,\n\n00:03:45.053 --> 00:03:48.135\nbut of course I can rescale it\nto make it work well for my hands.\n\n00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:51.492\nThat's really important, because\nthere's no reason in this day and age\n\n00:03:51.516 --> 00:03:53.856\nthat we should be conforming\nto a physical device.\n\n00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.627\nThat leads to bad things, like RSI.\n\n00:03:55.651 --> 00:03:58.428\nWe have so much technology nowadays\n\n00:03:58.452 --> 00:04:02.481\nthat these interfaces\nshould start conforming to us.\n\n00:04:02.505 --> 00:04:06.482\nThere's so little applied now\nto actually improving\n\n00:04:06.506 --> 00:04:09.085\nthe way we interact with interfaces\nfrom this point on.\n\n00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.300\nThis keyboard is probably actually\nthe really wrong direction to go.\n\n00:04:12.324 --> 00:04:15.626\nYou can imagine, in the future,\nas we develop this kind of technology,\n\n00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.053\na keyboard that kind of automatically\ndrifts as your hand moves away,\n\n00:04:19.077 --> 00:04:22.592\nand really intelligently anticipates\nwhich key you're trying to stroke.\n\n00:04:23.435 --> 00:04:25.728\nSo -- again, isn't this great?\n\n00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:28.981\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:29.005 --> 00:04:30.768\nAudience: Where's your lab?\n\n00:04:30.792 --> 00:04:33.364\nJeff Han: I'm a research scientist\nat NYU in New York.\n\n00:04:37.299 --> 00:04:40.934\nHere's an example of another kind of app.\nI can make these little fuzz balls.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.292\nIt'll remember the strokes I'm making.\n\n00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:45.235\nOf course I can do it with all my hands.\n\n00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:46.550\nIt's pressure-sensitive.\n\n00:04:47.863 --> 00:04:49.419\nWhat's neat about that is,\n\n00:04:49.443 --> 00:04:52.408\nI showed that two-finger gesture\nthat zooms in really quickly.\n\n00:04:52.432 --> 00:04:54.639\nBecause you don't have\nto switch to a hand tool\n\n00:04:54.663 --> 00:04:56.069\nor the magnifying glass tool,\n\n00:04:56.093 --> 00:04:58.632\nyou can just continuously make things\n\n00:04:58.656 --> 00:05:01.010\nin real multiple scales,\nall at the same time.\n\n00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:03.047\nI can create big things out here,\n\n00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:05.169\nbut I can go back\nand really quickly go back\n\n00:05:05.193 --> 00:05:07.893\nto where I started,\nand make even smaller things here.\n\n00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.116\nThis is going to be really important\n\n00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.173\nas we start getting to things\nlike data visualization.\n\n00:05:14.197 --> 00:05:16.864\nFor instance, I think\nwe all enjoyed Hans Rosling's talk,\n\n00:05:16.888 --> 00:05:20.414\nand he really emphasized the fact\nI've been thinking about for a long time:\n\n00:05:20.438 --> 00:05:21.789\nWe have all this great data,\n\n00:05:21.813 --> 00:05:23.910\nbut for some reason,\nit's just sitting there.\n\n00:05:23.934 --> 00:05:25.053\nWe're not accessing it.\n\n00:05:25.077 --> 00:05:28.600\nAnd one of the reasons why I think that is\n\n00:05:28.624 --> 00:05:33.340\nwill be helped by things like graphics\nand visualization and inference tools,\n\n00:05:33.364 --> 00:05:35.225\nbut I also think a big part of it\n\n00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:37.305\nis going to be having better interfaces,\n\n00:05:37.329 --> 00:05:39.569\nto be able to drill down\ninto this kind of data,\n\n00:05:39.593 --> 00:05:41.931\nwhile still thinking\nabout the big picture here.\n\n00:05:42.418 --> 00:05:45.397\nLet me show you another app here.\nThis is called WorldWind.\n\n00:05:45.421 --> 00:05:46.560\nIt's done by NASA.\n\n00:05:46.584 --> 00:05:49.414\nWe've all seen Google Earth;\n\n00:05:49.438 --> 00:05:51.396\nthis is an open-source version of that.\n\n00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.944\nThere are plug-ins to be able\nto load in different data sets\n\n00:05:54.968 --> 00:05:56.767\nthat NASA's collected over the years.\n\n00:05:56.791 --> 00:05:59.411\nAs you can see, I can use\nthe same two-fingered gestures\n\n00:05:59.435 --> 00:06:01.917\nto go down and go in really seamlessly.\n\n00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:03.321\nThere's no interface, again.\n\n00:06:03.345 --> 00:06:06.616\nIt really allows anybody\nto kind of go in --\n\n00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.603\nand it just does\nwhat you'd expect, you know?\n\n00:06:09.627 --> 00:06:12.899\nAgain, there's just no interface here.\nThe interface just disappears.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.834\nI can switch to different data views.\n\n00:06:16.858 --> 00:06:19.052\nThat's what's neat about this app here.\n\n00:06:19.076 --> 00:06:20.233\nNASA's really cool.\n\n00:06:20.257 --> 00:06:23.019\nThese hyper-spectral images\nare false-colored so you can --\n\n00:06:23.043 --> 00:06:26.986\nit's really good for determining\nvegetative use.\n\n00:06:27.845 --> 00:06:29.431\nWell, let's go back to this.\n\n00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.444\nThe great thing\nabout mapping applications --\n\n00:06:34.468 --> 00:06:35.958\nit's not really 2D, it's 3D.\n\n00:06:35.982 --> 00:06:39.474\nSo, again, with a multi-point interface,\nyou can do a gesture like this --\n\n00:06:39.498 --> 00:06:42.935\nso you can be able\nto tilt around like that --\n\n00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:44.833\n(Surprised laughter)\n\n00:06:44.857 --> 00:06:48.039\nIt's not just simply relegated\nto a kind of 2D panning and motion.\n\n00:06:48.063 --> 00:06:50.698\nThis gesture is just putting\ntwo fingers down --\n\n00:06:50.722 --> 00:06:54.375\nit's defining an axis of tilt --\nand I can tilt up and down that way.\n\n00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:56.477\nWe just came up with that on the spot,\n\n00:06:56.501 --> 00:06:58.438\nit's probably not the right thing to do,\n\n00:06:58.462 --> 00:07:01.691\nbut there's such interesting things\nyou can do with this interface.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.892\nIt's just so much fun\nplaying around with it, too.\n\n00:07:05.916 --> 00:07:07.269\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:07.293 --> 00:07:09.934\nAnd so the last thing\nI want to show you is --\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.635\nI'm sure we can all think\nof a lot of entertainment apps\n\n00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:14.183\nthat you can do with this thing.\n\n00:07:14.207 --> 00:07:18.257\nI'm more interested in the creative\napplications we can do with this.\n\n00:07:18.281 --> 00:07:21.518\nNow, here's a simple application here --\nI can draw out a curve.\n\n00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:26.425\nAnd when I close it,\nit becomes a character.\n\n00:07:26.743 --> 00:07:29.720\nBut the neat thing about it\nis I can add control points.\n\n00:07:29.744 --> 00:07:33.721\nAnd then what I can do is manipulate them\nwith both of my fingers at the same time.\n\n00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:35.648\nAnd you notice what it does.\n\n00:07:36.211 --> 00:07:38.766\nIt's kind of a puppeteering thing,\n\n00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:44.008\nwhere I can use as many fingers\nas I have to draw and make --\n\n00:07:50.232 --> 00:07:52.934\nNow, there's a lot of actual math\ngoing on under here\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:57.400\nfor this to control this mesh\nand do the right thing.\n\n00:07:58.141 --> 00:08:03.833\nThis technique of being able to manipulate\na mesh here, with multiple control points,\n\n00:08:03.857 --> 00:08:05.333\nis actually state of the art.\n\n00:08:05.357 --> 00:08:07.181\nIt was released at SIGGRAPH last year.\n\n00:08:07.205 --> 00:08:09.975\nIt's a great example\nof the kind of research I really love:\n\n00:08:09.999 --> 00:08:12.798\nall this compute power\nto make things do the right things,\n\n00:08:12.822 --> 00:08:15.543\nintuitive things,\nto do exactly what you expect.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:23.616\nSo, multi-touch interaction research\nis a very active field right now in HCI.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:27.434\nI'm not the only one doing it,\na lot of other people are getting into it.\n\n00:08:27.458 --> 00:08:30.703\nThis kind of technology is going to let\neven more people get into it,\n\n00:08:30.727 --> 00:08:34.219\nI'm looking forward to interacting\nwith all of you over the next few days\n\n00:08:34.243 --> 00:08:36.780\nand seeing how it can apply\nto your respective fields.\n\n00:08:36.804 --> 00:08:37.962\nThank you.\n\n00:08:37.986 --> 00:08:40.555\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "One Laptop per Child", "duration": "1057", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/nicholas_negroponte_on_one_laptop_per_child", "transcript": "I've been at MIT for 44 years. I went to TED I. There's only one other person here, I think, who did that. All the other TEDs \u2014 and I went to them all, under Ricky's regime \u2014 I talked about what the Media Lab was doing, which today has almost 500 people in it.And if you read the press, last week it actually said I quit the Media Lab. I didn't quit the Media Lab, I stepped down as chairman \u2014 which was a kind of ridiculous title, but someone else has taken it on \u2014 and one of the things you can do as a professor is you stay on as a professor. And I will now do for the rest of my life the One Laptop Per Child, which I've sort of been doing for a year and a half, anyway. So I'm going to tell you about this, use my 18 minutes to tell you why we're doing it, how we're doing it and then what we're doing. And at some point I'll even pass around what the $100 laptop might be like.I was asked by Chris to talk about some of the big issues, and so I figured I'd start with the three that at least drove me to do this. And the first is pretty obvious. It's amazing when you meet a head of state, and you say, \"What is your most precious natural resource?\" They will not say \"children\" at first, and then when you say, \"children,\" they will pretty quickly agree with you. And so that isn't very hard.(Laughter)Everybody agrees that whatever the solutions are to the big problems, they include education, sometimes can be just education and can never be without some element of education. So that's certainly part of it.And the third is a little bit less obvious. And that is that we all in this room learned how to walk, how to talk, not by being taught how to talk, or taught how to walk, but by interacting with the world, by having certain results as a consequence of being able to ask for something, or being able to stand up and reach it. Whereas at about the age six, we were told to stop learning that way, and that all learning from then on would happen through teaching, whether it's people standing up, like I'm doing now, or a book, or something. But it was really through teaching. And one of the things in general that computers have provided to learning is that it now includes a kind of learning which is a little bit more like walking and talking, in the sense that a lot of it is driven by the learner himself or herself.So with those as the principles \u2014 some of you may know Seymour Papert. This is back in 1982, when we were working in Senegal. Because some people think that the $100 laptop just happened a year ago, or two years ago, or we were struck by lightning \u2014 this actually has gone back a long time, and in fact, back to the '60s. Here we're in the '80s. Steve Jobs had given us some laptops. We were in Senegal. It didn't scale but it at least was bringing computers to developing countries and learning pretty quickly that these kids, even though English wasn't their language, the Latin alphabet barely was their language, but they could just swim like fish. They could play these like pianos.A little bit more recently, I got involved personally. And these are two anecdotes \u2014 one was in Cambodia, in a village that has no electricity, no water, no television, no telephone, but has broadband Internet now. And these kids, their first English word is \"Google\" and they only know Skype. They've never heard of telephony. They just use Skype. And they go home at night \u2014 they've got a broadband connection in a hut that doesn't have electricity. The parents love it, because when they open up the laptops, it's the brightest light source in the house. And talk about where metaphors and reality mix \u2014 this is the actual school.In parallel with this, Seymour Papert got the governor of Maine to legislate one laptop per child in the year 2002. Now at the time, I think it's fair to say that 80 percent of the teachers were \u2014 let me say, apprehensive. Really, they were actually against it. And they really preferred that the money would be used for higher salaries, more schools, whatever.And now, three and a half years later, guess what? They're reporting five things: drop of truancy to almost zero, attending parent-teacher meetings \u2014 which nobody did and now almost everybody does \u2014 drop in discipline problems, increase in student participation. Teachers are now saying it's kind of fun to teach. Kids are engaged \u2014 they have laptops! \u2014 and then the fifth, which interests me the most, is that the servers have to be turned off at certain times at night because the teachers are getting too much email from the kids asking them for help. So when you see that kind of thing \u2014 this is not something that you have to test. The days of pilot projects are over, when people say, \"We'd like to do three or four thousand in our country to see how it works.\" Screw you. Go to the back of the line and someone else will do it, and then when you figure out that this works, you can join as well. And this is what we're doing.(Laughter) (Applause)So, One Laptop Per Child was formed about a year and a half ago. It's a nonprofit association. It raised about 20 million dollars to do the engineering to just get this built, and then have it produced afterwards. Scale is truly important. And it's not important because you can buy components at a lower price, OK? It's because you can go to a manufacturer \u2014 and I will leave the name out \u2014 but we wanted a small display, doesn't have to have perfect color uniformity. It can even have a pixel or two missing. It doesn't have to be that bright. And this particular manufacturer said, \"We're not interested in that. We're interested in the living room. We're interested in perfect color uniformity. We're interested in big displays, bright displays. You're not part of our strategic plan.\" And I said, \"That's kind of too bad, because we need 100 million units a year.\"(Laughter)And they said, \"Oh, well, maybe we could become part of your strategic plan.\" And that's why scale counts. And that's why we will not launch this without five to 10 million units in the first run. And the idea is to launch with enough scale that the scale itself helps bring the price down, and that's why I said seven to 10 million there. And we're doing it without a sales-and-marketing team. I mean, you're looking at the sales-and-marketing team. We will do it by going to seven large countries and getting them to agree and launch it, and then the others can follow. We have partners. It's not hard to guess Google would be one. The others are all playing to pending. And this has been in the press a great deal. It's the so-called Green Machine that we introduced with Kofi Annan in November at the World Summit that was held in Tunisia.Now once people start looking at this, they say, \"Ah, this is a laptop project.\" Well, no, it's not a laptop project. It's an education project. And the fun part \u2014 and I'm quite focused on it \u2014 I tell people I used to be a light bulb, but now I'm a laser \u2014 I'm just going to get that thing built, and it turns out it's not so hard. Because laptop economics are the following: I say 50 percent here \u2014 it's more like 60, 60 percent of the cost of your laptop is sales, marketing, distribution and profit. Now we have none of those, OK? None of those figure into our cost, because first of all, we sell it at cost, and the governments distribute it. It gets distributed to the school system like a textbook. So that piece disappears. Then you have display and everything else. Now the display on your laptop costs, in rough numbers, 10 dollars a diagonal inch. That can drop to eight; it can drop to seven but it's not going to drop to two, or to one and a half, unless we do some pretty clever things. It's the rest \u2014 that little brown box \u2014 that is pretty fascinating, because the rest of your laptop is devoted to itself. It's a little bit like an obese person having to use most of their energy to move their obesity.(Laughter)And we have a situation today which is incredible. I've been using laptops since their inception. And my laptop runs slower, less reliably and less pleasantly than it ever has before. And this year is worse.(Applause)People clap, sometimes you even get standing ovations, and I say, \"What the hell's wrong with you? Why are we all sitting there?\" And somebody \u2014 to remain nameless \u2014 called our laptop a \"gadget\" recently. And I said, \"God, our laptop's going to go like a bat out of hell. When you open it up, it's going to go 'bing.'\" It'll be on. It'll be just like it was in 1985, when you bought an Apple Macintosh 512. It worked really well. And we've been going steadily downhill.Now, people ask all the time what it is. That's what it is. The two pieces that are probably notable: it'll be a mesh network, so when the kids open up their laptops, they all become a network, and then just need one or two points of backhaul. You can serve a couple of thousand kids with two megabits. So you really can bring into a village, and then the villages can connect themselves, and you really can do it quite well.The dual mode display \u2014 the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors \u2014 isn't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight? Well, you can't see it. And one of the reasons you can't see it is because it's backlighting most of the time, most cell phones. Now, what we're doing is, we're doing one that will be both frontlit and backlit. And whether you manually switch it or you do it in the software is to be seen. But when it's backlit, it's color. And when it's frontlit, it's black and white at three times the resolution.Is it all worked out? No. That's why a lot of our people are more or less living in Taiwan right now. And in about 30 days, we'll know for sure whether this works. Probably the most important piece there is that the kids really can do the maintenance. And this is again something that people don't believe, but I really think it's quite true. That's the machine we showed in Tunis. This is more the direction that we're going to go. And it's something that we didn't think was possible. Now, I'm going to pass this around. This isn't a design, OK? So this is just a mechanical engineering sort of embodiment of it for you to play with. And it's clearly just a model. The working one is at MIT. I'm going to pass it to this handsome gentleman. At least you can decide whether it goes left or \u2014Chris Anderson: Before you do it, for the people down in simulcast \u2014Nicholas Negroponte: Sorry! I forgot. CA: Just show it off a bit.So wherever the camera is \u2014 OK, good point. Thank you, Chris.The idea was that it would be not only a laptop, but that it could transform into an electronic book. So it's sort of an electronic book. This is where when you go outside, it's in black and white. The games buttons are missing, but it'll also be a games machine, book machine. Set it up this way, and it's a television set. Etc., etc. \u2014 is that enough for simulcast? OK, sorry. I'll let Jim decide which way to send it afterwards. OK. Seven countries.(Laughter)I say \"maybe\" for Massachusetts, because they actually have to do a bid. By law you've got to bid, and so on and so forth. So I can't quite name them. In the other cases, they don't have to do bids. They can decide \u2014 it's the federal government in each case. It's kind of agonizing, because a lot of people say, \"Let's do it at the state level,\" because states are more nimble than the feds, just because of size. And yet we count. We're really dealing with the federal government. We're really dealing with ministries of education. And if you look at governments around the world, ministries of education tend to be the most conservative, and also the ones that have huge payrolls. Everybody thinks they know about education, a lot of culture is built into it as well. It's really hard. And so it's certainly the hard road. If you look at the countries, they're pretty geoculturally distributed.Have they all agreed? No, not completely. Probably Thailand, Brazil and Nigeria are the three that are the most active and most agreed. We're purposely not signing anything with anybody until we actually have the working ones. And since I visit each one of those countries within at least every three months, I'm just going around the world every three weeks. Here's sort of the schedule and I put at the bottom we might give some away free in two years at this meeting. Everybody says it's a $100 laptop \u2014 you can't do it. Well, guess what, we're not. We're coming in probably at 135, to start, then drift down. And that's very important, because so many things hit the market at a price and then drift up. It's kind of the loss leader, and then as soon as it looks interesting, it can't be afforded, or it can't be scaled out. So we're targeting 50 dollars in 2010.The gray market's a big issue. And one of the ways \u2014 just one \u2014 but one of the ways to help in the case of the gray market is to make something that is so utterly unique \u2014 It's a little bit like the fact that automobiles \u2014 thousands of automobiles are stolen every day in the United States. Not one single post-office truck is stolen.(Laughter)And why? Because there's no market for post-office trucks. It looks like a post-office truck. You can spray paint it. You can do anything you want. I just learned recently: in South Africa, no white Volvos are stolen. Period. None. Zero. So we want to make it very much like a white Volvo.Each government has a task force. This perhaps is less interesting, but we're trying to get the governments to all work together and it's not easy. The economics of this is to start with the federal governments and then later, to subsequently go to other \u2014 whether it's child-to-child funding, so a child in this country buys one for a child in the developing world, maybe of the same gender, maybe of the same age. An uncle gives a niece or a nephew that as a birthday present. I mean, there are all sorts of things that will happen, and they'll be very, very exciting.And everybody says \u2014 I say \u2014 it's an education project. Are we providing the software? The answer is: The system certainly has software, but no, we're not providing the education content. That is really done in the countries. But we are certainly constructionists. And we certainly believe in learning by doing and everything from Logo, which was started in 1968, to more modern things, like Scratch, if you've ever even heard of it, are very, very much part of it. And that's the rollout.Are we dreaming? Is this real? It actually is real. The only criticism, and people really don't want to criticize this, because it is a humanitarian effort, a nonprofit effort and to criticize it is a little bit stupid, actually.(Laughter)But the one thing that people could criticize was, \"Great idea, but these guys can't do it.\" And that could either mean these guys, professors and so on couldn't do it, or that it's not possible. Well, on December 12, a company called Quanta agreed to build it, and since they make about one-third of all the laptops on the planet today, that question disappeared. So it's not a matter of whether it's going to happen. It is going to happen. And if it comes out at 138 dollars, so what? If it comes out six months late, so what? That's a pretty soft landing.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 41, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.854\nI've been at MIT for 44 years.\n\n00:00:14.878 --> 00:00:16.814\nI went to TED I.\n\n00:00:16.838 --> 00:00:19.694\nThere's only one other person here,\nI think, who did that.\n\n00:00:19.718 --> 00:00:20.934\nAll the other TEDs --\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:23.214\nand I went to them all,\nunder Ricky's regime --\n\n00:00:23.238 --> 00:00:25.774\nI talked about\nwhat the Media Lab was doing,\n\n00:00:25.798 --> 00:00:28.814\nwhich today has almost 500 people in it.\n\n00:00:28.838 --> 00:00:30.254\nAnd if you read the press,\n\n00:00:30.278 --> 00:00:32.934\nlast week it actually said\nI quit the Media Lab.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:37.134\nI didn't quit the Media Lab,\nI stepped down as chairman --\n\n00:00:37.158 --> 00:00:41.854\nwhich was a kind of ridiculous title,\nbut someone else has taken it on --\n\n00:00:41.878 --> 00:00:44.069\nand one of the things\nyou can do as a professor\n\n00:00:44.093 --> 00:00:45.934\nis you stay on as a professor.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:50.214\nAnd I will now do for the rest of my life\nthe One Laptop Per Child,\n\n00:00:50.238 --> 00:00:53.254\nwhich I've sort of been doing\nfor a year and a half, anyway.\n\n00:00:53.278 --> 00:00:55.014\nSo I'm going to tell you about this,\n\n00:00:55.038 --> 00:00:59.134\nuse my 18 minutes\nto tell you why we're doing it,\n\n00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:01.334\nhow we're doing it\nand then what we're doing.\n\n00:01:01.358 --> 00:01:04.654\nAnd at some point I'll even pass around\n\n00:01:04.678 --> 00:01:08.598\nwhat the $100 laptop might be like.\n\n00:01:10.758 --> 00:01:13.614\nI was asked by Chris\nto talk about some of the big issues,\n\n00:01:13.638 --> 00:01:18.894\nand so I figured I'd start with the three\nthat at least drove me to do this.\n\n00:01:18.918 --> 00:01:21.734\nAnd the first is pretty obvious.\n\n00:01:21.758 --> 00:01:24.414\nIt's amazing when you meet\na head of state, and you say,\n\n00:01:24.438 --> 00:01:27.174\n\"What is your most precious\nnatural resource?\"\n\n00:01:27.198 --> 00:01:29.894\nThey will not say \"children\" at first,\n\n00:01:29.918 --> 00:01:34.173\nand then when you say, \"children,\"\nthey will pretty quickly agree with you.\n\n00:01:34.197 --> 00:01:36.214\nAnd so that isn't very hard.\n\n00:01:36.238 --> 00:01:38.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:44.014\nEverybody agrees that whatever\nthe solutions are to the big problems,\n\n00:01:44.038 --> 00:01:48.774\nthey include education,\nsometimes can be just education\n\n00:01:48.798 --> 00:01:52.094\nand can never be without\nsome element of education.\n\n00:01:52.118 --> 00:01:53.934\nSo that's certainly part of it.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.334\nAnd the third\nis a little bit less obvious.\n\n00:01:56.358 --> 00:02:01.094\nAnd that is that we all in this room\nlearned how to walk, how to talk,\n\n00:02:01.118 --> 00:02:05.614\nnot by being taught how to talk,\nor taught how to walk,\n\n00:02:05.638 --> 00:02:07.334\nbut by interacting with the world,\n\n00:02:07.358 --> 00:02:11.494\nby having certain results as a consequence\nof being able to ask for something,\n\n00:02:11.518 --> 00:02:13.654\nor being able to stand up and reach it.\n\n00:02:13.678 --> 00:02:17.934\nWhereas at about the age six,\nwe were told to stop learning that way,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:21.294\nand that all learning from then on\nwould happen through teaching,\n\n00:02:21.318 --> 00:02:23.747\nwhether it's people standing up,\nlike I'm doing now,\n\n00:02:23.771 --> 00:02:25.494\nor a book, or something.\n\n00:02:25.518 --> 00:02:27.454\nBut it was really through teaching.\n\n00:02:27.478 --> 00:02:32.654\nAnd one of the things in general\nthat computers have provided to learning\n\n00:02:32.678 --> 00:02:35.814\nis that it now includes a kind of learning\n\n00:02:35.838 --> 00:02:38.934\nwhich is a little bit more\nlike walking and talking,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:45.574\nin the sense that a lot of it is driven\nby the learner himself or herself.\n\n00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:48.334\nSo with those as the principles --\n\n00:02:48.358 --> 00:02:50.374\nsome of you may know Seymour Papert.\n\n00:02:50.398 --> 00:02:53.934\nThis is back in 1982,\nwhen we were working in Senegal.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:59.203\nBecause some people think that\nthe $100 laptop just happened a year ago,\n\n00:02:59.227 --> 00:03:02.414\nor two years ago,\nor we were struck by lightning --\n\n00:03:02.438 --> 00:03:07.494\nthis actually has gone back a long time,\nand in fact, back to the '60s.\n\n00:03:07.518 --> 00:03:09.054\nHere we're in the '80s.\n\n00:03:09.078 --> 00:03:13.334\nSteve Jobs had given us some laptops.\nWe were in Senegal.\n\n00:03:13.358 --> 00:03:14.614\nIt didn't scale\n\n00:03:14.638 --> 00:03:19.734\nbut it at least was bringing computers\nto developing countries\n\n00:03:19.758 --> 00:03:22.214\nand learning pretty quickly\nthat these kids,\n\n00:03:22.238 --> 00:03:24.238\neven though English wasn't their language,\n\n00:03:24.262 --> 00:03:27.494\nthe Latin alphabet\nbarely was their language,\n\n00:03:27.518 --> 00:03:29.854\nbut they could just swim like fish.\n\n00:03:29.878 --> 00:03:31.638\nThey could play these like pianos.\n\n00:03:33.318 --> 00:03:37.534\nA little bit more recently,\nI got involved personally.\n\n00:03:37.558 --> 00:03:39.294\nAnd these are two anecdotes --\n\n00:03:39.318 --> 00:03:41.934\none was in Cambodia,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:46.374\nin a village that has no electricity,\nno water, no television, no telephone,\n\n00:03:46.398 --> 00:03:48.534\nbut has broadband Internet now.\n\n00:03:48.558 --> 00:03:52.054\nAnd these kids,\ntheir first English word is \"Google\"\n\n00:03:52.078 --> 00:03:54.414\nand they only know Skype.\n\n00:03:54.438 --> 00:03:56.054\nThey've never heard of telephony.\n\n00:03:56.078 --> 00:03:58.214\nThey just use Skype.\n\n00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:00.094\nAnd they go home at night --\n\n00:04:00.118 --> 00:04:03.934\nthey've got a broadband connection\nin a hut that doesn't have electricity.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.720\nThe parents love it,\nbecause when they open up the laptops,\n\n00:04:06.744 --> 00:04:08.934\nit's the brightest light source\nin the house.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:12.334\nAnd talk about\nwhere metaphors and reality mix --\n\n00:04:12.358 --> 00:04:14.958\nthis is the actual school.\n\n00:04:15.518 --> 00:04:20.614\nIn parallel with this,\nSeymour Papert got the governor of Maine\n\n00:04:20.638 --> 00:04:26.134\nto legislate one laptop per child\nin the year 2002.\n\n00:04:26.158 --> 00:04:31.254\nNow at the time, I think it's fair to say\nthat 80 percent of the teachers were --\n\n00:04:31.278 --> 00:04:32.854\nlet me say, apprehensive.\n\n00:04:32.878 --> 00:04:34.694\nReally, they were actually against it.\n\n00:04:34.718 --> 00:04:37.242\nAnd they really preferred\nthat the money would be used\n\n00:04:37.266 --> 00:04:39.654\nfor higher salaries,\nmore schools, whatever.\n\n00:04:39.678 --> 00:04:43.934\nAnd now, three and a half\nyears later, guess what?\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:50.174\nThey're reporting five things:\ndrop of truancy to almost zero,\n\n00:04:50.198 --> 00:04:52.123\nattending parent-teacher meetings --\n\n00:04:52.147 --> 00:04:54.654\nwhich nobody did\nand now almost everybody does --\n\n00:04:54.678 --> 00:04:58.574\ndrop in discipline problems,\nincrease in student participation.\n\n00:04:58.598 --> 00:05:01.014\nTeachers are now saying\nit's kind of fun to teach.\n\n00:05:01.038 --> 00:05:04.174\nKids are engaged -- they have laptops! --\n\n00:05:04.198 --> 00:05:06.654\nand then the fifth,\nwhich interests me the most,\n\n00:05:06.678 --> 00:05:09.894\nis that the servers have to be turned off\nat certain times at night\n\n00:05:09.918 --> 00:05:12.334\nbecause the teachers\nare getting too much email\n\n00:05:12.358 --> 00:05:14.334\nfrom the kids asking them for help.\n\n00:05:14.358 --> 00:05:16.134\nSo when you see that kind of thing --\n\n00:05:16.158 --> 00:05:18.206\nthis is not something\nthat you have to test.\n\n00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.934\nThe days of pilot projects are over,\nwhen people say,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:25.014\n\"We'd like to do three or four thousand\nin our country to see how it works.\"\n\n00:05:25.038 --> 00:05:28.134\nScrew you. Go to the back of the line\nand someone else will do it,\n\n00:05:28.158 --> 00:05:32.694\nand then when you figure out\nthat this works, you can join as well.\n\n00:05:32.718 --> 00:05:35.294\nAnd this is what we're doing.\n\n00:05:35.318 --> 00:05:37.454\n(Laughter) (Applause)\n\n00:05:37.478 --> 00:05:42.454\nSo, One Laptop Per Child\nwas formed about a year and a half ago.\n\n00:05:42.478 --> 00:05:44.374\nIt's a nonprofit association.\n\n00:05:44.398 --> 00:05:46.334\nIt raised about 20 million dollars\n\n00:05:46.358 --> 00:05:50.174\nto do the engineering\nto just get this built,\n\n00:05:50.198 --> 00:05:52.854\nand then have it produced afterwards.\n\n00:05:52.878 --> 00:05:55.134\nScale is truly important.\n\n00:05:55.158 --> 00:06:01.454\nAnd it's not important because you can\nbuy components at a lower price, OK?\n\n00:06:01.478 --> 00:06:04.354\nIt's because you can go\nto a manufacturer --\n\n00:06:04.378 --> 00:06:06.020\nand I will leave the name out --\n\n00:06:06.044 --> 00:06:09.574\nbut we wanted a small display,\n\n00:06:09.598 --> 00:06:13.374\ndoesn't have to have\nperfect color uniformity.\n\n00:06:13.398 --> 00:06:15.760\nIt can even have a pixel or two missing.\n\n00:06:15.784 --> 00:06:18.334\nIt doesn't have to be that bright.\n\n00:06:18.358 --> 00:06:20.654\nAnd this particular manufacturer said,\n\n00:06:20.678 --> 00:06:23.821\n\"We're not interested in that.\nWe're interested in the living room.\n\n00:06:23.845 --> 00:06:26.014\nWe're interested\nin perfect color uniformity.\n\n00:06:26.038 --> 00:06:28.374\nWe're interested in big displays,\nbright displays.\n\n00:06:28.398 --> 00:06:31.174\nYou're not part of our strategic plan.\"\n\n00:06:31.198 --> 00:06:34.913\nAnd I said, \"That's kind of too bad,\nbecause we need 100 million units a year.\"\n\n00:06:34.937 --> 00:06:36.508\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:36.532 --> 00:06:40.494\nAnd they said, \"Oh, well, maybe we could\nbecome part of your strategic plan.\"\n\n00:06:40.518 --> 00:06:42.934\nAnd that's why scale counts.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.214\nAnd that's why we will not launch this\n\n00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:49.134\nwithout five to 10 million units\nin the first run.\n\n00:06:49.158 --> 00:06:52.134\nAnd the idea is\nto launch with enough scale\n\n00:06:52.158 --> 00:06:54.734\nthat the scale itself\nhelps bring the price down,\n\n00:06:54.758 --> 00:06:58.654\nand that's why I said\nseven to 10 million there.\n\n00:06:58.678 --> 00:07:02.094\nAnd we're doing it\nwithout a sales-and-marketing team.\n\n00:07:02.118 --> 00:07:04.694\nI mean, you're looking\nat the sales-and-marketing team.\n\n00:07:04.718 --> 00:07:08.734\nWe will do it by going\nto seven large countries\n\n00:07:08.758 --> 00:07:11.282\nand getting them to agree and launch it,\n\n00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:13.614\nand then the others can follow.\n\n00:07:13.638 --> 00:07:15.494\nWe have partners.\n\n00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.518\nIt's not hard to guess\nGoogle would be one.\n\n00:07:17.542 --> 00:07:21.174\nThe others are all playing to pending.\n\n00:07:21.198 --> 00:07:24.054\nAnd this has been\nin the press a great deal.\n\n00:07:24.078 --> 00:07:29.974\nIt's the so-called Green Machine\nthat we introduced with Kofi Annan\n\n00:07:29.998 --> 00:07:34.294\nin November at the World Summit\nthat was held in Tunisia.\n\n00:07:34.318 --> 00:07:39.934\nNow once people start looking at this,\nthey say, \"Ah, this is a laptop project.\"\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:43.254\nWell, no, it's not a laptop project.\nIt's an education project.\n\n00:07:43.278 --> 00:07:46.934\nAnd the fun part --\nand I'm quite focused on it --\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:51.054\nI tell people I used to be a light bulb,\nbut now I'm a laser --\n\n00:07:51.078 --> 00:07:57.174\nI'm just going to get that thing built,\nand it turns out it's not so hard.\n\n00:07:57.198 --> 00:08:00.414\nBecause laptop economics\nare the following:\n\n00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:02.934\nI say 50 percent here --\nit's more like 60,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.014\n60 percent of the cost of your laptop\n\n00:08:05.038 --> 00:08:07.894\nis sales, marketing,\ndistribution and profit.\n\n00:08:07.918 --> 00:08:10.254\nNow we have none of those, OK?\n\n00:08:10.278 --> 00:08:13.214\nNone of those figure into our cost,\n\n00:08:13.238 --> 00:08:17.454\nbecause first of all, we sell it at cost,\nand the governments distribute it.\n\n00:08:17.478 --> 00:08:21.734\nIt gets distributed\nto the school system like a textbook.\n\n00:08:21.758 --> 00:08:23.894\nSo that piece disappears.\n\n00:08:23.918 --> 00:08:26.734\nThen you have display and everything else.\n\n00:08:26.758 --> 00:08:29.614\nNow the display on your laptop costs,\n\n00:08:29.638 --> 00:08:34.774\nin rough numbers,\n10 dollars a diagonal inch.\n\n00:08:34.798 --> 00:08:36.934\nThat can drop to eight;\nit can drop to seven\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.934\nbut it's not going to drop to two,\nor to one and a half,\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.718\nunless we do some pretty clever things.\n\n00:08:44.038 --> 00:08:48.214\nIt's the rest -- that little brown box --\nthat is pretty fascinating,\n\n00:08:48.238 --> 00:08:53.654\nbecause the rest of your laptop\nis devoted to itself.\n\n00:08:53.678 --> 00:08:56.294\nIt's a little bit like an obese person\n\n00:08:56.318 --> 00:08:59.454\nhaving to use most of their energy\nto move their obesity.\n\n00:08:59.478 --> 00:09:00.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:06.734\nAnd we have a situation today\nwhich is incredible.\n\n00:09:06.758 --> 00:09:09.734\nI've been using laptops\nsince their inception.\n\n00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:15.094\nAnd my laptop runs slower,\nless reliably and less pleasantly\n\n00:09:15.118 --> 00:09:17.654\nthan it ever has before.\n\n00:09:17.678 --> 00:09:19.174\nAnd this year is worse.\n\n00:09:19.198 --> 00:09:20.574\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:20.598 --> 00:09:23.894\nPeople clap, sometimes\nyou even get standing ovations,\n\n00:09:23.918 --> 00:09:27.614\nand I say, \"What the hell's wrong\nwith you? Why are we all sitting there?\"\n\n00:09:27.638 --> 00:09:33.974\nAnd somebody -- to remain nameless --\ncalled our laptop a \"gadget\" recently.\n\n00:09:33.998 --> 00:09:37.614\nAnd I said, \"God, our laptop's going to go\nlike a bat out of hell.\n\n00:09:37.638 --> 00:09:39.834\nWhen you open it up,\nit's going to go 'bing.'\"\n\n00:09:39.858 --> 00:09:41.134\nIt'll be on.\n\n00:09:41.158 --> 00:09:44.934\nIt'll be just like it was in 1985,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:49.654\nwhen you bought an Apple Macintosh 512.\n\n00:09:49.678 --> 00:09:51.414\nIt worked really well.\n\n00:09:51.438 --> 00:09:54.534\nAnd we've been going steadily downhill.\n\n00:09:54.558 --> 00:09:58.494\nNow, people ask all the time what it is.\n\n00:09:58.518 --> 00:10:00.574\nThat's what it is.\n\n00:10:00.598 --> 00:10:05.894\nThe two pieces that are probably notable:\nit'll be a mesh network,\n\n00:10:05.918 --> 00:10:09.534\nso when the kids open up their laptops,\nthey all become a network,\n\n00:10:09.558 --> 00:10:12.374\nand then just need\none or two points of backhaul.\n\n00:10:12.398 --> 00:10:15.574\nYou can serve a couple of thousand kids\nwith two megabits.\n\n00:10:15.598 --> 00:10:18.654\nSo you really can bring into a village,\n\n00:10:18.678 --> 00:10:20.974\nand then the villages\ncan connect themselves,\n\n00:10:20.998 --> 00:10:24.054\nand you really can do it quite well.\n\n00:10:24.078 --> 00:10:26.054\nThe dual mode display --\n\n00:10:26.078 --> 00:10:30.774\nthe idea is to have a display\nthat both works outdoors --\n\n00:10:30.798 --> 00:10:34.214\nisn't it fun using your cell phone\noutdoors in the sunlight?\n\n00:10:34.238 --> 00:10:35.774\nWell, you can't see it.\n\n00:10:35.798 --> 00:10:37.974\nAnd one of the reasons you can't see it\n\n00:10:37.998 --> 00:10:42.054\nis because it's backlighting\nmost of the time, most cell phones.\n\n00:10:42.078 --> 00:10:46.734\nNow, what we're doing is, we're doing one\nthat will be both frontlit and backlit.\n\n00:10:46.758 --> 00:10:50.534\nAnd whether you manually switch it\nor you do it in the software\n\n00:10:50.558 --> 00:10:52.054\nis to be seen.\n\n00:10:52.078 --> 00:10:53.934\nBut when it's backlit, it's color.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.014\nAnd when it's frontlit,\nit's black and white\n\n00:10:56.038 --> 00:10:58.014\nat three times the resolution.\n\n00:10:58.038 --> 00:11:00.494\nIs it all worked out? No.\n\n00:11:00.518 --> 00:11:05.774\nThat's why a lot of our people are\nmore or less living in Taiwan right now.\n\n00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:10.014\nAnd in about 30 days,\nwe'll know for sure whether this works.\n\n00:11:10.038 --> 00:11:14.254\nProbably the most important piece there\n\n00:11:14.278 --> 00:11:17.414\nis that the kids\nreally can do the maintenance.\n\n00:11:17.438 --> 00:11:20.574\nAnd this is again something\nthat people don't believe,\n\n00:11:20.598 --> 00:11:22.265\nbut I really think it's quite true.\n\n00:11:23.838 --> 00:11:28.734\nThat's the machine we showed in Tunis.\n\n00:11:28.758 --> 00:11:31.534\nThis is more the direction\nthat we're going to go.\n\n00:11:31.558 --> 00:11:34.894\nAnd it's something\nthat we didn't think was possible.\n\n00:11:34.918 --> 00:11:38.254\nNow, I'm going to pass this around.\n\n00:11:38.278 --> 00:11:40.454\nThis isn't a design, OK?\n\n00:11:40.478 --> 00:11:45.174\nSo this is just a mechanical\nengineering sort of embodiment of it\n\n00:11:45.198 --> 00:11:46.734\nfor you to play with.\n\n00:11:46.758 --> 00:11:48.614\nAnd it's clearly just a model.\n\n00:11:48.638 --> 00:11:51.334\nThe working one is at MIT.\n\n00:11:51.358 --> 00:11:54.214\nI'm going to pass it\nto this handsome gentleman.\n\n00:11:54.238 --> 00:11:56.694\nAt least you can decide\nwhether it goes left or --\n\n00:11:56.718 --> 00:12:00.018\nChris Anderson: Before you do it,\nfor the people down in simulcast --\n\n00:12:00.042 --> 00:12:03.104\nNicholas Negroponte: Sorry! I forgot.\nCA: Just show it off a bit.\n\n00:12:03.128 --> 00:12:06.134\nSo wherever the camera is --\nOK, good point. Thank you, Chris.\n\n00:12:06.158 --> 00:12:09.734\nThe idea was that\nit would be not only a laptop,\n\n00:12:09.758 --> 00:12:13.334\nbut that it could transform\ninto an electronic book.\n\n00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:15.025\nSo it's sort of an electronic book.\n\n00:12:15.049 --> 00:12:17.811\nThis is where when you go outside,\nit's in black and white.\n\n00:12:17.835 --> 00:12:19.614\nThe games buttons are missing,\n\n00:12:19.638 --> 00:12:21.933\nbut it'll also be a games machine,\n\n00:12:21.957 --> 00:12:23.294\nbook machine.\n\n00:12:23.318 --> 00:12:25.814\nSet it up this way,\nand it's a television set.\n\n00:12:25.838 --> 00:12:29.958\nEtc., etc. -- is that enough\nfor simulcast?

I'm Sirena. I'm 11 years old and from Connecticut. (Audience cheers)(Applause)Well, I'm not really sure why I'm here.(Laughter)I mean, what does this have to do with technology, entertainment and design? Well, I count my iPod, cellphone and computer as technology, but this has nothing to do with that.So I did a little research on it. Well, this is what I found. Of course, I hope I can memorize it.(Clears throat)The violin is made of a wood box and four metal strings. By pulling a string, it vibrates and produces a sound wave, which passes through a piece of wood called a bridge, and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified, but ... let me think.(Laughter)Placing your finger at different places on the fingerboard changes the string length, and that changes the frequency of the sound wave. (Sighs) Oh, my gosh!(Laughter)OK, this is sort of technology, but I can call it a 16th-century technology. But actually, the most fascinating thing that I found was that even the audio system or wave transmission nowadays are still based on the same principle of producing and projecting sound. Isn't that cool?(Laughter)(Applause)Design \u2014 I love its design. I remember when I was little, my mom asked me, \"Would you like to play the violin or the piano?\" I looked at that giant monster and said to myself \u2014 \"I am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day!\"(Laughter)This is small and lightweight. I can play from standing, sitting or walking. And, you know what? The best of all is that if I don't want to practice, (Whispering) I can hide it.(Laughter)The violin is very beautiful. Some people relate it as the shape of a lady. But whether you like it or not, it's been so for more than 400 years, unlike modern stuff [that] easily looks dated. But I think it's very personal and unique that, although each violin looks pretty similar, no two violins sound the same \u2014 even from the same maker or based on the same model.Entertainment \u2014 I love the entertainment. But actually, the instrument itself isn't very entertaining. I mean, when I first got my violin and tried to play around on it, it was actually really bad, because it didn't sound the way I'd heard from other kids \u2014 it was so horrible and so scratchy. So, it wasn't entertaining at all. But besides, my brother found this very funny: Yuk! Yuk! Yuk!(Laughter)A few years later, I heard a joke about the greatest violinist, Jascha Heifetz. After Mr. Heifetz's concert, a lady came over and complimented him: \"Oh, Mr. Heifetz, your violin sounded so great tonight!\" And Mr. Heifetz was a very cool person, so he picked up his violin and said, \"Funny \u2014 I don't hear anything.\"(Laughter)Now I realize that as the musician, we human beings, with our great mind, artistic heart and skill, can change this 16th-century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment. Now I know why I'm here.(Music)(Music ends)(Applause)At first, I thought I was just going to be here to perform, but unexpectedly, I learned and enjoyed much more. But ... although some of the talks were quite up there for me.(Laughter)Like the multi-dimension stuff. I mean, honestly, I'd be happy enough if I could actually get my two dimensions correct in school.(Laughter)But actually, the most impressive thing to me is that \u2014 well, actually, I would also like to say this for all children is to say thank you to all adults, for actually caring for us a lot, and to make our future world much better.

Like the speaker before me \u2014 I am a TED virgin, I guess. I'm also the first time here, and ...(Laughter)I don't know what to say!(Applause)I'm really happy that Mr. Anderson invited me. I'm really grateful that I get a chance to play for everyone. And the song that I just played was by Josef Hofmann. It's called \"Kaleidoscope.\" And Hofmann is a Polish pianist and composer of the late 19th century, and he's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time.I have another piece that I'd like to play for you. It's called \"Abegg Variations,\" by Robert Schumann, a German 19th-century composer. The name \"Abegg\" is actually A-B-E-G-G, and that's the main theme in the melody. (Plays the notes A, B, E, G and G) That comes from the last name of one of Schumann's female friends.(Laughter)But he wrote that for his wife.(Laughter)So actually, if you listen carefully, there are supposed to be five variations on this Abegg theme. It's written around 1834, so even though it's old, I hope you'll like it.(Music)(Music ends)(Applause)Now comes the part that I hate. Well, because Mr. Anderson told me that this session is called \"Sync and Flow,\" I was wondering, \"What do I know that these geniuses don't?\"(Laughter)So, I'll talk about musical composition, even though I don't know where to start.How do I compose? I think Yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose. What I do first is, I make a lot of little musical ideas you can just improvise here at the piano \u2014 and I choose one of those to become my main theme, my main melody, like the Abegg that you just heard. And once I choose my main theme, I have to decide: Out of all the styles in music, what kind of style do I want? And this year, I composed a Romantic style. So for inspiration, I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky and all the great Romantic composers.Next, I make the structure of the entire piece with my teachers. They help me plan out the whole piece. And then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas, because then you have to think.(Laughter)And then, when the piece takes somewhat of a solified form \u2014 solidified, excuse me \u2014 solidified form, you're supposed to actually polish the piece, polish the details, and then polish the overall performance of the composition.And another thing that I enjoy doing is drawing. Drawing, because I like to draw, you know, Japanese anime art. I think that's a craze among teens right now. And once I realized it, there's a parallel between creating music and creating art, because for your motive, or your little initial idea for your drawing, it's your character \u2014 you want to decide who you want to draw, or if you want to draw an original character. And then you want to decide: How are you going to draw the character? Like, am I going to use one page? Am I going to draw it on the computer? Am I going to use a two-page spread like a comic book? For a more grandiose effect, I guess. And then you have to do the initial sketch of the character, which is like your structure of a piece, and then you add pen and pencil, and whatever details that you need \u2014 that's polishing the drawing.And another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind, because I know I'm one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted. So if I'm trying to do homework and I don't feel like it, I'll try to draw or, you know, waste my time. And then what happens is, sometimes I absolutely can't draw or I can't compose at all, and then it's like there's too much on your mind. You can't focus on what you're supposed to do. And sometimes, if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it, you'll get something out of it, but it doesn't come naturally.What happens is, if something magical happens, if something natural happens to you, you're able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly, and then that's what I consider \"flow,\" because that's when everything clicks and you're able to do anything. You feel like you're on top of your game and you can do anything you want.I'm not going to play my own composition today because, although I did finish it, it's way too long. Instead, I'd like to try something called \"improvisation.\" I have here seven note cards, one with each note of the musical alphabet. And I'd like someone to come up here and choose five \u2014 anyone to come up here and choose five \u2014 and then I can make it into some sort of melody, and I'll improvise it. Wow. A volunteer, yay!(Laughter)(Applause)Jennifer Lin: Nice to meet you.Goldie Hawn: Thank you. Choose five?JL: Yes, five cards. Any five cards.GH: OK, one. JL: OK.GH: Two. JL: Yes.GH: Three.GH: Oh, D and F \u2014 too familiar.(Laughter)JL: One more. GH: OK. \"E\" for \"effort.\"JL: Would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose them?GH: OK \u2014 C, G, B, A and E.JL: Thank you very much!GH: You're welcome. And what about these?JL: I won't use them. Thank you!(Applause)Now, she chose C, G, B, A, E. I'm going to try to put that in some sort of order.(Plays notes)OK, that's nice. So, I'm going to have a moment to think, and I'll try to make something out of it.(Plays the five notes)(Music)(Music ends)(Applause)The next song, or the encore that I'm going to play is called

drawing.\n\n00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:48.354\nDrawing, because I like to draw,\nyou know, Japanese anime art.\n\n00:14:48.378 --> 00:14:50.661\nI think that's a craze\namong teens right now.\n\n00:14:51.343 --> 00:14:52.995\nAnd once I realized it,\n\n00:14:53.019 --> 00:14:57.015\nthere's a parallel between creating\nmusic and creating art,\n\n00:14:57.039 --> 00:15:02.149\nbecause for your motive, or your\nlittle initial idea for your drawing,\n\n00:15:02.173 --> 00:15:05.141\nit's your character -- you want\nto decide who you want to draw,\n\n00:15:05.165 --> 00:15:07.321\nor if you want to draw\nan original character.\n\n00:15:07.345 --> 00:15:10.842\nAnd then you want to decide:\nHow are you going to draw the character?\n\n00:15:10.866 --> 00:15:14.278\nLike, am I going to use one page?\nAm I going to draw it on the computer?\n\n00:15:14.302 --> 00:15:17.478\nAm I going to use a two-page spread\nlike a comic book?\n\n00:15:17.502 --> 00:15:19.705\nFor a more grandiose effect, I guess.\n\n00:15:20.089 --> 00:15:23.236\nAnd then you have to do\nthe initial sketch of the character,\n\n00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.298\nwhich is like your structure of a piece,\n\n00:15:25.322 --> 00:15:29.082\nand then you add pen and pencil,\nand whatever details that you need --\n\n00:15:29.106 --> 00:15:30.602\nthat's polishing the drawing.\n\n00:15:30.983 --> 00:15:34.705\nAnd another thing that both of these\nhave in common is your state of mind,\n\n00:15:34.729 --> 00:15:39.715\nbecause I know I'm one of those teenagers\nthat are really easily distracted.\n\n00:15:39.739 --> 00:15:44.754\nSo if I'm trying to do homework\nand I don't feel like it,\n\n00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:47.531\nI'll try to draw or,\nyou know, waste my time.\n\n00:15:47.957 --> 00:15:50.735\nAnd then what happens is,\nsometimes I absolutely can't draw\n\n00:15:50.759 --> 00:15:52.720\nor I can't compose at all,\n\n00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:55.050\nand then it's like\nthere's too much on your mind.\n\n00:15:55.074 --> 00:15:57.451\nYou can't focus\non what you're supposed to do.\n\n00:15:57.475 --> 00:16:02.776\nAnd sometimes, if you manage to use\nyour time wisely and work on it,\n\n00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.889\nyou'll get something out of it,\nbut it doesn't come naturally.\n\n00:16:06.444 --> 00:16:08.928\nWhat happens is,\nif something magical happens,\n\n00:16:08.952 --> 00:16:11.556\nif something natural happens to you,\n\n00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:15.199\nyou're able to produce\nall this beautiful stuff instantly,\n\n00:16:15.223 --> 00:16:17.351\nand then that's what I consider \"flow,\"\n\n00:16:17.375 --> 00:16:21.343\nbecause that's when everything clicks\nand you're able to do anything.\n\n00:16:21.367 --> 00:16:25.128\nYou feel like you're on top of your game\nand you can do anything you want.\n\n00:16:25.152 --> 00:16:28.373\nI'm not going to play\nmy own composition today because,\n\n00:16:28.397 --> 00:16:30.958\nalthough I did finish it,\nit's way too long.\n\n00:16:32.008 --> 00:16:35.196\nInstead, I'd like to try something\ncalled \"improvisation.\"\n\n00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.441\nI have here seven note cards,\n\n00:16:37.465 --> 00:16:40.648\none with each note\nof the musical alphabet.\n\n00:16:40.672 --> 00:16:44.555\nAnd I'd like someone to come up here\nand choose five --\n\n00:16:44.579 --> 00:16:46.567\nanyone to come up here and choose five --\n\n00:16:46.591 --> 00:16:49.303\nand then I can make it\ninto some sort of melody,\n\n00:16:49.327 --> 00:16:50.707\nand I'll improvise it.\n\n00:16:51.669 --> 00:16:54.800\nWow.

I think it's one of the most exciting that I'm working on, but I think it's also the simplest.It's a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world. It addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet, the number one cause of death in children under five. Which is ...? Water-borne diseases? Diarrhea? Malnutrition? No. It's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires \u2014 acute respiratory infections caused by this. Can you believe that?I find this shocking and somewhat appalling. Can't we make cleaner burning cooking fuels? Can't we make better stoves? How is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year? I know Bill Joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes, so I'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes, which is charcoal.(Laughter)So this is a picture of rural Haiti. Haiti is now 98 percent deforested. You'll see scenes like this all over the island. It leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the nation. A couple years ago there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths \u2014 that's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil. So the rains come \u2014 they go down the rivers and the flooding happens.Now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this: people need to cook, and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it. It's not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage. They know perfectly well, but they have no other choice. Fossil fuels are not available, and solar energy doesn't cook the way that they like their food prepared. And so this is what they do. You'll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree, cut it down and make charcoal out of it. So not surprisingly, there's a lot of effort that's been done to look at alternative cooking fuels.About four years ago, I took a team of students down to Haiti and we worked with Peace Corps volunteers there. This is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked. And the idea was that you could take waste paper; you could compress it and make briquettes that could be used for fuel. But this device was very slow. So our engineering students went to work on it and with some very simple changes, they were able to triple the throughput of this device. So you could imagine they were very excited about it. And they took the briquettes back to MIT so that they could test them. And one of the things that they found was they didn't burn. So it was a little discouraging to the students.(Laughter)And in fact, if you look closely, right here you can see it says, \"US Peace Corps.\" As it turns out, there actually wasn't any waste paper in this village. And while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village, it was 800 kilometers away. And so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel.What we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level. You see these all over Haiti as well. They're small-scale sugar mills. And the waste product from them after you extract the juice from the sugarcane is called \"bagasse.\" It has no other use. It has no nutritional value, so they don't feed it to the animals. It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it. What we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with, something like charcoal. So over the next couple of years, students and I worked to develop a process.So you start with the bagasse, and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of a waste fifty five-gallon oil drum. After some time, after setting it on fire, you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln, and then you end up with this carbonized material here. However, you can't burn this. It's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking. So we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes. And conveniently, one of my students was from Ghana, and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called \"kokonte,\" which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root. And so what we did was we looked, and we found that cassava is indeed grown in Haiti, under the name of \"manioc.\" In fact, it's grown all over the world \u2014 yucca, tapioca, manioc, cassava, it's all the same thing \u2014 a very starchy root vegetable. And you can make a very thick, sticky porridge out of it, which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes. So we did this. We went down to Haiti. These are the graduates of the first Ecole de Charbon, or Charcoal Institute. And these \u2014(Laughter)That's right. So I'm actually an instructor at MIT as well as CIT. And these are the briquettes that we made.Now I'm going to take you to a different continent. This is India and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in India. It's cow dung. And more than in Haiti, this produces really smoky fires, and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel. Kids and women are especially affected by it, because they're the ones who are around the cooking fires.So we wanted to see if we could introduce this charcoal-making technology there. Well, unfortunately, they didn't have sugarcane and they didn't have cassava, but that didn't stop us. What we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass. And there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area. And what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure, which they used ordinarily for their fuel. And we did side-by-side tests, and here you can see the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung. And you can see that it's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel. And in fact, it heats the water a lot more quickly. And so we were very happy, thus far. But one of the things that we found was when we did side-by-side comparisons with wood charcoal, it didn't burn as long. And the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking. So we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti.So we went back to MIT, we took out the Instron machine and we figured out what sort of forces you needed in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually are getting improved performance out of it? And at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this, we also had community partners in Haiti working to develop the process, to improve it and make it more accessible to people in the villages there. And after some time, we developed a low-cost press that allows you to produce charcoal, which actually now burns not only \u2014 actually, it burns longer, cleaner than wood charcoal.So now we're in a situation where we have a product, which is actually better than what you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace, which is a very wonderful place to be. In Haiti alone, about 30 million trees are cut down every year. There's a possibility of this being implemented and saving a good portion of those. In addition, the revenue generated from that charcoal is 260 million dollars. That's an awful lot for a country like Haiti \u2014 with a population of eight million and an average income of less than 400 dollars. So this is where we're also moving ahead with our charcoal project.And one of the things that I think is also interesting, is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley who's been doing risk analysis. And he's looked at the problem of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal. And he's found that worldwide, you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel. That's remarkable, but up until now, there weren't ways to do it without cutting down trees. But now we have a way that's using an agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel.One of the really exciting things, though, is something that came out of the trip that I took to Ghana just last month. And I think it's the coolest thing, and it's even lower tech than what you just saw, if you can imagine such a thing. Here it is. So what is this? This is corncobs turned into charcoal. And the beauty of this is that you don't need to form briquettes \u2014 it comes ready made. This is my $100 laptop, right here. And actually, like Nick, I brought samples.(Laughter)So we can pass these around. They're fully functional, field-tested, ready to roll out.(Laughter)And I think one of the things which is also remarkable about this technology, is that the technology transfer is so easy. Compared to the sugarcane charcoal, where we have to teach people how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step of cooking the binder, this comes pre-briquetted. And this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now, which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life.(Laughter)But once you see it, like you guys in the front row \u2014 All right, yeah, OK. So anyway \u2014(Laughter)Here it is. And this is, I think, a perfect example of what Robert Wright was talking about in those non-zero-sum things. So not only do you have health benefits, you have environmental benefits. But this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits. People can make their own cooking fuel from waste products. They can generate income from this. They can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own. It's really rare that you don't have trade-offs between health and economics, or environment and economics. So this is a project that I just find extremely exciting and I'm really looking forward to see where it takes us.So when we talk about, now, the future we will create, one of the things that I think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in. And now, I don't actually mean the world that we live in. I mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat. I mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand, and where, when you work 10 hours a day, you're still only earning 60 dollars in a month. I mean the world where women and children spend 40 billion hours a year fetching water. That's as if the entire workforce of the state of California worked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water.It's a place where, for example, if this were India, in this room, only three of us would have a car. If this were Afghanistan, only one person in this room would know how the use the Internet. If this were Zambia \u2014 300 of you would be farmers, 100 of you would have AIDS or HIV. And more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day. These are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for. These are the issues that we need to be training our engineers, our designers, our business people, our entrepreneurs to be facing. These are the solutions that we need to find.I have a few areas that I believe are especially important that we address. One of them is creating technologies to promote micro-finance and micro-enterprise, so that people who are living below the poverty line can find a way to move out \u2014 and that they're not doing it using the same traditional basket making, poultry rearing, etc. But there are new technologies and new products that they can make on a small scale.The next thing I believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops. And we need to rethink our development strategies, so that we're not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers, but rather to stop being poor farmers. And we need to think about how we can do that effectively. We need to work with the people in these communities and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems. That's the best way to do it. We shouldn't be doing it from outside. So we need to create this future, and we need to start doing it now.Thank you.(Applause)Chris Anderson: Thank you, incredible. Stay here. Tell us \u2014 just while we see if someone has a question \u2014 just tell us about one of the other things that you've worked on.Amy Smith: Some of the other things we're working on are ways to do low-cost water quality testing, so that communities can maintain their own water systems, know when they're working, know when they treat them, etc. We're also looking at low-cost water-treatment systems. One of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability to be able to do that.CA: What's the bottleneck preventing this stuff getting from scale? Do you need to find entrepreneurs, or venture capitalists, or what do you need to take what you've got and get it to scale?AS: I think it's large numbers of people moving it forward. It's a difficult thing \u2014 it's a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income. So you can't use the same models that you use in the United States for making things move forward. And we're a pretty small staff, which is me.(Laughter)So, you know, I do what I can with the students. We have 30 students a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward. The other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame, as, you know, you can't expect to get something done in a year or two years; you have to be looking five or 10 years ahead. But I think with the vision to do that, we can move forward.", "id": 2, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.598 --> 00:00:13.813\nIn terms of invention,\n\n00:00:13.838 --> 00:00:16.696\nI'd like to tell you the tale\nof one of my favorite projects.\n\n00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.013\nI think it's one of the most exciting\nthat I'm working on,\n\n00:00:20.038 --> 00:00:21.758\nbut I think it's also the simplest.\n\n00:00:22.118 --> 00:00:26.574\nIt's a project that has the potential\nto make a huge impact around the world.\n\n00:00:26.598 --> 00:00:30.014\nIt addresses one of the biggest\nhealth issues on the planet,\n\n00:00:30.038 --> 00:00:33.050\nthe number one cause of death\nin children under five.\n\n00:00:33.598 --> 00:00:34.798\nWhich is ...?\n\n00:00:35.638 --> 00:00:38.718\nWater-borne diseases?\nDiarrhea?

00:01:37.574\nthat there are no trees on the hills\nto stabilize the soil.\n\n00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:38.854\nSo the rains come --\n\n00:01:38.878 --> 00:01:41.318\nthey go down the rivers\nand the flooding happens.\n\n00:01:42.398 --> 00:01:45.854\nNow one of the reasons\nwhy there are so few trees is this:\n\n00:01:45.878 --> 00:01:47.254\npeople need to cook,\n\n00:01:47.278 --> 00:01:51.374\nand they harvest wood\nand they make charcoal in order to do it.\n\n00:01:51.398 --> 00:01:54.303\nIt's not that people are ignorant\nto the environmental damage.\n\n00:01:54.327 --> 00:01:56.947\nThey know perfectly well,\nbut they have no other choice.\n\n00:01:56.971 --> 00:01:58.974\nFossil fuels are not available,\n\n00:01:58.998 --> 00:02:03.894\nand solar energy doesn't cook the way\nthat they like their food prepared.\n\n00:02:03.918 --> 00:02:06.054\nAnd so this is what they do.\n\n00:02:06.078 --> 00:02:10.254\nYou'll find families like this who go out\ninto the forest to find a tree,\n\n00:02:10.278 --> 00:02:13.158\ncut it down and make charcoal out of it.\n\n00:02:14.398 --> 00:02:15.614\nSo not surprisingly,\n\n00:02:15.638 --> 00:02:20.437\nthere's a lot of effort that's been done\nto look at alternative cooking fuels.\n\n00:02:21.318 --> 00:02:24.374\nAbout four years ago, I took\na team of students down to Haiti\n\n00:02:24.398 --> 00:02:26.814\nand we worked with\nPeace Corps volunteers there.\n\n00:02:26.838 --> 00:02:28.254\nThis is one such volunteer\n\n00:02:28.278 --> 00:02:31.894\nand this is a device that he had built\nin the village where he worked.\n\n00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:34.574\nAnd the idea was\nthat you could take waste paper;\n\n00:02:34.598 --> 00:02:35.814\nyou could compress it\n\n00:02:35.838 --> 00:02:38.494\nand make briquettes\nthat could be used for fuel.\n\n00:02:38.518 --> 00:02:40.534\nBut this device was very slow.\n\n00:02:40.558 --> 00:02:43.654\nSo our engineering students\nwent to work on it\n\n00:02:43.678 --> 00:02:45.774\nand with some very simple changes,\n\n00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:48.854\nthey were able to triple\nthe throughput of this device.\n\n00:02:48.878 --> 00:02:51.414\nSo you could imagine\nthey were very excited about it.\n\n00:02:51.438 --> 00:02:55.238\nAnd they took the briquettes back to MIT\nso that they could test them.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:03:00.214\nAnd one of the things\nthat they found was they didn't burn.\n\n00:03:00.238 --> 00:03:03.014\nSo it was a little\ndiscouraging to the students.\n\n00:03:03.038 --> 00:03:04.574\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:04.598 --> 00:03:06.974\nAnd in fact, if you look closely,\n\n00:03:06.998 --> 00:03:09.598\nright here you can see\nit says, \"US Peace Corps.\"\n\n00:03:10.598 --> 00:03:14.414\nAs it turns out, there actually wasn't\nany waste paper in this village.\n\n00:03:14.438 --> 00:03:17.654\nAnd while it was a good use\nof government paperwork\n\n00:03:17.678 --> 00:03:20.583\nfor this volunteer to bring it\nback with him to his village,\n\n00:03:20.607 --> 00:03:22.694\nit was 800 kilometers away.\n\n00:03:22.718 --> 00:03:25.614\nAnd so we thought perhaps\nthere might be a better way\n\n00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:27.838\nto come up with\nan alternative cooking fuel.\n\n00:03:28.598 --> 00:03:30.854\nWhat we wanted to do\nis we wanted to make a fuel\n\n00:03:30.878 --> 00:03:34.214\nthat used something that was\nreadily available on the local level.\n\n00:03:34.238 --> 00:03:36.014\nYou see these all over Haiti as well.\n\n00:03:36.038 --> 00:03:37.774\nThey're small-scale sugar mills.\n\n00:03:37.798 --> 00:03:39.294\nAnd the waste product from them\n\n00:03:39.318 --> 00:03:41.734\nafter you extract the juice\nfrom the sugarcane\n\n00:03:41.758 --> 00:03:43.294\nis called \"bagasse.\"\n\n00:03:43.318 --> 00:03:44.534\nIt has no other use.\n\n00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:47.854\nIt has no nutritional value,\nso they don't feed it to the animals.\n\n00:03:47.878 --> 00:03:51.918\nIt just sits in a pile near the sugar mill\nuntil eventually they burn it.\n\n00:03:52.998 --> 00:03:55.294\nWhat we wanted to do was\nwe wanted to find a way\n\n00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:58.294\nto harness this waste resource\nand turn it into a fuel\n\n00:03:58.318 --> 00:04:01.294\nthat would be something\nthat people could easily cook with,\n\n00:04:01.318 --> 00:04:02.558\nsomething like charcoal.\n\n00:04:03.558 --> 00:04:05.174\nSo over the next couple of years,\n\n00:04:05.198 --> 00:04:08.854\nstudents and I worked\nto develop a process.\n\n00:04:08.878 --> 00:04:12.694\nSo you start with the bagasse,\nand then you take a very simple kiln\n\n00:04:12.718 --> 00:04:15.894\nthat you can make out of\na waste fifty five-gallon oil drum.\n\n00:04:15.918 --> 00:04:18.214\nAfter some time, after setting it on fire,\n\n00:04:18.238 --> 00:04:22.214\nyou seal it to restrict the oxygen\nthat goes into the kiln,\n\n00:04:22.238 --> 00:04:25.238\nand then you end up\nwith this carbonized material here.\n\n00:04:26.038 --> 00:04:27.614\nHowever, you can't burn this.\n\n00:04:27.638 --> 00:04:32.333\nIt's too fine and it burns too quickly\nto be useful for cooking.\n\n00:04:32.357 --> 00:04:36.614\nSo we had to try to find a way\nto form it into useful briquettes.\n\n00:04:36.638 --> 00:04:40.054\nAnd conveniently,\none of my students was from Ghana,\n\n00:04:40.078 --> 00:04:43.412\nand he remembered a dish his mom\nused to make for him called \"kokonte,\"\n\n00:04:43.436 --> 00:04:46.894\nwhich is a very sticky porridge\nmade out of the cassava root.\n\n00:04:46.918 --> 00:04:48.494\nAnd so what we did was we looked,\n\n00:04:48.518 --> 00:04:51.614\nand we found that cassava\nis indeed grown in Haiti,\n\n00:04:51.638 --> 00:04:53.774\nunder the name of \"manioc.\"\n\n00:04:53.798 --> 00:04:55.751\nIn fact, it's grown all over the world --\n\n00:04:55.775 --> 00:04:58.854\nyucca, tapioca, manioc, cassava,\nit's all the same thing --\n\n00:04:58.878 --> 00:05:00.974\na very starchy root vegetable.\n\n00:05:00.998 --> 00:05:04.214\nAnd you can make a very thick,\nsticky porridge out of it,\n\n00:05:04.238 --> 00:05:08.374\nwhich you can use to bind together\nthe charcoal briquettes.\n\n00:05:08.398 --> 00:05:11.574\nSo we did this. We went down to Haiti.\n\n00:05:11.598 --> 00:05:14.254\nThese are the graduates\nof the first Ecole de Charbon,\n\n00:05:14.278 --> 00:05:15.974\nor Charcoal Institute.\n\n00:05:15.998 --> 00:05:17.214\nAnd these --\n\n00:05:17.238 --> 00:05:18.454\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:18.478 --> 00:05:24.454\nThat's right. So I'm actually\nan instructor at MIT as well as CIT.\n\n00:05:24.478 --> 00:05:26.558\nAnd these are the briquettes that we made.\n\n00:05:27.998 --> 00:05:30.398\nNow I'm going to take you\nto a different continent.\n\n00:05:31.278 --> 00:05:32.494\nThis is India\n\n00:05:32.518 --> 00:05:35.734\nand this is the most commonly used\ncooking fuel in India.\n\n00:05:35.758 --> 00:05:37.134\nIt's cow dung.\n\n00:05:37.158 --> 00:05:41.334\nAnd more than in Haiti,\nthis produces really smoky fires,\n\n00:05:41.358 --> 00:05:43.814\nand this is where you see\nthe health impacts\n\n00:05:43.838 --> 00:05:47.918\nof cooking with cow dung\nand biomass as a fuel.\n\n00:05:48.558 --> 00:05:50.774\nKids and women\nare especially affected by it,\n\n00:05:50.798 --> 00:05:53.934\nbecause they're the ones\nwho are around the cooking fires.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.174\nSo we wanted to see\n\n00:05:55.198 --> 00:05:58.694\nif we could introduce\nthis charcoal-making technology there.\n\n00:05:58.718 --> 00:06:01.134\nWell, unfortunately,\nthey didn't have sugarcane\n\n00:06:01.158 --> 00:06:02.539\nand they didn't have cassava,\n\n00:06:02.563 --> 00:06:03.763\nbut that didn't stop us.\n\n00:06:04.358 --> 00:06:08.174\nWhat we did was we found what were\nthe locally available sources of biomass.\n\n00:06:08.198 --> 00:06:11.574\nAnd there was wheat straw\nand there was rice straw in this area.\n\n00:06:11.598 --> 00:06:15.214\nAnd what we could use as a binder\nwas actually small amounts of cow manure,\n\n00:06:15.238 --> 00:06:17.478\nwhich they used ordinarily for their fuel.\n\n00:06:18.918 --> 00:06:21.094\nAnd we did side-by-side tests,\n\n00:06:21.118 --> 00:06:23.694\nand here you can see\nthe charcoal briquettes\n\n00:06:23.718 --> 00:06:24.934\nand here the cow dung.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.214\nAnd you can see that it's a lot cleaner\nburning of a cooking fuel.\n\n00:06:28.238 --> 00:06:30.814\nAnd in fact, it heats the water\na lot more quickly.\n\n00:06:30.838 --> 00:06:33.134\nAnd so we were very happy, thus far.\n\n00:06:33.158 --> 00:06:34.854\nBut one of the things that we found\n\n00:06:34.878 --> 00:06:37.694\nwas when we did side-by-side\ncomparisons with wood charcoal,\n\n00:06:37.718 --> 00:06:39.334\nit didn't burn as long.\n\n00:06:39.358 --> 00:06:41.263\nAnd the briquettes crumbled a little bit\n\n00:06:41.287 --> 00:06:44.454\nand we lost energy as they fell apart\nas they were cooking.\n\n00:06:44.478 --> 00:06:47.694\nSo we wanted to try to find a way\nto make a stronger briquette\n\n00:06:47.718 --> 00:06:51.318\nso that we could compete with\nwood charcoal in the markets in Haiti.\n\n00:06:52.278 --> 00:06:54.294\nSo we went back to MIT,\n\n00:06:54.318 --> 00:06:56.534\nwe took out the Instron machine\n\n00:06:56.558 --> 00:06:59.254\nand we figured out\nwhat sort of forces you needed\n\n00:06:59.278 --> 00:07:01.374\nin order to compress\na briquette to the level\n\n00:07:01.398 --> 00:07:04.256\nthat you actually are getting\nimproved performance out of it?\n\n00:07:04.918 --> 00:07:08.214\nAnd at the same time that we had\nstudents in the lab looking at this,\n\n00:07:08.238 --> 00:07:15.174\nwe also had community partners in Haiti\nworking to develop the process,\n\n00:07:15.198 --> 00:07:20.198\nto improve it and make it more accessible\nto people in the villages there.\n\n00:07:21.118 --> 00:07:22.334\nAnd after some time,\n\n00:07:22.358 --> 00:07:27.174\nwe developed a low-cost press\nthat allows you to produce charcoal,\n\n00:07:27.198 --> 00:07:29.878\nwhich actually now burns not only --\n\n00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.918\nactually, it burns longer,\ncleaner than wood charcoal.\n\n00:07:34.358 --> 00:07:36.894\nSo now we're in a situation\nwhere we have a product,\n\n00:07:36.918 --> 00:07:41.214\nwhich is actually better than what\nyou can buy in Haiti in the marketplace,\n\n00:07:41.238 --> 00:07:43.958\nwhich is a very wonderful place to be.\n\n00:07:45.918 --> 00:07:50.654\nIn Haiti alone, about 30 million trees\nare cut down every year.\n\n00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:53.174\nThere's a possibility\nof this being implemented\n\n00:07:53.198 --> 00:07:55.494\nand saving a good portion of those.\n\n00:07:55.518 --> 00:08:01.934\nIn addition, the revenue generated\nfrom that charcoal is 260 million dollars.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.494\nThat's an awful lot\nfor a country like Haiti --\n\n00:08:04.518 --> 00:08:06.374\nwith a population of eight million\n\n00:08:06.398 --> 00:08:09.598\nand an average income\nof less than 400 dollars.\n\n00:08:10.638 --> 00:08:14.494\nSo this is where we're also moving ahead\nwith our charcoal project.\n\n00:08:14.518 --> 00:08:17.174\nAnd one of the things\nthat I think is also interesting,\n\n00:08:17.198 --> 00:08:21.494\nis I have a friend up at UC Berkeley\nwho's been doing risk analysis.\n\n00:08:21.518 --> 00:08:24.574\nAnd he's looked at the problem\nof the health impacts\n\n00:08:24.598 --> 00:08:26.694\nof burning wood versus charcoal.\n\n00:08:26.718 --> 00:08:30.814\nAnd he's found that worldwide,\nyou could prevent a million deaths\n\n00:08:30.838 --> 00:08:33.814\nswitching from wood\nto charcoal as a cooking fuel.\n\n00:08:33.838 --> 00:08:35.054\nThat's remarkable,\n\n00:08:35.078 --> 00:08:38.534\nbut up until now, there weren't ways\nto do it without cutting down trees.\n\n00:08:38.558 --> 00:08:39.774\nBut now we have a way\n\n00:08:39.798 --> 00:08:43.478\nthat's using an agricultural\nwaste material to create a cooking fuel.\n\n00:08:43.918 --> 00:08:45.934\nOne of the really exciting things, though,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.530\nis something that came out of the trip\nthat I took to Ghana just last month.\n\n00:08:49.554 --> 00:08:52.973\nAnd I think it's the coolest thing,\n\n00:08:52.997 --> 00:08:55.237\nand it's even lower tech\nthan what you just saw,\n\n00:08:55.261 --> 00:08:57.294\nif you can imagine such a thing.\n\n00:08:57.318 --> 00:08:58.534\nHere it is.\n\n00:08:58.558 --> 00:08:59.758\nSo what is this?\n\n00:09:00.438 --> 00:09:03.014\nThis is corncobs turned into charcoal.\n\n00:09:03.038 --> 00:09:06.181\nAnd the beauty of this is\nthat you don't need to form briquettes --\n\n00:09:06.205 --> 00:09:07.534\nit comes ready made.\n\n00:09:07.558 --> 00:09:10.414\nThis is my $100 laptop, right here.\n\n00:09:10.438 --> 00:09:13.454\nAnd actually, like Nick,\nI brought samples.\n\n00:09:13.478 --> 00:09:15.694\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:15.718 --> 00:09:17.478\nSo we can pass these around.\n\n00:09:19.478 --> 00:09:23.562\nThey're fully functional,\nfield-tested, ready to roll out.\n\n00:09:23.586 --> 00:09:25.292\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:27.478 --> 00:09:28.974\nAnd I think one of the things\n\n00:09:28.998 --> 00:09:33.214\nwhich is also remarkable\nabout this technology,\n\n00:09:33.238 --> 00:09:36.014\nis that the technology\ntransfer is so easy.\n\n00:09:36.038 --> 00:09:38.174\nCompared to the sugarcane charcoal,\n\n00:09:38.198 --> 00:09:41.014\nwhere we have to teach people\nhow to form it into briquettes\n\n00:09:41.038 --> 00:09:43.454\nand you have the extra step\nof cooking the binder,\n\n00:09:43.478 --> 00:09:45.054\nthis comes pre-briquetted.\n\n00:09:45.078 --> 00:09:48.031\nAnd this is about the most exciting\nthing in my life right now,\n\n00:09:48.055 --> 00:09:51.254\nwhich is perhaps\na sad commentary on my life.\n\n00:09:51.278 --> 00:09:53.534\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:53.558 --> 00:09:56.094\nBut once you see it,\nlike you guys in the front row --\n\n00:09:56.118 --> 00:09:57.334\nAll right, yeah, OK.\n\n00:09:57.358 --> 00:09:58.574\nSo anyway --\n\n00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.614\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:00.638 --> 00:10:01.854\nHere it is.\n\n00:10:01.878 --> 00:10:04.334\nAnd this is, I think, a perfect example\n\n00:10:04.358 --> 00:10:09.574\nof what Robert Wright was talking about\nin those non-zero-sum things.\n\n00:10:09.598 --> 00:10:12.094\nSo not only do you have health benefits,\n\n00:10:12.118 --> 00:10:14.254\nyou have environmental benefits.\n\n00:10:14.278 --> 00:10:18.094\nBut this is one\nof the incredibly rare situations\n\n00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:20.454\nwhere you also have economic benefits.\n\n00:10:20.478 --> 00:10:23.534\nPeople can make their own cooking fuel\nfrom waste products.\n\n00:10:23.558 --> 00:10:25.574\nThey can generate income from this.\n\n00:10:25.598 --> 00:10:28.734\nThey can save the money\nthat they were going to spend on charcoal\n\n00:10:28.758 --> 00:10:31.235\nand they can produce excess\nand sell it in the market\n\n00:10:31.259 --> 00:10:33.214\nto people who aren't making their own.\n\n00:10:33.238 --> 00:10:35.534\nIt's really rare\nthat you don't have trade-offs\n\n00:10:35.558 --> 00:10:38.774\nbetween health and economics,\nor environment and economics.\n\n00:10:38.798 --> 00:10:42.534\nSo this is a project\nthat I just find extremely exciting\n\n00:10:42.558 --> 00:10:47.958\nand I'm really looking forward\nto see where it takes us.\n\n00:10:50.078 --> 00:10:53.574\nSo when we talk about, now,\nthe future we will create,\n\n00:10:53.598 --> 00:10:55.614\none of the things\nthat I think is necessary\n\n00:10:55.638 --> 00:10:59.598\nis to have a very clear vision\nof the world that we live in.\n\n00:11:00.118 --> 00:11:02.904\nAnd now, I don't actually mean\nthe world that we live in.\n\n00:11:03.878 --> 00:11:07.974\nI mean the world where women\nspend two to three hours everyday\n\n00:11:07.998 --> 00:11:10.438\ngrinding grain for their families to eat.\n\n00:11:11.918 --> 00:11:14.294\nI mean the world\nwhere advanced building materials\n\n00:11:14.318 --> 00:11:17.734\nmeans cement roofing tiles\nthat are made by hand,\n\n00:11:17.758 --> 00:11:19.894\nand where, when you work 10 hours a day,\n\n00:11:19.918 --> 00:11:22.758\nyou're still only earning\n60 dollars in a month.\n\n00:11:24.278 --> 00:11:25.494\nI mean the world\n\n00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:31.718\nwhere women and children spend\n40 billion hours a year fetching water.\n\n00:11:32.478 --> 00:11:36.214\nThat's as if the entire workforce\nof the state of California\n\n00:11:36.238 --> 00:11:40.734\nworked full time for a year\ndoing nothing but fetching water.\n\n00:11:40.758 --> 00:11:45.094\nIt's a place where,\nfor example, if this were India,\n\n00:11:45.118 --> 00:11:47.558\nin this room, only three of us\nwould have a car.\n\n00:11:48.318 --> 00:11:49.534\nIf this were Afghanistan,\n\n00:11:49.558 --> 00:11:53.174\nonly one person in this room\nwould know how the use the Internet.\n\n00:11:53.198 --> 00:11:54.398\nIf this were Zambia --\n\n00:11:55.478 --> 00:11:58.174\n300 of you would be farmers,\n\n00:11:58.198 --> 00:12:01.334\n100 of you would have AIDS or HIV.\n\n00:12:01.358 --> 00:12:05.198\nAnd more than half of you would be living\non less than a dollar a day.\n\n00:12:06.238 --> 00:12:10.974\nThese are the issues that we\nneed to come up with solutions for.\n\n00:12:10.998 --> 00:12:14.854\nThese are the issues that\nwe need to be training our engineers,\n\n00:12:14.878 --> 00:12:18.318\nour designers, our business people,\nour entrepreneurs to be facing.\n\n00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:21.934\nThese are the solutions\nthat we need to find.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:28.134\nI have a few areas that I believe\nare especially important that we address.\n\n00:12:28.158 --> 00:12:30.214\nOne of them is creating technologies\n\n00:12:30.238 --> 00:12:33.254\nto promote micro-finance\nand micro-enterprise,\n\n00:12:33.278 --> 00:12:36.134\nso that people who are living\nbelow the poverty line\n\n00:12:36.158 --> 00:12:37.694\ncan find a way to move out --\n\n00:12:37.718 --> 00:12:39.099\nand that they're not doing it\n\n00:12:39.123 --> 00:12:42.734\nusing the same traditional\nbasket making, poultry rearing, etc.\n\n00:12:42.758 --> 00:12:44.949\nBut there are new technologies\nand new products\n\n00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:47.213\nthat they can make on a small scale.\n\n00:12:47.758 --> 00:12:48.974\nThe next thing I believe\n\n00:12:48.998 --> 00:12:53.374\nis that we need to create\ntechnologies for poor farmers\n\n00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:55.638\nto add value to their own crops.\n\n00:12:56.558 --> 00:12:59.214\nAnd we need to rethink\nour development strategies,\n\n00:12:59.238 --> 00:13:02.494\nso that we're not promoting\neducational campaigns\n\n00:13:02.518 --> 00:13:04.894\nto get them to stop being farmers,\n\n00:13:04.918 --> 00:13:07.694\nbut rather to stop being poor farmers.\n\n00:13:07.718 --> 00:13:10.551\nAnd we need to think\nabout how we can do that effectively.\n\n00:13:11.518 --> 00:13:14.174\nWe need to work with the people\nin these communities\n\n00:13:14.198 --> 00:13:17.054\nand give them the resources\nand the tools that they need\n\n00:13:17.078 --> 00:13:18.774\nto solve their own problems.\n\n00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:20.179\nThat's the best way to do it.\n\n00:13:20.203 --> 00:13:22.494\nWe shouldn't be doing it from outside.\n\n00:13:22.518 --> 00:13:26.678\nSo we need to create this future,\nand we need to start doing it now.\n\n00:13:27.198 --> 00:13:28.414\nThank you.\n\n00:13:28.438 --> 00:13:33.694\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:33.718 --> 00:13:36.210\nChris Anderson: Thank you, incredible.\n\n00:13:36.278 --> 00:13:37.478\nStay here.\n\n00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:41.214\nTell us -- just while we see\nif someone has a question --\n\n00:13:41.238 --> 00:13:44.654\njust tell us about one of the other things\nthat you've worked on.\n\n00:13:44.678 --> 00:13:47.174\nAmy Smith: Some of the other\nthings we're working on\n\n00:13:47.198 --> 00:13:49.375\nare ways to do low-cost\nwater quality testing,\n\n00:13:49.399 --> 00:13:52.134\nso that communities can maintain\ntheir own water systems,\n\n00:13:52.158 --> 00:13:54.873\nknow when they're working,\nknow when they treat them, etc.\n\n00:13:54.897 --> 00:13:57.534\nWe're also looking at low-cost\nwater-treatment systems.\n\n00:13:57.558 --> 00:14:00.939\nOne of the really exciting things\nis looking at solar water disinfection\n\n00:14:00.963 --> 00:14:03.523\nand improving the ability\nto be able to do that.\n\n00:14:04.278 --> 00:14:08.214\nCA: What's the bottleneck\npreventing this stuff getting from scale?\n\n00:14:08.238 --> 00:14:11.494\nDo you need to find entrepreneurs,\nor venture capitalists,\n\n00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:16.374\nor what do you need to take\nwhat you've got and get it to scale?\n\n00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:19.168\nAS: I think it's large numbers\nof people moving it forward.\n\n00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:20.391\nIt's a difficult thing --\n\n00:14:20.415 --> 00:14:22.422\nit's a marketplace\nwhich is very fragmented\n\n00:14:22.446 --> 00:14:24.654\nand a consumer population with no income.\n\n00:14:24.678 --> 00:14:27.934\nSo you can't use the same models\nthat you use in the United States\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.494\nfor making things move forward.\n\n00:14:29.518 --> 00:14:31.534\nAnd we're a pretty small staff,\n\n00:14:31.558 --> 00:14:32.774\nwhich is me.\n\n00:14:32.798 --> 00:14:34.774\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:34.798 --> 00:14:37.037\nSo, you know,\nI do what I can with the students.\n\n00:14:37.061 --> 00:14:39.300\nWe have 30 students a year\ngo out into the field\n\n00:14:39.324 --> 00:14:41.774\nand try to implement this\nand move it forward.\n\n00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:45.294\nThe other thing is you have to do things\nwith a long time frame,\n\n00:14:45.318 --> 00:14:49.254\nas, you know, you can't expect to get\nsomething done in a year or two years;\n\n00:14:49.278 --> 00:14:51.421\nyou have to be looking\nfive or 10 years ahead.\n\n00:14:51.445 --> 00:14:54.645\nBut I think with the vision to do that,\nwe can move forward."}, {"title": "Organic design, inspired by nature", "duration": "1170", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ross_lovegrove_shares_organic_designs", "transcript": "My name is Lovegrove. I only know nine Lovegroves, two of which are my parents. They are first cousins, and you know what happens when, you know \u2014(Laughter)So there's a terribly weird freaky side to me, which I'm fighting with all the time. So to try and get through today, I've kind of disciplined myself with an 18-minute talk. I was hanging on to have a pee. I thought perhaps if I was hanging on long enough, that would guide me through the 18 minutes.(Laughter)OK. I am known as Captain Organic and that's a philosophical position as well as an aesthetic position. But today what I'd like to talk to you about is that love of form and how form can touch people's soul and emotion. Not very long ago, not many thousands of years ago, we actually lived in caves, and I don't think we've lost that coding system. We respond so well to form. But I'm interested in creating intelligent form. I'm not interested at all in blobism or any of that superficial rubbish that you see coming out as design. This artificially induced consumerism \u2014 I think it's atrocious.My world is the world of people like Amory Lovins, Janine Benyus, James Watson. I'm in that world, but I work purely instinctively. I'm not a scientist. I could have been, perhaps, but I work in this world where I trust my instincts. So I am a 21st-century translator of technology into products that we use everyday and relate beautifully and naturally with. And we should be developing things \u2014 we should be developing packaging for ideas which elevate people's perceptions and respect for the things that we dig out of the earth and translate into products for everyday use. So, the water bottle.I'll begin with this concept of what I call DNA. DNA: Design, Nature, Art. These are the three things that condition my world. Here is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci, 500 years ago, before photography. It shows how observation, curiosity and instinct work to create amazing art. Industrial design is the art form of the 21st century. People like Leonardo \u2014 there have not been many \u2014 had this amazingly instinctive curiosity. I work from a similar position. I don't want to sound pretentious saying that, but this is my drawing made on a digital pad a couple of years ago \u2014 well into the 21st century, 500 years later. It's my impression of water. Impressionism being the most valuable art form on the planet as we know it: 100 million dollars, easily, for a Monet.I use, now, a whole new process. A few years ago I reinvented my process to keep up with people like Greg Lynn, Thom Mayne, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas \u2014 all these people that I think are persevering and pioneering with fantastic new ideas of how to create form. This is all created digitally. Here you see the machining, the milling of a block of acrylic. This is what I show to the client to say, \"That's what I want to do.\" At that point, I don't know if that's possible at all. It's a seductor, but I just feel in my bones that that's possible.So we go, we look at the tooling. We look at how that is produced. These are the invisible things that you never see in your life. This is the background noise of industrial design. That is like an Anish Kapoor flowing through a Richard Serra. It is more valuable than the product in my eyes. I don't have one. When I do make some money, I'll have one machined for myself. This is the final product. When they sent it to me, I thought I'd failed. It felt like nothing. It has to feel like nothing. It was when I put the water in that I realized that I'd put a skin on water itself. It's an icon of water itself, and it elevates people's perception of contemporary design. Each bottle is different, meaning the water level will give you a different shape. It's mass individualism from a single product. It fits the hand. It fits arthritic hands. It fits children's hands. It makes the product strong, the tessellation. It's a millefiori of ideas. In the future, they will look like that, because we need to move away from those type of polymers and use that for medical equipment and more important things, perhaps, in life. Biopolymers, these new ideas for materials, will come into play in probably a decade. It doesn't look as cool, does it? But I can live up to that. I don't have a problem with that. I design for that condition, biopolymers. It's the future.I took this video in Cape Town last year. This is the freaky side coming out. I have this special interest in things like this, which blow my mind. I don't know whether to, you know, drop to my knees, cry; I don't know what I think. But I just know that nature \u2014 nature improves with ever-greater purpose that which once existed, and that strangeness is a consequence of innovative thinking. When I look at these things, they look pretty normal to me. But these things evolved over many years, and what we're trying to do \u2014 I get three weeks to design a telephone. How the hell do I do that, when you get these things that take hundreds of millions of years to evolve? How do you condense that?It comes back to instinct. I'm not talking about designing telephones that look like that and I'm not looking at designing architecture like that. I'm just interested in natural growth patterns and the beautiful forms that only nature really creates. How that flows through me and how that comes out is what I'm trying to understand.This is a scan through the human forearm. It's then blown up through rapid prototyping to reveal its cellular structure. I have these in my office. My office is a mixture of the Natural History Museum and a NASA space lab. It's a weird, kind of freaky place. This is one of my specimens.This is made \u2014 bone is made from a mixture of inorganic minerals and polymers. I studied cooking in school for four years, and in that experience, which was called \"domestic science,\" it was a bit of a cheap trick for me to try and get a science qualification.(Laughter)Actually, I put marijuana in everything I cooked \u2014(Laughter)And I had access to all the best girls. It was fabulous. All the guys in the rugby team couldn't understand. Anyway \u2014 this is a meringue. This is another sample I have. A meringue is made exactly the same way, in my estimation, as a bone. It's made from polysaccharides and proteins. If you pour water on that, it dissolves. Could we be manufacturing from foodstuffs in the future? Not a bad idea. I don't know. I need to talk to Janine and a few other people about that, but I believe instinctively that that meringue can become something, a car \u2014 I don't know.I'm also interested in growth patterns: the unbridled way that nature grows things so you're not restricted by form at all. These interrelated forms, they do inspire everything I do, although I might end up making something incredibly simple. This is a detail of a chair that I've designed in magnesium. It shows this interlocution of elements and the beauty of, kind of, engineering and biological thinking, shown pretty much as a bone structure. Any one of those elements you could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object.It's the world's first chair made in magnesium. It cost 1.7 million dollars to develop. It's called \"Go,\" by Bernhardt, USA. It went into Time magazine in 2001 as the new language of the 21st century. Boy. For somebody growing up in Wales in a little village, that's enough. It shows how you make one holistic form, like the car industry, and then you break up what you need. This is an absolutely beautiful way of working. It's a godly way of working. It's organic and it's essential. It's an absolutely fat-free design, and when you look at it, you see human beings.When that moves into polymers, you can change the elasticity, the fluidity of the form. This is an idea for a gas-injected, one-piece polymer chair. What nature does is it drills holes in things. It liberates form. It takes away anything extraneous. That's what I do. I make organic things which are essential. And they look funky, too \u2014 but I don't set out to make funky things because I think that's an absolute disgrace.I set out to look at natural forms. If you took the idea of fractal technology further, take a membrane, shrinking it down constantly like nature does \u2014 that could be a seat for a chair. It could be a sole for a sports shoe. It could be a car blending into seats. Wow. Let's go for it. That's the kind of stuff. This is what exists in nature. Observation now allows us to bring that natural process into the design process every day. That's what I do.This is a show that's currently on in Tokyo. It's called \"Superliquidity.\" It's my sculptural investigation. It's like 21st-century Henry Moore. When you see a Henry Moore, still, your hair stands up. There's some amazing spiritual connect. If he was a car designer, phew, we'd all be driving one. In his day, he was the highest taxpayer in Britain.That is the power of organic design. It contributes immensely to our \u2014 sense of being, our sense of relationships with things, our sensuality and, you know, the sort of \u2014 even the sort of socio-erotic side, which is very important. This is my artwork. This is all my process. These actually are sold as artwork. They're very big prints. But this is how I get to that object.Ironically, that object was made by the Killarney process, which is a brand-new process here for the 21st century, and I can hear Greg Lynn laughing his socks off as I say that. I'll tell you about that later.When I look into these data images, I see new things. It's self-inspired. Diatomic structures, radiolaria, the things that we couldn't see but we can do now \u2014 these, again, are cored out. They're made virtually from nothing. They're made from silica. Why not structures from cars like that? Coral, all these natural forces, take away what they don't need and they deliver maximum beauty. We need to be in that realm. I want to do stuff like that.This is a new chair which should come on the market in September. It's for a company called Moroso in Italy. It's a gas-injected polymer chair. Those holes you see there are very filtered-down, watered-down versions of the extremity of the diatomic structures. It goes with the flow of the polymer and you'll see \u2014 there's an image coming up right now that shows the full thing. It's great to have companies in Italy who support this way of dreaming. If you see the shadows that come through that, they're actually probably more important than the product, but it's the minimum it takes. The coring out of the back lets you breathe. It takes away any material you don't need and it actually garners flexure too.I was going to break into a dance then.This is some current work I'm doing. I'm looking at single-surface structures and how they stretch and flow. It's based on furniture typologies, but that's not the end motivation. It's made from aluminum ... as opposed to aluminium, and it's grown. It's grown in my mind, and then it's grown in terms of the whole process that I go through.This is two weeks ago in CCP in Coventry, who build parts for Bentleys and so on. It's being built as we speak and it will be on show in Phillips next year in New York. I have a big show with Phillips Auctioneers. When I see these animations, oh Jesus, I'm blown away. This is what goes on in my studio everyday. I walk \u2014 I'm traveling. I come back. Some guy's got that on a computer \u2014 there's this like, oh my goodness. So I try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio. This kind of effervescent \u2014 fully charged sense of soup that delivers ideas.Single-surface products. Furniture's a good one. How you grow legs out of a surface. I would love to build this one day and perhaps I'd like to build it also out of flour, sugar, polymer, wood chips \u2014 I don't know, human hair. I don't know. I'd love a go at that. I don't know. If I just got some time. That's the weird side coming out again. A lot of companies don't understand that.Three weeks ago I was with Sony in Tokyo. They said, \"Give us the dream. What is our dream? How do we beat Apple?\" I said, \"You don't copy Apple, that's for sure. You get into biopolymers.\" They looked straight through me. What a waste. Anyway.(Laughter)No, it's true. Fuck them. You know, I mean \u2014(Laughter)I'm delivering; they're not taking. I've had this image 20 years. I've had this image of a water droplet for 20 years, sitting on a hot bed. That is an image of a car for me. That's the car of the future. It's a water droplet. I've been banging on about this like I can't believe. Cars are all wrong.I'm going to show you something a bit weird now. They laughed everywhere over the world I showed this. The only place that didn't laugh was Moscow. Cars are made from 30,000 components. How ridiculous is that? Couldn't you make that from 300? It's got a vacuum-formed, carbon-nylon pan. Everything's holistically integrated. It opens and closes like a bread bin. There is no engine. There's a solar panel on the back and there are batteries in the wheels; they're fitted like Formula 1. You take them off your wall, you plug them in. Off you go. A three-wheeled car: slow, feminine, transparent, so you can see the people in there. You drive different. You see that thing. You do. You do. And not anesthetized, separated from life. There's a hole at the front and there's a reason for that. It's a city car. You drive along. You get out. You drive on to a proboscis. You get out. It lifts you up. It presents the solar panel to the sun, and at night, it's a street lamp.(Applause)That's what happens if you get inspired by the street lamp first, and do the car second. I can see these bubbles with these hydrogen packages, floating around on the ground, driven by AI. When I showed this in South Africa, everybody afterwards was going, \"Hey, car on a stick. Like this.\" Can you imagine? A car on a stick.(Laughter)If you put it next to contemporary architecture, it feels totally natural to me. And that's what I do with my furniture. I'm not putting Charles Eames' furniture in buildings anymore. I'm trying to build furniture which fits architecture. I'm trying to build transportation systems. I work on aircraft for Airbus, I do all this sort of stuff trying to force these natural, inspired-by-nature dreams home.I'm going to finish on two things. This is the stereolithography of a staircase. It's a little bit of a dedication to James, James Watson. I built this thing for my studio. It cost me 250,000 dollars to build this. Most people go and buy the Aston Martin. I built this. This is the data that goes with that. Incredibly complex. Took about two years, because I'm looking for fat-free design. Lean, efficient things. Healthy products. This is built by composites. It's a single element which rotates around to create a holistic element, and this is a carbon-fiber handrail which is only supported in two places. Modern materials allow us to do modern things.This is a shot in the studio. This is how it looks pretty much every day. You wouldn't want to have a fear of heights coming down it. There is virtually no handrail. It doesn't pass any standards.(Laughter)Who cares?(Laughter)And it has an internal handrail which gives it its strength. It's this holistic integration. That's my studio. It's subterranean. It's in Notting Hill, next to all the crap \u2014 the prostitutes and all that stuff. It's next to David Hockney's original studio. It has a lighting system that changes throughout the day. My guys go out for lunch. The door's open. They come back in, because it's normally raining and they prefer to stay in.This is my studio. Elephant skull from Oxford University, 1988. I bought that last year. They're very difficult to find. If anybody's got a whale skeleton they want to sell me, I'll put it in the studio.So I'm just going to interject a little bit with some of the things that you'll see in the video. It's a homemade video, made it myself at three o'clock in the morning just to show you how my real world is. You never see that. You never see architects or designers showing you their real world.This is called a \"Plasnet.\" It's a new bio-polycarbonate chair I'm doing in Italy.World's first bamboo bike with folding handlebars. We should all be riding one of these. As China buys all these crappy cars, we should be riding things like this. Counterbalance.Like I say, it's a cross between Natural History Museum and a NASA laboratory. It's full of prototypes and objects. It's self-inspirational, again. I mean, the rare times when I'm there, I do enjoy it. And I get lots and lots of kids coming. I'm a contaminator for all those children of investment bankers \u2014 wankers. Sorry.(Laughter)That's a solar seed. It's a concept for new architecture. That thing on the top is the world's first solar-powered garden lamp \u2014 the first produced. Giles Revell should be talking here today \u2014 amazing photography of things you can't see.The first sculptural model I made for that thing in Tokyo.Lots of stuff. There's a little leaf chair \u2014 that golden looking thing is called \"Leaf.\" It's made from Kevlar.On the wall is my book called \"Supernatural,\" which allows me to remember what I've done, because I forget.There's an aerated brick I did in Limoges last year, in Concepts for New Ceramics in Architecture.Gernot Oberfell, working at three o'clock in the morning \u2014 and I don't pay overtime. Overtime is the passion of design, so join the club or don't.(Laughter)No, it's true. People like Tom and Greg \u2014 we're traveling like you can't \u2014 we fit it all in. I don't know how we do it.Next week I'm at Electrolux in Sweden, then I'm in Beijing on Friday. You work that one out. And when I see Ed's photographs, I think, why the hell am I going to China? It's true. It's true. Because there's a soul in this whole thing. We need to have a new instinct for the 21st century. We need to combine all this stuff. If all the people who were talking over this period worked on a car together, it would be a joy, absolute joy.So there's a new X-light system I'm doing in Japan.There's Tuareg shoes from North Africa. There's a Kifwebe mask.These are my sculptures.A copper jelly mold.(Laughter)It sounds like some quiz show or something, doesn't it? So, it's going to end. Thank you, James, for your great inspiration.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 27, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.174\nMy name is Lovegrove.\n\n00:00:13.198 --> 00:00:17.294\nI only know nine Lovegroves,\ntwo of which are my parents.\n\n00:00:17.318 --> 00:00:21.134\nThey are first cousins, and you know\nwhat happens when, you know --\n\n00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:22.374\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:22.398 --> 00:00:26.614\nSo there's a terribly weird\nfreaky side to me,\n\n00:00:26.638 --> 00:00:28.494\nwhich I'm fighting with all the time.\n\n00:00:28.518 --> 00:00:31.294\nSo to try and get through today,\n\n00:00:31.318 --> 00:00:34.374\nI've kind of disciplined myself\nwith an 18-minute talk.\n\n00:00:34.398 --> 00:00:35.894\nI was hanging on to have a pee.\n\n00:00:35.918 --> 00:00:38.254\nI thought perhaps\nif I was hanging on long enough,\n\n00:00:38.278 --> 00:00:40.278\nthat would guide me\nthrough the 18 minutes.\n\n00:00:40.302 --> 00:00:42.614\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:42.638 --> 00:00:49.134\nOK. I am known as Captain Organic\n\n00:00:49.158 --> 00:00:52.397\nand that's a philosophical position\nas well as an aesthetic position.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:57.774\nBut today what I'd like to talk\nto you about is that love of form\n\n00:00:57.798 --> 00:01:01.758\nand how form can touch\npeople's soul and emotion.\n\n00:01:03.638 --> 00:01:08.574\nNot very long ago,\nnot many thousands of years ago,\n\n00:01:08.598 --> 00:01:10.534\nwe actually lived in caves,\n\n00:01:10.558 --> 00:01:14.814\nand I don't think\nwe've lost that coding system.\n\n00:01:14.838 --> 00:01:17.974\nWe respond so well to form.\n\n00:01:17.998 --> 00:01:20.454\nBut I'm interested\nin creating intelligent form.\n\n00:01:20.478 --> 00:01:22.414\nI'm not interested at all in blobism\n\n00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:26.454\nor any of that superficial rubbish\nthat you see coming out as design.\n\n00:01:26.478 --> 00:01:31.118\nThis artificially induced\nconsumerism -- I think it's atrocious.\n\n00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:36.174\nMy world is the world\nof people like Amory Lovins,\n\n00:01:36.198 --> 00:01:38.654\nJanine Benyus, James Watson.\n\n00:01:38.678 --> 00:01:42.294\nI'm in that world,\nbut I work purely instinctively.\n\n00:01:42.318 --> 00:01:45.054\nI'm not a scientist.\nI could have been, perhaps,\n\n00:01:45.078 --> 00:01:47.894\nbut I work in this world\nwhere I trust my instincts.\n\n00:01:47.918 --> 00:01:54.574\nSo I am a 21st-century\ntranslator of technology\n\n00:01:54.598 --> 00:01:59.734\ninto products that we use everyday\nand relate beautifully and naturally with.\n\n00:01:59.758 --> 00:02:03.494\nAnd we should be developing things --\nwe should be developing packaging\n\n00:02:03.518 --> 00:02:07.374\nfor ideas which elevate\npeople's perceptions\n\n00:02:07.398 --> 00:02:10.894\nand respect for the things\nthat we dig out of the earth\n\n00:02:10.918 --> 00:02:13.174\nand translate into products\nfor everyday use.\n\n00:02:13.198 --> 00:02:15.654\nSo, the water bottle.\n\n00:02:15.678 --> 00:02:18.334\nI'll begin with this concept\nof what I call DNA.\n\n00:02:18.358 --> 00:02:20.534\nDNA: Design, Nature, Art.\n\n00:02:20.558 --> 00:02:22.939\nThese are the three things\nthat condition my world.\n\n00:02:22.963 --> 00:02:28.454\nHere is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci,\n500 years ago, before photography.\n\n00:02:28.478 --> 00:02:33.534\nIt shows how observation,\ncuriosity and instinct\n\n00:02:33.558 --> 00:02:36.774\nwork to create amazing art.\n\n00:02:36.798 --> 00:02:39.574\nIndustrial design is the art form\nof the 21st century.\n\n00:02:39.598 --> 00:02:43.134\nPeople like Leonardo --\nthere have not been many --\n\n00:02:43.158 --> 00:02:46.774\nhad this amazingly instinctive curiosity.\n\n00:02:46.798 --> 00:02:48.294\nI work from a similar position.\n\n00:02:48.318 --> 00:02:50.461\nI don't want to sound\npretentious saying that,\n\n00:02:50.485 --> 00:02:54.254\nbut this is my drawing made\non a digital pad a couple of years ago --\n\n00:02:54.278 --> 00:02:56.614\nwell into the 21st century,\n500 years later.\n\n00:02:56.638 --> 00:02:59.614\nIt's my impression of water.\n\n00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:03.162\nImpressionism being the most valuable\nart form on the planet as we know it:\n\n00:03:03.186 --> 00:03:05.534\n100 million dollars, easily, for a Monet.\n\n00:03:05.558 --> 00:03:07.414\nI use, now, a whole new process.\n\n00:03:07.438 --> 00:03:09.414\nA few years ago I reinvented my process\n\n00:03:09.438 --> 00:03:13.974\nto keep up with people like Greg Lynn,\nThom Mayne, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas --\n\n00:03:13.998 --> 00:03:17.334\nall these people that I think\nare persevering and pioneering\n\n00:03:17.358 --> 00:03:21.374\nwith fantastic new ideas\nof how to create form.\n\n00:03:21.398 --> 00:03:22.894\nThis is all created digitally.\n\n00:03:22.918 --> 00:03:26.174\nHere you see the machining,\nthe milling of a block of acrylic.\n\n00:03:26.198 --> 00:03:29.437\nThis is what I show to the client to say,\n\"That's what I want to do.\"\n\n00:03:29.461 --> 00:03:31.985\nAt that point, I don't know\nif that's possible at all.\n\n00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:36.466\nIt's a seductor, but I just feel\nin my bones that that's possible.\n\n00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:40.094\nSo we go, we look at the tooling.\n\n00:03:40.118 --> 00:03:41.734\nWe look at how that is produced.\n\n00:03:41.758 --> 00:03:44.711\nThese are the invisible things\nthat you never see in your life.\n\n00:03:44.735 --> 00:03:47.294\nThis is the background noise\nof industrial design.\n\n00:03:47.318 --> 00:03:51.134\nThat is like an Anish Kapoor\nflowing through a Richard Serra.\n\n00:03:51.158 --> 00:03:53.397\nIt is more valuable\nthan the product in my eyes.\n\n00:03:53.421 --> 00:03:54.803\nI don't have one.\n\n00:03:54.827 --> 00:03:57.715\nWhen I do make some money,\nI'll have one machined for myself.\n\n00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:58.992\nThis is the final product.\n\n00:03:59.016 --> 00:04:01.233\nWhen they sent it to me,\nI thought I'd failed.\n\n00:04:01.257 --> 00:04:03.614\nIt felt like nothing.\nIt has to feel like nothing.\n\n00:04:03.638 --> 00:04:05.174\nIt was when I put the water in\n\n00:04:05.198 --> 00:04:07.854\nthat I realized that I'd put\na skin on water itself.\n\n00:04:07.878 --> 00:04:09.894\nIt's an icon of water itself,\n\n00:04:09.918 --> 00:04:13.734\nand it elevates people's perception\nof contemporary design.\n\n00:04:13.758 --> 00:04:15.094\nEach bottle is different,\n\n00:04:15.118 --> 00:04:17.738\nmeaning the water level\nwill give you a different shape.\n\n00:04:17.762 --> 00:04:20.774\nIt's mass individualism\nfrom a single product.\n\n00:04:20.798 --> 00:04:22.014\nIt fits the hand.\n\n00:04:22.038 --> 00:04:24.374\nIt fits arthritic hands.\nIt fits children's hands.\n\n00:04:24.398 --> 00:04:26.541\nIt makes the product strong,\nthe tessellation.\n\n00:04:26.565 --> 00:04:28.854\nIt's a millefiori of ideas.\n\n00:04:28.878 --> 00:04:31.614\nIn the future, they will look like that,\n\n00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:34.265\nbecause we need to move away\nfrom those type of polymers\n\n00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:35.916\nand use that for medical equipment\n\n00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.996\nand more important things,\nperhaps, in life.\n\n00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.694\nBiopolymers, these new\nideas for materials,\n\n00:04:40.718 --> 00:04:43.134\nwill come into play in probably a decade.\n\n00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:44.734\nIt doesn't look as cool, does it?\n\n00:04:44.758 --> 00:04:47.814\nBut I can live up to that.\nI don't have a problem with that.\n\n00:04:47.838 --> 00:04:51.518\nI design for that condition,\nbiopolymers. It's the future.\n\n00:04:52.718 --> 00:04:55.134\nI took this video in Cape Town last year.\n\n00:04:55.158 --> 00:04:56.894\nThis is the freaky side coming out.\n\n00:04:56.918 --> 00:05:01.454\nI have this special interest\nin things like this, which blow my mind.\n\n00:05:01.478 --> 00:05:04.414\nI don't know whether to,\nyou know, drop to my knees, cry;\n\n00:05:04.438 --> 00:05:05.694\nI don't know what I think.\n\n00:05:05.718 --> 00:05:07.718\nBut I just know that nature --\n\n00:05:09.078 --> 00:05:14.054\nnature improves with ever-greater purpose\n\n00:05:14.078 --> 00:05:17.014\nthat which once existed,\n\n00:05:17.038 --> 00:05:20.174\nand that strangeness\nis a consequence of innovative thinking.\n\n00:05:20.198 --> 00:05:23.454\nWhen I look at these things,\nthey look pretty normal to me.\n\n00:05:23.478 --> 00:05:26.859\nBut these things evolved over many years,\nand what we're trying to do --\n\n00:05:26.883 --> 00:05:30.054\nI get three weeks to design a telephone.\nHow the hell do I do that,\n\n00:05:30.078 --> 00:05:33.674\nwhen you get these things that take\nhundreds of millions of years to evolve?\n\n00:05:33.698 --> 00:05:35.094\nHow do you condense that?\n\n00:05:35.118 --> 00:05:36.654\nIt comes back to instinct.\n\n00:05:36.678 --> 00:05:39.614\nI'm not talking about designing\ntelephones that look like that\n\n00:05:39.638 --> 00:05:42.258\nand I'm not looking\nat designing architecture like that.\n\n00:05:42.282 --> 00:05:44.494\nI'm just interested\nin natural growth patterns\n\n00:05:44.518 --> 00:05:48.694\nand the beautiful forms\nthat only nature really creates.\n\n00:05:48.718 --> 00:05:51.494\nHow that flows through me\nand how that comes out\n\n00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:53.134\nis what I'm trying to understand.\n\n00:05:53.158 --> 00:05:56.054\nThis is a scan through the human forearm.\n\n00:05:56.078 --> 00:05:59.094\nIt's then blown up\nthrough rapid prototyping\n\n00:05:59.118 --> 00:06:00.694\nto reveal its cellular structure.\n\n00:06:00.718 --> 00:06:02.214\nI have these in my office.\n\n00:06:02.238 --> 00:06:05.254\nMy office is a mixture\nof the Natural History Museum\n\n00:06:05.278 --> 00:06:06.934\nand a NASA space lab.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.774\nIt's a weird, kind of freaky place.\n\n00:06:09.798 --> 00:06:11.894\nThis is one of my specimens.\n\n00:06:11.918 --> 00:06:13.134\nThis is made --\n\n00:06:13.158 --> 00:06:19.934\nbone is made from a mixture\nof inorganic minerals and polymers.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:24.694\nI studied cooking in school\nfor four years, and in that experience,\n\n00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:26.433\nwhich was called \"domestic science,\"\n\n00:06:26.457 --> 00:06:30.029\nit was a bit of a cheap trick for me\nto try and get a science qualification.\n\n00:06:30.053 --> 00:06:31.614\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:31.638 --> 00:06:34.334\nActually, I put marijuana\nin everything I cooked --\n\n00:06:34.358 --> 00:06:35.574\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:35.598 --> 00:06:38.218\nAnd I had access to all\nthe best girls. It was fabulous.\n\n00:06:38.242 --> 00:06:40.623\nAll the guys in the rugby team\ncouldn't understand.\n\n00:06:40.647 --> 00:06:42.214\nAnyway -- this is a meringue.\n\n00:06:42.238 --> 00:06:43.694\nThis is another sample I have.\n\n00:06:43.718 --> 00:06:47.094\nA meringue is made exactly the same way,\nin my estimation, as a bone.\n\n00:06:47.118 --> 00:06:50.774\nIt's made from\npolysaccharides and proteins.\n\n00:06:50.798 --> 00:06:52.974\nIf you pour water on that, it dissolves.\n\n00:06:52.998 --> 00:06:56.654\nCould we be manufacturing\nfrom foodstuffs in the future?\n\n00:06:56.678 --> 00:06:58.454\nNot a bad idea. I don't know.\n\n00:06:58.478 --> 00:07:01.240\nI need to talk to Janine\nand a few other people about that,\n\n00:07:01.264 --> 00:07:05.054\nbut I believe instinctively that\nthat meringue can become something,\n\n00:07:05.078 --> 00:07:06.278\na car -- I don't know.\n\n00:07:07.276 --> 00:07:09.134\nI'm also interested in growth patterns:\n\n00:07:09.158 --> 00:07:13.654\nthe unbridled way that nature grows things\n\n00:07:13.678 --> 00:07:16.254\nso you're not restricted by form at all.\n\n00:07:16.278 --> 00:07:19.934\nThese interrelated forms,\nthey do inspire everything I do,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:23.414\nalthough I might end up\nmaking something incredibly simple.\n\n00:07:23.438 --> 00:07:26.654\nThis is a detail of a chair\nthat I've designed in magnesium.\n\n00:07:26.678 --> 00:07:31.734\nIt shows this interlocution of elements\nand the beauty of, kind of, engineering\n\n00:07:31.758 --> 00:07:33.743\nand biological thinking,\n\n00:07:33.767 --> 00:07:35.854\nshown pretty much as a bone structure.\n\n00:07:35.878 --> 00:07:38.694\nAny one of those elements\nyou could sort of hang on the wall\n\n00:07:38.718 --> 00:07:40.374\nas some kind of art object.\n\n00:07:40.398 --> 00:07:43.174\nIt's the world's first chair\nmade in magnesium.\n\n00:07:43.198 --> 00:07:45.254\nIt cost 1.7 million dollars to develop.\n\n00:07:45.278 --> 00:07:48.254\nIt's called \"Go,\" by Bernhardt, USA.\n\n00:07:48.278 --> 00:07:54.014\nIt went into Time magazine in 2001\nas the new language of the 21st century.\n\n00:07:54.038 --> 00:07:57.838\nBoy. For somebody growing up in Wales\nin a little village, that's enough.\n\n00:07:59.158 --> 00:08:02.134\nIt shows how you make one holistic form,\nlike the car industry,\n\n00:08:02.158 --> 00:08:03.873\nand then you break up what you need.\n\n00:08:03.897 --> 00:08:06.094\nThis is an absolutely\nbeautiful way of working.\n\n00:08:06.118 --> 00:08:08.374\nIt's a godly way of working.\n\n00:08:08.398 --> 00:08:10.654\nIt's organic and it's essential.\n\n00:08:10.678 --> 00:08:12.345\nIt's an absolutely fat-free design,\n\n00:08:12.369 --> 00:08:16.254\nand when you look at it,\nyou see human beings.\n\n00:08:16.278 --> 00:08:17.707\nWhen that moves into polymers,\n\n00:08:17.731 --> 00:08:22.094\nyou can change the elasticity,\nthe fluidity of the form.\n\n00:08:22.118 --> 00:08:25.734\nThis is an idea for a gas-injected,\none-piece polymer chair.\n\n00:08:25.758 --> 00:08:28.534\nWhat nature does\nis it drills holes in things.\n\n00:08:28.558 --> 00:08:29.774\nIt liberates form.\n\n00:08:29.798 --> 00:08:31.894\nIt takes away anything extraneous.\n\n00:08:31.918 --> 00:08:33.134\nThat's what I do.\n\n00:08:33.158 --> 00:08:35.574\nI make organic things which are essential.\n\n00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:39.694\nAnd they look funky, too --\nbut I don't set out to make funky things\n\n00:08:39.718 --> 00:08:41.774\nbecause I think\nthat's an absolute disgrace.\n\n00:08:41.798 --> 00:08:43.894\nI set out to look at natural forms.\n\n00:08:43.918 --> 00:08:47.894\nIf you took the idea of fractal technology\nfurther, take a membrane,\n\n00:08:47.918 --> 00:08:50.613\nshrinking it down constantly\nlike nature does --\n\n00:08:50.637 --> 00:08:52.214\nthat could be a seat for a chair.\n\n00:08:52.238 --> 00:08:54.014\nIt could be a sole for a sports shoe.\n\n00:08:54.038 --> 00:08:56.894\nIt could be a car blending into seats.\n\n00:08:56.918 --> 00:08:59.574\nWow. Let's go for it.\nThat's the kind of stuff.\n\n00:08:59.598 --> 00:09:01.414\nThis is what exists in nature.\n\n00:09:01.438 --> 00:09:06.374\nObservation now allows us\nto bring that natural process\n\n00:09:06.398 --> 00:09:08.414\ninto the design process every day.\n\n00:09:08.438 --> 00:09:09.654\nThat's what I do.\n\n00:09:09.678 --> 00:09:11.734\nThis is a show\nthat's currently on in Tokyo.\n\n00:09:11.758 --> 00:09:15.414\nIt's called \"Superliquidity.\"\nIt's my sculptural investigation.\n\n00:09:15.438 --> 00:09:18.094\nIt's like 21st-century Henry Moore.\n\n00:09:18.118 --> 00:09:21.934\nWhen you see a Henry Moore, still,\nyour hair stands up.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.174\nThere's some amazing spiritual connect.\n\n00:09:24.198 --> 00:09:28.094\nIf he was a car designer,\nphew, we'd all be driving one.\n\n00:09:28.118 --> 00:09:31.294\nIn his day, he was\nthe highest taxpayer in Britain.\n\n00:09:31.318 --> 00:09:33.694\nThat is the power of organic design.\n\n00:09:33.718 --> 00:09:37.118\nIt contributes immensely to our --\n\n00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:40.214\nsense of being,\n\n00:09:40.238 --> 00:09:42.096\nour sense of relationships with things,\n\n00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.294\nour sensuality and,\nyou know, the sort of --\n\n00:09:44.318 --> 00:09:48.334\neven the sort of socio-erotic side,\nwhich is very important.\n\n00:09:48.358 --> 00:09:50.854\nThis is my artwork.\nThis is all my process.\n\n00:09:50.878 --> 00:09:54.894\nThese actually are sold as artwork.\nThey're very big prints.\n\n00:09:54.918 --> 00:09:57.414\nBut this is how I get to that object.\n\n00:09:57.438 --> 00:10:00.614\nIronically, that object was made\nby the Killarney process,\n\n00:10:00.638 --> 00:10:03.254\nwhich is a brand-new process here\nfor the 21st century,\n\n00:10:03.278 --> 00:10:06.294\nand I can hear Greg Lynn\nlaughing his socks off as I say that.\n\n00:10:06.318 --> 00:10:08.014\nI'll tell you about that later.\n\n00:10:08.038 --> 00:10:11.814\nWhen I look into these data images,\n\n00:10:11.838 --> 00:10:13.574\nI see new things.\n\n00:10:13.598 --> 00:10:16.174\nIt's self-inspired.\n\n00:10:16.198 --> 00:10:18.054\nDiatomic structures, radiolaria,\n\n00:10:18.078 --> 00:10:20.507\nthe things that we couldn't see\nbut we can do now --\n\n00:10:20.531 --> 00:10:21.867\nthese, again, are cored out.\n\n00:10:21.891 --> 00:10:25.294\nThey're made virtually from nothing.\nThey're made from silica.\n\n00:10:25.318 --> 00:10:27.494\nWhy not structures from cars like that?\n\n00:10:27.518 --> 00:10:30.614\nCoral, all these natural forces,\n\n00:10:30.638 --> 00:10:35.814\ntake away what they don't need\nand they deliver maximum beauty.\n\n00:10:35.838 --> 00:10:38.094\nWe need to be in that realm.\n\n00:10:38.118 --> 00:10:40.494\nI want to do stuff like that.\n\n00:10:40.518 --> 00:10:43.566\nThis is a new chair which should\ncome on the market in September.\n\n00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:47.414\nIt's for a company called Moroso in Italy.\nIt's a gas-injected polymer chair.\n\n00:10:47.438 --> 00:10:50.094\nThose holes you see there\nare very filtered-down,\n\n00:10:50.118 --> 00:10:54.134\nwatered-down versions of the extremity\nof the diatomic structures.\n\n00:10:54.158 --> 00:10:56.682\nIt goes with the flow\nof the polymer and you'll see --\n\n00:10:56.706 --> 00:10:59.694\nthere's an image coming up\nright now that shows the full thing.\n\n00:10:59.718 --> 00:11:03.614\nIt's great to have companies in Italy\nwho support this way of dreaming.\n\n00:11:03.638 --> 00:11:05.789\nIf you see the shadows\nthat come through that,\n\n00:11:05.813 --> 00:11:08.535\nthey're actually probably\nmore important than the product,\n\n00:11:08.559 --> 00:11:09.996\nbut it's the minimum it takes.\n\n00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.294\nThe coring out of the back\nlets you breathe.\n\n00:11:12.318 --> 00:11:14.271\nIt takes away any material you don't need\n\n00:11:14.295 --> 00:11:16.575\nand it actually garners flexure too.\n\n00:11:18.278 --> 00:11:21.374\nI was going to break into a dance then.\n\n00:11:21.398 --> 00:11:23.334\nThis is some current work I'm doing.\n\n00:11:23.358 --> 00:11:25.414\nI'm looking at single-surface structures\n\n00:11:25.438 --> 00:11:28.134\nand how they stretch and flow.\n\n00:11:28.158 --> 00:11:33.638\nIt's based on furniture typologies,\nbut that's not the end motivation.\n\n00:11:33.998 --> 00:11:35.598\nIt's made from aluminum ...\n\n00:11:36.758 --> 00:11:40.014\nas opposed to aluminium, and it's grown.\n\n00:11:40.038 --> 00:11:41.254\nIt's grown in my mind,\n\n00:11:41.278 --> 00:11:45.854\nand then it's grown in terms\nof the whole process that I go through.\n\n00:11:45.878 --> 00:11:50.534\nThis is two weeks ago in CCP in Coventry,\nwho build parts for Bentleys and so on.\n\n00:11:50.558 --> 00:11:52.734\nIt's being built as we speak\n\n00:11:52.758 --> 00:11:55.734\nand it will be on show in Phillips\nnext year in New York.\n\n00:11:55.758 --> 00:11:58.614\nI have a big show\nwith Phillips Auctioneers.\n\n00:11:58.638 --> 00:12:01.614\nWhen I see these animations,\noh Jesus, I'm blown away.\n\n00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:03.654\nThis is what goes on\nin my studio everyday.\n\n00:12:03.678 --> 00:12:05.454\nI walk -- I'm traveling. I come back.\n\n00:12:05.478 --> 00:12:08.812\nSome guy's got that on a computer --\nthere's this like, oh my goodness.\n\n00:12:08.836 --> 00:12:12.574\nSo I try to create this energy\nof invention every day in my studio.\n\n00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:14.614\nThis kind of effervescent --\n\n00:12:14.638 --> 00:12:20.214\nfully charged sense of soup\nthat delivers ideas.\n\n00:12:20.238 --> 00:12:22.214\nSingle-surface products.\n\n00:12:22.238 --> 00:12:23.934\nFurniture's a good one.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.774\nHow you grow legs out of a surface.\n\n00:12:26.798 --> 00:12:28.418\nI would love to build this one day\n\n00:12:28.442 --> 00:12:31.414\nand perhaps I'd like\nto build it also out of flour, sugar,\n\n00:12:31.438 --> 00:12:35.054\npolymer, wood chips --\nI don't know, human hair.\n\n00:12:35.078 --> 00:12:38.774\nI don't know. I'd love a go at that.\nI don't know. If I just got some time.\n\n00:12:38.798 --> 00:12:42.614\nThat's the weird side coming out again.\nA lot of companies don't understand that.\n\n00:12:42.638 --> 00:12:45.334\nThree weeks ago I was with Sony in Tokyo.\n\n00:12:45.358 --> 00:12:48.755\nThey said, \"Give us the dream.\nWhat is our dream? How do we beat Apple?\"\n\n00:12:48.779 --> 00:12:50.978\nI said, \"You don't copy Apple,\nthat's for sure.\n\n00:12:51.002 --> 00:12:52.262\nYou get into biopolymers.\"\n\n00:12:52.286 --> 00:12:53.921\nThey looked straight through me.\n\n00:12:54.878 --> 00:12:56.694\nWhat a waste. Anyway.\n\n00:12:56.718 --> 00:12:57.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:01.174\nNo, it's true. Fuck them.\nYou know, I mean --\n\n00:13:01.198 --> 00:13:02.534\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:02.558 --> 00:13:04.774\nI'm delivering; they're not taking.\n\n00:13:04.798 --> 00:13:06.334\nI've had this image 20 years.\n\n00:13:06.358 --> 00:13:09.974\nI've had this image of a water droplet\nfor 20 years, sitting on a hot bed.\n\n00:13:09.998 --> 00:13:11.774\nThat is an image of a car for me.\n\n00:13:11.798 --> 00:13:14.179\nThat's the car of the future.\nIt's a water droplet.\n\n00:13:14.203 --> 00:13:16.774\nI've been banging on about this\nlike I can't believe.\n\n00:13:16.798 --> 00:13:18.014\nCars are all wrong.\n\n00:13:18.038 --> 00:13:20.277\nI'm going to show you\nsomething a bit weird now.\n\n00:13:20.301 --> 00:13:22.894\nThey laughed everywhere\nover the world I showed this.\n\n00:13:22.918 --> 00:13:24.974\nThe only place\nthat didn't laugh was Moscow.\n\n00:13:24.998 --> 00:13:26.814\nCars are made from 30,000 components.\n\n00:13:26.838 --> 00:13:32.494\nHow ridiculous is that?\nCouldn't you make that from 300?\n\n00:13:32.518 --> 00:13:35.654\nIt's got a vacuum-formed,\ncarbon-nylon pan.\n\n00:13:35.678 --> 00:13:39.210\nEverything's holistically integrated.\nIt opens and closes like a bread bin.\n\n00:13:39.234 --> 00:13:41.717\nThere is no engine.\nThere's a solar panel on the back\n\n00:13:41.741 --> 00:13:45.041\nand there are batteries in the wheels;\nthey're fitted like Formula 1.\n\n00:13:45.065 --> 00:13:47.875\nYou take them off your wall,\nyou plug them in. Off you go.\n\n00:13:47.899 --> 00:13:50.614\nA three-wheeled car: slow, feminine,\n\n00:13:50.638 --> 00:13:52.877\ntransparent, so you can see\nthe people in there.\n\n00:13:52.901 --> 00:13:54.378\nYou drive different.\n\n00:13:54.402 --> 00:13:56.574\nYou see that thing. You do. You do.\n\n00:13:56.598 --> 00:13:59.294\nAnd not anesthetized, separated from life.\n\n00:13:59.318 --> 00:14:02.614\nThere's a hole at the front\nand there's a reason for that.\n\n00:14:02.638 --> 00:14:06.054\nIt's a city car.\nYou drive along. You get out.\n\n00:14:06.078 --> 00:14:08.678\nYou drive on to a proboscis.

But if you know anything about the history of Britannica since 1962, it was anything but radical: still a very completely safe, stodgy type of encyclopedia. Wikipedia, on the other hand, begins with a very radical idea, and that's for all of us to imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge.And that's what we're doing. So Wikipedia \u2014 you just saw the little demonstration of it \u2014 it's a freely licensed encyclopedia. It's written by thousands of volunteers all over the world in many, many languages. It's written using wiki software \u2014 which is the type of software he just demonstrated \u2014 so anyone can quickly edit and save, and it goes live on the Internet immediately. And everything about Wikipedia is managed by virtually an all-volunteer staff. So when Yochai is talking about new methods of organization, he's exactly describing Wikipedia. And what I'm going to do today is tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside.So Wikipedia's owned by the Wikimedia Foundation, which I founded, a nonprofit organization. And our goal, the core aim of the Wikimedia Foundation, is to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet. And so, if you think about what that means, it means a lot more than just building a cool website. We're really interested in all the issues of the digital divide, poverty worldwide, empowering people everywhere to have the information that they need to make good decisions. And so we're going to have to do a lot of work that goes beyond just the Internet. And so that's a big part of why we've chosen the free licensing model, because that empowers local entrepreneurs or anyone who wants to \u2014 they can take our content and do anything they like with it \u2014 you can copy it, redistribute it \u2014 and you can do it commercially or non-commercially.So there's a lot of opportunities that are going to arise around Wikipedia all over the world. We're funded by donations from the public, and one of the more interesting things about that is how little money it actually takes to run Wikipedia. So Yochai showed you the graph of what the cost of a printing press was. And I'm going to tell you what the cost of Wikipedia is. But first, I'll show you how big it is. So we've got over 600,000 articles in English. We've got two million total articles across many, many different languages. The biggest languages are German, Japanese, French \u2014 all the Western-European languages are quite big. But only around one-third of all of our traffic to our web clusters to the English Wikipedia, which is surprising to a lot of people. A lot of people think in a very English-centric way on the Internet, but for us, we're truly global. We're in many, many languages. How popular we've gotten to be \u2014 we're a top-50 website and we're more popular than the New York Times. So this is where we get to Yochai's discussion.This shows the growth of Wikipedia \u2014 we're the blue line there \u2014 and this is the New York Times over there. And what's interesting about this is the New York Times website is a huge, enormous corporate operation with I have no idea how many hundreds of employees. We have exactly one employee, and that employee is our lead software developer. And he's only been our employee since January 2005, all the other growth before that ... So the servers are managed by a ragtag band of volunteers. All the editing is done by volunteers. And the way that we're organized is not like any traditional organization you can imagine. People are always asking, \"Well, who's in charge of this?\" or \"Who does that?\" And the answer is: anybody who wants to pitch in. It's a very unusual and chaotic thing. We've got over 90 servers now in three locations. These are managed by volunteer system administrators who are online. I can go online any time of the day or night and see eight to 10 people waiting for me to ask a question or something, anything about the servers. You could never afford to do this in a company. You could never afford to have a standby crew of people 24 hours a day and do what we're doing at Wikipedia.So we're doing around 1.4 billion page views monthly, so it's really gotten to be a huge thing. And everything is managed by the volunteers. And the total monthly cost for our bandwidth is about 5,000 dollars. And that's essentially our main cost. We could actually do without the employee. We hired Brian because he was working part-time for two years and full-time at Wikipedia, so we actually hired him, so he could get a life and go to the movies sometimes. So the big question when you've got this really chaotic organization is, why isn't it all rubbish? Why is the website as good as it is?First of all, how good is it? Well, it's pretty good. It isn't perfect, but it's much better than you would expect, given our completely chaotic model. So when you saw him make a ridiculous edit to the page about me, you think, \"Oh, this is obviously just going to degenerate into rubbish.\" But when we've seen quality tests \u2014 and there haven't been enough of these yet and I'm really encouraging people to do more, comparing Wikipedia to traditional things \u2014 we win hands down.So a German magazine compared German Wikipedia, which is much, much smaller than English, to Microsoft Encarta and to Brockhaus multimedial, and we won across the board. They hired experts to come and look at articles and compare the quality, and we were very pleased with that result.So a lot of people have heard about the Wikipedia Bush-Kerry controversy. The media has covered this somewhat extensively. It started out with an article in Red Herring. The reporters called me up and they \u2014 I mean, I have to say they spelled my name right, but they really wanted to say the Bush-Kerry election is so contentious, it's tearing apart the Wikipedia community. And so they quote me as saying, \"They're the most contentious in the history of Wikipedia.\" What I actually said is they're not contentious at all. So it's a slight misquote.(Laughter)The articles were edited quite heavily. And it is true that we did have to lock the articles on a couple of occasions. Time magazine recently reported that \"Extreme action sometimes has to be taken, and Wales locked the entries on Kerry and Bush for most of 2004.\" This came after I told the reporter that we had to lock it for \u2014 occasionally a little bit here and there. So the truth in general is that the kinds of controversies that you would probably think we have within the Wikipedia community are not really controversies at all.Articles on controversial topics are edited a lot, but they don't cause much controversy within the community. And the reason for this is that most people understand the need for neutrality. The real struggle is not between the right and the left \u2014 that's where most people assume \u2014 but it's between the party of the thoughtful and the party of the jerks. And no side of the political spectrum has a monopoly on either of those qualities. The actual truth about the specific Bush-Kerry incident is that the Bush-Kerry articles were locked less than one percent of the time in 2004, and it wasn't because they were contentious; it was just because there was routine vandalism \u2014 which happens sometimes even on stage ...(Laughter)Sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalized Wikipedia and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly. And I said \u2014 you know, I always say, please don't do that. That's not a good thing. So how do we do this? How do we manage the quality control? How does it work?So there's a few elements, mostly social policies and some elements of the software. So the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point of view policy. This is something that I set down, from the very beginning, as a core principle of the community that's completely not debatable. It's a social concept of cooperation, so we don't talk a lot about truth and objectivity. The reason for this is if we say we're only going to write the \"truth\" about some topic, that doesn't do us a damn bit of good of figuring out what to write, because I don't agree with you about what's the truth. But we have this jargon term of neutrality, which has its own long history within the community, which basically says, any time there's a controversial issue, Wikipedia itself should not take a stand on the issue. We should merely report on what reputable parties have said about it. So this neutrality policy is really important for us because it empowers a community that is very diverse to come together and actually get some work done.So we have very diverse contributors in terms of political, religious, cultural backgrounds. By having this firm neutrality policy, which is non-negotiable from the beginning, we ensure that people can work together and that the entries don't become simply a war back and forth between the left and the right. If you engage in that type of behavior, you'll be asked to leave the community.So, real-time peer review. Every single change on the site goes to the \"Recent changes\" page. So as soon as he made his change, it went to the \"Recent changes\" page. That recent changes page was also fed into an IRC channel, which is an Internet chat channel that people are monitoring with various software tools. And people can get RSS feeds \u2014 they can get email notifications of changes. And then users can set up their own personal watch list. So my page is on quite a few volunteers' watch lists, because it is sometimes vandalized. And therefore, what happens is someone will notice the change very quickly, and then they'll just simply revert the change.There's a \"new pages feed,\" for example, so you can go to a certain page of Wikipedia and see every new page as it's created. This is really important because a lot of new pages are just garbage that has to be deleted, you know, \"ASDFASDF.\" But also, that's some of the most interesting and fun things, some of the new articles. People will start an article on some interesting topic, other people will find that intriguing and jump in and help and make it much better.So we do have edits by anonymous users, which is one of the most controversial and intriguing things about Wikipedia. So, Chris was able to do his change \u2014 he didn't have to log in or anything; he just went on the website and made a change. But it turns out that only about 18 percent of all the edits to the website are done by anonymous users. And that's a really important thing to understand: the vast majority of the edits that go on on the website are from a very close-knit community of maybe 600 to 1,000 people who are in constant communication. And we have over 40 IRC channels, 40 mailing lists. All these people know each other. They communicate. We have off-line meetings.These are the people who are doing the bulk of the site, and they are, in a sense, semi-professionals at what they're doing. The standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality. We don't always meet those standards, but that's what we're striving for.And so that tight community is who really cares for the site, and these are some of the smartest people I've ever met. It's my job to say that, but it's actually true. The type of people who were drawn to writing an encyclopedia for fun tend to be pretty smart people.The tools and the software: there's lots of tools that allow us \u2014 allow us, meaning the community \u2014 to self-monitor and to monitor all the work. This is an example of a page history on \"flat Earth,\" and you can see some changes that were made. What's nice about this page is you can immediately take a look at this and see, \"OK, I understand now.\" When somebody goes and looks at \u2014 they see that someone, an anonymous IP number, made an edit to my page. That sounds suspicious. Who is this person? Somebody looks at it \u2014 they can immediately see highlighted in red all of the changes that took place \u2014 to see, OK, well, these words have changed, things like this. So that's one tool that we can use to very quickly monitor the history of a page.Another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very open-ended. Most of the social rules and the methods of work are left completely open-ended in the software. All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages. And so there's nothing in the software that enforces the rules. The example I've got up here is the Votes for Deletion page. So, I mentioned earlier, people type \"ASDFASDF\" \u2014 it needs to be deleted. Cases like that, the administrators just delete it. There's no reason to have a big argument about it. But you can imagine there's a lot of other areas where the question is, is this notable enough to go in an encyclopedia? Is the information verifiable? Is it a hoax? Is it true? Is it what? So we needed a social method for figuring out the answer to this. And so the method that arose organically within the community is the Votes For Deletion page. And in the particular example we have here, it's a film, \"Twisted Issues,\" and the first person says, \"Now this is supposedly a film. It fails the Google test miserably.\" The Google test is you look in Google and see if it's there, because if something's not even in Google, it probably doesn't exist at all. It's not a perfect rule, but it's a nice starting point for quick research. So somebody says, \"Delete it, please. Delete it \u2014 it's not notable.\" And then somebody says, \"Wait, I found it. I found it in a book, 'Film Threat Video Guide: the 20 Underground Films You Must See.'\" So the next persons says, \"Clean it up.\" Somebody says, \"I've found it on IMDB. Keep, keep, keep.\"And what's interesting about this is that the software is \u2014 these votes are just text typed into a page. This is not really a vote so much as it is a dialogue. Now it is true that at the end of the day, an administrator can go through here and take a look at this and say, \"OK, 18 deletes, two keeps: we'll delete it.\" But in other cases, this could be 18 deletes and two keeps, and we would keep it, because if those last two keeps say, \"Wait a minute. Nobody else saw this but I found it in a book, and I found a link to a page that describes it, and I'm going to clean it up tomorrow, so please don't delete it,\" then it would survive.And it also matters who the people are who are voting. Like I say, it's a tight-knit community. Down here at the bottom, \"Keep, real movie,\" RickK. RickK is a very famous Wikipedian who does an enormous amount of work with vandalism, hoaxes and votes for deletion. His voice carries a lot of weight within the community because he knows what he's doing. So how is all this governed? People really want to know about administrators, things like that. So the Wikipedia governance model, the governance of the community, is a very confusing, but workable mix of consensus \u2014 meaning we try not to vote on the content of articles, because the majority view is not necessarily neutral \u2014 some amount of democracy \u2014 all of the administrators \u2014 these are the people who have the ability to delete pages. That doesn't mean that they have the right to delete pages. They still have to follow all the rules \u2014 but they're elected by the community.Sometimes people \u2014 random trolls on the Internet \u2014 like to accuse me of handpicking the administrators to bias the content of the encyclopedia. I always laugh at this, because I have no idea how they're elected, actually. There's a certain amount of aristocracy. You got a hint of that when I mentioned, like, RickK's voice would carry a lot more weight than someone we don't know.I give this talk sometimes with Angela, who was just re-elected to the board from the community \u2014 to the Board of the Foundation, with more than twice the votes of the person who didn't make it. And I always embarrass her because I say, \"Well, Angela, for example, could get away with doing absolutely anything within Wikipedia, because she's so admired and so powerful.\" But the irony is, of course, that Angela can do this because she's the one person who you know would never, ever break any rules of Wikipedia. And I also like to say she's the only person who actually knows all the rules of Wikipedia, so ... And then there's monarchy, and that's my role on the community, so ...(Laughter)I was describing this in Berlin once, and the next day in the newspaper the headline said, \"I am the Queen of England.\"(Laughter)And that's not exactly what I said, but \u2014(Laughter)the point is my role in the community \u2014 Within the free software world, there's been a long-standing tradition of the \"benevolent dictator\" model. So if you look at most of the major free software projects, they have one single person in charge who everyone agrees is the benevolent dictator. Well, I don't like the term \"benevolent dictator,\" and I don't think that it's my job or my role in the world of ideas to be the dictator of the future of all human knowledge compiled by the world. It just isn't appropriate. But there is a need still for a certain amount of monarchy, a certain amount of \u2014 sometimes we have to make a decision and we don't want to get bogged down too heavily in formal decision-making processes.So as an example of how this can be important: we recently had a situation where a neo-Nazi website discovered Wikipedia, and they said, \"Oh, well, this is horrible, this Jewish conspiracy of a website, and we're going to get certain articles deleted that we don't like. And we see they have a voting process, so we're going to send \u2014 we have 40,000 members and we're going to send them over and they're all going to vote and get these pages deleted.\" Well, they managed to get 18 people to show up. That's neo-Nazi math for you. They always think they've got 40,000 members when they've got 18. But they managed to get 18 people to come and vote in a fairly absurd way to delete a perfectly valid article. Of course, the vote ended up being about 85 to 18, so there was no real danger to our democratic processes. On the other hand, people said, \"But what are we going to do? I mean, this could happen. What if some group gets really seriously organized and comes in and wants to vote?\" Then I said, \"Well, fuck it, we'll just change the rules.\" That's my job in the community: to say we won't allow our openness and freedom to undermine the quality of the content. And so, as long as people trust me in my role, then that's a valid place for me. Of course, because of the free licensing, if I do a bad job, the volunteers are more than happy to take and leave \u2014 I can't tell anyone what to do.So the final point here is that to understand how Wikipedia works, it's important to understand that our wiki model is the way we work, but we are not fanatical web anarchists. In fact, we're very flexible about the social methodology, because ultimately, the passion of the community is for the quality of the work, not necessarily for the process that we use to generate it.Thank you.(Applause)Ben Saunders: Yeah, hi, Ben Saunders. Jimmy, you mentioned impartiality being a key to Wikipedia's success. It strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased. Have you found Wikipedia being used by teachers and how do you see Wikipedia changing education?Jimmy Wales: Yeah, so, a lot of teachers are beginning to use Wikipedia. There's a media storyline about Wikipedia, which I think is false. It builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers. And the storyline is, there's this crazy thing, Wikipedia, but academics hate it and teachers hate it. And that turns out to not be true. The last time I got an email from a journalist saying, \"Why do academics hate Wikipedia?\" I sent it from my Harvard email address because I was recently appointed a fellow there. And I said, \"Well, they don't all hate it.\"(Laughter)But I think there's going to be huge impacts. And we actually have a project that I'm personally really excited about, which is the Wikibooks project, which is an effort to create textbooks in all the languages. And that's a much bigger project. It's going to take 20 years or so to come to fruition.But part of that is to fulfill our mission of giving an encyclopedia to every single person on the planet. We don't mean we're going to Spam them with AOL-style CDs. We mean we're going to give them a tool that they can use. And for a lot of people in the world, if I give you an encyclopedia that's written at a university level, it doesn't do you any good without a whole host of literacy materials to build you up to the point where you can actually use it. The Wikibooks project is an effort to do that. And I think that we're going to see \u2014 it may not even come from us; there's all kinds of innovation going on. But freely licensed textbooks are the next big thing in education.", "id": 37, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.518 --> 00:00:15.653\nCharles Van Doren, who was later\na senior editor of Britannica,\n\n00:00:15.677 --> 00:00:18.854\nsaid the ideal encyclopedia\nshould be radical --\n\n00:00:18.878 --> 00:00:20.414\nit should stop being safe.\n\n00:00:20.438 --> 00:00:23.654\nBut if you know anything about the history\nof Britannica since 1962,\n\n00:00:23.678 --> 00:00:25.014\nit was anything but radical:\n\n00:00:25.038 --> 00:00:29.934\nstill a very completely safe,\nstodgy type of encyclopedia.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:34.134\nWikipedia, on the other hand,\nbegins with a very radical idea,\n\n00:00:34.158 --> 00:00:36.174\nand that's for all of us\nto imagine a world\n\n00:00:36.198 --> 00:00:38.214\nin which every single person on the planet\n\n00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:40.814\nis given free access\nto the sum of all human knowledge.\n\n00:00:40.838 --> 00:00:42.172\nAnd that's what we're doing.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.117\nSo Wikipedia --\n\n00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:46.574\nyou just saw the little\ndemonstration of it --\n\n00:00:46.598 --> 00:00:48.694\nit's a freely licensed encyclopedia.\n\n00:00:48.718 --> 00:00:50.576\nIt's written by thousands of volunteers\n\n00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.600\nall over the world\nin many, many languages.\n\n00:00:53.278 --> 00:00:55.014\nIt's written using wiki software --\n\n00:00:55.038 --> 00:00:57.594\nwhich is the type of software\nhe just demonstrated --\n\n00:00:57.618 --> 00:00:59.333\nso anyone can quickly edit and save,\n\n00:00:59.357 --> 00:01:01.453\nand it goes live\non the Internet immediately.\n\n00:01:02.598 --> 00:01:07.214\nAnd everything about Wikipedia is managed\nby virtually an all-volunteer staff.\n\n00:01:07.238 --> 00:01:11.654\nSo when Yochai is talking\nabout new methods of organization,\n\n00:01:11.678 --> 00:01:14.174\nhe's exactly describing Wikipedia.\n\n00:01:14.198 --> 00:01:15.627\nAnd what I'm going to do today\n\n00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:19.051\nis tell you a little bit more\nabout how it really works on the inside.\n\n00:01:19.918 --> 00:01:23.054\nSo Wikipedia's owned\nby the Wikimedia Foundation,\n\n00:01:23.078 --> 00:01:24.294\nwhich I founded,\n\n00:01:24.318 --> 00:01:25.734\na nonprofit organization.\n\n00:01:25.758 --> 00:01:29.774\nAnd our goal, the core aim\nof the Wikimedia Foundation,\n\n00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:32.974\nis to get a free encyclopedia\nto every single person on the planet.\n\n00:01:32.998 --> 00:01:35.014\nAnd so, if you think\nabout what that means,\n\n00:01:35.038 --> 00:01:37.574\nit means a lot more\nthan just building a cool website.\n\n00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:40.614\nWe're really interested\nin all the issues of the digital divide,\n\n00:01:40.638 --> 00:01:42.214\npoverty worldwide,\n\n00:01:42.238 --> 00:01:45.614\nempowering people everywhere\nto have the information that they need\n\n00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:46.854\nto make good decisions.\n\n00:01:46.878 --> 00:01:49.454\nAnd so we're going\nto have to do a lot of work\n\n00:01:49.478 --> 00:01:51.174\nthat goes beyond just the Internet.\n\n00:01:51.198 --> 00:01:54.494\nAnd so that's a big part of why\nwe've chosen the free licensing model,\n\n00:01:54.518 --> 00:01:57.757\nbecause that empowers local\nentrepreneurs or anyone who wants to --\n\n00:01:57.781 --> 00:02:00.693\nthey can take our content\nand do anything they like with it --\n\n00:02:00.717 --> 00:02:02.399\nyou can copy it, redistribute it --\n\n00:02:02.423 --> 00:02:04.835\nand you can do it\ncommercially or non-commercially.\n\n00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:08.359\nSo there's a lot of opportunities\nthat are going to arise around Wikipedia\n\n00:02:08.383 --> 00:02:09.578\nall over the world.\n\n00:02:10.438 --> 00:02:12.454\nWe're funded by donations from the public,\n\n00:02:12.478 --> 00:02:14.934\nand one of the more\ninteresting things about that\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:18.774\nis how little money\nit actually takes to run Wikipedia.\n\n00:02:18.798 --> 00:02:23.334\nSo Yochai showed you the graph\nof what the cost of a printing press was.\n\n00:02:23.358 --> 00:02:26.694\nAnd I'm going to tell you\nwhat the cost of Wikipedia is.\n\n00:02:26.718 --> 00:02:28.576\nBut first, I'll show you how big it is.\n\n00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.560\nSo we've got over 600,000\narticles in English.\n\n00:02:32.998 --> 00:02:37.454\nWe've got two million total articles\nacross many, many different languages.\n\n00:02:37.478 --> 00:02:40.734\nThe biggest languages\nare German, Japanese, French --\n\n00:02:40.758 --> 00:02:44.454\nall the Western-European\nlanguages are quite big.\n\n00:02:44.478 --> 00:02:47.854\nBut only around one-third\nof all of our traffic to our web\n\n00:02:47.878 --> 00:02:49.514\nclusters to the English Wikipedia,\n\n00:02:49.538 --> 00:02:51.396\nwhich is surprising to a lot of people.\n\n00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.774\nA lot of people think in a very\nEnglish-centric way on the Internet,\n\n00:02:54.798 --> 00:02:56.694\nbut for us, we're truly global.\n\n00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:58.291\nWe're in many, many languages.\n\n00:02:58.838 --> 00:03:01.974\nHow popular we've gotten to be --\nwe're a top-50 website\n\n00:03:01.998 --> 00:03:04.189\nand we're more popular\nthan the New York Times.\n\n00:03:04.213 --> 00:03:08.453\nSo this is where we get\nto Yochai's discussion.\n\n00:03:08.918 --> 00:03:12.254\nThis shows the growth of Wikipedia --\nwe're the blue line there --\n\n00:03:12.278 --> 00:03:14.974\nand this is the New York Times over there.\n\n00:03:14.998 --> 00:03:16.574\nAnd what's interesting about this\n\n00:03:16.598 --> 00:03:20.934\nis the New York Times website is a huge,\nenormous corporate operation\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.454\nwith I have no idea\nhow many hundreds of employees.\n\n00:03:23.478 --> 00:03:25.494\nWe have exactly one employee,\n\n00:03:25.518 --> 00:03:28.134\nand that employee\nis our lead software developer.\n\n00:03:28.158 --> 00:03:31.334\nAnd he's only been our employee\nsince January 2005,\n\n00:03:31.358 --> 00:03:33.174\nall the other growth before that ...\n\n00:03:33.198 --> 00:03:36.814\nSo the servers are managed\nby a ragtag band of volunteers.\n\n00:03:36.838 --> 00:03:38.814\nAll the editing is done by volunteers.\n\n00:03:38.838 --> 00:03:40.374\nAnd the way that we're organized\n\n00:03:40.398 --> 00:03:43.081\nis not like any traditional\norganization you can imagine.\n\n00:03:43.105 --> 00:03:45.820\nPeople are always asking,\n\"Well, who's in charge of this?\"\n\n00:03:45.844 --> 00:03:47.014\nor \"Who does that?\"\n\n00:03:47.038 --> 00:03:49.334\nAnd the answer is:\nanybody who wants to pitch in.\n\n00:03:49.358 --> 00:03:52.838\nIt's a very unusual and chaotic thing.\n\n00:03:53.438 --> 00:03:55.734\nWe've got over 90 servers now\nin three locations.\n\n00:03:55.758 --> 00:04:01.014\nThese are managed by volunteer\nsystem administrators who are online.\n\n00:04:01.038 --> 00:04:03.094\nI can go online\nany time of the day or night\n\n00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:07.414\nand see eight to 10 people waiting for me\n\n00:04:07.438 --> 00:04:10.974\nto ask a question or something,\nanything about the servers.\n\n00:04:10.998 --> 00:04:13.334\nYou could never afford\nto do this in a company.\n\n00:04:13.358 --> 00:04:14.574\nYou could never afford\n\n00:04:14.598 --> 00:04:18.334\nto have a standby crew of people\n24 hours a day\n\n00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:20.678\nand do what we're doing at Wikipedia.\n\n00:04:21.438 --> 00:04:24.654\nSo we're doing around\n1.4 billion page views monthly,\n\n00:04:24.678 --> 00:04:26.718\nso it's really gotten to be a huge thing.\n\n00:04:27.318 --> 00:04:29.694\nAnd everything is managed\nby the volunteers.\n\n00:04:29.718 --> 00:04:33.934\nAnd the total monthly cost\nfor our bandwidth is about 5,000 dollars.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.894\nAnd that's essentially our main cost.\n\n00:04:35.918 --> 00:04:38.174\nWe could actually do without the employee.\n\n00:04:38.198 --> 00:04:42.614\nWe hired Brian because he was\nworking part-time for two years\n\n00:04:42.638 --> 00:04:43.934\nand full-time at Wikipedia,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.174\nso we actually hired him,\n\n00:04:45.198 --> 00:04:47.838\nso he could get a life\nand go to the movies sometimes.\n\n00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:52.294\nSo the big question when you've got\nthis really chaotic organization is,\n\n00:04:52.318 --> 00:04:53.534\nwhy isn't it all rubbish?\n\n00:04:53.558 --> 00:04:55.478\nWhy is the website as good as it is?\n\n00:04:55.953 --> 00:04:57.334\nFirst of all, how good is it?\n\n00:04:57.358 --> 00:04:58.894\nWell, it's pretty good.\n\n00:04:58.918 --> 00:05:00.134\nIt isn't perfect,\n\n00:05:00.158 --> 00:05:02.174\nbut it's much better\nthan you would expect,\n\n00:05:02.198 --> 00:05:03.881\ngiven our completely chaotic model.\n\n00:05:03.905 --> 00:05:06.921\nSo when you saw him make\na ridiculous edit to the page about me,\n\n00:05:06.945 --> 00:05:10.694\nyou think, \"Oh, this is obviously\njust going to degenerate into rubbish.\"\n\n00:05:10.718 --> 00:05:12.449\nBut when we've seen quality tests --\n\n00:05:12.473 --> 00:05:14.489\nand there haven't been enough of these yet\n\n00:05:14.513 --> 00:05:17.094\nand I'm really encouraging\npeople to do more,\n\n00:05:17.118 --> 00:05:19.254\ncomparing Wikipedia\nto traditional things --\n\n00:05:19.278 --> 00:05:21.054\nwe win hands down.\n\n00:05:21.078 --> 00:05:23.814\nSo a German magazine\ncompared German Wikipedia,\n\n00:05:23.838 --> 00:05:27.174\nwhich is much, much smaller than English,\n\n00:05:27.198 --> 00:05:31.294\nto Microsoft Encarta\nand to Brockhaus multimedial,\n\n00:05:31.318 --> 00:05:32.774\nand we won across the board.\n\n00:05:32.798 --> 00:05:36.179\nThey hired experts to come and look\nat articles and compare the quality,\n\n00:05:36.203 --> 00:05:38.523\nand we were very pleased with that result.\n\n00:05:39.278 --> 00:05:44.814\nSo a lot of people have heard about\nthe Wikipedia Bush-Kerry controversy.\n\n00:05:44.838 --> 00:05:47.494\nThe media has covered this\nsomewhat extensively.\n\n00:05:47.518 --> 00:05:50.334\nIt started out\nwith an article in Red Herring.\n\n00:05:50.358 --> 00:05:52.174\nThe reporters called me up and they --\n\n00:05:52.198 --> 00:05:55.174\nI mean, I have to say\nthey spelled my name right,\n\n00:05:55.198 --> 00:06:00.134\nbut they really wanted to say\nthe Bush-Kerry election is so contentious,\n\n00:06:00.158 --> 00:06:02.534\nit's tearing apart\nthe Wikipedia community.\n\n00:06:02.558 --> 00:06:04.054\nAnd so they quote me as saying,\n\n00:06:04.078 --> 00:06:06.974\n\"They're the most contentious\nin the history of Wikipedia.\"\n\n00:06:06.998 --> 00:06:09.574\nWhat I actually said\nis they're not contentious at all.\n\n00:06:09.598 --> 00:06:11.694\nSo it's a slight misquote.\n\n00:06:11.718 --> 00:06:13.494\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:13.518 --> 00:06:15.534\nThe articles were edited quite heavily.\n\n00:06:15.558 --> 00:06:18.014\nAnd it is true that we did\nhave to lock the articles\n\n00:06:18.038 --> 00:06:19.374\non a couple of occasions.\n\n00:06:19.398 --> 00:06:21.774\nTime magazine recently reported that\n\n00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:23.814\n\"Extreme action sometimes has to be taken,\n\n00:06:23.838 --> 00:06:28.694\nand Wales locked the entries\non Kerry and Bush for most of 2004.\"\n\n00:06:28.718 --> 00:06:32.974\nThis came after I told the reporter\nthat we had to lock it for --\n\n00:06:32.998 --> 00:06:35.134\noccasionally a little bit here and there.\n\n00:06:35.158 --> 00:06:38.534\nSo the truth in general\nis that the kinds of controversies\n\n00:06:38.558 --> 00:06:41.749\nthat you would probably think\nwe have within the Wikipedia community\n\n00:06:41.773 --> 00:06:44.494\nare not really controversies at all.\n\n00:06:44.518 --> 00:06:47.014\nArticles on controversial topics\nare edited a lot,\n\n00:06:47.038 --> 00:06:50.014\nbut they don't cause much controversy\nwithin the community.\n\n00:06:50.038 --> 00:06:53.758\nAnd the reason for this is that most\npeople understand the need for neutrality.\n\n00:06:54.558 --> 00:07:01.254\nThe real struggle is not\nbetween the right and the left --\n\n00:07:01.278 --> 00:07:02.898\nthat's where most people assume --\n\n00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:04.974\nbut it's between\nthe party of the thoughtful\n\n00:07:04.998 --> 00:07:06.294\nand the party of the jerks.\n\n00:07:06.318 --> 00:07:08.134\nAnd no side of the political spectrum\n\n00:07:08.158 --> 00:07:10.614\nhas a monopoly\non either of those qualities.\n\n00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:13.214\nThe actual truth\nabout the specific Bush-Kerry incident\n\n00:07:13.238 --> 00:07:16.214\nis that the Bush-Kerry articles\n\n00:07:16.238 --> 00:07:19.214\nwere locked less than one percent\nof the time in 2004,\n\n00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:21.294\nand it wasn't because\nthey were contentious;\n\n00:07:21.318 --> 00:07:23.654\nit was just because\nthere was routine vandalism --\n\n00:07:23.678 --> 00:07:27.374\nwhich happens sometimes even on stage ...\n\n00:07:27.398 --> 00:07:28.534\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:28.558 --> 00:07:32.094\nSometimes even reporters have reported\nto me that they vandalized Wikipedia\n\n00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.454\nand were amazed\nthat it was fixed so quickly.\n\n00:07:34.478 --> 00:07:37.254\nAnd I said -- you know, I always say,\nplease don't do that.\n\n00:07:37.278 --> 00:07:38.854\nThat's not a good thing.\n\n00:07:38.878 --> 00:07:40.374\nSo how do we do this?\n\n00:07:40.398 --> 00:07:43.254\nHow do we manage the quality control?\n\n00:07:43.278 --> 00:07:44.478\nHow does it work?\n\n00:07:46.078 --> 00:07:47.774\nSo there's a few elements,\n\n00:07:47.798 --> 00:07:51.054\nmostly social policies\nand some elements of the software.\n\n00:07:51.078 --> 00:07:53.814\nSo the biggest\nand the most important thing\n\n00:07:53.838 --> 00:07:55.569\nis our neutral point of view policy.\n\n00:07:55.593 --> 00:07:58.355\nThis is something\nthat I set down, from the very beginning,\n\n00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:02.414\nas a core principle of the community\nthat's completely not debatable.\n\n00:08:02.438 --> 00:08:05.334\nIt's a social concept of cooperation,\n\n00:08:05.358 --> 00:08:08.854\nso we don't talk a lot\nabout truth and objectivity.\n\n00:08:08.878 --> 00:08:10.934\nThe reason for this is if we say\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.534\nwe're only going to write\nthe \"truth\" about some topic,\n\n00:08:13.558 --> 00:08:16.765\nthat doesn't do us a damn bit of good\nof figuring out what to write,\n\n00:08:16.789 --> 00:08:19.325\nbecause I don't agree with you\nabout what's the truth.\n\n00:08:19.349 --> 00:08:21.694\nBut we have this\njargon term of neutrality,\n\n00:08:21.718 --> 00:08:24.174\nwhich has its own long history\nwithin the community,\n\n00:08:24.198 --> 00:08:27.614\nwhich basically says,\nany time there's a controversial issue,\n\n00:08:27.638 --> 00:08:30.214\nWikipedia itself should not\ntake a stand on the issue.\n\n00:08:30.238 --> 00:08:33.477\nWe should merely report on what\nreputable parties have said about it.\n\n00:08:33.501 --> 00:08:36.574\nSo this neutrality policy\nis really important for us\n\n00:08:36.598 --> 00:08:39.854\nbecause it empowers a community\nthat is very diverse\n\n00:08:39.878 --> 00:08:42.174\nto come together\nand actually get some work done.\n\n00:08:42.198 --> 00:08:44.334\nSo we have very diverse contributors\n\n00:08:44.358 --> 00:08:47.574\nin terms of political,\nreligious, cultural backgrounds.\n\n00:08:47.598 --> 00:08:49.414\nBy having this firm neutrality policy,\n\n00:08:49.438 --> 00:08:51.454\nwhich is non-negotiable\nfrom the beginning,\n\n00:08:51.478 --> 00:08:53.336\nwe ensure that people can work together\n\n00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.574\nand that the entries\ndon't become simply a war\n\n00:08:55.598 --> 00:08:57.741\nback and forth\nbetween the left and the right.\n\n00:08:57.765 --> 00:09:01.480\nIf you engage in that type of behavior,\nyou'll be asked to leave the community.\n\n00:09:03.198 --> 00:09:04.654\nSo, real-time peer review.\n\n00:09:04.678 --> 00:09:07.814\nEvery single change on the site\ngoes to the \"Recent changes\" page.\n\n00:09:07.838 --> 00:09:11.334\nSo as soon as he made his change,\nit went to the \"Recent changes\" page.\n\n00:09:11.358 --> 00:09:15.334\nThat recent changes page\nwas also fed into an IRC channel,\n\n00:09:15.358 --> 00:09:16.934\nwhich is an Internet chat channel\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:20.158\nthat people are monitoring\nwith various software tools.\n\n00:09:20.878 --> 00:09:23.334\nAnd people can get RSS feeds --\n\n00:09:23.358 --> 00:09:26.454\nthey can get email\nnotifications of changes.\n\n00:09:26.478 --> 00:09:29.134\nAnd then users can set up\ntheir own personal watch list.\n\n00:09:29.158 --> 00:09:31.651\nSo my page is on quite a few\nvolunteers' watch lists,\n\n00:09:31.675 --> 00:09:33.371\nbecause it is sometimes vandalized.\n\n00:09:33.395 --> 00:09:39.374\nAnd therefore, what happens is someone\nwill notice the change very quickly,\n\n00:09:39.398 --> 00:09:42.774\nand then they'll just\nsimply revert the change.\n\n00:09:42.798 --> 00:09:44.714\nThere's a \"new pages feed,\" for example,\n\n00:09:44.738 --> 00:09:46.794\nso you can go\nto a certain page of Wikipedia\n\n00:09:46.818 --> 00:09:48.746\nand see every new page as it's created.\n\n00:09:48.778 --> 00:09:49.928\nThis is really important\n\n00:09:49.938 --> 00:09:53.154\nbecause a lot of new pages\nare just garbage that has to be deleted,\n\n00:09:53.158 --> 00:09:54.414\nyou know, \"ASDFASDF.\"\n\n00:09:54.438 --> 00:09:57.354\nBut also, that's some\nof the most interesting and fun things,\n\n00:09:57.378 --> 00:09:58.594\nsome of the new articles.\n\n00:09:58.618 --> 00:10:01.194\nPeople will start an article\non some interesting topic,\n\n00:10:01.218 --> 00:10:03.034\nother people will find that intriguing\n\n00:10:03.058 --> 00:10:05.454\nand jump in and help\nand make it much better.\n\n00:10:05.478 --> 00:10:07.374\nSo we do have edits by anonymous users,\n\n00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:11.254\nwhich is one of the most controversial\nand intriguing things about Wikipedia.\n\n00:10:11.278 --> 00:10:14.894\nSo, Chris was able to do his change --\nhe didn't have to log in or anything;\n\n00:10:14.918 --> 00:10:17.734\nhe just went on the website\nand made a change.\n\n00:10:17.758 --> 00:10:19.814\nBut it turns out\nthat only about 18 percent\n\n00:10:19.838 --> 00:10:21.334\nof all the edits to the website\n\n00:10:21.358 --> 00:10:22.694\nare done by anonymous users.\n\n00:10:22.718 --> 00:10:25.054\nAnd that's a really important\nthing to understand:\n\n00:10:25.078 --> 00:10:28.334\nthe vast majority of the edits\nthat go on on the website\n\n00:10:28.358 --> 00:10:32.054\nare from a very close-knit community\nof maybe 600 to 1,000 people\n\n00:10:32.078 --> 00:10:33.698\nwho are in constant communication.\n\n00:10:33.722 --> 00:10:36.294\nAnd we have over 40 IRC channels,\n40 mailing lists.\n\n00:10:36.318 --> 00:10:37.894\nAll these people know each other.\n\n00:10:37.918 --> 00:10:39.966\nThey communicate.\nWe have off-line meetings.\n\n00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.610\nThese are the people\nwho are doing the bulk of the site,\n\n00:10:42.634 --> 00:10:47.282\nand they are, in a sense,\nsemi-professionals at what they're doing.\n\n00:10:47.918 --> 00:10:50.254\nThe standards we set for ourselves\n\n00:10:50.278 --> 00:10:53.334\nare equal to or higher\nthan professional standards of quality.\n\n00:10:53.358 --> 00:10:56.874\nWe don't always meet those standards,\nbut that's what we're striving for.\n\n00:10:56.898 --> 00:10:59.756\nAnd so that tight community\nis who really cares for the site,\n\n00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.414\nand these are some\nof the smartest people I've ever met.\n\n00:11:02.438 --> 00:11:04.694\nIt's my job to say that,\nbut it's actually true.\n\n00:11:04.718 --> 00:11:08.454\nThe type of people who were drawn\nto writing an encyclopedia for fun\n\n00:11:08.478 --> 00:11:10.814\ntend to be pretty smart people.\n\n00:11:10.838 --> 00:11:13.934\nThe tools and the software:\nthere's lots of tools that allow us --\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.578\nallow us, meaning the community --\n\n00:11:15.602 --> 00:11:17.654\nto self-monitor\nand to monitor all the work.\n\n00:11:17.678 --> 00:11:20.174\nThis is an example\nof a page history on \"flat Earth,\"\n\n00:11:20.198 --> 00:11:22.254\nand you can see some changes\nthat were made.\n\n00:11:22.278 --> 00:11:25.574\nWhat's nice about this page\nis you can immediately take a look at this\n\n00:11:25.598 --> 00:11:27.174\nand see, \"OK, I understand now.\"\n\n00:11:27.198 --> 00:11:28.974\nWhen somebody goes and looks at --\n\n00:11:28.998 --> 00:11:31.141\nthey see that someone,\nan anonymous IP number,\n\n00:11:31.165 --> 00:11:32.654\nmade an edit to my page.\n\n00:11:32.678 --> 00:11:34.734\nThat sounds suspicious.\nWho is this person?\n\n00:11:34.758 --> 00:11:35.974\nSomebody looks at it --\n\n00:11:35.998 --> 00:11:38.014\nthey can immediately see\nhighlighted in red\n\n00:11:38.038 --> 00:11:39.934\nall of the changes that took place --\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.574\nto see, OK, well, these words\nhave changed, things like this.\n\n00:11:43.598 --> 00:11:45.218\nSo that's one tool that we can use\n\n00:11:45.242 --> 00:11:47.762\nto very quickly monitor\nthe history of a page.\n\n00:11:48.478 --> 00:11:50.774\nAnother thing that we do\nwithin the community\n\n00:11:50.798 --> 00:11:54.174\nis we leave everything very open-ended.\n\n00:11:54.198 --> 00:11:57.574\nMost of the social rules\nand the methods of work\n\n00:11:57.598 --> 00:12:00.014\nare left completely open-ended\nin the software.\n\n00:12:00.038 --> 00:12:02.054\nAll of that stuff is just on Wiki pages.\n\n00:12:02.078 --> 00:12:05.174\nAnd so there's nothing\nin the software that enforces the rules.\n\n00:12:05.198 --> 00:12:09.214\nThe example I've got up here\nis the Votes for Deletion page.\n\n00:12:09.238 --> 00:12:11.814\nSo, I mentioned earlier,\npeople type \"ASDFASDF\" --\n\n00:12:11.838 --> 00:12:13.054\nit needs to be deleted.\n\n00:12:13.078 --> 00:12:15.554\nCases like that,\nthe administrators just delete it.\n\n00:12:15.578 --> 00:12:17.914\nThere's no reason\nto have a big argument about it.\n\n00:12:17.938 --> 00:12:21.273\nBut you can imagine there's a lot\nof other areas where the question is,\n\n00:12:21.297 --> 00:12:23.537\nis this notable enough\nto go in an encyclopedia?\n\n00:12:23.561 --> 00:12:27.134\nIs the information verifiable?\nIs it a hoax? Is it true? Is it what?\n\n00:12:27.158 --> 00:12:30.214\nSo we needed a social method\nfor figuring out the answer to this.\n\n00:12:30.238 --> 00:12:33.096\nAnd so the method that arose\norganically within the community\n\n00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.694\nis the Votes For Deletion page.\n\n00:12:34.718 --> 00:12:36.734\nAnd in the particular\nexample we have here,\n\n00:12:36.758 --> 00:12:38.254\nit's a film, \"Twisted Issues,\"\n\n00:12:38.278 --> 00:12:39.734\nand the first person says,\n\n00:12:39.758 --> 00:12:43.454\n\"Now this is supposedly a film.\nIt fails the Google test miserably.\"\n\n00:12:43.478 --> 00:12:46.294\nThe Google test is you look in Google\nand see if it's there,\n\n00:12:46.318 --> 00:12:50.214\nbecause if something's not even in Google,\nit probably doesn't exist at all.\n\n00:12:50.238 --> 00:12:51.814\nIt's not a perfect rule,\n\n00:12:51.838 --> 00:12:55.174\nbut it's a nice starting point\nfor quick research.\n\n00:12:55.198 --> 00:12:58.453\nSo somebody says, \"Delete it, please.\nDelete it -- it's not notable.\"\n\n00:12:58.477 --> 00:13:01.493\nAnd then somebody says,\n\"Wait, I found it. I found it in a book,\n\n00:13:01.517 --> 00:13:04.774\n'Film Threat Video Guide:\nthe 20 Underground Films You Must See.'\"\n\n00:13:04.798 --> 00:13:06.703\nSo the next persons says, \"Clean it up.\"\n\n00:13:06.727 --> 00:13:10.134\nSomebody says, \"I've found it on IMDB.\nKeep, keep, keep.\"\n\n00:13:10.158 --> 00:13:12.974\nAnd what's interesting about this\nis that the software is --\n\n00:13:12.998 --> 00:13:16.534\nthese votes are just text\ntyped into a page.\n\n00:13:16.558 --> 00:13:20.614\nThis is not really a vote\nso much as it is a dialogue.\n\n00:13:20.638 --> 00:13:23.374\nNow it is true that at the end of the day,\n\n00:13:23.398 --> 00:13:26.637\nan administrator can go through here\nand take a look at this and say,\n\n00:13:26.661 --> 00:13:29.134\n\"OK, 18 deletes, two keeps:\nwe'll delete it.\"\n\n00:13:29.158 --> 00:13:32.934\nBut in other cases,\nthis could be 18 deletes and two keeps,\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.754\nand we would keep it,\nbecause if those last two keeps say,\n\n00:13:35.778 --> 00:13:38.683\n\"Wait a minute. Nobody else saw this\nbut I found it in a book,\n\n00:13:38.707 --> 00:13:40.905\nand I found a link\nto a page that describes it,\n\n00:13:40.929 --> 00:13:44.025\nand I'm going to clean it up tomorrow,\nso please don't delete it,\"\n\n00:13:44.049 --> 00:13:45.234\nthen it would survive.\n\n00:13:45.258 --> 00:13:47.854\nAnd it also matters\nwho the people are who are voting.\n\n00:13:47.878 --> 00:13:49.783\nLike I say, it's a tight-knit community.\n\n00:13:49.807 --> 00:13:52.334\nDown here at the bottom,\n\"Keep, real movie,\" RickK.\n\n00:13:52.358 --> 00:13:55.739\nRickK is a very famous Wikipedian\nwho does an enormous amount of work\n\n00:13:55.763 --> 00:13:58.494\nwith vandalism, hoaxes\nand votes for deletion.\n\n00:13:58.518 --> 00:14:01.334\nHis voice carries a lot of weight\nwithin the community\n\n00:14:01.358 --> 00:14:02.930\nbecause he knows what he's doing.\n\n00:14:04.358 --> 00:14:06.294\nSo how is all this governed?\n\n00:14:06.318 --> 00:14:09.454\nPeople really want to know\nabout administrators, things like that.\n\n00:14:09.478 --> 00:14:13.334\nSo the Wikipedia governance model,\nthe governance of the community,\n\n00:14:13.358 --> 00:14:17.774\nis a very confusing,\nbut workable mix of consensus --\n\n00:14:17.798 --> 00:14:20.334\nmeaning we try not to vote\non the content of articles,\n\n00:14:20.358 --> 00:14:24.254\nbecause the majority view\nis not necessarily neutral --\n\n00:14:24.278 --> 00:14:25.574\nsome amount of democracy --\n\n00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:26.934\nall of the administrators --\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.754\nthese are the people\nwho have the ability to delete pages.\n\n00:14:29.778 --> 00:14:32.614\nThat doesn't mean that they have\nthe right to delete pages.\n\n00:14:32.638 --> 00:14:36.474\nThey still have to follow all the rules --\nbut they're elected by the community.\n\n00:14:36.498 --> 00:14:38.928\nSometimes people --\nrandom trolls on the Internet --\n\n00:14:38.952 --> 00:14:41.335\nlike to accuse me\nof handpicking the administrators\n\n00:14:41.359 --> 00:14:43.264\nto bias the content of the encyclopedia.\n\n00:14:43.288 --> 00:14:47.054\nI always laugh at this, because I have\nno idea how they're elected, actually.\n\n00:14:47.078 --> 00:14:49.054\nThere's a certain amount of aristocracy.\n\n00:14:49.078 --> 00:14:51.221\nYou got a hint of that\nwhen I mentioned, like,\n\n00:14:51.245 --> 00:14:53.397\nRickK's voice would carry\na lot more weight\n\n00:14:53.421 --> 00:14:54.717\nthan someone we don't know.\n\n00:14:54.741 --> 00:14:57.454\nI give this talk sometimes with Angela,\n\n00:14:57.478 --> 00:15:00.209\nwho was just re-elected to the board\nfrom the community --\n\n00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:01.729\nto the Board of the Foundation,\n\n00:15:01.753 --> 00:15:04.894\nwith more than twice the votes\nof the person who didn't make it.\n\n00:15:04.918 --> 00:15:07.854\nAnd I always embarrass her because I say,\n\n00:15:07.878 --> 00:15:09.174\n\"Well, Angela, for example,\n\n00:15:09.198 --> 00:15:12.614\ncould get away with doing\nabsolutely anything within Wikipedia,\n\n00:15:12.638 --> 00:15:14.654\nbecause she's so admired and so powerful.\"\n\n00:15:14.678 --> 00:15:18.494\nBut the irony is, of course, that Angela\ncan do this because she's the one person\n\n00:15:18.518 --> 00:15:21.494\nwho you know would never, ever\nbreak any rules of Wikipedia.\n\n00:15:21.518 --> 00:15:23.574\nAnd I also like to say\nshe's the only person\n\n00:15:23.598 --> 00:15:26.814\nwho actually knows\nall the rules of Wikipedia, so ...\n\n00:15:26.838 --> 00:15:28.077\nAnd then there's monarchy,\n\n00:15:28.101 --> 00:15:30.117\nand that's my role\non the community, so ...\n\n00:15:30.141 --> 00:15:32.534\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:32.558 --> 00:15:35.174\nI was describing this in Berlin once,\n\n00:15:35.198 --> 00:15:37.974\nand the next day\nin the newspaper the headline said,\n\n00:15:37.998 --> 00:15:39.566\n\"I am the Queen of England.\"\n\n00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:40.741\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:40.765 --> 00:15:43.134\nAnd that's not exactly what I said, but --\n\n00:15:43.158 --> 00:15:44.654\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:44.678 --> 00:15:47.254\nthe point is my role in the community --\n\n00:15:47.278 --> 00:15:51.974\nWithin the free software world,\nthere's been a long-standing tradition\n\n00:15:51.998 --> 00:15:55.214\nof the \"benevolent dictator\" model.\n\n00:15:55.238 --> 00:15:58.094\nSo if you look at most\nof the major free software projects,\n\n00:15:58.118 --> 00:15:59.894\nthey have one single person in charge\n\n00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:03.254\nwho everyone agrees\nis the benevolent dictator.\n\n00:16:03.278 --> 00:16:05.774\nWell, I don't like the term\n\"benevolent dictator,\"\n\n00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:09.774\nand I don't think that it's my job\nor my role in the world of ideas\n\n00:16:09.798 --> 00:16:13.134\nto be the dictator of the future\nof all human knowledge\n\n00:16:13.158 --> 00:16:14.374\ncompiled by the world.\n\n00:16:14.398 --> 00:16:16.094\nIt just isn't appropriate.\n\n00:16:16.118 --> 00:16:18.894\nBut there is a need still\nfor a certain amount of monarchy,\n\n00:16:18.918 --> 00:16:20.494\na certain amount of --\n\n00:16:20.518 --> 00:16:22.294\nsometimes we have to make a decision\n\n00:16:22.318 --> 00:16:24.557\nand we don't want\nto get bogged down too heavily\n\n00:16:24.581 --> 00:16:27.294\nin formal decision-making processes.\n\n00:16:27.318 --> 00:16:32.214\nSo as an example\nof how this can be important:\n\n00:16:32.238 --> 00:16:36.214\nwe recently had a situation where\na neo-Nazi website discovered Wikipedia,\n\n00:16:36.238 --> 00:16:39.094\nand they said,\n\"Oh, well, this is horrible,\n\n00:16:39.118 --> 00:16:41.014\nthis Jewish conspiracy of a website,\n\n00:16:41.038 --> 00:16:44.197\nand we're going to get certain articles\ndeleted that we don't like.\n\n00:16:44.221 --> 00:16:47.221\nAnd we see they have a voting process,\nso we're going to send --\n\n00:16:47.245 --> 00:16:50.054\nwe have 40,000 members\nand we're going to send them over\n\n00:16:50.078 --> 00:16:52.856\nand they're all going to vote\nand get these pages deleted.\"\n\n00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.071\nWell, they managed\nto get 18 people to show up.\n\n00:16:55.095 --> 00:16:57.854\nThat's neo-Nazi math for you.\n\n00:16:57.878 --> 00:17:01.334\nThey always think they've got\n40,000 members when they've got 18.\n\n00:17:01.358 --> 00:17:04.854\nBut they managed to get 18 people\nto come and vote in a fairly absurd way\n\n00:17:04.878 --> 00:17:06.894\nto delete a perfectly valid article.\n\n00:17:06.918 --> 00:17:09.654\nOf course, the vote ended up\nbeing about 85 to 18,\n\n00:17:09.678 --> 00:17:12.934\nso there was no real danger\nto our democratic processes.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:16.253\nOn the other hand, people said,\n\"But what are we going to do?\n\n00:17:16.277 --> 00:17:17.533\nI mean, this could happen.\n\n00:17:17.557 --> 00:17:19.894\nWhat if some group\ngets really seriously organized\n\n00:17:19.918 --> 00:17:22.494\nand comes in and wants to vote?\"\n\n00:17:22.518 --> 00:17:25.293\nThen I said, \"Well, fuck it,\nwe'll just change the rules.\"\n\n00:17:25.317 --> 00:17:27.013\nThat's my job in the community:\n\n00:17:27.037 --> 00:17:30.614\nto say we won't allow\nour openness and freedom\n\n00:17:30.638 --> 00:17:33.214\nto undermine the quality of the content.\n\n00:17:33.238 --> 00:17:36.533\nAnd so, as long as people\ntrust me in my role,\n\n00:17:36.557 --> 00:17:38.414\nthen that's a valid place for me.\n\n00:17:38.438 --> 00:17:40.474\nOf course, because of the free licensing,\n\n00:17:40.498 --> 00:17:43.975\nif I do a bad job, the volunteers\nare more than happy to take and leave --\n\n00:17:43.999 --> 00:17:45.479\nI can't tell anyone what to do.\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:50.654\nSo the final point here\nis that to understand how Wikipedia works,\n\n00:17:50.678 --> 00:17:53.869\nit's important to understand\nthat our wiki model is the way we work,\n\n00:17:53.893 --> 00:17:57.494\nbut we are not fanatical web anarchists.\n\n00:17:57.518 --> 00:18:00.894\nIn fact, we're very flexible\nabout the social methodology,\n\n00:18:00.918 --> 00:18:03.334\nbecause ultimately,\nthe passion of the community\n\n00:18:03.358 --> 00:18:05.374\nis for the quality of the work,\n\n00:18:05.398 --> 00:18:08.374\nnot necessarily for the process\nthat we use to generate it.\n\n00:18:08.398 --> 00:18:09.614\nThank you.\n\n00:18:09.638 --> 00:18:13.894\n(Applause)\n\n00:18:13.918 --> 00:18:15.694\nBen Saunders: Yeah, hi, Ben Saunders.\n\n00:18:15.718 --> 00:18:19.854\nJimmy, you mentioned impartiality\nbeing a key to Wikipedia's success.\n\n00:18:19.878 --> 00:18:25.214\nIt strikes me that much of the textbooks\nthat are used to educate our children\n\n00:18:25.238 --> 00:18:27.014\nare inherently biased.\n\n00:18:27.038 --> 00:18:30.654\nHave you found Wikipedia\nbeing used by teachers\n\n00:18:30.678 --> 00:18:33.134\nand how do you see Wikipedia\nchanging education?\n\n00:18:33.158 --> 00:18:37.374\nJimmy Wales: Yeah, so, a lot of teachers\nare beginning to use Wikipedia.\n\n00:18:37.398 --> 00:18:41.974\nThere's a media storyline about Wikipedia,\nwhich I think is false.\n\n00:18:41.998 --> 00:18:45.574\nIt builds on the storyline\nof bloggers versus newspapers.\n\n00:18:45.598 --> 00:18:48.734\nAnd the storyline is,\nthere's this crazy thing, Wikipedia,\n\n00:18:48.758 --> 00:18:52.214\nbut academics hate it\nand teachers hate it.\n\n00:18:52.238 --> 00:18:54.814\nAnd that turns out to not be true.\n\n00:18:54.838 --> 00:18:57.374\nThe last time I got an email\nfrom a journalist saying,\n\n00:18:57.398 --> 00:18:59.114\n\"Why do academics hate Wikipedia?\"\n\n00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:00.996\nI sent it from my Harvard email address\n\n00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.273\nbecause I was recently\nappointed a fellow there.\n\n00:19:03.297 --> 00:19:05.313\nAnd I said, \"Well,\nthey don't all hate it.\"\n\n00:19:05.337 --> 00:19:06.414\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:09.294\nBut I think there's going\nto be huge impacts.\n\n00:19:09.318 --> 00:19:12.734\nAnd we actually have a project\nthat I'm personally really excited about,\n\n00:19:12.758 --> 00:19:14.254\nwhich is the Wikibooks project,\n\n00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:17.374\nwhich is an effort to create\ntextbooks in all the languages.\n\n00:19:17.398 --> 00:19:18.974\nAnd that's a much bigger project.\n\n00:19:18.998 --> 00:19:23.614\nIt's going to take 20 years or so\nto come to fruition.\n\n00:19:23.638 --> 00:19:25.654\nBut part of that is to fulfill our mission\n\n00:19:25.678 --> 00:19:28.654\nof giving an encyclopedia\nto every single person on the planet.\n\n00:19:28.678 --> 00:19:31.534\nWe don't mean we're going\nto Spam them with AOL-style CDs.\n\n00:19:31.558 --> 00:19:34.354\nWe mean we're going to give them\na tool that they can use.\n\n00:19:34.378 --> 00:19:36.154\nAnd for a lot of people in the world,\n\n00:19:36.178 --> 00:19:39.354\nif I give you an encyclopedia\nthat's written at a university level,\n\n00:19:39.378 --> 00:19:42.934\nit doesn't do you any good\nwithout a whole host of literacy materials\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:45.734\nto build you up to the point\nwhere you can actually use it.\n\n00:19:45.758 --> 00:19:47.901\nThe Wikibooks project\nis an effort to do that.\n\n00:19:47.925 --> 00:19:51.134\nAnd I think that we're going to see --\nit may not even come from us;\n\n00:19:51.158 --> 00:19:53.134\nthere's all kinds of innovation going on.\n\n00:19:53.158 --> 00:19:56.318\nBut freely licensed textbooks\nare the next big thing in education."}, {"title": "The birth of the open-source learning revolution", "duration": "1114", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/richard_baraniuk_on_open_source_learning", "transcript": "I'm Rich Baraniuk and what I'd like to talk a little bit about today are some ideas that I think have just tremendous resonance with all the things that have been talked about the last two days. So many different points of resonance that it's going to be difficult to bring them all up, but I'll try to do my best. Does anybody remember these?(Laughter)OK, so these are LP records and they've been replaced, right? They've been swept away over the last two decades by these types of world-flattening digitization technologies, right? And I think it was best witnessed when Thomas was playing the music as we came in the room today. What's happened in the music world is there's a culture, or an ecosystem that's been created that, if you take some words from Apple, the catchphrase \u2014 that we create, rip, mix and burn. What I mean by that is that anyone in the world is free and allowed to create new music and musical ideas. Anyone in the world is allowed to rip or copy musical ideas, use them in innovative ways. Anyone is allowed to mix them in different types of ways, draw connections between musical ideas, and people can burn them or create final products and continue the circle. And what that's done is it's created, like I said, a vibrant community that's very inclusive, with people continually working to connect musical ideas, innovate them and keep things constantly up to date. Today's hit single is not last year's hit single.But I'm not here to talk about music today. I'm here to talk about books. In particular, textbooks and the kind of educational materials that we use every day in school. Has anyone here ever been to school?(Laughter)OK, does anybody realize there's a crisis in our schools, around the world? I'm not going to spend too much time on that, but what I want to talk about is some of the disconnects that appear when an author publishes a book. That in fact, the publishing process \u2014 just because of the fact that it's complicated, it's heavy, books are expensive \u2014 creates a sort of a wall between authors of books and the ultimate users of books, be they teachers, students or just general readers. And this is even more true if you happen to speak a language other than one of the world's major languages, and especially English. I'm going to call these people below the barrier \"shutouts\" because they're really shut out of the process of being able to share their knowledge with the world. And so what I want to talk about today is trying to take these ideas that we've seen in the musical culture and try to bring these towards reinventing the way we think about writing books, using them and teaching from them. So, that's what I'd like to talk about and, really, how we get from where we are now to where we need to go.The first thing I'd like you to do is a little thought experiment. Imagine taking all the world's books. OK, everybody imagine books and imagine just tearing out the pages. So, liberating these pages and imagine digitizing them and then storing them in a vast, interconnected, global repository. Think of it as a massive iTunes for book-type content. And then take that material and imagine making it all open, so that people can modify it, play with it, improve it. Imagine making it free, so that anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge, and imagine using information technology so that you can update this content, improve it, play with it, on a timescale that's more on the order of seconds instead of years. Instead of editions of a book coming out every two years, imagine them coming out every 25 seconds.So, imagine we could do that and imagine we could put people into this. So that we could truly build an ecosystem with not just authors, but all the people who could be or want to be authors in all the different languages of the world, and I think if you could do this, it would be called \u2014 I'm just going to refer to it as a knowledge ecosystem. So, really, this is the dream, and in a sense what you can think of it is we're trying to enable anyone in the world, I mean anyone in the world \u2014(Laughter)to be their own educational DJ, creating educational materials, sharing them with the world, constantly innovating on them. So, this is the dream.In fact, this dream is actually being realized. Over the last six-and-a-half years, we've been working really hard at Rice University on a project called Connexions, and so what I'd like to do for the rest of the talk is just tell you a little bit about what people are doing with Connexions, which you can kind of think of as the counterpoint to Nicholas Negroponte's talk yesterday, where they're working on the hardware of bringing education to the world. We're working on the open-source tools and the content. So, that's sort of to put it in perspective here.So, create. What are some of the people that are using these kind of tools? Well, the first thing is, there's a community of engineering professors, from Cambridge to Kyoto, who are developing engineering content in electrical engineering to develop what you can think of as a massive, super textbook that covers the entire area of electrical engineering. And not only that \u2014 it can be customized for use in each of their own individual institutions. If people like Kitty Jones, a shut-out \u2014 a private music teacher and mom from Champagne, Illinois, who wanted to share her fantastic music content with the world, on how to teach kids how to play music \u2014 Her material is now used over 600,000 times per month. Tremendous use. In fact, a lot of this use coming from United States K-12 schools, because anyone who's involved in a school scale back, the first thing that's cut is the music curriculum. And so this is just indicating the tremendous thirst for this kind of open, free content. A lot of teachers are using this stuff.What about ripping? What about copying, reusing? A team of volunteers at the University of Texas at El Paso \u2014 graduate students translating this engineering super textbook ideas. And within about a week, having this be some of our most popular material in widespread use all over Latin America, and in particular in Mexico, because of the open, extensible nature of this. People, volunteers and even companies that are translating materials into Asian languages like Chinese, Japanese and Thai, to spread the knowledge even further.OK, what about people who are mixing? What does \"mixing\" mean? \"Mixing\" means building customized courses, means building customized books. Companies like National Instruments, who are embedding very powerful, interactive simulations into the materials, so that we can go way beyond our regular kind of textbook to an experience that all the teaching materials are things you can actually interact with and play around with and actually learn as you do.We've been working with Teachers Without Borders, who are very interested in mixing our materials. They're going to be using Connexions as their platform to develop and deliver teaching materials for teaching teachers how to teach in 84 countries around the world. TWB is currently in Iraq, training 20,000 teachers supported by USAID. And to them, this idea of being able to remix and customize to the local context is extraordinarily important, because just providing free content to people has actually been likened by people in the developing world to a kind of cultural imperialism \u2014 that if you don't empower people with the ability to re-contextualize the material, translate it into their own language and take ownership of it, it's not good.OK, other organizations we've been working with, UC Merced \u2014 people know about UC Merced. It's a new university in California, in the Central Valley, working very closely with community colleges. They're actually developing a lot of their science and engineering curriculum to spread widely around the world in our system. And they're also trying to develop all of their software tools completely open-source. We've been working with AMD, which has a project called 50x15, which is trying to bring Internet connectivity to 50 percent of the world's population by 2015. We're going to be providing content to them in a whole range of different languages. And we've also been working with a number of other organizations. In particular, a bunch of the projects that are funded by Hewlett Foundation, who have taken a real leadership role in this area of open content.OK, burn \u2014 I think this is, sort of, quite interesting. \"Burn\" is the idea of trying to create the physical instantiation of one of these courses. And I think a lot of you received \u2014 I think all of you received one of these music books in your gift pack. A little present for you. Just to tell you quickly about it: this is an engineering textbook. It's about 300 pages long, hardbound. This costs \u2014 anybody guess? How much would it cost in a bookstore?(Audience) 65 dollars.Richard Baraniuk: OK. This costs 22 dollars to the student. Why does it cost 22 dollars? Because it's published on demand and it's developed from this repository of open materials. If this book were to be published by a regular publisher, it would cost at least 122 dollars.So what we're seeing is moving this burning or publication process from the regular, sort of single-authored book towards community-authored materials that are modular, that are customized to each individual class and published on demand very inexpensively, either pushed out through Amazon or published directly through an on-demand press, like QOOP. And I think that this is an extraordinarily interesting area because there is tremendous area under this long tail in publishing. We're not talking about the Harry Potter end, right at the left side. We're talking about books on hypergeometric partial differential equations. Books that might sell 100 copies a year, 1,000 copies a year. There is tremendous sustaining revenue under this long tail to sustain open projects like ours, but also to sustain this new emergence of on-demand publishers, like QOOP, who produced these two books. And I think one of the things that you should take away from this talk is that there's an impending cut-out-the-middle-man disintermediation, that's going to be happening in the publishing industry. And it's going to reach a crescendo over the next few years, and I think that it's for our benefit, really, and for the world's benefit.OK, so what are the enablers? What's really making all of this happen? There's tons of technology, and the only piece of technology that I really want to talk about is XML. How many people know about XML? Oh, great. So it's the future of the web, right? It's semantic representation of content. And what you can really think of XML in this case is it's the packaging that we're putting around these pages. Remember we took the book, tore the pages out? Well, what the XML is going to do is it's going to turn those pages into Lego blocks. XML are the nubs on the Lego that allow us to combine the content together in a myriad different ways, and it provides us a framework to share content. So, it lets you take this ecosystem in its primordial state of all this content, all the pages you've torn out of books, and create highly sophisticated learning machines: books, courses, course packs.It gives you the ability to personalize the learning experience to each individual student, so that every student can have a book or a course that's customized to their learning style, their context, their language and the things that excite them. It lets you reuse the same materials in multiple different ways, and surprising new ways. It lets you interconnect ideas, indicating how fields relate to each other. And I'll just give you my personal story. We came up with this six-and-a-half years ago because I teach the stuff in the red box.And my day job, as Chris said \u2014 I'm an electrical engineering professor. I teach signal processing and my challenge was to show that this math \u2014 Wow, about half of you have already fallen asleep just looking at the equation.(Laughter)But this seemingly dry math is actually the center of this tremendously powerful web that links technology \u2014 that links really cool applications like music synthesizers to tremendous economic opportunities, but also governed by intellectual property. And the thing that I realized is there was no way that I, as an engineer, could write this book that would get all of this across. We needed a community to do it and we needed new tools to be able to interconnect these ideas. And I think that really, in a sense, what we're trying to do is make Minsky's dream come to a reality, where you can imagine all the books in a library actually starting to talk to each other. And people who are teachers out here \u2014 whoever taught, you know this \u2014 it's the interconnections between ideas that teaching is really all about.OK, back to math. Imagine \u2014 this is possible: that every single equation that you click on in one of your new e-texts is something that you're going to be able to explore and experiment with. So imagine your kid's algebra textbook in seventh grade. You can click on every single equation and bring up a little tool to be able to experiment with it, tinker with it, understand it. Because we really don't understand until we do. The same type of mark-up, like MathML, for chemistry. Imagine chemistry textbooks that actually understand the structure of how molecules are formed. Imagine Music XML that actually lets you delve into the semantic structure of music, play with it, understand it. It's no wonder that everybody's getting into it, right? Even the three wise men.(Laughter)OK, the second big enabler, and this is where I told a big lie. The second big enabler is intellectual property. Because, in fact, I got up here and I talked about how great the music culture is. We can share and rip, mix and burn, but in fact, that's all illegal. And we would be accused of [piracy] for doing that, because this music has been propertized. It's now owned, much of it by big industries. So, really, the key thing here is we can't let this happen. We can't let this Napster thing happen here. So, what we have to do is get it right from the very beginning. And what we have to do is find an intellectual property framework that makes sharing safe and makes it easily understandable. And the inspiration here is taken from open-source software. Things like Linux and the GPL.The Creative Commons licenses. How many people have heard of creative commons? If you have not, you must learn about it. Creativecommons.org. At the bottom of every piece of material in Connexions and in lots of other projects, you can find their logo. Clicking on that logo takes you to an absolute no-nonsense, human-readable document, a deed, that tells you exactly what you can do with this content. In fact, you're free to share it, to do all of these things: to copy it, to change it, even to make commercial use of it, as long as you attribute the author. Because in academic publishing and much of educational publishing, it's really this idea of sharing knowledge and making impact. That's why people write, not necessarily making bucks. We're not talking about Harry Potter, right? We're at the long tail end here. Behind that is the legal code, very carefully constructed.And Creative Commons is taking off \u2014 over 43 million things out there, licensed with a Creative Commons license. Not just text, but music, images, video. And there's actually a tremendous uptake of the number of people that are actually licensing music to make it free for people who do this whole idea of re-sampling, ripping, mixing, burning and sharing.OK, I'd like to conclude with just the last few points. So, we've built this idea of a commons. People are using it. We get over 500,000 unique visitors per month, just to our particular site. MIT OpenCourseWare, which is another large open-content site, gets a similar number of hits. But how do we protect this? How do we protect it into the future? And the first thing that people are probably thinking is quality control, right? Because we're saying that anybody can contribute things to this commons. Anybody can contribute anything. So that could be a problem.It didn't take long until people started contributing materials, for example, on lingerie, which is actually a pretty good module. The only problem is it's plagiarized from a major French feminist journal, and when you go to the supposed course website, it points to a lingerie-selling website. So this is a little bit of a problem. So we clearly need some kind of idea of quality control and this is really where the idea of review and peer review comes in. You come to TED. Why do you come to TED? Because Chris and his team have ensured that things are very, very high quality, right? And so we need to be able to do the same thing. And we need to be able to design structures, and what we're doing is designing social software to enable anyone to build their own peer review process, and we call these things \"lenses.\" And basically what they allow is anyone out there can develop their own peer-review process, so that they can focus on the content in the repository that they think is really important. And you can think of TED as a potential lens.So I'd just like to end by saying: you can really view this as a call to action. Connexions and open content is all about sharing knowledge. All of you here are tremendously imbued with tremendous amounts of knowledge, and what I'd like to do is invite each and every one of you to contribute to this project and other projects of its type, because I think together we can truly change the landscape of education and educational publishing.So, thanks very much.", "id": 25, "subtitle":

some ideas that I think\nhave just tremendous resonance\n\n00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:22.414\nwith all the things that have been\ntalked about the last two days.\n\n00:00:22.438 --> 00:00:24.214\nSo many different points of resonance\n\n00:00:24.238 --> 00:00:26.715\nthat it's going to be difficult\nto bring them all up,\n\n00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:28.054\nbut I'll try to do my best.\n\n00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:29.454\nDoes anybody remember these?\n\n00:00:29.478 --> 00:00:31.254\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:31.278 --> 00:00:37.254\nOK, so these are LP records\nand they've been replaced, right?\n\n00:00:37.278 --> 00:00:39.974\nThey've been swept away\nover the last two decades\n\n00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:44.854\nby these types of world-flattening\ndigitization technologies, right?\n\n00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.494\nAnd I think it was best witnessed\n\n00:00:47.518 --> 00:00:51.334\nwhen Thomas was playing the music\nas we came in the room today.\n\n00:00:51.358 --> 00:00:54.014\nWhat's happened in the music world\nis there's a culture,\n\n00:00:54.038 --> 00:00:55.814\nor an ecosystem that's been created\n\n00:00:55.838 --> 00:00:58.414\nthat, if you take some words from Apple,\n\n00:00:58.438 --> 00:01:02.414\nthe catchphrase --\nthat we create, rip, mix and burn.\n\n00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:05.614\nWhat I mean by that is that anyone\nin the world is free and allowed\n\n00:01:05.638 --> 00:01:07.974\nto create new music and musical ideas.\n\n00:01:07.998 --> 00:01:11.694\nAnyone in the world is allowed\nto rip or copy musical ideas,\n\n00:01:11.718 --> 00:01:13.454\nuse them in innovative ways.\n\n00:01:13.478 --> 00:01:16.453\nAnyone is allowed to mix them\nin different types of ways,\n\n00:01:16.477 --> 00:01:18.654\ndraw connections between musical ideas,\n\n00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:22.654\nand people can burn them or create\nfinal products and continue the circle.\n\n00:01:22.678 --> 00:01:25.014\nAnd what that's done\nis it's created, like I said,\n\n00:01:25.038 --> 00:01:27.038\na vibrant community that's very inclusive,\n\n00:01:27.062 --> 00:01:30.774\nwith people continually working\nto connect musical ideas,\n\n00:01:30.798 --> 00:01:34.214\ninnovate them and keep things\nconstantly up to date.\n\n00:01:34.238 --> 00:01:38.014\nToday's hit single\nis not last year's hit single.\n\n00:01:38.038 --> 00:01:40.214\nBut I'm not here\nto talk about music today.\n\n00:01:40.238 --> 00:01:41.694\nI'm here to talk about books.\n\n00:01:41.718 --> 00:01:45.134\nIn particular, textbooks\nand the kind of educational materials\n\n00:01:45.158 --> 00:01:47.574\nthat we use every day in school.\n\n00:01:47.598 --> 00:01:49.313\nHas anyone here ever been to school?\n\n00:01:49.337 --> 00:01:50.734\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:50.758 --> 00:01:54.734\nOK, does anybody realize\nthere's a crisis in our schools,\n\n00:01:54.758 --> 00:01:56.534\naround the world?\n\n00:01:56.558 --> 00:01:59.094\nI'm not going to spend\ntoo much time on that,\n\n00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:02.454\nbut what I want to talk about\nis some of the disconnects\n\n00:02:02.478 --> 00:02:04.974\nthat appear when an author\npublishes a book.\n\n00:02:04.998 --> 00:02:06.856\nThat in fact, the publishing process --\n\n00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.071\njust because of the fact\nthat it's complicated,\n\n00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:10.774\nit's heavy, books are expensive --\n\n00:02:10.798 --> 00:02:14.094\ncreates a sort of a wall\nbetween authors of books\n\n00:02:14.118 --> 00:02:15.654\nand the ultimate users of books,\n\n00:02:15.678 --> 00:02:19.774\nbe they teachers, students\nor just general readers.\n\n00:02:19.798 --> 00:02:22.934\nAnd this is even more true\nif you happen to speak a language\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:26.894\nother than one of the world's\nmajor languages, and especially English.\n\n00:02:26.918 --> 00:02:29.734\nI'm going to call these people\nbelow the barrier \"shutouts\"\n\n00:02:29.758 --> 00:02:31.901\nbecause they're really\nshut out of the process\n\n00:02:31.925 --> 00:02:34.453\nof being able to share\ntheir knowledge with the world.\n\n00:02:34.477 --> 00:02:37.669\nAnd so what I want to talk about today\nis trying to take these ideas\n\n00:02:37.693 --> 00:02:39.516\nthat we've seen in the musical culture\n\n00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.881\nand try to bring these\ntowards reinventing the way\n\n00:02:41.905 --> 00:02:45.734\nwe think about writing books,\nusing them and teaching from them.\n\n00:02:45.758 --> 00:02:47.574\nSo, that's what I'd like to talk about\n\n00:02:47.598 --> 00:02:49.837\nand, really, how we get\nfrom where we are now\n\n00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:51.134\nto where we need to go.\n\n00:02:51.158 --> 00:02:54.254\nThe first thing I'd like you to do\nis a little thought experiment.\n\n00:02:54.278 --> 00:02:56.040\nImagine taking all the world's books.\n\n00:02:56.064 --> 00:02:59.574\nOK, everybody imagine books\nand imagine just tearing out the pages.\n\n00:02:59.598 --> 00:03:01.694\nSo, liberating these pages\n\n00:03:01.718 --> 00:03:04.974\nand imagine digitizing them\nand then storing them\n\n00:03:04.998 --> 00:03:07.894\nin a vast, interconnected,\nglobal repository.\n\n00:03:07.918 --> 00:03:13.534\nThink of it as a massive iTunes\nfor book-type content.\n\n00:03:13.558 --> 00:03:16.814\nAnd then take that material\nand imagine making it all open,\n\n00:03:16.838 --> 00:03:19.894\nso that people can modify it,\nplay with it, improve it.\n\n00:03:19.918 --> 00:03:21.174\nImagine making it free,\n\n00:03:21.198 --> 00:03:24.437\nso that anyone in the world can have\naccess to all of this knowledge,\n\n00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:26.814\nand imagine using information technology\n\n00:03:26.838 --> 00:03:30.174\nso that you can update this content,\nimprove it, play with it,\n\n00:03:30.198 --> 00:03:34.854\non a timescale that's more\non the order of seconds instead of years.\n\n00:03:34.878 --> 00:03:37.734\nInstead of editions of a book\ncoming out every two years,\n\n00:03:37.758 --> 00:03:40.694\nimagine them coming out every 25 seconds.\n\n00:03:40.718 --> 00:03:44.974\nSo, imagine we could do that\nand imagine we could put people into this.\n\n00:03:44.998 --> 00:03:48.374\nSo that we could truly build\nan ecosystem with not just authors,\n\n00:03:48.398 --> 00:03:51.974\nbut all the people\nwho could be or want to be authors\n\n00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:54.054\nin all the different\nlanguages of the world,\n\n00:03:54.078 --> 00:03:56.654\nand I think if you could do this,\nit would be called --\n\n00:03:56.678 --> 00:03:59.254\nI'm just going to refer to it\nas a knowledge ecosystem.\n\n00:03:59.278 --> 00:04:01.374\nSo, really, this is the dream,\n\n00:04:01.398 --> 00:04:03.256\nand in a sense what you can think of it\n\n00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.423\nis we're trying\nto enable anyone in the world,\n\n00:04:05.447 --> 00:04:06.974\nI mean anyone in the world --\n\n00:04:06.998 --> 00:04:08.214\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:08.238 --> 00:04:10.334\nto be their own educational DJ,\n\n00:04:10.358 --> 00:04:13.174\ncreating educational materials,\nsharing them with the world,\n\n00:04:13.198 --> 00:04:14.934\nconstantly innovating on them.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.174\nSo, this is the dream.\n\n00:04:16.198 --> 00:04:19.014\nIn fact, this dream\nis actually being realized.\n\n00:04:19.038 --> 00:04:20.854\nOver the last six-and-a-half years,\n\n00:04:20.878 --> 00:04:23.534\nwe've been working really hard\nat Rice University\n\n00:04:23.558 --> 00:04:25.134\non a project called Connexions,\n\n00:04:25.158 --> 00:04:27.574\nand so what I'd like to do\nfor the rest of the talk\n\n00:04:27.598 --> 00:04:28.979\nis just tell you a little bit\n\n00:04:29.003 --> 00:04:31.054\nabout what people are doing\nwith Connexions,\n\n00:04:31.078 --> 00:04:33.414\nwhich you can kind of\nthink of as the counterpoint\n\n00:04:33.438 --> 00:04:35.343\nto Nicholas Negroponte's talk yesterday,\n\n00:04:35.367 --> 00:04:38.796\nwhere they're working on the hardware\nof bringing education to the world.\n\n00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.294\nWe're working on the open-source tools\n\n00:04:41.318 --> 00:04:42.854\nand the content.\n\n00:04:42.878 --> 00:04:45.694\nSo, that's sort of\nto put it in perspective here.\n\n00:04:45.718 --> 00:04:47.294\nSo, create.\n\n00:04:47.318 --> 00:04:50.294\nWhat are some of the people\nthat are using these kind of tools?\n\n00:04:50.318 --> 00:04:51.534\nWell, the first thing is,\n\n00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:54.414\nthere's a community\nof engineering professors,\n\n00:04:54.438 --> 00:04:56.534\nfrom Cambridge to Kyoto,\n\n00:04:56.558 --> 00:05:00.494\nwho are developing engineering content\nin electrical engineering\n\n00:05:00.518 --> 00:05:04.494\nto develop what you can think of\nas a massive, super textbook\n\n00:05:04.518 --> 00:05:07.454\nthat covers the entire area\nof electrical engineering.\n\n00:05:07.478 --> 00:05:08.694\nAnd not only that --\n\n00:05:08.718 --> 00:05:12.998\nit can be customized for use in each\nof their own individual institutions.\n\n00:05:14.078 --> 00:05:17.534\nIf people like Kitty Jones, a shut-out --\n\n00:05:17.558 --> 00:05:21.934\na private music teacher and mom\nfrom Champagne, Illinois,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:25.334\nwho wanted to share her fantastic\nmusic content with the world,\n\n00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:27.614\non how to teach kids how to play music --\n\n00:05:27.638 --> 00:05:33.094\nHer material is now used\nover 600,000 times per month.\n\n00:05:33.118 --> 00:05:34.614\nTremendous use.\n\n00:05:34.638 --> 00:05:38.894\nIn fact, a lot of this use coming\nfrom United States K-12 schools,\n\n00:05:38.918 --> 00:05:43.334\nbecause anyone who's involved\nin a school scale back,\n\n00:05:43.358 --> 00:05:46.014\nthe first thing that's cut\nis the music curriculum.\n\n00:05:46.038 --> 00:05:48.534\nAnd so this is just indicating\nthe tremendous thirst\n\n00:05:48.558 --> 00:05:50.694\nfor this kind of open, free content.\n\n00:05:50.718 --> 00:05:53.094\nA lot of teachers are using this stuff.\n\n00:05:53.118 --> 00:05:56.174\nWhat about ripping?\nWhat about copying, reusing?\n\n00:05:56.198 --> 00:05:59.614\nA team of volunteers\nat the University of Texas at El Paso --\n\n00:05:59.638 --> 00:06:04.494\ngraduate students translating\nthis engineering super textbook ideas.\n\n00:06:04.518 --> 00:06:06.134\nAnd within about a week,\n\n00:06:06.158 --> 00:06:08.494\nhaving this be some\nof our most popular material\n\n00:06:08.518 --> 00:06:12.894\nin widespread use all over Latin America,\nand in particular in Mexico,\n\n00:06:12.918 --> 00:06:15.734\nbecause of the open,\nextensible nature of this.\n\n00:06:15.758 --> 00:06:18.574\nPeople, volunteers and even companies\n\n00:06:18.598 --> 00:06:21.214\nthat are translating materials\ninto Asian languages\n\n00:06:21.238 --> 00:06:23.414\nlike Chinese, Japanese and Thai,\n\n00:06:23.438 --> 00:06:26.838\nto spread the knowledge even further.\n\n00:06:27.718 --> 00:06:29.494\nOK, what about people who are mixing?\n\n00:06:29.518 --> 00:06:30.694\nWhat does \"mixing\" mean?\n\n00:06:30.718 --> 00:06:32.734\n\"Mixing\" means\nbuilding customized courses,\n\n00:06:32.758 --> 00:06:36.254\nmeans building customized books.\n\n00:06:36.278 --> 00:06:38.014\nCompanies like National Instruments,\n\n00:06:38.038 --> 00:06:43.134\nwho are embedding very powerful,\ninteractive simulations\n\n00:06:43.158 --> 00:06:44.334\ninto the materials,\n\n00:06:44.358 --> 00:06:47.294\nso that we can go way beyond\nour regular kind of textbook\n\n00:06:47.318 --> 00:06:48.534\nto an experience\n\n00:06:48.558 --> 00:06:52.494\nthat all the teaching materials\nare things you can actually interact with\n\n00:06:52.518 --> 00:06:56.454\nand play around with\nand actually learn as you do.\n\n00:06:56.478 --> 00:06:58.814\nWe've been working\nwith Teachers Without Borders,\n\n00:06:58.838 --> 00:07:01.077\nwho are very interested\nin mixing our materials.\n\n00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:03.774\nThey're going to be using\nConnexions as their platform\n\n00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:09.014\nto develop and deliver teaching materials\nfor teaching teachers how to teach\n\n00:07:09.038 --> 00:07:11.614\nin 84 countries around the world.\n\n00:07:11.638 --> 00:07:14.854\nTWB is currently in Iraq,\n\n00:07:14.878 --> 00:07:19.414\ntraining 20,000 teachers\nsupported by USAID.\n\n00:07:19.438 --> 00:07:22.254\nAnd to them, this idea\nof being able to remix\n\n00:07:22.278 --> 00:07:26.934\nand customize to the local context\nis extraordinarily important,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.694\nbecause just providing\nfree content to people\n\n00:07:29.718 --> 00:07:32.734\nhas actually been likened\nby people in the developing world\n\n00:07:32.758 --> 00:07:35.094\nto a kind of cultural imperialism --\n\n00:07:35.118 --> 00:07:36.654\nthat if you don't empower people\n\n00:07:36.678 --> 00:07:39.054\nwith the ability\nto re-contextualize the material,\n\n00:07:39.078 --> 00:07:42.254\ntranslate it into their own language\nand take ownership of it,\n\n00:07:42.278 --> 00:07:44.014\nit's not good.\n\n00:07:44.038 --> 00:07:48.414\nOK, other organizations\nwe've been working with, UC Merced --\n\n00:07:48.438 --> 00:07:50.214\npeople know about UC Merced.\n\n00:07:50.238 --> 00:07:54.134\nIt's a new university in California,\nin the Central Valley,\n\n00:07:54.158 --> 00:07:56.894\nworking very closely\nwith community colleges.\n\n00:07:56.918 --> 00:07:58.254\nThey're actually developing\n\n00:07:58.278 --> 00:08:00.574\na lot of their science\nand engineering curriculum\n\n00:08:00.598 --> 00:08:05.094\nto spread widely\naround the world in our system.\n\n00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:08.023\nAnd they're also trying to develop\nall of their software tools\n\n00:08:08.047 --> 00:08:09.454\ncompletely open-source.\n\n00:08:09.478 --> 00:08:14.214\nWe've been working with AMD,\nwhich has a project called 50x15,\n\n00:08:14.238 --> 00:08:16.974\nwhich is trying to bring\nInternet connectivity\n\n00:08:16.998 --> 00:08:20.614\nto 50 percent of the world's\npopulation by 2015.\n\n00:08:20.638 --> 00:08:22.654\nWe're going to be\nproviding content to them\n\n00:08:22.678 --> 00:08:24.814\nin a whole range of different languages.\n\n00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:27.934\nAnd we've also been working\nwith a number of other organizations.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:31.974\nIn particular, a bunch of the projects\nthat are funded by Hewlett Foundation,\n\n00:08:31.998 --> 00:08:36.454\nwho have taken a real leadership role\nin this area of open content.\n\n00:08:36.478 --> 00:08:40.054\nOK, burn -- I think\nthis is, sort of, quite interesting.\n\n00:08:40.078 --> 00:08:44.334\n\"Burn\" is the idea of trying\nto create the physical instantiation\n\n00:08:44.358 --> 00:08:45.574\nof one of these courses.\n\n00:08:45.598 --> 00:08:47.654\nAnd I think a lot of you received --\n\n00:08:47.678 --> 00:08:53.534\nI think all of you received one\nof these music books in your gift pack.\n\n00:08:53.558 --> 00:08:55.014\nA little present for you.\n\n00:08:55.038 --> 00:08:58.534\nJust to tell you quickly about it:\nthis is an engineering textbook.\n\n00:08:58.558 --> 00:09:02.198\nIt's about 300 pages long, hardbound.\n\n00:09:03.158 --> 00:09:05.478\nThis costs -- anybody guess?\n\n00:09:07.278 --> 00:09:09.334\nHow much would it cost in a bookstore?\n\n00:09:09.358 --> 00:09:10.574\n(Audience) 65 dollars.\n\n00:09:10.598 --> 00:09:15.334\nRichard Baraniuk:\nOK. This costs 22 dollars to the student.\n\n00:09:15.358 --> 00:09:16.694\nWhy does it cost 22 dollars?\n\n00:09:16.718 --> 00:09:18.694\nBecause it's published on demand\n\n00:09:18.718 --> 00:09:22.254\nand it's developed\nfrom this repository of open materials.\n\n00:09:22.278 --> 00:09:24.974\nIf this book were to be published\nby a regular publisher,\n\n00:09:24.998 --> 00:09:28.174\nit would cost at least 122 dollars.\n\n00:09:28.198 --> 00:09:29.414\nSo what we're seeing\n\n00:09:29.438 --> 00:09:32.334\nis moving this burning\nor publication process\n\n00:09:32.358 --> 00:09:35.854\nfrom the regular,\nsort of single-authored book\n\n00:09:35.878 --> 00:09:38.254\ntowards community-authored materials\n\n00:09:38.278 --> 00:09:42.014\nthat are modular, that are customized\nto each individual class\n\n00:09:42.038 --> 00:09:44.694\nand published on demand\nvery inexpensively,\n\n00:09:44.718 --> 00:09:47.214\neither pushed out through Amazon\n\n00:09:47.238 --> 00:09:51.414\nor published directly\nthrough an on-demand press, like QOOP.\n\n00:09:51.438 --> 00:09:54.854\nAnd I think that this is\nan extraordinarily interesting area\n\n00:09:54.878 --> 00:10:00.694\nbecause there is tremendous area\nunder this long tail in publishing.\n\n00:10:00.718 --> 00:10:02.854\nWe're not talking\nabout the Harry Potter end,\n\n00:10:02.878 --> 00:10:04.094\nright at the left side.\n\n00:10:04.118 --> 00:10:05.334\nWe're talking about books\n\n00:10:05.358 --> 00:10:07.974\non hypergeometric\npartial differential equations.\n\n00:10:07.998 --> 00:10:12.294\nBooks that might sell\n100 copies a year, 1,000 copies a year.\n\n00:10:12.318 --> 00:10:17.174\nThere is tremendous\nsustaining revenue under this long tail\n\n00:10:17.198 --> 00:10:19.614\nto sustain open projects like ours,\n\n00:10:19.638 --> 00:10:24.494\nbut also to sustain this new emergence\nof on-demand publishers,\n\n00:10:24.518 --> 00:10:26.814\nlike QOOP, who produced these two books.\n\n00:10:26.838 --> 00:10:30.124\nAnd I think one of the things\nthat you should take away from this talk\n\n00:10:30.148 --> 00:10:34.174\nis that there's an impending\ncut-out-the-middle-man disintermediation,\n\n00:10:34.198 --> 00:10:36.854\nthat's going to be happening\nin the publishing industry.\n\n00:10:36.878 --> 00:10:39.734\nAnd it's going to reach a crescendo\nover the next few years,\n\n00:10:39.758 --> 00:10:43.574\nand I think that it's for our benefit,\nreally, and for the world's benefit.\n\n00:10:43.598 --> 00:10:45.254\nOK, so what are the enablers?\n\n00:10:45.278 --> 00:10:47.214\nWhat's really making all of this happen?\n\n00:10:47.238 --> 00:10:48.854\nThere's tons of technology,\n\n00:10:48.878 --> 00:10:52.734\nand the only piece of technology\nthat I really want to talk about is XML.\n\n00:10:52.758 --> 00:10:54.494\nHow many people know about XML?\n\n00:10:54.518 --> 00:10:55.734\nOh, great.\n\n00:10:55.758 --> 00:10:57.534\nSo it's the future of the web, right?\n\n00:10:57.558 --> 00:11:01.934\nIt's semantic representation of content.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.334\nAnd what you can really\nthink of XML in this case\n\n00:11:04.358 --> 00:11:07.254\nis it's the packaging\nthat we're putting around these pages.\n\n00:11:07.278 --> 00:11:09.534\nRemember we took the book,\ntore the pages out?\n\n00:11:09.558 --> 00:11:11.454\nWell, what the XML is going to do\n\n00:11:11.478 --> 00:11:15.814\nis it's going to turn those pages\ninto Lego blocks.\n\n00:11:15.838 --> 00:11:17.734\nXML are the nubs on the Lego\n\n00:11:17.758 --> 00:11:21.814\nthat allow us to combine the content\ntogether in a myriad different ways,\n\n00:11:21.838 --> 00:11:25.334\nand it provides us a framework\nto share content.\n\n00:11:25.358 --> 00:11:28.654\nSo, it lets you take this ecosystem\n\n00:11:28.678 --> 00:11:31.254\nin its primordial state\nof all this content,\n\n00:11:31.278 --> 00:11:33.136\nall the pages you've torn out of books,\n\n00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.134\nand create highly sophisticated\nlearning machines:\n\n00:11:37.158 --> 00:11:39.894\nbooks, courses, course packs.\n\n00:11:39.918 --> 00:11:43.614\nIt gives you the ability\nto personalize the learning experience\n\n00:11:43.638 --> 00:11:45.334\nto each individual student,\n\n00:11:45.358 --> 00:11:48.014\nso that every student\ncan have a book or a course\n\n00:11:48.038 --> 00:11:51.494\nthat's customized to their\nlearning style, their context,\n\n00:11:51.518 --> 00:11:54.254\ntheir language and the things\nthat excite them.\n\n00:11:54.278 --> 00:11:57.894\nIt lets you reuse the same materials\nin multiple different ways,\n\n00:11:57.918 --> 00:11:59.894\nand surprising new ways.\n\n00:11:59.918 --> 00:12:01.854\nIt lets you interconnect ideas,\n\n00:12:01.878 --> 00:12:06.054\nindicating how fields\nrelate to each other.\n\n00:12:06.078 --> 00:12:08.334\nAnd I'll just give you my personal story.\n\n00:12:08.358 --> 00:12:10.854\nWe came up with this\nsix-and-a-half years ago\n\n00:12:10.878 --> 00:12:13.494\nbecause I teach the stuff in the red box.\n\n00:12:13.518 --> 00:12:17.294\nAnd my day job, as Chris said --\nI'm an electrical engineering professor.\n\n00:12:17.318 --> 00:12:18.974\nI teach signal processing\n\n00:12:18.998 --> 00:12:21.534\nand my challenge\nwas to show that this math --\n\n00:12:21.558 --> 00:12:23.894\nWow, about half of you\nhave already fallen asleep\n\n00:12:23.918 --> 00:12:25.374\njust looking at the equation.\n\n00:12:25.398 --> 00:12:26.574\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:26.598 --> 00:12:28.054\nBut this seemingly dry math\n\n00:12:28.078 --> 00:12:32.414\nis actually the center\nof this tremendously powerful web\n\n00:12:32.438 --> 00:12:34.134\nthat links technology --\n\n00:12:34.158 --> 00:12:37.894\nthat links really cool applications\nlike music synthesizers\n\n00:12:37.918 --> 00:12:41.054\nto tremendous economic opportunities,\n\n00:12:41.078 --> 00:12:43.214\nbut also governed\nby intellectual property.\n\n00:12:43.238 --> 00:12:44.654\nAnd the thing that I realized\n\n00:12:44.678 --> 00:12:46.934\nis there was no way\nthat I, as an engineer,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.578\ncould write this book\nthat would get all of this across.\n\n00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:51.031\nWe needed a community to do it\n\n00:12:51.055 --> 00:12:55.094\nand we needed new tools\nto be able to interconnect these ideas.\n\n00:12:55.118 --> 00:12:57.974\nAnd I think that really,\nin a sense, what we're trying to do\n\n00:12:57.998 --> 00:12:59.974\nis make Minsky's dream come to a reality,\n\n00:12:59.998 --> 00:13:02.254\nwhere you can imagine\nall the books in a library\n\n00:13:02.278 --> 00:13:04.214\nactually starting to talk to each other.\n\n00:13:04.238 --> 00:13:07.934\nAnd people who are teachers out here --\nwhoever taught, you know this --\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:12.454\nit's the interconnections between ideas\nthat teaching is really all about.\n\n00:13:12.478 --> 00:13:14.534\nOK, back to math.\n\n00:13:14.558 --> 00:13:17.054\nImagine -- this is possible:\n\n00:13:17.078 --> 00:13:21.654\nthat every single equation that you\nclick on in one of your new e-texts\n\n00:13:21.678 --> 00:13:25.414\nis something that you're going to be able\nto explore and experiment with.\n\n00:13:25.438 --> 00:13:28.974\nSo imagine your kid's\nalgebra textbook in seventh grade.\n\n00:13:28.998 --> 00:13:30.894\nYou can click on every single equation\n\n00:13:30.918 --> 00:13:33.774\nand bring up a little tool\nto be able to experiment with it,\n\n00:13:33.798 --> 00:13:35.654\ntinker with it, understand it.\n\n00:13:35.678 --> 00:13:38.414\nBecause we really\ndon't understand until we do.\n\n00:13:38.438 --> 00:13:42.614\nThe same type of mark-up,\nlike MathML, for chemistry.\n\n00:13:42.638 --> 00:13:43.934\nImagine chemistry textbooks\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:48.174\nthat actually understand the structure\nof how molecules are formed.\n\n00:13:48.198 --> 00:13:50.134\nImagine Music XML\n\n00:13:50.158 --> 00:13:53.574\nthat actually lets you delve\ninto the semantic structure of music,\n\n00:13:53.598 --> 00:13:55.414\nplay with it, understand it.\n\n00:13:55.438 --> 00:13:58.614\nIt's no wonder that everybody's\ngetting into it, right?\n\n00:13:58.638 --> 00:13:59.894\nEven the three wise men.\n\n00:13:59.918 --> 00:14:01.094\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:01.118 --> 00:14:06.654\nOK, the second big enabler,\nand this is where I told a big lie.\n\n00:14:06.678 --> 00:14:09.814\nThe second big enabler\nis intellectual property.\n\n00:14:09.838 --> 00:14:11.334\nBecause, in fact, I got up here\n\n00:14:11.358 --> 00:14:13.694\nand I talked about how great\nthe music culture is.\n\n00:14:13.718 --> 00:14:17.334\nWe can share and rip, mix and burn,\nbut in fact, that's all illegal.\n\n00:14:17.358 --> 00:14:20.734\nAnd we would be accused\nof [piracy] for doing that,\n\n00:14:20.758 --> 00:14:24.094\nbecause this music has been propertized.\n\n00:14:24.118 --> 00:14:28.414\nIt's now owned,\nmuch of it by big industries.\n\n00:14:28.438 --> 00:14:31.200\nSo, really, the key thing here\nis we can't let this happen.\n\n00:14:31.224 --> 00:14:33.934\nWe can't let this\nNapster thing happen here.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.911\nSo, what we have to do\nis get it right from the very beginning.\n\n00:14:36.935 --> 00:14:40.334\nAnd what we have to do\nis find an intellectual property framework\n\n00:14:40.358 --> 00:14:45.414\nthat makes sharing safe\nand makes it easily understandable.\n\n00:14:45.438 --> 00:14:49.254\nAnd the inspiration here\nis taken from open-source software.\n\n00:14:49.278 --> 00:14:52.854\nThings like Linux and the GPL.\n\n00:14:52.878 --> 00:14:55.259\nThe Creative Commons licenses.\n\n00:14:55.283 --> 00:14:57.474\nHow many people\nhave heard of creative commons?\n\n00:14:57.498 --> 00:14:59.454\nIf you have not, you must learn about it.\n\n00:14:59.478 --> 00:15:01.054\nCreativecommons.org.\n\n00:15:01.078 --> 00:15:04.414\nAt the bottom of every piece\nof material in Connexions\n\n00:15:04.438 --> 00:15:06.294\nand in lots of other projects,\n\n00:15:06.318 --> 00:15:07.894\nyou can find their logo.\n\n00:15:07.918 --> 00:15:11.494\nClicking on that logo\ntakes you to an absolute no-nonsense,\n\n00:15:11.518 --> 00:15:14.654\nhuman-readable document, a deed,\n\n00:15:14.678 --> 00:15:17.345\nthat tells you exactly\nwhat you can do with this content.\n\n00:15:17.369 --> 00:15:20.974\nIn fact, you're free to share it,\nto do all of these things:\n\n00:15:20.998 --> 00:15:24.054\nto copy it, to change it,\neven to make commercial use of it,\n\n00:15:24.078 --> 00:15:26.974\nas long as you attribute the author.\n\n00:15:26.998 --> 00:15:31.414\nBecause in academic publishing\nand much of educational publishing,\n\n00:15:31.438 --> 00:15:35.774\nit's really this idea of sharing knowledge\n\n00:15:35.798 --> 00:15:37.094\nand making impact.\n\n00:15:37.118 --> 00:15:40.974\nThat's why people write,\nnot necessarily making bucks.\n\n00:15:40.998 --> 00:15:43.094\nWe're not talking\nabout Harry Potter, right?\n\n00:15:43.118 --> 00:15:44.814\nWe're at the long tail end here.\n\n00:15:44.838 --> 00:15:49.494\nBehind that is the legal code,\nvery carefully

tremendous uptake\n\n00:16:05.358 --> 00:16:08.814\nof the number of people\nthat are actually licensing music\n\n00:16:08.838 --> 00:16:12.054\nto make it free for people\nwho do this whole idea of re-sampling,\n\n00:16:12.078 --> 00:16:14.214\nripping, mixing, burning and sharing.\n\n00:16:14.238 --> 00:16:17.934\nOK, I'd like to conclude\nwith just the last few points.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.334\nSo, we've built this idea of a commons.\n\n00:16:20.358 --> 00:16:22.254\nPeople are using it.\n\n00:16:22.278 --> 00:16:28.574\nWe get over 500,000 unique visitors\nper month, just to our particular site.\n\n00:16:28.598 --> 00:16:32.654\nMIT OpenCourseWare,\nwhich is another large open-content site,\n\n00:16:32.678 --> 00:16:34.894\ngets a similar number of hits.\n\n00:16:34.918 --> 00:16:36.574\nBut how do we protect this?\n\n00:16:36.598 --> 00:16:38.374\nHow do we protect it into the future?\n\n00:16:38.398 --> 00:16:41.134\nAnd the first thing\nthat people are probably thinking\n\n00:16:41.158 --> 00:16:42.774\nis quality control, right?\n\n00:16:42.798 --> 00:16:47.494\nBecause we're saying that anybody\ncan contribute things to this commons.\n\n00:16:47.518 --> 00:16:50.334\nAnybody can contribute anything.\n\n00:16:50.358 --> 00:16:52.894\nSo that could be a problem.\n\n00:16:52.918 --> 00:16:57.134\nIt didn't take long until people\nstarted contributing materials,\n\n00:16:57.158 --> 00:16:59.294\nfor example, on lingerie,\n\n00:16:59.318 --> 00:17:01.294\nwhich is actually a pretty good module.\n\n00:17:01.318 --> 00:17:06.894\nThe only problem is it's plagiarized\nfrom a major French feminist journal,\n\n00:17:06.918 --> 00:17:09.734\nand when you go\nto the supposed course website,\n\n00:17:09.758 --> 00:17:13.934\nit points to a lingerie-selling website.\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.134\nSo this is a little bit of a problem.\n\n00:17:16.158 --> 00:17:19.214\nSo we clearly need some kind\nof idea of quality control\n\n00:17:19.238 --> 00:17:22.934\nand this is really where the idea\nof review and peer review comes in.\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.863\nYou come to TED. Why do you come to TED?\n\n00:17:25.358 --> 00:17:27.773\nBecause Chris and his team have ensured\n\n00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:30.974\nthat things are\nvery, very high quality, right?\n\n00:17:30.998 --> 00:17:33.414\nAnd so we need to be able\nto do the same thing.\n\n00:17:33.438 --> 00:17:36.494\nAnd we need to be able\nto design structures,\n\n00:17:36.518 --> 00:17:39.574\nand what we're doing\nis designing social software\n\n00:17:39.598 --> 00:17:42.694\nto enable anyone to build\ntheir own peer review process,\n\n00:17:42.718 --> 00:17:44.534\nand we call these things \"lenses.\"\n\n00:17:44.558 --> 00:17:45.974\nAnd basically what they allow\n\n00:17:45.998 --> 00:17:49.414\nis anyone out there can develop\ntheir own peer-review process,\n\n00:17:49.438 --> 00:17:53.414\nso that they can focus\non the content in the repository\n\n00:17:53.438 --> 00:17:55.153\nthat they think is really important.\n\n00:17:55.177 --> 00:17:58.454\nAnd you can think of TED\nas a potential lens.\n\n00:17:58.478 --> 00:18:00.255\nSo I'd just like to end by saying:\n\n00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:04.934\nyou can really view this\nas a call to action.\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:09.934\nConnexions and open content\nis all about sharing knowledge.\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:14.974\nAll of you here are tremendously imbued\nwith tremendous amounts of knowledge,\n\n00:18:14.998 --> 00:18:17.774\nand what I'd like to do\nis invite each and every one of you\n\n00:18:17.798 --> 00:18:21.014\nto contribute to this project\nand other projects of its type,\n\n00:18:21.038 --> 00:18:24.814\nbecause I think together\nwe can truly change the landscape\n\n00:18:24.838 --> 00:18:27.054\nof education and educational publishing.\n\n00:18:27.078 --> 00:18:28.278\nSo, thanks very much."}, {"title": "Nerdcore comedy", "duration": "1136", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ze_frank_s_nerdcore_comedy", "transcript": "You know, when Chris first approached me to speak at TED, I said no, because I felt like I wasn't going to be able to make that personal connection, you know, that I wanted to.

CASUAL][WORD.](Applause)I invented the Placebo Camera.(Laughter)It doesn't actually take pictures, but it's a hell of a lot cheaper, and you still feel like you were there.(Laughter)(Clears his throat)(Laughter)\"Dear Sir, good day, compliments of the day, and my best wishes to you and family.(Breathes in)I know this letter will come to you surprisingly, but let it not be a surprise to you, for nature has a way of arriving unannounced, and, as an adage says, originals are very hard to find, but their echoes sound ouder. So I decided to contact you myself, for you to assure me of safety and honesty, if I have to entrust any amount of money under your custody. I am Mr Micheal Bangura, the son of late Mr Thaimu Bangura who was the Minister of Finance in Sierra Leone but was killed during the civil war.(Laughter)Knowing your country to be economical conducive for investment, and your people as transparent and trustworthy to engage in business, on which premise I write you.(Laughter)Before my father death, he had the sum of 23 million United States dollars, which he kept away from the rebel leaders during the course of the war.(Laughter)This fund was supposed to be used for the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country, before the outbreak of war. When the war broke out, the rebel leader demanded the fund be given to him, my father insisted it was not in his possession, and he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund. Meanwhile, my mother and I is the only person who knows about it because my father always confide in me.(Sighs)I made an arrangement with a Red Cross relief worker, who used his official van to transport the money to Lungi Airport, Freetown, although he did not know the real contents of the box.(Laughter)The fund was deposited as a family reasure, in a safe, reliable security company in Dakar, Senegal, where I was only given temporary asylum. I do not wish to invest the money in Senegal due to unfavorable economic climate, and so close to my country. The only assistance I need from you, which I know you would do for me, are the following: one, be a silent partner and receive the funds in your account in trust; two, provide a bank account under your control to which the funds will be remitted; three, receive the funds into your account in trust; take out your commission; and leave the rest of the money until I arrive, after the transfer is complete. Sincerely, Mr Micheal Bangura.\"(Laughter)(Applause)This is really embarrassing. I was told backstage that I have 18 minutes. I only prepared 15.(Laughter)So if it's cool, I'd like to just wait for three.(Laughter)(Laughter ends)I'm really sorry.(Laughter)(Applause)What's your name?(Laughter)Mark Surfas. It's pretty cool, huh? Pursuing happiness.(Laughter)Are you a virgin? Virgin?I mean \u2014 no, I mean like in the TED sense?(Laughter)Are you? Oh, yeah? So what are you, like, a thousand, two thousand, somewhere in there? Huh? Oh? You don't know what I'm talking about?(Laughter)Ah, Mark \u2014(Laughter)Surfas.(Laughter)1,860 \u2014 am I good?And that's nothing to be ashamed of. That's nothing to be ashamed of.(Applause)Yeah, I was hanging out with some Google guys last night. Really cool, we were getting wasted.(Laughter)And they were telling me that Google software has gotten so advanced that, based on your interaction with Google over your lifetime, they can actually predict what you are going to say \u2014(Laughter)next.And I was like, \"Get the fuck out of here. That's crazy.\"(Laughter)But they said, \"No, but don't show anyone.\"But they slipped up. And they said that I could just type in \"What was I going to say next?\" and my name, and it would tell me. And I have to tell you, this is an unadulterated piece of software, this is a real Internet browser and this is the actual Google site, and we're going to test it out live today. What was I going to say next? And \"Ze Frank\" \u2014 that's me. Am I feeling lucky?(Laughter)(Shouting) Am I feeling lucky?Audience: Yes! Yeah!(Sighs)(Laughter)Ze Frank: Oh! Amazing.(Laughter)In March of 2001 \u2014(Laughter)I filmed myself dancing to Madonna's \"Justify My Love.\" On a Thursday, I sent out a link to a website that featured those clips to 17 of my closest friends, as part of an invitation to my \u2014 an invitation to my th \u2014 th \u2014 26th birthday party.(Laughter)(Clears throat)By Monday, over a million people were coming to this site a day.(Sighs)(Laughter)Within a week, I received a call from Earthlink that said, due to a 10 cents per megabyte overage charge, I owed them 30,000 dollars.(Laughter)Needless to say, I was able to leave my job.[WAS LAID OFF](Laughter)And, finally, you know, become freelance.(Laughter)[UNEMPLOYED]But some people refer to me more as, like, an Internet guru or \u2014[JACKASS]swami.(Laughter)I knew I had something. I'd basically distilled a very difficult-to-explain and complex philosophy, which I won't get into here, because it's a little too deep for all of you, but \u2014(Laughter)It's about what makes websites popular, and, you know, it's \u2014[DANCE LIKE AN IDIOT AND DON'T SELL ANYTHING]It's unfortunate that I don't have more time. Maybe I can come back next year, or something like that.(Laughter)I'm obsessed with email. I get a lot of it. Four years later, I still get probably two or three hundred emails a day from people I don't know, and it's been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know different cultures, you know? It's like a microscope to the rest of the world. You can kind of peer into other people's lives. And I also feel like I get a lot of inspiration from the average user. For example, somebody wrote, \"Hey Ze, if you ever come to Boulder, you should rock out with us,\" and I said, \"Why wait?\"[rocking out](Video) (Music)And they said, \"Hey Ze, thanks for rocking out, but I meant the kind of rocking out where we'd be naked.\"(Laughter)And that was embarrassing. But you know, it's kind of a collaboration between me and the fans, so I said, \"Sure.\"[rocking out naked](Video) (Music)(Laughter)I hear a lot of you whispering.(Laughter)And I know what you're saying, \"Holy crap! How is his presentation so smooth?\"(Laughter)And I have to say that it's not all me this year. I guess Chris has to take some credit here, because in years past, I guess there's been some sort of subpar speakers at TED. I don't know.And so, this year, Chris sent us a TED conference simulator.(Laughter)Which really allowed us as speakers to get there, in the trenches, and practice at home so that we would be ready for this experience. And I've got to say that, you know, it's really, really great to be here.(Pre-recorded applause)I'd like to tell all of you a little joke.(Pre-recorded applause and cheering)Not just the good stuff, though. You can do heckler mode.Voice: Hey, moron, get off the stage!ZF: You get off the stage.(Laughter)Voice: We want Malcolm Gladwell.(Laughter)(Baby cooing)(Huge crowd applauding)In case you run over time.(Heroic music)Just one last thing I'd like to say, I'd, really \u2014(Laughter)I'd like to thank all of you for being here.(Loud music)(Laughter)And frog mode.(Singing)(Sings) \"Ah, the first time that I made love to a rock shrimp \u2014\"(Laughter)[Spam jokes are the new airplane jokes](Sighs)It's true. Some people say to me, \"Ze, you're doing all this stuff, this Internet stuff, and you're not making any money.\"(Laughter)\"Why?\" And I say, \"Mom, Dad \u2014(Laughter)I'm trying.\" I don't know if you're all aware of this, but the video game market, kids are playing these video games, but, supposedly, there's tons of money. I mean, like, I think, 100,000 dollars or so a year is being spent on these things. So I decided to try my hand. I came up with a few games.(Laughter)This is called \"Atheist.\" I figured it would be popular with the young kids. OK. Look, I'll move around and say some things.(Sighs)[Game over. There is no replay.](Laughter)So that didn't go over so well.(Laughter)I don't really understand why you're laughing.(Laughter)Should have done this before I tried to pitch it. \"Buddhist,\" of course, looks very, very similar to \"Atheist.\"(Laughter)But you come back as a duck.(Laughter)And this is great because, you know, for a quarter, you can play this for a long time.(Laughter)And Chris had said in an email that we should really bring something new to TED, something that we haven't shown anyone. So, I made this for TED. It's \"Christian.\" It's the third in the series. I'm hoping it's going to do well this year.(Sighs)(Laughter)Do you have a preference?(Laughter)Good choice.(Laughter)So you can wait for the Second Coming,which is a random number between one and 500 million.(Laughter)So really, what are we talking about here? Oh, tech joy.(Laughter)Tech joy, to me, means something, because I get a lot of joy out of tech. And in fact, making things using technology \u2014 and I'm being serious here, even though I'm using my sarcastic voice \u2014 I won't \u2014 hold on. Making things, you know \u2014 making things actually does give me a lot of joy. It's the process of creation that keeps me sort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life, and it's that feeling of being about 80 percent complete on a project \u2014 where you know you still have something to do, but it's not finished, and you're not starting something \u2014 that really fills my entire life.And so, what I've done is,I started getting interested in creating online social spaces to share that feeling with people who don't consider themselves artists. We're in a culture of guru-ship. It's so hard to use some software because, you know, it's unapproachable, people feel like they have to read the manual. So I try to create these very minimal activities that allow people to express themselves, and, hopefully \u2014(\"The End\" by The Doors)Whoa! I'm like \u2014 on the page, but it doesn't exist.(Laughter)It's, like \u2014 seriously, though \u2014(Laughter)I try to create meaningful environments for people to express themselves.(Laughter)Here I created a contest called, \"When Office Supplies Attack,\" which, I think, really resonated with the working population.(Laughter)Over 500 entries in three weeks. Toilet paper fashion.(Laughter)Again, people from all over the country. The watch is particularly incredible.(Laughter)Online drawing tools \u2014 you've probably seen a lot of them. I think they're wonderful. It's a chance for people to get to play with crayons and all that kind of stuff. But I'm interested in the process of creating, as the real event that I'm interested in. And the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing, and they get bummed out at this, sort of, you know, stick figure, awful little thing that they created. And eventually, it just makes them stop playing with it, or they draw penises and things like that.(Laughter)So, the Scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool. In other words, it's a helping tool. You can draw your simple stick figure, and it collaborates with you to create sort of a post-war German etching.(Laughter)In fact, it's tuned to be better at drawing things that look worse. So, we go ahead, and we start scribbling. So the idea is that you can really, you know, partake in this process, but watch something really crappy look beautiful. And here are some of my favorites. This is the little trap marionette that was submitted to me. Very cool.(Laughter)Darling. Beautiful stuff. I mean this is incredible. An 11-year-old girl drew this and submitted it. It's just gorgeous.(Laughter)I'm dead serious here. This is not a joke.(Laughter)But, I think it's a really fun and wonderful thing. So this is called the \"Fiction Project.\" This is an online space, which is basically a refurbished message board that encourages collaborative fiction writing. These are haikus. None of the haikus were written by the same person. In fact, each line is contributed by a different person at a different time. I think that the \"now tied up, tied down, mistress cruel approaches me, now tied down, it's up.\" It's an amazing way, and I'll tell you, if you come home, and your spouse, or whoever it is, says, \"Let's talk\" \u2014 That, like, chills you to the very core.(Laughter)But it's peripheral activities like these that allow people to get together, doing fun things. They actually get to know each other, and it's sort of like low-threshold peripheral activities that I think are the key to bringing up some of our bonding social capital that we're lacking. And very, very quickly \u2014 I love puppets. Here's a puppet. It dances to music. Lotte Reiniger, an amazing shadow puppeteer in the 20s, that started doing more elaborate things. I became interested in puppets, and I just want to show one last thing to you. Oh, this is how you make puppets.(Applause)Chris Anderson: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Ze Frank.(Applause)", "id": 87, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.456 --> 00:00:17.934\nYou know, when Chris first approached me\nto speak at TED, I said no,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.101\nbecause I felt\nlike I wasn't going to be able\n\n00:00:20.125 --> 00:00:23.364\nto make that personal connection,\nyou know, that I wanted to.\n\n00:00:23.388 --> 00:00:24.934\nIt's such a large conference.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.457\nBut he explained to me\nthat he was in a bind,\n\n00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:30.934\nand that he was having trouble\nfinding the kind of sex appeal\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.934\nand star power that\nthe conference was known for.\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.793\nSo I said fine, Ted -- I mean Chris.\n\n00:00:36.817 --> 00:00:38.934\nI'll come on two conditions.\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:43.800\nOne: I want to speak as early\nin the morning as possible.\n\n00:00:44.307 --> 00:00:48.574\nAnd two: I want to pick\nthe theme for TED 2006.\n\n00:00:48.598 --> 00:00:50.707\nAnd luckily he agreed.\n\n00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:55.413\nAnd the theme, in two years,\nis going to be \"Cute Pictures Of Puppies.\"\n\n00:00:55.795 --> 00:00:58.601\n(Video) (Music)\n\n00:01:05.612 --> 00:01:07.298\n[How to Dance Properly BASIC TWIRL]\n\n00:01:07.322 --> 00:01:08.983\n[NEW SCHOOL]\n\n00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:12.616\n[OLD SCHOOL]\n\n00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.711\n[WHO'S YOUR DADDY?]\n\n00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:18.121\n[\"RIDE THE PONY\"]\n\n00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:21.918\n[MAKE LOVE TO THE CROWD]\n\n00:01:21.942 --> 00:01:23.994\n[SMACKING THAT ASS]\n\n00:01:24.018 --> 00:01:26.195\n[STIR THE POT OF LOVE]\n\n00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.102\n[HANGING OUT ...

And I say, \"Mom, Dad --\n\n00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.152\nI'm trying.\"\n\n00:11:58.821 --> 00:12:00.934\nI don't know if you're all aware of this,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.934\nbut the video game market,\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.802\nkids are playing these video games,\n\n00:12:05.826 --> 00:12:07.878\nbut, supposedly, there's tons of money.\n\n00:12:07.902 --> 00:12:11.125\nI mean, like, I think,\n100,000 dollars or so a year\n\n00:12:11.149 --> 00:12:12.744\nis being spent on these things.\n\n00:12:13.197 --> 00:12:16.755\nSo I decided to try my hand.\n\n00:12:17.135 --> 00:12:18.562\nI came up with a few games.\n\n00:12:18.586 --> 00:12:20.680\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:20.704 --> 00:12:21.934\nThis is called \"Atheist.\"\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.601\nI figured it would be popular\nwith the young kids.\n\n00:12:25.028 --> 00:12:26.322\nOK.\n\n00:12:26.346 --> 00:12:28.958\nLook, I'll move around\nand say some things.\n\n00:12:30.368 --> 00:12:31.518\n(Sighs)\n\n00:12:32.176 --> 00:12:34.484\n[Game over. There is no replay.]\n\n00:12:34.508 --> 00:12:36.286\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:37.934\nSo that didn't go over so well.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:41.291\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:41.315 --> 00:12:43.585\nI don't really understand\nwhy you're laughing.\n\n00:12:43.609 --> 00:12:44.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.437\nShould have done this\nbefore I tried to pitch it.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:52.934\n\"Buddhist,\" of course, looks\nvery, very similar to \"Atheist.\"\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.043\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:54.067 --> 00:12:55.934\nBut you come back as a duck.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:13:01.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.387\nAnd this is great because,\nyou know, for a quarter,\n\n00:13:04.411 --> 00:13:06.387\nyou can play this for a long time.\n\n00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:07.935\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:07.959 --> 00:13:09.736\nAnd Chris had said in an email\n\n00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.107\nthat we should really bring\nsomething new to TED,\n\n00:13:12.131 --> 00:13:14.583\nsomething that we haven't shown anyone.\n\n00:13:15.807 --> 00:13:17.934\nSo, I made this for TED. It's \"Christian.\"\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.412\nIt's the third in the series.\n\n00:13:19.436 --> 00:13:21.568\nI'm hoping it's going\nto do well this year.\n\n00:13:22.149 --> 00:13:23.299\n(Sighs)\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.212\nDo you have a preference?\n\n00:13:28.236 --> 00:13:30.365\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:31.539\nGood choice.\n\n00:13:31.563 --> 00:13:34.605\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:37.339\nSo you can wait for the Second Coming,\n\n00:13:37.363 --> 00:13:41.934\nwhich is a random number\nbetween one and 500 million.\n\n00:13:42.702 --> 00:13:45.884\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:48.675\nSo really, what are we talking about here?\n\n00:13:48.699 --> 00:13:49.934\nOh, tech joy.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.351\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:52.375 --> 00:13:56.077\nTech joy, to me, means something,\nbecause I get a lot of joy out of tech.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:00.934\nAnd in fact, making things\nusing technology --\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.386\nand I'm being serious here,\n\n00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.555\neven though I'm using\nmy sarcastic voice -- I won't -- hold on.\n\n00:14:06.615 --> 00:14:09.670\nMaking things, you know --\n\n00:14:09.694 --> 00:14:12.000\nmaking things actually\ndoes give me a lot of joy.\n\n00:14:12.024 --> 00:14:14.339\nIt's the process of creation that keeps me\n\n00:14:14.363 --> 00:14:17.934\nsort of a bubble and a half\nabove perpetual anxiety in my life,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:21.387\nand it's that feeling of being\nabout 80 percent complete on a project --\n\n00:14:21.411 --> 00:14:23.602\nwhere you know you still have\nsomething to do,\n\n00:14:23.626 --> 00:14:26.934\nbut it's not finished,\nand you're not starting something --\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.648\nthat really fills my entire life.\n\n00:14:29.672 --> 00:14:31.506\nAnd so, what I've done is,\n\n00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:35.136\nI started getting interested\nin creating online social spaces\n\n00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.630\nto share that feeling\n\n00:14:36.654 --> 00:14:39.058\nwith people who don't consider\nthemselves artists.\n\n00:14:39.082 --> 00:14:41.556\nWe're in a culture of guru-ship.\n\n00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:45.412\nIt's so hard to use some software\nbecause, you know, it's unapproachable,\n\n00:14:45.436 --> 00:14:48.012\npeople feel like they have\nto read the manual.\n\n00:14:48.036 --> 00:14:53.628\nSo I try to create\nthese very minimal activities\n\n00:14:53.652 --> 00:14:57.082\nthat allow people to express\nthemselves, and, hopefully --\n\n00:14:57.106 --> 00:15:00.934\n(\"The End\" by The Doors)\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:06.934\nWhoa! I'm like -- on the page,\nbut it doesn't exist.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.320\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:08.344 --> 00:15:11.332\nIt's, like -- seriously, though --\n\n00:15:11.356 --> 00:15:13.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:17.934\nI try to create meaningful environments\nfor people to express themselves.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.021\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:19.045 --> 00:15:22.934\nHere I created a contest called,\n\"When Office Supplies Attack,\"\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:27.934\nwhich, I think, really resonated\nwith the working population.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.116\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.601\nOver 500 entries in three weeks.\n\n00:15:33.512 --> 00:15:34.934\nToilet paper fashion.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.801\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:37.825 --> 00:15:40.112\nAgain, people from all over the country.\n\n00:15:40.136 --> 00:15:42.244\nThe watch is particularly incredible.\n\n00:15:42.268 --> 00:15:44.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.742\nOnline drawing tools --\nyou've probably seen a lot of them.\n\n00:15:47.766 --> 00:15:49.013\nI think they're wonderful.\n\n00:15:49.037 --> 00:15:51.509\nIt's a chance for people\nto get to play with crayons\n\n00:15:51.533 --> 00:15:52.819\nand all that kind of stuff.\n\n00:15:52.843 --> 00:15:55.196\nBut I'm interested\nin the process of creating,\n\n00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.398\nas the real event that I'm interested in.\n\n00:15:58.422 --> 00:16:02.556\nAnd the problem is that\na lot of people suck at drawing,\n\n00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:06.546\nand they get bummed out at this,\nsort of, you know, stick figure,\n\n00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.773\nawful little thing that they created.\n\n00:16:08.797 --> 00:16:11.934\nAnd eventually, it just makes them\nstop playing with it,\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.479\nor they draw penises and things like that.\n\n00:16:14.503 --> 00:16:15.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:19.363\nSo, the Scribbler is an attempt\nto create a generative tool.\n\n00:16:19.387 --> 00:16:21.934\nIn other words, it's a helping tool.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.768\nYou can draw your simple stick figure,\n\n00:16:23.792 --> 00:16:27.934\nand it collaborates with you to create\nsort of a post-war German etching.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.164\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:30.188 --> 00:16:37.013\nIn fact, it's tuned to be better\nat drawing things that look worse.\n\n00:16:37.418 --> 00:16:40.902\nSo, we go ahead, and we start scribbling.\n\n00:16:41.846 --> 00:16:45.934\nSo the idea is that you can really,\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.934\nyou know, partake in this process,\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:51.934\nbut watch something\nreally crappy look beautiful.\n\n00:16:52.811 --> 00:16:54.521\nAnd here are some of my favorites.\n\n00:16:54.545 --> 00:16:58.403\nThis is the little trap marionette\nthat was submitted to me.\n\n00:17:01.308 --> 00:17:02.506\nVery cool.\n\n00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:03.651\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:05.215 --> 00:17:06.444\nDarling.\n\n00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:08.448\nBeautiful stuff.\n\n00:17:09.671 --> 00:17:11.349\nI mean this is incredible.\n\n00:17:11.373 --> 00:17:14.074\nAn 11-year-old girl drew this\nand submitted it.\n\n00:17:14.098 --> 00:17:15.805\nIt's just gorgeous.\n\n00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:17.353\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:17.377 --> 00:17:19.145\nI'm dead serious here.\n\n00:17:19.169 --> 00:17:20.616\nThis is not a joke.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:26.253\nBut, I think it's a really fun\nand wonderful thing.\n\n00:17:26.277 --> 00:17:29.439\nSo this is called the \"Fiction Project.\"\n\n00:17:29.463 --> 00:17:31.436\nThis is an online space,\n\n00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.934\nwhich is basically\na refurbished message board\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:37.688\nthat encourages collaborative\nfiction writing.\n\n00:17:37.712 --> 00:17:38.934\nThese are haikus.\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:41.339\nNone of the haikus were written\nby the same person.\n\n00:17:41.363 --> 00:17:45.319\nIn fact, each line is contributed\nby a different person\n\n00:17:45.343 --> 00:17:46.934\nat a different time.\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:50.800\nI think that the \"now tied up, tied down,\n\n00:17:50.824 --> 00:17:53.604\nmistress cruel approaches me,\nnow tied down, it's up.\"\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:57.934\nIt's an amazing way, and I'll tell you,\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:03.386\nif you come home, and your spouse,\nor whoever it is,\n\n00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.156\nsays, \"Let's talk\" --\n\n00:18:07.021 --> 00:18:10.503\nThat, like, chills you to the very core.\n\n00:18:10.527 --> 00:18:11.582\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:11.606 --> 00:18:13.781\nBut it's peripheral activities like these\n\n00:18:13.805 --> 00:18:16.934\nthat allow people to get together,\ndoing fun things.\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:18.720\nThey actually get to know each other,\n\n00:18:18.744 --> 00:18:22.314\nand it's sort of like low-threshold\nperipheral activities\n\n00:18:22.338 --> 00:18:24.304\nthat I think are the key to bringing up\n\n00:18:24.328 --> 00:18:26.852\nsome of our bonding social capital\nthat we're lacking.\n\n00:18:26.876 --> 00:18:29.240\nAnd very, very quickly --\nI love puppets.\n\n00:18:29.264 --> 00:18:31.249\nHere's a puppet.\n\n00:18:31.273 --> 00:18:32.457\nIt dances to music.\n\n00:18:32.481 --> 00:18:36.934\nLotte Reiniger, an amazing\nshadow puppeteer in the 20s,\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:38.927\nthat started doing more elaborate things.\n\n00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:40.428\nI became interested in puppets,\n\n00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:42.641\nand I just want to show\none last thing to you.\n\n00:18:42.665 --> 00:18:44.237\nOh, this is how you make puppets.\n\n00:18:44.261 --> 00:18:45.847\n(Applause)\n\n00:18:45.871 --> 00:18:48.387\nChris Anderson: Ladies\nand gentlemen, Mr. Ze Frank.\n\n00:18:48.411 --> 00:18:51.411\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Meet the founder of the blog revolution", "duration": "1006", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/mena_trott_tours_her_blog_world", "transcript": "Over the past couple of days, as I've been preparing for my speech, I've become more and more nervous about what I'm going to say and about being on the same stage as all these fascinating people. Being on the same stage as Al Gore, who was the first person I ever voted for. And \u2014(Laughter)So I was getting pretty nervous and, you know, I didn't know that Chris sits on the stage, and that's more nerve-racking. But then I started thinking about my family. I started thinking about my father and my grandfather and my great-grandfather, and I realized that I had all of these Teds going through my bloodstream \u2014(Laughter)that I had to consider this \"my element.\"So, who am I? Chris kind of mentioned I started a company with my husband. We have about 125 people internationally. If you looked in the book, you saw this ...(Laughter)which I really was appalled by.(Laughter)And because I wanted to impress you all with slides, since I saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs, I made a graph that moves, and I talk about the makeup of me.(Laughter)So, besides this freakish thing, this is my science slide. This is math, and this is science, this is genetics. This is my grandmother, and this is where I get this mouth.(Laughter)So \u2014 I'm a blogger, which, probably, to a lot of you, means different things. You may have heard about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha, where a blogger talked about how you hack or break into a Kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen, and it spread all over. Kryptonite had to adjust the lock, and they had to address it to avoid too many customer concerns. You may have heard about Rathergate, which was basically the result of bloggers realizing that the \"th\" in 111 is not typeset on an old typewriter; it's on Word. Bloggers exposed this, or they worked hard to expose this. You know, blogs are scary. This is what you see. I see this, and I'm sure scared \u2014 I swear on stage \u2014 shitless about blogs, because this is not something that's friendly. But there are blogs that are changing the way we read news and consume media, and these are great examples. These people are reaching thousands, if not millions, of readers, and that's incredibly important. During the hurricane, you had MSNBC posting about the hurricane on their blog, updating it frequently. This was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools.You have my friend, who has a blog on PVRs, personal recorders. He makes enough money just by running ads, to support his family up in Oregon. That's all he does now, and this is something that blogs have made possible. And then you have something like this, which is Interplast. It's a wonderful organization of people and doctors who go to developing nations to offer plastic surgery to those who need it. Children with cleft palates get it, and they document their story. This is wonderful. I am not that caring.(Laughter)I talk about myself. That's what I am. I'm a blogger. I have always decided that I was going to be an expert on one thing, and I am an expert on this person, and so I write about it. So, the short story about my blog: it started in 2001, I was 23. I wasn't happy with my job, because I was a designer, but I wasn't being really stimulated. I was an English major in college. I didn't have any use for it, but I missed writing. So, I started to write a blog and I started to create things like these little stories. This was an illustration about my camp experience when I was 11 years old, and how I went to a YMCA camp, Christian camp, and basically by the end, I had made my friends hate me so much that I hid in a bunk, They couldn't find me, they sent a search party, and I overheard people saying they wish I had killed myself \u2014 jumped off Bible Peak.You can laugh, this is OK.(Laughter)This is me. This is what happened to me. And when I started my blog, it was really this one goal \u2014 I said, \"I am not going to be famous to the world, but I could be famous to people on the Internet.\" And I set a goal. I said, \"I'm going to win an award,\" because I had never won an award in my entire life. And I said, \"I'm going to win the South by Southwest Weblog award.\" And I won it \u2014 I reached all of these people, and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life every day.And then I wrote a post about a banjo. I wrote a post about wanting to buy a banjo \u2014 a $300 banjo, which is a lot of money. And I don't play instruments; I don't know anything about music. I like music, and I like banjos, and I think I probably heard Steve Martin playing, and I said, \"I could do that.\" And I said to my husband, \"Ben, can I buy a banjo?\" And he's like, \"No.\"And my husband \u2014(Laughter)this is my husband, who is very hot \u2014 he won an award for being hot.(Laughter)He told me, \"You cannot buy a banjo. You're just like your dad,\" who collects instruments. And I wrote a post about how I was so mad at him, he was such a tyrant \u2014 he would not let me buy this banjo. And those people who know me understood my joke \u2014 this is Mena, this is how I make a joke at people. Because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant, this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog.(Laughter)And if he knew I was showing this right now \u2014 I put this in today \u2014 he would kill me.But the thing was, my friends read it, and they're like, \"Oh, that Mena, she wrote a post about wanting a stupid thing and being stupid.\" But I got emails from people that said, \"Oh my God, your husband is such an asshole. How much money does he spend on beer in a year? You could take that money and buy your banjo. Why don't you open a separate account?\" I've been with him since I was 17, we've never had a separate bank account. They said, \"Separate your bank account. Spend your money; spend his money, that's it.\" And then I got people saying, \"Leave him.\"(Laughter)I was like, \"OK, what? Who are these people? And why are they reading this?\" And I realized: I don't want to reach these people. I don't want to write for this public audience. And I started to kill my blog slowly. I'm like, I don't want to write this anymore. Slowly and slowly \u2014And I did tell personal stories from time to time. I wrote this one, and I put this up because of Einstein today. I'm going to get choked up, because this is my first pet, and she passed away two years ago. And I decided to break from, \"I don't really write about my public life,\" because I wanted to give her a little memorial. But anyways, it's these sorts of personal stories \u2014 You know, you read the blogs about politics or about media, and gossip and all these things. These are out there, but it's more of the personal that interests me, and this is who I am.You see Norman Rockwell, and you have art critics say, \"Norman Rockwell is not art. Norman Rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms, and this is not something to be considered high art.\" And I think this is one of the most important things to us as humans. These things resonate with us, and, if you think about blogs, you think of high art blogs, the history paintings about, you know, all the biblical stories, and then you have this. These are the blogs that interest me: the people that just tell stories.One story is about this baby, and his name is Odin. His father was a blogger. And he was writing his blog one day, and his wife gave birth to her baby at 25 weeks. And he never expected this. One day, it was normal; the next day, it was hell. And this is a one-pound baby. So Odin was documented every single day.Pictures were taken every day: day one, day two ... You have day nine \u2014 they're talking about his apnea; day 39 \u2014 he gets pneumonia. His baby is so small, and I've never encountered such a \u2014 just \u2014 a disturbing image, but just so heartfelt. And you're reading this as it happens, so on day 55, everybody reads that he's having failures: breathing failures and heart failures, and it's slowing down, and you don't know what to expect.But then it gets better. Day 96, he goes home. And you see this post. That's not something you're going to see in a paper or magazine but this is something this person feels, and people are excited about it \u2014 28 comments. That's not a huge amount of people reading, but 28 people matter. And today, he is a healthy baby, who, if you read his blog \u2014 it's snowdeal.org, his father's blog \u2014 he is taking pictures of him still, because he is still his son and he is, I think, at his age level right now because he had received such great treatment from the hospital.So, blogs. So what? You've probably heard these things before. We talked about the WELL, and about all these sorts of things throughout our online history. But I think blogs are basically just an evolution, and that's where we are today. It's this record of who you are, your persona. You have your Google search, where you say, \"What is Mena Trott?\" And then you find these things and you're happy or unhappy. But then you also find people's blogs, and those are the records of people that are writing daily \u2014 not necessarily about the same topic, but things that interest them. And we talk about the world flattens, being in this panel, and I am very optimistic \u2014 whenever I think about blogs, I'm like, \"We've got to reach all these people.\" Hundreds of millions and billions of people. We're getting into China, we want to be there, but there are so many people that won't have the access to write a blog. But to see something like the $100 computer is amazing, because blogging software is simple. We have a successful company because of timing, and because of perseverance, but it's simple stuff \u2014 it's not rocket science. And so, that's an amazing thing to consider. So \u2014 the life record of a blog is something that I find incredibly important.And we started with a slide of my Teds, and I had to add this slide, because I knew the minute I showed this, my mom \u2014 my mom will see this, because she does read my blog and she'll say, \"Why wasn't there a picture of me?\" This is my mom. So, I have all the people that I know of. But this is basically the extent of the family that I know in terms of my direct line. I showed a Norman Rockwell painting before, and this one, I grew up with, looking at constantly. I would spend hours looking at the connections, saying, \"Oh, the little kid up at the top has red hair; so does that first generation up there.\" And it's just these little things. This is not science, but this was enough for me to be really interested in how we have evolved and how we can trace our line. So that has always influenced me.I have this record, this 1910 census, of another Grabowski \u2014 that's my maiden name \u2014 and there's a Theodore, because there's always a Theodore. This is all I have, a couple of facts about somebody. I have their date of birth, their age, what they did in their household, if they spoke English, and that's it, that's all I know of these people. And it's pretty sad, because I only go back five generations, and that's it. I don't even know what happens on my mom's side, because she's from Cuba and I don't have that many things. Just doing this, I spent time in the archives \u2014 that's why my husband's a saint \u2014 I spent time in the Washington archives, just sitting there, looking for these things. Now it's online, but he sat through that.And so you have this record and \u2014 This is my great-great-grandmother. This is the only picture I have. And to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs; to think about the people that are on those $100 computers, talking about who they are, sharing these personal stories \u2014 this is an amazing thing.Another photo that has greatly influenced me, or a series of photos, is this project that's done by an Argentinean man and his wife. And he's basically taking a picture of his family every day for the past, what is '76? \u2014 20 ... Oh my God, I'm '77 \u2014 29 years? Twenty-nine years.There was a joke, originally, about my graph that I left out, which is: You see all this math? I'm just happy I was able to add it up to 100, because that's my skill set.(Laughter)So you have these people aging, and now this is them today, or last year. And that's a powerful thing to have, to be able to track this. I wish that I would have this of my family. I know that one day my children will be wondering \u2014 or my grandchildren, or my great-grandchildren, if I ever have children \u2014 what I am going to \u2014 who I was. So I do something that's very narcissistic \u2014I am a blogger \u2014 that is an amazing thing for me, because it captures a moment in time every day. I take a picture of myself \u2014 I've been doing this since last year \u2014 every single day. And, you know, it's the same picture; it's basically the same person.Only a couple of people read it. I don't write this for this audience; I'm showing it now, but I would go insane if this was really public. About four people probably read it, and they tell me, \"You haven't updated.\" I'm probably going to get people telling me I haven't updated. But this is amazing, because I can go back to a day \u2014 to April 2005, and say, what was I doing this day? I look at it, I know exactly. It's this visual cue that is so important to what we do. I put the bad pictures up too, because there are bad pictures.(Laughter)And I remember instantly: I am in Germany in this \u2014 I had to go for a one-day trip. I was sick, and I was in a hotel room, and I wanted not to be there. And so you see these things, it's not just always smiling. Now I've kind of evolved it, so I have this look. If you look at my driver's license, I have the same look, and it's a pretty disturbing thing, but it's something that is really important.And the last story I really want to tell is this story, because this is probably the one that means the most to me in all of what I'm doing. I'll probably get choked up, because I tend to when I talk about this. So, this woman, her name was Emma, and she was a blogger on our service, TypePad. And she was a beta tester, so she was there right when we opened \u2014 you know, there was 100 people. And she wrote about her life dealing with cancer. She was writing and writing, and we all started reading it, because we had so few blogs on the service, we could keep track of everyone.And she was writing one day, and then she disappeared for a little bit. And her sister came on, and she said that Emma had passed away. And all of our support staff who had talked to her were really emotional, and it was a very hard day at the company.And this was one of those instances where I realized how much blogging affects our relationship, and flattening this sort of world. That this woman is in England, and she lives \u2014 she lived \u2014 a life where she was talking about what she was doing. But the big thing that really influenced us was, her sister wrote to me, and she said \u2014 and she wrote on this blog \u2014 that writing her blog during the last couple of months of her life was probably the best thing that had happened to her, and being able to talk to people and to share what was going on, and being able to write and receive comments. And that was amazing, to be able to know that we had empowered that, and that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing, and the idea that blogging doesn't have to be scary, that we don't always have to be attack of the blogs, that we can be people who are open, and wanting to help and talk to people. That was an amazing thing.And so I printed out and sent a PDF of her blog to her family, and they passed it out at her memorial service, and even in her obituary, they mentioned her blog, because it was such a big part of her life. And that's a huge thing.So, this is her legacy, and I think that my call to action to all of you is: think about blogs, think about what they are, think about what you've thought of them, and then actually do it, because it's something that's really going to change our lives.So, thank you.(Applause)", "id": 21, "subtitle":

speech,\n\n00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:19.656\nI've become more and more nervous\nabout what I'm going to say\n\n00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.799\nand about being on the same stage\nas all these fascinating people.\n\n00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:27.113\nBeing on the same stage as Al Gore,\nwho was the first person I ever voted for.\n\n00:00:27.137 --> 00:00:28.297\nAnd --\n\n00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:31.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.748\nSo I was getting pretty nervous\n\n00:00:33.772 --> 00:00:36.577\nand, you know, I didn't know\nthat Chris sits on the stage,\n\n00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:38.085\nand that's more nerve-racking.\n\n00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:40.165\nBut then I started thinking\nabout my family.\n\n00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:42.934\nI started thinking about my father\nand my grandfather\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.021\nand my great-grandfather,\n\n00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.713\nand I realized\n\n00:00:46.737 --> 00:00:50.983\nthat I had all of these Teds\ngoing through my bloodstream --\n\n00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:52.405\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.934\nthat I had to consider this \"my element.\"\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.335\nSo, who am I?\n\n00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.988\nChris kind of mentioned I started\na company with my husband.\n\n00:01:02.012 --> 00:01:04.431\nWe have about 125 people internationally.\n\n00:01:04.455 --> 00:01:05.934\nIf you looked in the book,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.542\nyou saw this ...\n\n00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:08.835\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:12.131\nwhich I really was appalled by.\n\n00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.558\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:14.582 --> 00:01:17.934\nAnd because I wanted\nto impress you all with slides,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.696\nsince I saw the great presentations\nyesterday with graphs,\n\n00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.038\nI made a graph that moves,\n\n00:01:23.062 --> 00:01:25.934\nand I talk about the makeup of me.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:29.304\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:29.328 --> 00:01:31.381\nSo, besides this freakish thing,\n\n00:01:31.405 --> 00:01:32.657\nthis is my science slide.\n\n00:01:32.681 --> 00:01:35.249\nThis is math, and this is science,\nthis is genetics.\n\n00:01:35.273 --> 00:01:38.145\nThis is my grandmother,\nand this is where I get this mouth.\n\n00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:40.117\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:41.397\nSo --\n\n00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:46.177\nI'm a blogger, which, probably,\nto a lot of you, means different things.\n\n00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:50.253\nYou may have heard\nabout the Kryptonite lock brouhaha,\n\n00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:52.261\nwhere a blogger talked about how you hack\n\n00:01:52.285 --> 00:01:54.934\nor break into a Kryptonite\nlock using a ballpoint pen,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.307\nand it spread all over.\n\n00:01:56.331 --> 00:01:58.297\nKryptonite had to adjust the lock,\n\n00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:01.934\nand they had to address it\nto avoid too many customer concerns.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.933\nYou may have heard about Rathergate,\n\n00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:07.064\nwhich was basically the result of bloggers\n\n00:02:07.088 --> 00:02:11.108\nrealizing that the \"th\" in 111\n\n00:02:11.132 --> 00:02:14.305\nis not typeset on an old typewriter;\n\n00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:15.605\nit's on Word.\n\n00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.342\nBloggers exposed this,\n\n00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:19.934\nor they worked hard to expose this.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.525\nYou know, blogs are scary.\nThis is what you see.\n\n00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:28.022\nI see this, and I'm sure scared --\nI swear on stage -- shitless about blogs,\n\n00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:31.030\nbecause this is not\nsomething that's friendly.\n\n00:02:31.054 --> 00:02:34.680\nBut there are blogs that are changing\nthe way we read news\n\n00:02:34.704 --> 00:02:37.101\nand consume media,\nand these are great examples.\n\n00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:39.410\nThese people are reaching thousands,\n\n00:02:39.434 --> 00:02:41.280\nif not millions, of readers,\n\n00:02:41.304 --> 00:02:42.934\nand that's incredibly important.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.934\nDuring the hurricane,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:48.272\nyou had MSNBC posting\nabout the hurricane on their blog,\n\n00:02:48.296 --> 00:02:49.638\nupdating it frequently.\n\n00:02:49.662 --> 00:02:52.934\nThis was possible because of the easy\nnature of blogging tools.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.673\nYou have my friend,\n\n00:02:54.697 --> 00:02:59.232\nwho has a blog on PVRs,\npersonal recorders.\n\n00:02:59.256 --> 00:03:01.526\nHe makes enough money just by running ads,\n\n00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.367\nto support his family up in Oregon.\n\n00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:04.542\nThat's all he does now,\n\n00:03:04.566 --> 00:03:07.008\nand this is something\nthat blogs have made possible.\n\n00:03:07.032 --> 00:03:09.816\nAnd then you have something\nlike this, which is Interplast.\n\n00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.418\nIt's a wonderful organization\n\n00:03:11.442 --> 00:03:15.627\nof people and doctors\nwho go to developing nations\n\n00:03:15.651 --> 00:03:17.934\nto offer plastic surgery\nto those who need it.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:21.620\nChildren with cleft palates get it,\nand they document their story.\n\n00:03:21.644 --> 00:03:22.934\nThis is wonderful.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.934\nI am not that caring.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.685\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:29.885\nI talk about myself.\n\n00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.502\nThat's what I am. I'm a blogger.\n\n00:03:31.526 --> 00:03:35.055\nI have always decided that I was going\nto be an expert on one thing,\n\n00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.309\nand I am an expert on this person,\n\n00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:39.498\nand so I write about it.\n\n00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.443\nSo, the short story about my blog:\n\n00:03:41.467 --> 00:03:43.618\nit started in 2001, I was 23.\n\n00:03:43.642 --> 00:03:45.366\nI wasn't happy with my job,\n\n00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.842\nbecause I was a designer,\n\n00:03:46.866 --> 00:03:48.786\nbut I wasn't being really stimulated.\n\n00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.443\nI was an English major in college.\n\n00:03:50.467 --> 00:03:53.142\nI didn't have any use for it,\nbut I missed writing.\n\n00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.800\nSo, I started to write a blog\n\n00:03:54.824 --> 00:03:57.697\nand I started to create things\nlike these little stories.\n\n00:03:57.721 --> 00:04:01.934\nThis was an illustration about my camp\nexperience when I was 11 years old,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.934\nand how I went to a YMCA camp,\nChristian camp,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.574\nand basically by the end,\n\n00:04:06.598 --> 00:04:11.478\nI had made my friends hate me so much\nthat I hid in a bunk,\n\n00:04:11.502 --> 00:04:13.758\nThey couldn't find me,\nthey sent a search party,\n\n00:04:13.782 --> 00:04:16.759\nand I overheard people saying\nthey wish I had killed myself --\n\n00:04:16.783 --> 00:04:18.625\njumped off Bible Peak.\n\n00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:20.294\nYou can laugh, this is OK.\n\n00:04:20.318 --> 00:04:21.710\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:21.734 --> 00:04:23.934\nThis is me.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.427\nThis is what happened to me.\n\n00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:28.934\nAnd when I started my blog,\nit was really this one goal --\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:34.654\nI said, \"I am not going\nto be famous to the world,\n\n00:04:34.678 --> 00:04:37.132\nbut I could be famous\nto people on the Internet.\"\n\n00:04:37.156 --> 00:04:38.316\nAnd I set a goal.\n\n00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.726\nI said, \"I'm going to win an award,\"\n\n00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.168\nbecause I had never won\nan award in my entire life.\n\n00:04:43.192 --> 00:04:47.123\nAnd I said, \"I'm going to win\nthe South by Southwest Weblog award.\"\n\n00:04:47.147 --> 00:04:49.934\nAnd I won it -- I reached\nall of these people,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:53.445\nand I had tens of thousands of people\nreading about my life every day.\n\n00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:55.896\nAnd then I wrote a post about a banjo.\n\n00:04:56.277 --> 00:04:58.015\nI wrote a post\n\n00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.595\nabout wanting to buy a banjo --\n\n00:05:00.619 --> 00:05:03.071\na $300 banjo, which is a lot of money.\n\n00:05:03.571 --> 00:05:05.254\nAnd I don't play instruments;\n\n00:05:05.278 --> 00:05:07.449\nI don't know anything about music.\n\n00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:09.934\nI like music, and I like banjos,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.338\nand I think I probably heard\nSteve Martin playing,\n\n00:05:12.362 --> 00:05:13.934\nand I said, \"I could do that.\"\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.251\nAnd I said to my husband,\n\n00:05:15.275 --> 00:05:17.465\n\"Ben, can I buy a banjo?\"\nAnd he's like, \"No.\"\n\n00:05:17.489 --> 00:05:18.720\nAnd my husband --\n\n00:05:18.744 --> 00:05:19.906\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.974\nthis is my husband, who is very hot --\n\n00:05:21.998 --> 00:05:23.934\nhe won an award for being hot.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.606\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.495\nHe told me,\n\n00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:29.934\n\"You cannot buy a banjo.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.133\nYou're just like your dad,\"\nwho collects instruments.\n\n00:05:33.157 --> 00:05:37.030\nAnd I wrote a post\nabout how I was so mad at him,\n\n00:05:37.054 --> 00:05:39.903\nhe was such a tyrant --\nhe would not let me buy this banjo.\n\n00:05:39.927 --> 00:05:42.289\nAnd those people who know me\nunderstood my joke --\n\n00:05:42.313 --> 00:05:44.662\nthis is Mena, this is how\nI make a joke at people.\n\n00:05:44.686 --> 00:05:47.934\nBecause the joke in this\nis that this person is not a tyrant,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.934\nthis person is so loving and so sweet\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.747\nthat he lets me dress him up\n\n00:05:51.771 --> 00:05:54.861\nand post pictures of him to my blog.\n\n00:05:54.885 --> 00:05:58.708\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:58.732 --> 00:06:02.058\nAnd if he knew I was showing\nthis right now -- I put this in today --\n\n00:06:02.082 --> 00:06:03.915\nhe would kill me.\n\n00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:06.259\nBut the thing was, my friends read it,\n\n00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:08.710\nand they're like, \"Oh, that Mena,\nshe wrote a post\n\n00:06:08.734 --> 00:06:11.202\nabout wanting a stupid thing\nand being stupid.\"\n\n00:06:11.226 --> 00:06:13.682\nBut I got emails from people that said,\n\n00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:16.769\n\"Oh my God, your husband\nis such an asshole.\n\n00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:19.604\nHow much money does\nhe spend on beer in a year?\n\n00:06:19.628 --> 00:06:22.620\nYou could take that money\nand buy your banjo.\n\n00:06:22.644 --> 00:06:24.509\nWhy don't you open a separate account?\"\n\n00:06:24.533 --> 00:06:28.085\nI've been with him since I was 17,\nwe've never had a separate bank account.\n\n00:06:28.109 --> 00:06:29.990\nThey said, \"Separate your bank account.\n\n00:06:30.014 --> 00:06:32.197\nSpend your money;\nspend his money, that's it.\"\n\n00:06:32.221 --> 00:06:34.350\nAnd then I got people saying, \"Leave him.\"\n\n00:06:34.374 --> 00:06:35.521\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:35.545 --> 00:06:38.396\nI was like, \"OK, what?\nWho are these people?\n\n00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.934\nAnd why are they reading this?\"\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.343\nAnd I realized: I don't\nwant to reach these people.\n\n00:06:42.367 --> 00:06:44.934\nI don't want to write\nfor this public audience.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.934\nAnd I started to kill my blog slowly.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.060\nI'm like, I don't want\nto write this anymore.\n\n00:06:49.084 --> 00:06:50.704\nSlowly and slowly --\n\n00:06:50.728 --> 00:06:53.716\nAnd I did tell personal\nstories from time to time.\n\n00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.652\nI wrote this one, and I put this\nup because of Einstein today.\n\n00:06:56.676 --> 00:06:59.355\nI'm going to get choked up,\nbecause this is my first pet,\n\n00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:01.007\nand she passed away two years ago.\n\n00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:04.489\nAnd I decided to break from, \"I don't\nreally write about my public life,\"\n\n00:07:04.513 --> 00:07:06.719\nbecause I wanted to give her\na little memorial.\n\n00:07:06.743 --> 00:07:09.234\nBut anyways, it's these sorts\nof personal stories --\n\n00:07:09.258 --> 00:07:12.049\nYou know, you read the blogs\nabout politics or about media,\n\n00:07:12.073 --> 00:07:13.603\nand gossip and all these things.\n\n00:07:13.627 --> 00:07:14.785\nThese are out there,\n\n00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:17.934\nbut it's more of the personal\nthat interests me,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.226\nand this is who I am.\n\n00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.803\nYou see Norman Rockwell,\nand you have art critics say,\n\n00:07:22.827 --> 00:07:24.254\n\"Norman Rockwell is not art.\n\n00:07:24.278 --> 00:07:27.410\nNorman Rockwell hangs\nin living rooms and bathrooms,\n\n00:07:27.434 --> 00:07:30.934\nand this is not something\nto be considered high art.\"\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.741\nAnd I think this is one\nof the most important things\n\n00:07:33.765 --> 00:07:36.003\nto us as humans.\n\n00:07:36.027 --> 00:07:38.625\nThese things resonate with us,\n\n00:07:38.649 --> 00:07:41.673\nand, if you think about blogs,\nyou think of high art blogs,\n\n00:07:41.697 --> 00:07:45.663\nthe history paintings about,\nyou know, all the biblical stories,\n\n00:07:45.687 --> 00:07:46.838\nand then you have this.\n\n00:07:46.862 --> 00:07:50.554\nThese are the blogs that interest me:\nthe people that just tell stories.\n\n00:07:50.578 --> 00:07:54.522\nOne story is about this baby,\nand his name is Odin.\n\n00:07:54.546 --> 00:07:56.728\nHis father was a blogger.\n\n00:07:56.752 --> 00:07:59.622\nAnd he was writing his blog one day,\n\n00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:02.247\nand his wife gave birth to her baby\n\n00:08:02.271 --> 00:08:03.934\nat 25 weeks.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.707\nAnd he never expected this.\n\n00:08:05.731 --> 00:08:08.934\nOne day, it was normal;\nthe next day, it was hell.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.732\nAnd this is a one-pound baby.\n\n00:08:10.756 --> 00:08:13.934\nSo Odin was documented every single day.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.630\nPictures were taken every day:\nday one, day two ...\n\n00:08:16.654 --> 00:08:19.543\nYou have day nine --\nthey're talking about his apnea;\n\n00:08:19.567 --> 00:08:21.424\nday 39 -- he gets pneumonia.\n\n00:08:21.448 --> 00:08:22.934\nHis baby is so small,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:26.315\nand I've never encountered such a --\n\n00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:29.934\njust -- a disturbing image,\nbut just so heartfelt.\n\n00:08:30.597 --> 00:08:33.740\nAnd you're reading this as it happens,\n\n00:08:33.764 --> 00:08:37.869\nso on day 55, everybody reads\nthat he's having failures:\n\n00:08:37.893 --> 00:08:39.747\nbreathing failures and heart failures,\n\n00:08:39.771 --> 00:08:42.934\nand it's slowing down,\nand you don't know what to expect.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.170\nBut then it gets better.\nDay 96, he goes home.\n\n00:08:46.194 --> 00:08:48.280\nAnd you see this post.\n\n00:08:48.304 --> 00:08:51.334\nThat's not something you're going\nto see in a paper or magazine\n\n00:08:51.358 --> 00:08:53.312\nbut this is something this person feels,\n\n00:08:53.336 --> 00:08:55.717\nand people are excited\nabout it -- 28 comments.\n\n00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:57.804\nThat's not a huge amount\nof people reading,\n\n00:08:57.828 --> 00:08:59.598\nbut 28 people matter.\n\n00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:02.533\nAnd today, he is a healthy baby,\n\n00:09:02.557 --> 00:09:04.692\nwho, if you read his blog --\n\n00:09:04.716 --> 00:09:07.771\nit's snowdeal.org, his father's blog --\n\n00:09:07.795 --> 00:09:10.958\nhe is taking pictures of him still,\nbecause he is still his son\n\n00:09:10.982 --> 00:09:13.934\nand he is, I think,\nat his age level right now\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:17.712\nbecause he had received such\ngreat treatment from the hospital.\n\n00:09:18.275 --> 00:09:19.816\nSo, blogs.\n\n00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.387\nSo what? You've probably\nheard these things before.\n\n00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:26.054\nWe talked about the WELL,\nand about all these sorts of things\n\n00:09:26.078 --> 00:09:27.934\nthroughout our online history.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:31.596\nBut I think blogs are basically\njust an evolution,\n\n00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.263\nand that's where we are today.\n\n00:09:33.287 --> 00:09:35.883\nIt's this record\nof who you are, your persona.\n\n00:09:35.907 --> 00:09:38.972\nYou have your Google search,\nwhere you say, \"What is Mena Trott?\"\n\n00:09:38.996 --> 00:09:42.742\nAnd then you find these things\nand you're happy or unhappy.\n\n00:09:42.766 --> 00:09:44.934\nBut then you also find people's blogs,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.856\nand those are the records of people\nthat are writing daily --\n\n00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.800\nnot necessarily about the same topic,\nbut things that interest them.\n\n00:09:51.824 --> 00:09:55.570\nAnd we talk about the world\nflattens, being in this panel,\n\n00:09:55.594 --> 00:09:58.691\nand I am very optimistic --\nwhenever I think about blogs,\n\n00:09:58.715 --> 00:10:00.973\nI'm like, \"We've got to reach\nall these people.\"\n\n00:10:00.997 --> 00:10:03.076\nHundreds of millions\nand billions of people.\n\n00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.246\nWe're getting into China,\nwe want to be there,\n\n00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.971\nbut there are so many people that\nwon't have the access to write a blog.\n\n00:10:08.995 --> 00:10:11.732\nBut to see something\nlike the $100 computer is amazing,\n\n00:10:11.756 --> 00:10:13.806\nbecause blogging software is simple.\n\n00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:16.073\nWe have a successful company\nbecause of timing,\n\n00:10:16.097 --> 00:10:18.605\nand because of perseverance,\nbut it's simple stuff --\n\n00:10:18.629 --> 00:10:20.140\nit's not rocket science.\n\n00:10:20.164 --> 00:10:23.164\nAnd so, that's an amazing\nthing to consider.\n\n00:10:23.573 --> 00:10:24.993\nSo --\n\n00:10:26.252 --> 00:10:31.121\nthe life record of a blog is something\nthat I find incredibly important.\n\n00:10:31.145 --> 00:10:33.442\nAnd we started with a slide of my Teds,\n\n00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:35.124\nand I had to add this slide,\n\n00:10:35.148 --> 00:10:37.518\nbecause I knew the minute\nI showed this, my mom --\n\n00:10:37.542 --> 00:10:40.084\nmy mom will see this,\nbecause she does read my blog\n\n00:10:40.108 --> 00:10:42.596\nand she'll say, \"Why wasn't there\na picture of me?\"\n\n00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.837\nThis is my mom.\n\n00:10:43.861 --> 00:10:46.131\nSo, I have all the people that I know of.\n\n00:10:46.155 --> 00:10:50.081\nBut this is basically the extent\nof the family that I know\n\n00:10:50.105 --> 00:10:52.989\nin terms of my direct line.\n\n00:10:53.013 --> 00:10:57.096\nI showed a Norman Rockwell painting\nbefore, and this one, I grew up with,\n\n00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.934\nlooking at constantly.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.154\nI would spend hours\nlooking at the connections,\n\n00:11:01.178 --> 00:11:03.934\nsaying, \"Oh, the little kid\nup at the top has red hair;\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.934\nso does that first generation up there.\"\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.600\nAnd it's just these little things.\n\n00:11:07.624 --> 00:11:11.551\nThis is not science,\nbut this was enough for me\n\n00:11:11.575 --> 00:11:14.934\nto be really interested\nin how we have evolved\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.232\nand how we can trace our line.\n\n00:11:17.708 --> 00:11:19.934\nSo that has always influenced me.\n\n00:11:20.243 --> 00:11:23.855\nI have this record, this 1910 census,\n\n00:11:23.879 --> 00:11:26.386\nof another Grabowski --\nthat's my maiden name --\n\n00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.147\nand there's a Theodore,\nbecause there's always a Theodore.\n\n00:11:29.171 --> 00:11:32.803\nThis is all I have,\na couple of facts about somebody.\n\n00:11:32.827 --> 00:11:36.968\nI have their date of birth, their age,\nwhat they did in their household,\n\n00:11:36.992 --> 00:11:38.143\nif they spoke English,\n\n00:11:38.167 --> 00:11:40.506\nand that's it, that's all I know\nof these people.\n\n00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:41.934\nAnd it's pretty sad,\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.601\nbecause I only go back\nfive generations, and that's it.\n\n00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:47.892\nI don't even know what happens\non my mom's side,\n\n00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:50.859\nbecause she's from Cuba\nand I don't have that many things.\n\n00:11:51.957 --> 00:11:54.263\nJust doing this,\nI spent time in the archives --\n\n00:11:54.287 --> 00:11:55.931\nthat's why my husband's a saint --\n\n00:11:55.955 --> 00:11:57.883\nI spent time in the Washington archives,\n\n00:11:57.907 --> 00:12:00.012\njust sitting there,\nlooking for these things.\n\n00:12:00.036 --> 00:12:02.016\nNow it's online, but he sat through that.\n\n00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.531\nAnd so you have this record and --\n\n00:12:04.555 --> 00:12:06.643\nThis is my great-great-grandmother.\n\n00:12:06.667 --> 00:12:08.294\nThis is the only picture I have.\n\n00:12:08.318 --> 00:12:12.581\nAnd to think of what we have the ability\nto do with our blogs;\n\n00:12:12.605 --> 00:12:15.934\nto think about the people\nthat are on those $100 computers,\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:19.599\ntalking about who they are,\nsharing these personal stories --\n\n00:12:19.623 --> 00:12:21.337\nthis is an amazing thing.\n\n00:12:21.742 --> 00:12:24.934\nAnother photo that has\ngreatly influenced me,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.934\nor a series of photos, is this project\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:30.231\nthat's done by an Argentinean\nman and his wife.\n\n00:12:30.255 --> 00:12:33.429\nAnd he's basically taking a picture\nof his family every day\n\n00:12:33.453 --> 00:12:39.221\nfor the past, what is '76? -- 20 ...\nOh my God, I'm '77 -- 29 years?\n\n00:12:39.245 --> 00:12:40.966\nTwenty-nine years.\n\n00:12:42.019 --> 00:12:45.383\nThere was a joke, originally,\nabout my graph that I left out, which is:\n\n00:12:45.407 --> 00:12:46.564\nYou see all this math?\n\n00:12:46.588 --> 00:12:48.763\nI'm just happy I was able\nto add it up to 100,\n\n00:12:48.787 --> 00:12:50.582\nbecause that's my skill set.\n\n00:12:50.606 --> 00:12:52.820\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:52.844 --> 00:12:55.505\nSo you have these people aging,\n\n00:12:55.529 --> 00:12:58.835\nand now this is them today, or last year.\n\n00:12:59.163 --> 00:13:02.108\nAnd that's a powerful thing\nto have, to be able to track this.\n\n00:13:02.132 --> 00:13:04.934\nI wish that I would have\nthis of my family.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:08.934\nI know that one day my children\nwill be wondering --\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.197\nor my grandchildren,\nor my great-grandchildren,\n\n00:13:11.221 --> 00:13:13.295\nif I ever have children --\n\n00:13:13.319 --> 00:13:15.934\nwhat I am going to --\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.245\nwho I was.\n\n00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:19.520\nSo I do something\nthat's very narcissistic --\n\n00:13:19.544 --> 00:13:21.036\nI am a blogger --\n\n00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.520\nthat is an amazing thing for me,\n\n00:13:23.544 --> 00:13:26.519\nbecause it captures\na moment in time every day.\n\n00:13:26.543 --> 00:13:29.803\nI take a picture of myself --\nI've been doing this since last year --\n\n00:13:29.827 --> 00:13:31.132\nevery single day.\n\n00:13:31.156 --> 00:13:32.982\nAnd, you know, it's the same picture;\n\n00:13:33.006 --> 00:13:34.763\nit's basically the same person.\n\n00:13:34.787 --> 00:13:36.366\nOnly a couple of people read it.\n\n00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:38.243\nI don't write this for this audience;\n\n00:13:38.267 --> 00:13:42.274\nI'm showing it now, but I would go\ninsane if this was really public.\n\n00:13:42.298 --> 00:13:43.989\nAbout four people probably read it,\n\n00:13:44.013 --> 00:13:46.361\nand they tell me, \"You haven't updated.\"\n\n00:13:46.385 --> 00:13:49.345\nI'm probably going to get people\ntelling me I haven't updated.\n\n00:13:49.369 --> 00:13:52.934\nBut this is amazing, because I can\ngo back to a day -- to April 2005,\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.630\nand say, what was I doing this day?\n\n00:13:54.654 --> 00:13:56.054\nI look at it, I know exactly.\n\n00:13:56.078 --> 00:13:59.074\nIt's this visual cue\nthat is so important to what we do.\n\n00:13:59.098 --> 00:14:01.197\nI put the bad pictures up too,\n\n00:14:01.221 --> 00:14:03.627\nbecause there are bad pictures.\n\n00:14:03.651 --> 00:14:04.817\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:04.841 --> 00:14:08.501\nAnd I remember instantly:\nI am in Germany in this --\n\n00:14:08.525 --> 00:14:10.025\nI had to go for a one-day trip.\n\n00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:12.713\nI was sick, and I was in a hotel room,\n\n00:14:12.737 --> 00:14:14.513\nand I wanted not to be there.\n\n00:14:14.537 --> 00:14:17.464\nAnd so you see these things,\nit's not just always smiling.\n\n00:14:17.488 --> 00:14:19.801\nNow I've kind of evolved it,\nso I have this look.\n\n00:14:19.825 --> 00:14:22.517\nIf you look at my driver's license,\nI have the same look,\n\n00:14:22.541 --> 00:14:25.820\nand it's a pretty disturbing thing,\n\n00:14:25.844 --> 00:14:28.269\nbut it's something\nthat is really important.\n\n00:14:28.682 --> 00:14:34.070\nAnd the last story\nI really want to tell is this story,\n\n00:14:34.094 --> 00:14:37.367\nbecause this is probably the one\nthat means the most to me\n\n00:14:37.391 --> 00:14:38.634\nin all of what I'm doing.\n\n00:14:38.658 --> 00:14:41.982\nI'll probably get choked up,\nbecause I tend to when I talk about this.\n\n00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:44.134\nSo, this woman, her name was Emma,\n\n00:14:44.158 --> 00:14:47.198\nand she was a blogger\non our service, TypePad.\n\n00:14:47.222 --> 00:14:50.383\nAnd she was a beta tester,\nso she was there right when we opened --\n\n00:14:50.407 --> 00:14:51.934\nyou know, there was 100 people.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.934\nAnd she wrote about her life\ndealing with cancer.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:58.094\nShe was writing and writing,\nand we all started reading it,\n\n00:14:58.118 --> 00:15:00.185\nbecause we had\nso few blogs on the service,\n\n00:15:00.209 --> 00:15:01.820\nwe could keep track of everyone.\n\n00:15:01.844 --> 00:15:03.815\nAnd she was writing one day,\n\n00:15:03.839 --> 00:15:06.093\nand then she disappeared for a little bit.\n\n00:15:06.117 --> 00:15:10.532\nAnd her sister came on, and she said\nthat Emma had passed away.\n\n00:15:10.556 --> 00:15:15.416\nAnd all of our support staff who had\ntalked to her were really emotional,\n\n00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.599\nand it was a very hard day at the company.\n\n00:15:18.623 --> 00:15:21.934\nAnd this was one of those\ninstances where I realized\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.666\nhow much blogging\naffects our relationship,\n\n00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.352\nand flattening this sort of world.\n\n00:15:26.376 --> 00:15:28.060\nThat this woman is in England,\n\n00:15:28.084 --> 00:15:31.321\nand she lives -- she lived -- a life\n\n00:15:31.345 --> 00:15:34.607\nwhere she was talking\nabout what she was doing.\n\n00:15:34.631 --> 00:15:38.160\nBut the big thing\nthat really influenced us was,\n\n00:15:38.184 --> 00:15:40.070\nher sister wrote to me, and she said --\n\n00:15:40.094 --> 00:15:41.498\nand she wrote on this blog --\n\n00:15:41.522 --> 00:15:44.758\nthat writing her blog during\nthe last couple of months of her life\n\n00:15:44.782 --> 00:15:47.275\nwas probably the best thing\nthat had happened to her,\n\n00:15:47.299 --> 00:15:50.367\nand being able to talk to people\nand to share what was going on,\n\n00:15:50.391 --> 00:15:53.280\nand being able to write\nand receive comments.\n\n00:15:53.304 --> 00:15:54.472\nAnd that was amazing,\n\n00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:56.758\nto be able to know\nthat we had empowered that,\n\n00:15:56.782 --> 00:15:59.962\nand that blogging was something\nthat she felt comfortable doing,\n\n00:15:59.986 --> 00:16:03.121\nand the idea that blogging\ndoesn't have to be scary,\n\n00:16:03.145 --> 00:16:05.628\nthat we don't always have\nto be attack of the blogs,\n\n00:16:05.652 --> 00:16:09.335\nthat we can be people who are open,\nand wanting to help and talk to people.\n\n00:16:09.359 --> 00:16:10.934\nThat was an amazing thing.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:16.445\nAnd so I printed out and sent\na PDF of her blog to her family,\n\n00:16:16.469 --> 00:16:18.668\nand they passed it\nout at her memorial service,\n\n00:16:18.692 --> 00:16:21.054\nand even in her obituary,\nthey mentioned her blog,\n\n00:16:21.078 --> 00:16:23.087\nbecause it was such\na big part of her life.\n\n00:16:23.111 --> 00:16:24.348\nAnd that's a huge thing.\n\n00:16:24.372 --> 00:16:27.337\nSo, this is her legacy,\n\n00:16:27.361 --> 00:16:30.657\nand I think that my call to action\nto all of you is:\n\n00:16:30.681 --> 00:16:32.838\nthink about blogs,\nthink about what they are,\n\n00:16:32.862 --> 00:16:34.790\nthink about what you've thought of them,\n\n00:16:34.814 --> 00:16:35.979\nand then actually do it,\n\n00:16:36.003 --> 00:16:39.001\nbecause it's something\nthat's really going to change our lives.\n\n00:16:39.025 --> 00:16:40.187\nSo, thank you.\n\n00:16:40.211 --> 00:16:41.211\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why we love, why we cheat", "duration": "1407", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/helen_fisher_tells_us_why_we_love_cheat", "transcript": "I'd like to talk today about the two biggest social trends in the coming century, and perhaps in the next 10,000 years. But I want to start with my work on romantic love, because that's my most recent work. What I and my colleagues did was put 32 people, who were madly in love, into a functional MRI brain scanner. 17 who were madly in love and their love was accepted; and 15 who were madly in love and they had just been dumped. And so I want to tell you about that first, and then go on into where I think love is going.(Laughter)\"What 'tis to love?\" Shakespeare said. I think our ancestors \u2014 I think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago. I started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was by looking at the last 45 years of the psychological research and as it turns out, there's a very specific group of things that happen when you fall in love. The first thing that happens is, a person begins to take on what I call, \"special meaning.\" As a truck driver once said to me, \"The world had a new center, and that center was Mary Anne.\"George Bernard Shaw said it differently. \"Love consists of overestimating the differences between one woman and another.\" And indeed, that's what we do.(Laughter)And then you just focus on this person. You can list what you don't like about them, but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do. As Chaucer said, \"Love is blind.\"In trying to understand romantic love, I decided I would read poetry from all over the world, and I just want to give you one very short poem from eighth-century China, because it's an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman. It's a little bit like when you are madly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot \u2014 their car is different from every other car in the parking lot. Their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party. And in this case, a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat.And it goes like this. It's by a guy called Yuan Zhen. \"I cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat. The night I brought you home, I watched you roll it out.\" He became hooked on a sleeping mat, probably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain, just like with you and me.But anyway, not only does this person take on special meaning, you focus your attention on them. You aggrandize them. But you have intense energy. As one Polynesian said, \"I felt like jumping in the sky.\" You're up all night. You're walking till dawn. You feel intense elation when things are going well; mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly. Real dependence on this person. As one businessman in New York said to me, \"Anything she liked, I liked.\" Simple. Romantic love is very simple.You become extremely sexually possessive. You know, if you're just sleeping with somebody casually, you don't really care if they're sleeping with somebody else. But the moment you fall in love, you become extremely sexually possessive of them. I think there's a Darwinian purpose to this. The whole point of this is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team.But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving: an intense craving to be with a particular person, not just sexually, but emotionally. It would be nice to go to bed with them, but you want them to call you on the telephone, to invite you out, etc., to tell you that they love you. The other main characteristic is motivation. The motor in the brain begins to crank, and you want this person.And last but not least, it is an obsession. Before I put these people in the MRI machine, I would ask them all kinds of questions. But my most important question was always the same. It was: \"What percentage of the day and night do you think about this person?\" And indeed, they would say, \"All day. All night. I can never stop thinking about him or her.\"And then, the very last question \u2014 I would always have to work myself up to this question, because I'm not a psychologist. I don't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation. My final question was always the same. I would say, \"Would you die for him or her?\" And, indeed, these people would say \"Yes!\" as if I had asked them to pass the salt. I was just staggered by it.So we scanned their brains, looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph, with a distraction task in between. So we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state. And we found activity in a lot of brain regions. In fact, one of the most important was a brain region that becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine. And indeed, that's exactly what happens.I began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion. In fact, I had always thought it was a series of emotions, from very high to very low. But actually, it's a drive. It comes from the motor of the mind, the wanting part of the mind, the craving part of the mind. The kind of part of the mind when you're reaching for that piece of chocolate, when you want to win that promotion at work. The motor of the brain. It's a drive.And in fact, I think it's more powerful than the sex drive. You know, if you ask somebody to go to bed with you, and they say, \"No, thank you,\" you certainly don't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression. But certainly, around the world, people who are rejected in love will kill for it. People live for love. They kill for love. They die for love. They have songs, poems, novels, sculptures, paintings, myths, legends. In over 175 societies, people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system. I have come to think it's one of the most powerful brain systems on Earth for both great joy and great sorrow.And I've also come to think that it's one of three basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction. One is the sex drive: the craving for sexual gratification. W.H. Auden called it an \"intolerable neural itch,\" and indeed, that's what it is. It keeps bothering you a little bit, like being hungry. The second of these three brain systems is romantic love: that elation, obsession of early love. And the third brain system is attachment: that sense of calm and security you can feel for a long-term partner.And I think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there, looking for a whole range of partners. You can feel it when you're just driving along in your car. It can be focused on nobody. I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time, thereby conserving mating time and energy. And I think that attachment, the third brain system, evolved to enable you to tolerate this human being at least long enough to raise a child together as a team. So with that preamble, I want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends. One of the last 10,000 years and the other, certainly of the last 25 years, that are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems: lust, romantic love and deep attachment to a partner.The first is women working, moving into the workforce. I've looked at 130 societies through the demographic yearbooks of the United Nations. Everywhere in the world, 129 out of 130 of them, women are not only moving into the job market \u2014 sometimes very, very slowly, but they are moving into the job market \u2014 and they are very slowly closing that gap between men and women in terms of economic power, health and education. It's very slow.For every trend on this planet, there's a counter-trend. We all know of them, but nevertheless \u2014 the Arabs say, \"The dogs may bark, but the caravan moves on.\" And, indeed, that caravan is moving on. Women are moving back into the job market. And I say back into the job market, because this is not new. For millions of years, on the grasslands of Africa, women commuted to work to gather their vegetables. They came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal. The double income family was the standard. And women were regarded as just as economically, socially and sexually powerful as men. In short, we're really moving forward to the past.Then, women's worst invention was the plow. With the beginning of plow agriculture, men's roles became extremely powerful. Women lost their ancient jobs as collectors, but then with the industrial revolution and the post-industrial revolution they're moving back into the job market. In short, they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago, 10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago. We are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal. And it's going to have an impact.I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women on the business community. I'll say just a couple of things, and then go on to sex and love. There's a lot of gender differences; anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child. I don't know why they want to think that men and women are alike. There's much we have in common, but there's a whole lot that we do not have in common.We are \u2014 in the words of Ted Hughes, \"I think that we are like two feet. We need each other to get ahead.\" But we did not evolve to have the same brain. And we're finding more and more gender differences in the brain. I'll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love. One of them is women's verbal ability. Women can talk.Women's ability to find the right word rapidly, basic articulation goes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle, when estrogen levels peak. But even at menstruation, they're better than the average man. Women can talk. They've been doing it for a million years; words were women's tools. They held that baby in front of their face, cajoling it, reprimanding it, educating it with words. And, indeed, they're becoming a very powerful force.Even in places like India and Japan, where women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market, they're moving into journalism. And I think that the television is like the global campfire. We sit around it and it shapes our minds. Almost always, when I'm on TV, the producer who calls me, who negotiates what we're going to say, is a woman. In fact, Solzhenitsyn once said, \"To have a great writer is to have another government.\"Today 54 percent of people who are writers in America are women. It's one of many, many characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market. They've got incredible people skills, negotiating skills. They're highly imaginative. We now know the brain circuitry of imagination, of long-term planning. They tend to be web thinkers. Because the female parts of the brain are better connected, they tend to collect more pieces of data when they think, put them into more complex patterns, see more options and outcomes. They tend to be contextual, holistic thinkers, what I call web thinkers.Men tend to \u2014 and these are averages \u2014 tend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous, focus on what they do, and move in a more step-by-step thinking pattern. They're both perfectly good ways of thinking. We need both of them to get ahead. In fact, there's many more male geniuses in the world. And there's also many more male idiots in the world.(Laughter)When the male brain works well, it works extremely well. And what I really think that we're doing is, we're moving towards a collaborative society, a society in which the talents of both men and women are becoming understood and valued and employed.But in fact, women moving into the job market is having a huge impact on sex and romance and family life. Foremost, women are starting to express their sexuality. I'm always astonished when people come to me and say, \"Why is it that men are so adulterous?\" \"Why do you think more men are adulterous than women?\" \"Well, men are more adulterous!\" And I say, \"Who do you think these men are sleeping with?\"(Laughter)And \u2014 basic math!Anyway. In the Western world, women start sooner at sex, have more partners, express less remorse for the partners that they do, marry later, have fewer children, leave bad marriages in order to get good ones. We are seeing the rise of female sexual expression. And, indeed, once again we're moving forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands of Africa a million years ago, because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today.We're also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality. They're now saying that the 21st century is going to be the century of what they call the \"symmetrical marriage,\" or the \"pure marriage,\" or the \"companionate marriage.\" This is a marriage between equals, moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit.We're also seeing a rise of romantic love. 91 percent of American women and 86 percent of American men would not marry somebody who had every single quality they were looking for in a partner, if they were not in love with that person. People around the world, in a study of 37 societies, want to be in love with the person that they marry. Indeed, arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life.I even think that marriages might even become more stable because of the second great world trend. The first one being women moving into the job market, the second one being the aging world population. They're now saying that in America, that middle age should be regarded as up to age 85. Because in that highest age category of 76 to 85, as much as 40 percent of people have nothing really wrong with them. So we're seeing there's a real extension of middle age.For one of my books, I looked at divorce data in 58 societies. And as it turns out, the older you get, the less likely you are to divorce. So the divorce rate right now is stable in America, and it's actually beginning to decline. It may decline some more. I would even say that with Viagra, estrogen replacement, hip replacements and the incredibly interesting women \u2014 women have never been as interesting as they are now. Not at any time on this planet have women been so educated, so interesting, so capable. And so I honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make good marriages, that time is now.However, there's always kinds of complications in this. These three brain systems \u2014 lust, romantic love and attachment \u2014 don't always go together. They can go together, by the way. That's why casual sex isn't so casual. With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine. Dopamine's associated with romantic love, and you can just fall in love with somebody who you're just having casual sex with. With orgasm, then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin \u2014 those are associated with attachment. This is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you've made love to them.But these three brain systems: lust, romantic love and attachment, aren't always connected to each other. You can feel deep attachment to a long-term partner while you feel intense romantic love for somebody else, while you feel the sex drive for people unrelated to these other partners. In short, we're capable of loving more than one person at a time. In fact, you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else. It's as if there's a committee meeting going on in your head as you are trying to decide what to do. So I don't think, honestly, we're an animal that was built to be happy; we are an animal that was built to reproduce. I think the happiness we find, we make. And I think, however, we can make good relationships with each other.So I want to conclude with two things. I want to conclude with a worry, and with a wonderful story. The worry is about antidepressants. Over 100 million prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the United States. And these drugs are going generic. They are seeping around the world. I know one girl who's been on these antidepressants, SSRIs, serotonin-enhancing antidepressants \u2014 since she was 13. She's 23. She's been on them ever since she was 13.I've got nothing against people who take them short term, when they're going through something horrible. They want to commit suicide or kill somebody else. I would recommend it. But more and more people in the United States are taking them long term. And indeed, what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin. And by raising levels of serotonin, you suppress the dopamine circuit. Everybody knows that. Dopamine is associated with romantic love. Not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit, but they kill the sex drive. And when you kill the sex drive, you kill orgasm. And when you kill orgasm, you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment. The things are connected in the brain. And when you tamper with one brain system, you're going to tamper with another. I'm just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place.So now \u2014(Applause)Thank you.I want to end with a story. And then, just a comment. I've been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for 30 years. I'm an identical twin; I am interested in why we're all alike. Why you and I are alike, why the Iraqis and the Japanese and the Australian Aborigines and the people of the Amazon River are all alike. And about a year ago, an Internet dating service, Match.com, came to me and asked me if I would design a new dating site for them. I said, \"I don't know anything about personality. You know? I don't know. Do you think you've got the right person?\" They said, \"Yes.\" It got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another.That's my current project; it will be my next book. There's all kinds of reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another. Timing is important. Proximity is important. Mystery is important. You fall in love with somebody who's somewhat mysterious, in part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain, probably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love. You fall in love with somebody who fits within what I call your \"love map,\" an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up. And I also think that you gravitate to certain people, actually, with somewhat complementary brain systems. And that's what I'm now contributing to this.But I want to tell you a story, to illustrate. I've been carrying on here about the biology of love. I wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it, too, the magic of it. It's a story that was told to me by somebody who had heard it just from one \u2014 probably a true story. It was a graduate student \u2014 I'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues \u2014 Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook. That's where we put our people in the MRI machine.And this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student, and she was not in love with him. And they were all at a conference in Beijing. And he knew from our work that if you go and do something very novel with somebody, you can drive up the dopamine in the brain, and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love.(Laughter)So he decided he'd put science to work. And he invited this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with him.And sure enough \u2014 I've never been in one, but apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks and it's crazy and it's noisy and it's exciting. He figured that this would drive up the dopamine, and she'd fall in love with him. So off they go and she's squealing and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time. An hour later they get down off of the rickshaw, and she throws her hands up and she says, \"Wasn't that wonderful?\" And, \"Wasn't that rickshaw driver handsome!\"(Laughter)(Applause)There's magic to love!(Applause)But I will end by saying that millions of years ago, we evolved three basic drives: the sex drive, romantic love and attachment to a long-term partner. These circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain. They're going to survive as long as our species survives on what Shakespeare called \"this mortal coil.\"Thank you.Chris Anderson: Helen Fisher!(Applause)", "id": 16, "subtitle":

century,\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:21.458\nand perhaps in the next 10,000 years.\n\n00:00:22.117 --> 00:00:25.934\nBut I want to start\nwith my work on romantic love,\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.823\nbecause that's my most recent work.\n\n00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.934\nWhat I and my colleagues did was put\n32 people, who were madly in love,\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.934\ninto a functional MRI brain scanner.\n\n00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:38.175\n17 who were madly in love\nand their love was accepted;\n\n00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.149\nand 15 who were madly in love\nand they had just been dumped.\n\n00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.308\nAnd so I want to tell you\nabout that first,\n\n00:00:44.332 --> 00:00:47.197\nand then go on into where\nI think love is going.\n\n00:00:48.647 --> 00:00:49.647\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:53.417\n\"What 'tis to love?\" Shakespeare said.\n\n00:00:54.496 --> 00:00:56.414\nI think our ancestors --\n\n00:00:56.438 --> 00:01:00.336\nI think human beings have been\nwondering about this question\n\n00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.136\nsince they sat around their campfires\n\n00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.851\nor lay and watched\nthe stars a million years ago.\n\n00:01:06.886 --> 00:01:10.117\nI started out by trying to figure out\nwhat romantic love was\n\n00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:15.624\nby looking at the last 45 years\nof the psychological research\n\n00:01:15.648 --> 00:01:16.955\nand as it turns out,\n\n00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.933\nthere's a very specific group of things\nthat happen when you fall in love.\n\n00:01:21.526 --> 00:01:23.934\nThe first thing that happens is,\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.934\na person begins to take on\nwhat I call, \"special meaning.\"\n\n00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:29.153\nAs a truck driver once said to me,\n\n00:01:29.177 --> 00:01:32.958\n\"The world had a new center,\nand that center was Mary Anne.\"\n\n00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.719\nGeorge Bernard Shaw said it differently.\n\n00:01:35.743 --> 00:01:38.211\n\"Love consists of overestimating\nthe differences\n\n00:01:38.235 --> 00:01:40.243\nbetween one woman and another.\"\n\n00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:42.529\nAnd indeed, that's what we do.\n\n00:01:42.553 --> 00:01:45.807\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:48.427\nAnd then you just focus on this person.\n\n00:01:48.451 --> 00:01:51.268\nYou can list what you\ndon't like about them,\n\n00:01:51.292 --> 00:01:54.856\nbut then you sweep that aside\nand focus on what you do.\n\n00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.879\nAs Chaucer said, \"Love is blind.\"\n\n00:01:58.488 --> 00:02:00.649\nIn trying to understand romantic love,\n\n00:02:00.673 --> 00:02:03.650\nI decided I would read poetry\nfrom all over the world,\n\n00:02:03.674 --> 00:02:06.326\nand I just want to give\nyou one very short poem\n\n00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.597\nfrom eighth-century China,\n\n00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:09.830\nbecause it's an almost perfect example\n\n00:02:09.854 --> 00:02:13.218\nof a man who is focused totally\non a particular woman.\n\n00:02:13.782 --> 00:02:16.822\nIt's a little bit like when you are\nmadly in love with somebody\n\n00:02:16.846 --> 00:02:18.484\nand you walk into a parking lot --\n\n00:02:18.508 --> 00:02:21.888\ntheir car is different\nfrom every other car in the parking lot.\n\n00:02:21.912 --> 00:02:23.418\nTheir wine glass at dinner\n\n00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:26.934\nis different from every other wine glass\nat the dinner party.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:30.722\nAnd in this case, a man got hooked\non a bamboo sleeping mat.\n\n00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.469\nAnd it goes like this.\n\n00:02:32.493 --> 00:02:33.984\nIt's by a guy called Yuan Zhen.\n\n00:02:35.381 --> 00:02:37.934\n\"I cannot bear to put away\nthe bamboo sleeping mat.\n\n00:02:38.595 --> 00:02:41.600\nThe night I brought you home,\nI watched you roll it out.\"\n\n00:02:42.426 --> 00:02:44.783\nHe became hooked on a sleeping mat,\n\n00:02:44.807 --> 00:02:47.783\nprobably because of elevated activity\nof dopamine in his brain,\n\n00:02:47.807 --> 00:02:49.228\njust like with you and me.\n\n00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:52.417\nBut anyway, not only does this person\ntake on special meaning,\n\n00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:54.887\nyou focus your attention on them.\n\n00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:56.512\nYou aggrandize them.\n\n00:02:56.536 --> 00:02:58.297\nBut you have intense energy.\n\n00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:01.816\nAs one Polynesian said,\n\"I felt like jumping in the sky.\"\n\n00:03:02.364 --> 00:03:05.561\nYou're up all night.\nYou're walking till dawn.\n\n00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:08.544\nYou feel intense elation\nwhen things are going well;\n\n00:03:08.568 --> 00:03:12.117\nmood swings into horrible despair\nwhen things are going poorly.\n\n00:03:12.141 --> 00:03:14.595\nReal dependence on this person.\n\n00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:17.018\nAs one businessman in New York said to me,\n\n00:03:17.042 --> 00:03:18.903\n\"Anything she liked, I liked.\"\n\n00:03:19.482 --> 00:03:21.443\nSimple. Romantic love is very simple.\n\n00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:24.934\nYou become extremely sexually possessive.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.689\nYou know, if you're just sleeping\nwith somebody casually,\n\n00:03:27.713 --> 00:03:30.583\nyou don't really care\nif they're sleeping with somebody else.\n\n00:03:30.607 --> 00:03:32.161\nBut the moment you fall in love,\n\n00:03:32.185 --> 00:03:34.481\nyou become extremely\nsexually possessive of them.\n\n00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:37.934\nI think there's a Darwinian\npurpose to this.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.591\nThe whole point of this\nis to pull two people together\n\n00:03:40.615 --> 00:03:43.921\nstrongly enough to begin\nto rear babies as a team.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.934\nBut the main characteristics\nof romantic love are craving:\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:51.380\nan intense craving\nto be with a particular person,\n\n00:03:51.404 --> 00:03:53.627\nnot just sexually, but emotionally.\n\n00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:57.379\nIt would be nice to go to bed with them,\n\n00:03:57.403 --> 00:04:01.635\nbut you want them to call you\non the telephone, to invite you out, etc.,\n\n00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:03.515\nto tell you that they love you.\n\n00:04:04.418 --> 00:04:09.140\nThe other main characteristic\nis motivation.\n\n00:04:09.164 --> 00:04:12.529\nThe motor in the brain begins to crank,\nand you want this person.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.822\nAnd last but not least,\nit is an obsession.\n\n00:04:16.132 --> 00:04:19.934\nBefore I put these people\nin the MRI machine,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.934\nI would ask them all kinds of questions.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.123\nBut my most important question\nwas always the same.\n\n00:04:25.147 --> 00:04:29.934\nIt was: \"What percentage of the day\nand night do you think about this person?\"\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.848\nAnd indeed, they would say,\n\n00:04:31.872 --> 00:04:34.029\n\"All day. All night.\n\n00:04:34.053 --> 00:04:36.394\nI can never stop thinking\nabout him or her.\"\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.768\nAnd then, the very last question --\n\n00:04:38.792 --> 00:04:41.391\nI would always have to work\nmyself up to this question,\n\n00:04:41.415 --> 00:04:42.982\nbecause I'm not a psychologist.\n\n00:04:43.006 --> 00:04:45.982\nI don't work with people\nin any kind of traumatic situation.\n\n00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:48.257\nMy final question was always the same.\n\n00:04:48.281 --> 00:04:50.934\nI would say,\n\"Would you die for him or her?\"\n\n00:04:51.423 --> 00:04:53.494\nAnd, indeed, these people would say \"Yes!\"\n\n00:04:53.518 --> 00:04:55.629\nas if I had asked them to pass the salt.\n\n00:04:55.653 --> 00:04:58.347\nI was just staggered by it.\n\n00:04:59.592 --> 00:05:02.178\nSo we scanned their brains,\n\n00:05:02.202 --> 00:05:04.312\nlooking at a photograph\nof their sweetheart\n\n00:05:04.336 --> 00:05:06.104\nand looking at a neutral photograph,\n\n00:05:06.128 --> 00:05:07.962\nwith a distraction task in between.\n\n00:05:07.986 --> 00:05:12.934\nSo we could look at the same brain\nwhen it was in that heightened state\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.255\nand when it was in a resting state.\n\n00:05:15.827 --> 00:05:18.098\nAnd we found activity\nin a lot of brain regions.\n\n00:05:18.122 --> 00:05:20.780\nIn fact, one of the most important\nwas a brain region\n\n00:05:20.804 --> 00:05:24.012\nthat becomes active\nwhen you feel the rush of cocaine.\n\n00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd indeed, that's exactly what happens.\n\n00:05:27.608 --> 00:05:32.227\nI began to realize that romantic love\nis not an emotion.\n\n00:05:32.251 --> 00:05:35.107\nIn fact, I had always thought\nit was a series of emotions,\n\n00:05:35.131 --> 00:05:36.837\nfrom very high to very low.\n\n00:05:36.861 --> 00:05:38.567\nBut actually, it's a drive.\n\n00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:40.726\nIt comes from the motor of the mind,\n\n00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.415\nthe wanting part of the mind,\nthe craving part of the mind.\n\n00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:45.934\nThe kind of part of the mind\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.598\nwhen you're reaching\nfor that piece of chocolate,\n\n00:05:48.622 --> 00:05:52.460\nwhen you want to win\nthat promotion at work.\n\n00:05:52.864 --> 00:05:54.403\nThe motor of the brain.\n\n00:05:54.427 --> 00:05:55.631\nIt's a drive.\n\n00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:58.758\nAnd in fact, I think it's more powerful\nthan the sex drive.\n\n00:05:59.124 --> 00:06:01.607\nYou know, if you ask somebody\nto go to bed with you,\n\n00:06:01.631 --> 00:06:03.068\nand they say, \"No, thank you,\"\n\n00:06:03.092 --> 00:06:06.609\nyou certainly don't kill yourself\nor slip into a clinical depression.\n\n00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:09.826\nBut certainly, around the world,\n\n00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.807\npeople who are rejected\nin love will kill for it.\n\n00:06:14.307 --> 00:06:15.442\nPeople live for love.\n\n00:06:15.466 --> 00:06:16.726\nThey kill for love.\n\n00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:17.781\nThey die for love.\n\n00:06:18.235 --> 00:06:21.813\nThey have songs, poems, novels,\n\n00:06:21.837 --> 00:06:25.781\nsculptures, paintings, myths, legends.\n\n00:06:25.805 --> 00:06:27.954\nIn over 175 societies,\n\n00:06:27.978 --> 00:06:32.762\npeople have left their evidence\nof this powerful brain system.\n\n00:06:32.786 --> 00:06:33.809\nI have come to think\n\n00:06:33.833 --> 00:06:36.421\nit's one of the most powerful\nbrain systems on Earth\n\n00:06:36.445 --> 00:06:39.022\nfor both great joy and great sorrow.\n\n00:06:39.617 --> 00:06:41.054\nAnd I've also come to think\n\n00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:44.561\nthat it's one of three\nbasically different brain systems\n\n00:06:44.586 --> 00:06:46.633\nthat evolved from mating and reproduction.\n\n00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.085\nOne is the sex drive:\nthe craving for sexual gratification.\n\n00:06:50.513 --> 00:06:53.934\nW.H. Auden called it\nan \"intolerable neural itch,\"\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.933\nand indeed, that's what it is.\n\n00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.680\nIt keeps bothering you\na little bit, like being hungry.\n\n00:07:00.862 --> 00:07:03.808\nThe second of these three brain\nsystems is romantic love:\n\n00:07:03.832 --> 00:07:05.934\nthat elation, obsession of early love.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.314\nAnd the third brain system is attachment:\n\n00:07:08.338 --> 00:07:12.291\nthat sense of calm and security\nyou can feel for a long-term partner.\n\n00:07:12.656 --> 00:07:15.468\nAnd I think that the sex drive\nevolved to get you out there,\n\n00:07:15.492 --> 00:07:18.047\nlooking for a whole range of partners.\n\n00:07:18.071 --> 00:07:20.856\nYou can feel it when you're just\ndriving along in your car.\n\n00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.252\nIt can be focused on nobody.\n\n00:07:22.276 --> 00:07:25.934\nI think romantic love evolved\nto enable you to focus your mating energy\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.934\non just one individual at a time,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.790\nthereby conserving mating time and energy.\n\n00:07:30.814 --> 00:07:33.544\nAnd I think that attachment,\nthe third brain system,\n\n00:07:33.568 --> 00:07:37.110\nevolved to enable you to tolerate\nthis human being\n\n00:07:37.134 --> 00:07:41.187\nat least long enough to raise\na child together as a team.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.456\nSo with that preamble,\n\n00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:50.511\nI want to go into discussing\nthe two most profound social trends.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.241\nOne of the last 10,000 years\n\n00:07:53.265 --> 00:07:57.962\nand the other,\ncertainly of the last 25 years,\n\n00:07:57.986 --> 00:08:02.238\nthat are going to have an impact\non these three different brain systems:\n\n00:08:02.262 --> 00:08:05.815\nlust, romantic love\nand deep attachment to a partner.\n\n00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:10.681\nThe first is women working,\nmoving into the workforce.\n\n00:08:13.291 --> 00:08:16.182\nI've looked at 130 societies\n\n00:08:16.206 --> 00:08:18.847\nthrough the demographic yearbooks\nof the United Nations.\n\n00:08:18.871 --> 00:08:23.603\nEverywhere in the world,\n129 out of 130 of them,\n\n00:08:23.627 --> 00:08:25.934\nwomen are not only moving\ninto the job market --\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.934\nsometimes very, very slowly,\nbut they are moving into the job market --\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:33.812\nand they are very slowly closing\nthat gap between men and women\n\n00:08:33.836 --> 00:08:37.633\nin terms of economic power,\nhealth and education.\n\n00:08:37.657 --> 00:08:38.793\nIt's very slow.\n\n00:08:38.817 --> 00:08:41.934\nFor every trend on this planet,\nthere's a counter-trend.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.271\nWe all know of them, but nevertheless --\n\n00:08:44.295 --> 00:08:50.691\nthe Arabs say, \"The dogs may bark,\nbut the caravan moves on.\"\n\n00:08:50.715 --> 00:08:53.042\nAnd, indeed, that caravan is moving on.\n\n00:08:53.066 --> 00:08:55.753\nWomen are moving back into the job market.\n\n00:08:55.777 --> 00:08:58.934\nAnd I say back into the job market,\nbecause this is not new.\n\n00:08:59.281 --> 00:09:02.947\nFor millions of years,\non the grasslands of Africa,\n\n00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:06.121\nwomen commuted to work\nto gather their vegetables.\n\n00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:09.805\nThey came home with 60 to 80 percent\nof the evening meal.\n\n00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:12.717\nThe double income family was the standard.\n\n00:09:12.741 --> 00:09:16.171\nAnd women were regarded\nas just as economically,\n\n00:09:16.195 --> 00:09:19.934\nsocially and sexually powerful as men.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.761\nIn short, we're really\nmoving forward to the past.\n\n00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:29.474\nThen, women's worst\ninvention was the plow.\n\n00:09:29.498 --> 00:09:33.172\nWith the beginning of plow agriculture,\nmen's roles became extremely powerful.\n\n00:09:33.196 --> 00:09:37.632\nWomen lost their ancient\njobs as collectors,\n\n00:09:37.656 --> 00:09:41.335\nbut then with the industrial revolution\nand the post-industrial revolution\n\n00:09:41.359 --> 00:09:43.302\nthey're moving back into the job market.\n\n00:09:43.326 --> 00:09:48.453\nIn short, they are acquiring the status\nthat they had a million years ago,\n\n00:09:48.477 --> 00:09:51.701\n10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago.\n\n00:09:51.725 --> 00:09:56.296\nWe are seeing now one\nof the most remarkable traditions\n\n00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.653\nin the history of the human animal.\n\n00:10:00.624 --> 00:10:02.220\nAnd it's going to have an impact.\n\n00:10:02.244 --> 00:10:03.777\nI generally give a whole lecture\n\n00:10:03.801 --> 00:10:06.105\non the impact of women\non the business community.\n\n00:10:06.129 --> 00:10:09.186\nI'll say just a couple of things,\nand then go on to sex and love.\n\n00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.067\nThere's a lot of gender differences;\n\n00:10:11.091 --> 00:10:13.267\nanybody who thinks men and women are alike\n\n00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:15.233\nsimply never had a boy and a girl child.\n\n00:10:15.257 --> 00:10:18.450\nI don't know why they want to think\nthat men and women are alike.\n\n00:10:18.474 --> 00:10:19.997\nThere's much we have in common,\n\n00:10:20.021 --> 00:10:22.934\nbut there's a whole lot\nthat we do not have in common.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.934\nWe are -- in the words of Ted Hughes,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:30.062\n\"I think that we are like two feet.\nWe need each other to get ahead.\"\n\n00:10:30.086 --> 00:10:32.934\nBut we did not evolve\nto have the same brain.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:36.407\nAnd we're finding more and more\ngender differences in the brain.\n\n00:10:36.431 --> 00:10:39.558\nI'll only just use a couple\nand then move on to sex and love.\n\n00:10:39.582 --> 00:10:41.689\nOne of them is women's verbal ability.\n\n00:10:41.713 --> 00:10:42.934\nWomen can talk.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.934\nWomen's ability to find the right word\nrapidly, basic articulation\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.336\ngoes up in the middle\nof the menstrual cycle,\n\n00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.931\nwhen estrogen levels peak.\n\n00:10:50.955 --> 00:10:54.573\nBut even at menstruation,\nthey're better than the average man.\n\n00:10:55.057 --> 00:10:56.105\nWomen can talk.\n\n00:10:56.613 --> 00:10:59.934\nThey've been doing it for a million years;\nwords were women's tools.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.045\nThey held that baby\nin front of their face,\n\n00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:05.878\ncajoling it, reprimanding it,\neducating it with words.\n\n00:11:05.902 --> 00:11:08.934\nAnd, indeed, they're becoming\na very powerful force.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:14.195\nEven in places like India and Japan,\n\n00:11:14.219 --> 00:11:17.616\nwhere women are not moving rapidly\ninto the regular job market,\n\n00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.473\nthey're moving into journalism.\n\n00:11:19.497 --> 00:11:23.934\nAnd I think that the television\nis like the global campfire.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:27.934\nWe sit around it and it shapes our minds.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:32.042\nAlmost always, when I'm on TV,\nthe producer who calls me,\n\n00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:34.209\nwho negotiates what we're going to say,\n\n00:11:34.233 --> 00:11:35.288\nis a woman.\n\n00:11:35.312 --> 00:11:37.970\nIn fact, Solzhenitsyn once said,\n\n00:11:37.994 --> 00:11:41.148\n\"To have a great writer\nis to have another government.\"\n\n00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:46.227\nToday 54 percent of people\nwho are writers in America are women.\n\n00:11:47.116 --> 00:11:49.789\nIt's one of many, many\ncharacteristics that women have\n\n00:11:49.813 --> 00:11:52.093\nthat they will bring into the job market.\n\n00:11:52.117 --> 00:11:56.244\nThey've got incredible people skills,\nnegotiating skills.\n\n00:11:56.268 --> 00:11:57.934\nThey're highly imaginative.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:02.537\nWe now know the brain circuitry\nof imagination, of long-term planning.\n\n00:12:02.561 --> 00:12:04.681\nThey tend to be web thinkers.\n\n00:12:04.705 --> 00:12:07.490\nBecause the female parts\nof the brain are better connected,\n\n00:12:07.514 --> 00:12:10.688\nthey tend to collect more\npieces of data when they think,\n\n00:12:10.712 --> 00:12:15.415\nput them into more complex patterns,\nsee more options and outcomes.\n\n00:12:15.439 --> 00:12:19.145\nThey tend to be contextual,\nholistic thinkers,\n\n00:12:19.169 --> 00:12:20.709\nwhat I call web thinkers.\n\n00:12:20.733 --> 00:12:22.738\nMen tend to -- and these are averages --\n\n00:12:22.762 --> 00:12:25.421\ntend to get rid of what they regard\nas extraneous,\n\n00:12:25.445 --> 00:12:26.830\nfocus on what they do,\n\n00:12:26.854 --> 00:12:32.780\nand move in a more\nstep-by-step thinking pattern.\n\n00:12:33.129 --> 00:12:35.231\nThey're both perfectly good\nways of thinking.\n\n00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:37.487\nWe need both of them to get ahead.\n\n00:12:37.511 --> 00:12:40.934\nIn fact, there's many more\nmale geniuses in the world.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.679\nAnd there's also many more\nmale idiots in the world.\n\n00:12:43.703 --> 00:12:45.429\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:45.453 --> 00:12:48.635\nWhen the male brain works well,\nit works extremely well.\n\n00:12:48.659 --> 00:12:51.993\nAnd what I really think\nthat we're doing is,\n\n00:12:52.017 --> 00:12:54.303\nwe're moving towards\na collaborative society,\n\n00:12:54.327 --> 00:12:57.129\na society in which the talents\nof both men and women\n\n00:12:57.153 --> 00:13:00.934\nare becoming understood\nand valued and employed.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.721\nBut in fact, women moving\ninto the job market\n\n00:13:03.745 --> 00:13:08.855\nis having a huge impact\non sex and romance and family life.\n\n00:13:09.566 --> 00:13:14.650\nForemost, women are starting\nto express their sexuality.\n\n00:13:14.674 --> 00:13:17.300\nI'm always astonished\nwhen people come to me and say,\n\n00:13:17.324 --> 00:13:19.642\n\"Why is it that men are so adulterous?\"\n\n00:13:19.666 --> 00:13:22.379\n\"Why do you think\nmore men are adulterous than women?\"\n\n00:13:22.403 --> 00:13:23.974\n\"Well, men are more adulterous!\"\n\n00:13:23.998 --> 00:13:26.936\nAnd I say, \"Who do you think\nthese men are sleeping with?\"\n\n00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.364\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:28.388 --> 00:13:30.116\nAnd -- basic math!\n\n00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:31.314\nAnyway.\n\n00:13:31.338 --> 00:13:34.934\nIn the Western world,\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.934\nwomen start sooner at sex,\nhave more partners,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.843\nexpress less remorse\nfor the partners that they do,\n\n00:13:40.867 --> 00:13:43.549\nmarry later, have fewer children,\n\n00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:46.478\nleave bad marriages\nin order to get good ones.\n\n00:13:46.502 --> 00:13:50.481\nWe are seeing the rise\nof female sexual expression.\n\n00:13:50.505 --> 00:13:55.226\nAnd, indeed, once again we're moving\nforward to the kind of sexual expression\n\n00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.934\nthat we probably saw on the grasslands\nof Africa a million years ago,\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.934\nbecause this is the kind\nof sexual expression that we see\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.216\nin hunting and gathering societies today.\n\n00:14:04.823 --> 00:14:08.799\nWe're also returning\nto an ancient form of marriage equality.\n\n00:14:09.378 --> 00:14:13.934\nThey're now saying that the 21st century\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:17.934\nis going to be the century of what\nthey call the \"symmetrical marriage,\"\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:23.342\nor the \"pure marriage,\"\nor the \"companionate marriage.\"\n\n00:14:23.366 --> 00:14:26.934\nThis is a marriage between equals,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.401\nmoving forward to a pattern\n\n00:14:29.425 --> 00:14:32.559\nthat is highly compatible\nwith the ancient human spirit.\n\n00:14:33.733 --> 00:14:36.272\nWe're also seeing a rise of romantic love.\n\n00:14:36.744 --> 00:14:40.970\n91 percent of American women\nand 86 percent of American men\n\n00:14:40.994 --> 00:14:45.597\nwould not marry somebody\nwho had every single quality\n\n00:14:45.621 --> 00:14:47.437\nthey were looking for in a partner,\n\n00:14:47.461 --> 00:14:50.224\nif they were not in love with that person.\n\n00:14:50.248 --> 00:14:53.767\nPeople around the world,\nin a study of 37 societies,\n\n00:14:53.791 --> 00:14:57.428\nwant to be in love\nwith the person that they marry.\n\n00:14:57.904 --> 00:15:03.958\nIndeed, arranged marriages are\non their way off this braid of human life.\n\n00:15:07.576 --> 00:15:10.370\nI even think that marriages\nmight even become more stable\n\n00:15:10.394 --> 00:15:14.148\nbecause of the second great world trend.\n\n00:15:14.172 --> 00:15:16.934\nThe first one being women\nmoving into the job market,\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.808\nthe second one being\nthe aging world population.\n\n00:15:19.832 --> 00:15:22.259\nThey're now saying that in America,\n\n00:15:22.283 --> 00:15:25.934\nthat middle age should be regarded\nas up to age 85.\n\n00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:31.479\nBecause in that highest\nage category of 76 to 85,\n\n00:15:31.503 --> 00:15:34.934\nas much as 40 percent of people\nhave nothing really wrong with them.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:38.340\nSo we're seeing there's a real\nextension of middle age.\n\n00:15:38.672 --> 00:15:43.934\nFor one of my books,\nI looked at divorce data in 58 societies.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:48.189\nAnd as it turns out, the older you get,\nthe less likely you are to divorce.\n\n00:15:48.554 --> 00:15:52.155\nSo the divorce rate right now\nis stable in America,\n\n00:15:52.179 --> 00:15:54.513\nand it's actually beginning to decline.\n\n00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:56.139\nIt may decline some more.\n\n00:15:59.091 --> 00:16:03.090\nI would even say that with Viagra,\n\n00:16:03.114 --> 00:16:06.929\nestrogen replacement, hip replacements\n\n00:16:06.953 --> 00:16:08.934\nand the incredibly interesting women\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.063\n-- women have never been\nas interesting as they are now.\n\n00:16:12.087 --> 00:16:15.545\nNot at any time on this planet\nhave women been so educated,\n\n00:16:15.569 --> 00:16:17.516\nso interesting, so capable.\n\n00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:23.299\nAnd so I honestly think that if there\nreally was ever a time in human evolution\n\n00:16:23.323 --> 00:16:27.188\nwhen we have the opportunity to make\ngood marriages, that time is now.\n\n00:16:28.474 --> 00:16:31.675\nHowever, there's always kinds\nof complications in this.\n\n00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:36.416\nThese three brain systems --\nlust, romantic love and attachment --\n\n00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.794\ndon't always go together.\n\n00:16:37.818 --> 00:16:39.517\nThey can go together, by the way.\n\n00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:41.493\nThat's why casual sex isn't so casual.\n\n00:16:41.517 --> 00:16:43.786\nWith orgasm you get a spike of dopamine.\n\n00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:45.906\nDopamine's associated with romantic love,\n\n00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:47.953\nand you can just\nfall in love with somebody\n\n00:16:47.977 --> 00:16:49.840\nwho you're just having casual sex with.\n\n00:16:49.864 --> 00:16:53.300\nWith orgasm, then you get a real rush\nof oxytocin and vasopressin --\n\n00:16:53.324 --> 00:16:55.355\nthose are associated with attachment.\n\n00:16:55.379 --> 00:16:59.338\nThis is why you can feel such a sense\nof cosmic union with somebody\n\n00:16:59.362 --> 00:17:01.211\nafter you've made love to them.\n\n00:17:01.235 --> 00:17:05.934\nBut these three brain systems:\nlust, romantic love and attachment,\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.439\naren't always connected to each other.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:12.209\nYou can feel deep attachment\nto a long-term partner\n\n00:17:12.233 --> 00:17:16.325\nwhile you feel intense\nromantic love for somebody else,\n\n00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:21.802\nwhile you feel the sex drive for people\nunrelated to these other partners.\n\n00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:27.299\nIn short, we're capable of loving\nmore than one person at a time.\n\n00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:29.664\nIn fact, you can lie in bed at night\n\n00:17:29.688 --> 00:17:32.934\nand swing from deep feelings\nof attachment for one person\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:36.390\nto deep feelings\nof romantic love for somebody else.\n\n00:17:36.414 --> 00:17:39.295\nIt's as if there's a committee meeting\ngoing on in your head\n\n00:17:39.319 --> 00:17:42.446\nas you are trying to decide what to do.\n\n00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:44.105\nSo I don't think, honestly,\n\n00:17:44.129 --> 00:17:46.144\nwe're an animal\nthat was built to be happy;\n\n00:17:46.168 --> 00:17:48.436\nwe are an animal\nthat was built to reproduce.\n\n00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:51.395\nI think the happiness we find, we make.\n\n00:17:51.419 --> 00:17:54.901\nAnd I think, however,\n\n00:17:54.925 --> 00:17:57.592\nwe can make good relationships\nwith each other.\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:00.063\nSo I want to conclude with two things.\n\n00:18:00.087 --> 00:18:02.134\nI want to conclude with a worry,\n\n00:18:02.158 --> 00:18:05.087\nand with a wonderful story.\n\n00:18:06.245 --> 00:18:08.934\nThe worry is about antidepressants.\n\n00:18:10.589 --> 00:18:15.721\nOver 100 million prescriptions\nof antidepressants\n\n00:18:15.745 --> 00:18:18.566\nare written every year\nin the United States.\n\n00:18:19.058 --> 00:18:21.623\nAnd these drugs are going generic.\n\n00:18:21.647 --> 00:18:24.130\nThey are seeping around the world.\n\n00:18:24.701 --> 00:18:29.934\nI know one girl who's been\non these antidepressants,\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:33.934\nSSRIs, serotonin-enhancing\nantidepressants -- since she was 13.\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:36.934\nShe's 23. She's been on them\never since she was 13.\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:40.474\nI've got nothing against people\nwho take them short term,\n\n00:18:40.498 --> 00:18:42.721\nwhen they're going\nthrough something horrible.\n\n00:18:42.745 --> 00:18:45.100\nThey want to commit suicide\nor kill somebody else.\n\n00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:46.192\nI would recommend it.\n\n00:18:46.216 --> 00:18:48.675\nBut more and more people\nin the United States\n\n00:18:48.699 --> 00:18:51.083\nare taking them long term.\n\n00:18:51.107 --> 00:18:56.472\nAnd indeed, what these drugs do\nis raise levels of serotonin.\n\n00:18:56.932 --> 00:19:01.753\nAnd by raising levels of serotonin,\nyou suppress the dopamine circuit.\n\n00:19:01.777 --> 00:19:03.339\nEverybody knows that.\n\n00:19:03.902 --> 00:19:06.797\nDopamine is associated with romantic love.\n\n00:19:08.585 --> 00:19:11.735\nNot only do they suppress\nthe dopamine circuit,\n\n00:19:11.759 --> 00:19:13.626\nbut they kill the sex drive.\n\n00:19:14.274 --> 00:19:18.098\nAnd when you kill the sex drive,\nyou kill orgasm.\n\n00:19:18.122 --> 00:19:19.313\nAnd when you kill orgasm,\n\n00:19:19.337 --> 00:19:23.204\nyou kill that flood of drugs\nassociated with attachment.\n\n00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:25.934\nThe things are connected in the brain.\n\n00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:28.614\nAnd when you tamper with one brain system,\n\n00:19:28.638 --> 00:19:30.583\nyou're going to tamper with another.\n\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:35.712\nI'm just simply saying that a world\nwithout love is a deadly place.\n\n00:19:36.696 --> 00:19:37.698\nSo now --\n\n00:19:37.722 --> 00:19:41.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:43.661\nThank you.\n\n00:19:43.685 --> 00:19:45.170\nI want to end with a story.\n\n00:19:45.797 --> 00:19:47.097\nAnd then, just a comment.\n\n00:19:48.699 --> 00:19:53.478\nI've been studying romantic love\nand sex and attachment for 30 years.\n\n00:19:55.732 --> 00:19:59.248\nI'm an identical twin;\nI am interested in why we're all alike.\n\n00:19:59.883 --> 00:20:02.934\nWhy you and I are alike,\nwhy the Iraqis and the Japanese\n\n00:20:02.958 --> 00:20:05.958\nand the Australian Aborigines\nand the people of the Amazon River\n\n00:20:05.982 --> 00:20:06.982\nare all alike.\n\n00:20:07.735 --> 00:20:10.044\nAnd about a year ago,\n\n00:20:10.068 --> 00:20:13.053\nan Internet dating service,\nMatch.com, came to me\n\n00:20:13.077 --> 00:20:16.729\nand asked me if I would design\na new dating site for them.\n\n00:20:16.753 --> 00:20:19.555\nI said, \"I don't know anything\nabout personality. You know?\n\n00:20:19.579 --> 00:20:22.299\nI don't know. Do you think\nyou've got the right person?\"\n\n00:20:22.323 --> 00:20:23.363\nThey said, \"Yes.\"\n\n00:20:23.387 --> 00:20:26.410\nIt got me thinking\nabout why it is that you fall in love\n\n00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:28.166\nwith one person rather than another.\n\n00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:31.633\nThat's my current project;\nit will be my next book.\n\n00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:33.759\nThere's all kinds of reasons\n\n00:20:33.783 --> 00:20:36.536\nthat you fall in love\nwith one person rather than another.\n\n00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.846\nTiming is important.\nProximity is important.\n\n00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:41.250\nMystery is important.\n\n00:20:41.274 --> 00:20:44.003\nYou fall in love with somebody\nwho's somewhat mysterious,\n\n00:20:44.027 --> 00:20:46.705\nin part because mystery\nelevates dopamine in the brain,\n\n00:20:46.729 --> 00:20:49.495\nprobably pushes you\nover that threshold to fall in love.\n\n00:20:49.519 --> 00:20:50.948\nYou fall in love with somebody\n\n00:20:50.972 --> 00:20:53.067\nwho fits within\nwhat I call your \"love map,\"\n\n00:20:53.091 --> 00:20:55.238\nan unconscious list of traits\n\n00:20:55.262 --> 00:20:57.576\nthat you build in childhood\nas you grow up.\n\n00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.642\nAnd I also think\nthat you gravitate to certain people,\n\n00:21:00.666 --> 00:21:03.934\nactually, with somewhat\ncomplementary brain systems.\n\n00:21:03.958 --> 00:21:06.245\nAnd that's what I'm now\ncontributing to this.\n\n00:21:06.269 --> 00:21:09.934\nBut I want to tell you\na story, to illustrate.\n\n00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:12.934\nI've been carrying on here\nabout the biology of love.\n\n00:21:13.667 --> 00:21:17.354\nI wanted to show you a little bit\nabout the culture of it, too,\n\n00:21:17.378 --> 00:21:18.545\nthe magic of it.\n\n00:21:19.958 --> 00:21:23.307\nIt's a story that was told to me\n\n00:21:23.331 --> 00:21:25.792\nby somebody who had\nheard it just from one --\n\n00:21:25.816 --> 00:21:26.934\nprobably a true story.\n\n00:21:28.466 --> 00:21:31.934\nIt was a graduate student --\nI'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues --\n\n00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:33.934\nArt Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook.\n\n00:21:33.958 --> 00:21:36.329\nThat's where we put our people\nin the MRI machine.\n\n00:21:36.958 --> 00:21:41.521\nAnd this graduate student was madly\nin love with another graduate student,\n\n00:21:41.545 --> 00:21:43.918\nand she was not in love with him.\n\n00:21:45.164 --> 00:21:47.419\nAnd they were\nall at a conference in Beijing.\n\n00:21:48.443 --> 00:21:51.477\nAnd he knew from our work\n\n00:21:51.501 --> 00:21:55.909\nthat if you go and do something\nvery novel with somebody,\n\n00:21:55.933 --> 00:21:57.934\nyou can drive up\nthe dopamine in the brain,\n\n00:21:57.958 --> 00:22:01.651\nand perhaps trigger\nthis brain system for romantic love.\n\n00:22:01.675 --> 00:22:03.832\n(Laughter)\n\n00:22:03.856 --> 00:22:07.742\nSo he decided he'd put science to work.\n\n00:22:08.582 --> 00:22:11.916\nAnd he invited this girl to go off\non a rickshaw ride with him.\n\n00:22:12.767 --> 00:22:14.836\nAnd sure enough -- I've never been in one,\n\n00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.598\nbut apparently they go\nall around the buses and the trucks\n\n00:22:17.622 --> 00:22:20.440\nand it's crazy and it's noisy\nand it's exciting.\n\n00:22:20.464 --> 00:22:22.750\nHe figured that this\nwould drive up the dopamine,\n\n00:22:22.774 --> 00:22:24.306\nand she'd fall in love with him.\n\n00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:29.304\nSo off they go and she's squealing\nand squeezing him\n\n00:22:29.328 --> 00:22:31.845\nand laughing and having a wonderful time.\n\n00:22:31.869 --> 00:22:35.408\nAn hour later they get down\noff of the rickshaw,\n\n00:22:35.432 --> 00:22:39.012\nand she throws her hands up and she says,\n\n00:22:39.036 --> 00:22:41.348\n\"Wasn't that wonderful?\"\n\n00:22:41.372 --> 00:22:44.786\nAnd, \"Wasn't that rickshaw\ndriver handsome!\"\n\n00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:47.879\n(Laughter)\n\n00:22:47.903 --> 00:22:53.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:22:53.958 --> 00:22:55.120\nThere's magic to love!\n\n00:22:55.144 --> 00:22:56.755\n(Applause)\n\n00:22:56.779 --> 00:23:00.399\nBut I will end by saying\nthat millions of years ago,\n\n00:23:00.423 --> 00:23:02.755\nwe evolved three basic drives:\n\n00:23:02.779 --> 00:23:05.298\nthe sex drive, romantic love\n\n00:23:05.322 --> 00:23:07.662\nand attachment to a long-term partner.\n\n00:23:07.686 --> 00:23:10.765\nThese circuits are deeply\nembedded in the human brain.\n\n00:23:11.161 --> 00:23:15.564\nThey're going to survive\nas long as our species survives\n\n00:23:15.588 --> 00:23:18.296\non what Shakespeare called\n\"this mortal coil.\"\n\n00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.326\nThank you.\n\n00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:20.775\nChris Anderson: Helen Fisher!\n\n00:23:20.799 -->

worried.(Laughter)I was worried. That's why I began this piece. I was worried about vaginas. I was worried what we think about vaginas and even more worried that we don't think about them. I was worried about my own vagina. It needed a context, a culture, a community of other vaginas. There is so much darkness and secrecy surrounding them. Like the Bermuda Triangle, nobody ever reports back from there.(Laughter)In the first place, it's not so easy to even find your vagina. Women go days, weeks, months, without looking at it. I interviewed a high-powered businesswoman; she told me she didn't have time. \"Looking at your vagina,\" she said, \"is a full day's work.\"(Laughter)\"You've got to get down there on your back, in front of a mirror, full-length preferred. You've got to get in the perfect position with the perfect light, which then becomes shadowed by the angle you're at. You're twisting your head up, arching your back, it's exhausting.\" She was busy; she didn't have time. So I decided to talk to women about their vaginas. They began as casual vagina interviews, and they turned into vagina monologues. I talked with over 200 women. I talked to older women, younger women, married women, lesbians, single women. I talked to corporate professionals, college professors, actors, sex workers. I talked to African-American women, Asian-American women, Native-American women, Caucasian women, Jewish women.OK, at first women were a little shy, a little reluctant to talk. Once they got going, you couldn't stop them. Women love to talk about their vaginas, they do. Mainly because no one's ever asked them before.(Laughter)Let's just start with the word \"vagina\" \u2014 vagina, vagina. It sounds like an infection, at best. Maybe a medical instrument. \"Hurry, nurse, bring the vagina!\"(Laughter)Vagina, vagina, vagina.It doesn't matter how many times you say the word, it never sounds like a word you want to say. It's a completely ridiculous, totally un-sexy word. If you use it during sex, trying to be politically correct, \"Darling, would you stroke my vagina,\" you kill the act right there.(Laughter)I'm worried what we call them and don't call them. In Great Neck, New York, they call it a Pussycat. A woman told me there her mother used to tell her, \"Don't wear panties, dear, underneath your pajamas. You need to air out your Pussycat.\"(Laughter)In Westchester, they call it a Pooki, in New Jersey, a twat. There's Powderbox, derriere, a Pooky, a Poochi, a Poopi, a Poopelu, a Pooninana, a Padepachetchki, a Pal, and a Piche.(Laughter)There's Toadie, Dee Dee, Nishi, Dignity, Coochi Snorcher, Cooter, Labbe, Gladys Seagelman, VA, Wee wee, Horsespot, Nappy Dugout, Mongo, Ghoulie, Powderbox, a Mimi in Miami, a Split Knish in Philadelphia ...(Laughter)and a Schmende in the Bronx.(Laughter)I am worried about vaginas. This is how the \"Vagina Monologues\" begins. But it really didn't begin there. It began with a conversation with a woman. We were having a conversation about menopause, and we got onto the subject of her vagina, which you'll do if you're talking about menopause. And she said things that really shocked me about her vagina \u2014 that it was dried-up and finished and dead \u2014 and I was kind of shocked. So I said to a friend casually, \"Well, what do you think about your vagina?\" And that woman said something more amazing, and then the next woman said something more amazing, and before I knew it, every woman was telling me I had to talk to somebody about their vagina because they had an amazing story, and I was sucked down the vagina trail.(Laughter)And I really haven't gotten off of it. I think if you had told me when I was younger that I was going to grow up, and be in shoe stores, and people would scream out, \"There she is, the Vagina Lady!\" I don't know that that would have been my life ambition.(Laughter)But I want to talk a little bit about happiness, and the relationship to this whole vagina journey, because it has been an extraordinary journey that began eight years ago. I think before I did the \"Vagina Monologues,\" I didn't really believe in happiness. I thought that only idiots were happy, to be honest. I remember when I started practicing Buddhism 14 years ago, and I was told that the end of this practice was to be happy, I said, \"How could you be happy and live in this world of suffering and live in this world of pain?\" I mistook happiness for a lot of other things, like numbness or decadence or selfishness. And what happened through the course of the \"Vagina Monologues\" and this journey is, I think I have come to understand a little bit more about happiness.There are three qualities I want to talk about. One is seeing what's right in front of you, and talking about it, and stating it. I think what I learned from talking about the vagina and speaking about the vagina, is it was the most obvious thing \u2014 it was right in the center of my body and the center of the world \u2014 and yet it was the one thing nobody talked about. The second thing is that what talking about the vagina did is it opened this door which allowed me to see that there was a way to serve the world to make it better. And that's where the deepest happiness has actually come from. And the third principle of happiness, which I've realized recently:Eight years ago, this momentum and this energy, this \"V-wave\" started \u2014 and I can only describe it as a \"V-wave\" because, to be honest, I really don't understand it completely; I feel at the service of it. But this wave started, and if I question the wave, or try to stop the wave or look back at the wave, I often have the experience of whiplash or the potential of my neck breaking. But if I go with the wave, and I trust the wave and I move with the wave, I go to the next place, and it happens logically and organically and truthfully. And I started this piece, particularly with stories and narratives, and I was talking to one woman and that led to another woman and that led to another woman. And then I wrote those stories down, and I put them out in front of other people.And every single time I did the show at the beginning, women would literally line up after the show, because they wanted to tell me their stories. And at first I thought, \"Oh great, I'll hear about wonderful orgasms, and great sex lives, and how women love their vaginas.\" But in fact, that's not what women lined up to tell me. What women lined up to tell me was how they were raped, and how they were battered, and how they were beaten, and how they were gang-raped in parking lots, and how they were incested by their uncles. And I wanted to stop doing the \"Vagina Monologues,\" because it felt too daunting. I felt like a war photographer who takes pictures of terrible events, but doesn't intervene on their behalf.And so in 1997, I said, \"Let's get women together. What could we do with this information that all these women are being violated?\" And it turned out, after thinking and investigating, that I discovered \u2014 and the UN has actually said this recently \u2014 that one out of every three women on this planet will be beaten or raped in her lifetime. That's essentially a gender; that's essentially the resource of the planet, which is women. So in 1997 we got all these incredible women together and we said, \"How can we use the play, this energy, to stop violence against women?\" And we put on one event in New York City, in the theater, and all these great actors came \u2014 from Susan Sarandon, to Glenn Close, to Whoopi Goldberg \u2014 and we did one performance on one evening, and that catalyzed this wave, this energy.And within five years, this extraordinary thing began to happen. One woman took that energy and she said, \"I want to bring this wave, this energy, to college campuses,\" and so she took the play and she said, \"Let's use the play and have performances once a year, where we can raise money to stop violence against women in local communities all around the world.\" And in one year, it went to 50 colleges, and then it expanded. And over the course of the last six years, it's spread and it's spread and it's spread around the world.What I have learned is two things: one, that the epidemic of violence towards women is shocking; it's global; it is so profound and it is so devastating, and it is so in every little pocket of every little crater, of every little society that we don't even recognize it, because it's become ordinary. This journey has taken me to Afghanistan, where I had the extraordinary honor and privilege to go into parts of Afghanistan under the Taliban. I was dressed in a burqa and I went in with an extraordinary group, called the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan. And I saw firsthand how women had been stripped of every single right that was possible to strip women of \u2014 from being educated, to being employed, to being actually allowed to eat ice cream. For those of you who don't know, it was illegal to eat ice cream under the Taliban. And I actually saw and met women who had been flogged for being caught eating vanilla ice cream. I was taken to the secret ice cream-eating place in a little town, where we went to a back room, and women were seated and a curtain was pulled around us, and they were served vanilla ice cream. And women lifted their burqas and ate this ice cream. And I don't think I ever understood pleasure until that moment, and how women have found a way to keep their pleasure alive.It has taken me, this journey, to Islamabad, where I have witnessed and met women with their faces melted off. It has taken me to Juarez, Mexico, where I was a week ago, where I have literally been there in parking lots, where bones of women have washed up and been dumped next to Coca-Cola bottles. It has taken me to universities all over this country, where girls are date-raped and drugged. I have seen terrible, terrible, terrible violence. But I have also recognized, in the course of seeing that violence, that being in the face of things and seeing actually what's in front of us is the antidote to depression, and to a feeling that one is worthless and has no value.Because before the \"Vagina Monologues,\" I will say that 80 percent of my consciousness was closed off to what was really going on in this reality, and that closing-off closed off my vitality and my life energy. What has also happened is in the course of these travels \u2014 and it's been an extraordinary thing \u2014 is that every single place that I have gone to in the world, I have met a new species. And I really love hearing about all these species at the bottom of the sea. And I was thinking about how being with these extraordinary people on this particular panel, that it's beneath, beyond and between, and the vagina kind of fits into all those categories.(Laughter)But one of the things I've seen is this species \u2014 and it is a species, and it is a new paradigm, and it doesn't get reported in the press or in the media because I don't think good news ever is news, and I don't think people who are transforming the planet are what gets the ratings on TV shows. But every single country I have been to \u2014 and in the last six years, I've been to about 45 countries, and many tiny little villages and cities and towns \u2014 I have seen something what I've come to call \"vagina warriors.\" A \"vagina warrior\" is a woman, or a vagina-friendly man, who has witnessed incredible violence or suffered it, and rather than getting an AK-47 or a weapon of mass destruction or a machete, they hold the violence in their bodies; they grieve it; they experience it; and then they go out and devote their lives to making sure it doesn't happen to anybody else.I have met these women everywhere on the planet, and I want to tell a few stories, because I believe that stories are the way that we transmit information, where it goes into our bodies. And I think one of the things about being at TED that's been very interesting is that I live in my body a lot, and I don't live in my head very much anymore. And this is a very heady place. And it's been really interesting to be in my head for the last two days; I've been very disoriented \u2014(Laughter)because I think the world, the V-world, is very much in your body. It's a body world, and the species really exists in the body. And I think there's a real significance in us attaching our bodies to our heads, that that separation has created a divide that is often separating purpose from intent. And the connection between body and head often brings those things into union.I want to talk about three particular people that I've met, vagina warriors, who really transformed my understanding of this whole principle and species, and one is a woman named Marsha Lopez. Marsha Lopez was a woman I met in Guatemala. She was 14 years old, and she was in a marriage and her husband was beating her on a regular basis. And she couldn't get out, because she was addicted to the relationship, and she had no money. Her sister was younger than her, and she applied \u2014 we had a \"Stop Rape\" contest a few years ago in New York \u2014 and she applied, hoping that she would become a finalist and she could bring her sister. She did become a finalist; she brought Marsha to New York.And at that time, we did this extraordinary V-Day at Madison Square Garden, where we sold out the entire testosterone-filled dome \u2014 18,000 people standing up to say \"Yes\" to vaginas, which was really a pretty incredible transformation. And she came, and she witnessed this, and she decided that she would go back and leave her husband, and that she would bring V-Day to Guatemala. She was 21 years old. I went to Guatemala and she had sold out the National Theater of Guatemala. And I watched her walk up on stage in her red short dress and high heels, and she stood there and said, \"My name is Marsha. I was beaten by my husband for five years. He almost murdered me. I left and you can, too.\" And the entire 2,000 people went absolutely crazy.There's a woman named Esther Ch\u00e1vez who I met in Juarez, Mexico. And Esther Ch\u00e1vez was a brilliant accountant in Mexico City. She was 72 years old and she was planning to retire. She went to Juarez to take care of an ailing aunt, and in the course of it, she began to discover what was happening to the murdered and disappeared women of Juarez. She gave up her life; she moved to Juarez. She started to write the stories which documented the disappeared women. 300 women have disappeared in a border town because they're brown and poor. There has been no response to the disappearance, and not one person has been held accountable. She began to document it. She opened a center called Casa Amiga, and in six years, she has literally brought this to the consciousness of the world. We were there a week ago, when there were 7,000 people in the street, and it was truly a miracle. And as we walked through the streets, the people of Juarez, who normally don't even come into the streets, because the streets are so dangerous, literally stood there and wept, to see that other people from the world had showed up for that particular community.There's another woman, named Agnes. And Agnes, for me, epitomizes what a vagina warrior is. I met her three years ago in Kenya. And Agnes was mutilated as a little girl; she was circumcised against her will when she was 10 years old, and she really made a decision that she didn't want this practice to continue anymore in her community. So when she got older, she created this incredible thing: it's an anatomical sculpture of a woman's body, half a woman's body. And she walked through the Rift Valley, and she had vagina and vagina replacement parts, where she would teach girls and parents and boys and girls what a healthy vagina looks like, and what a mutilated vagina looks like.And in the course of her travel \u2014 she walked literally for eight years through the Rift Valley, through dust, through sleeping on the ground, because the Maasai are nomads, and she would have to find them, and they would move, and she would find them again \u2014 she saved 1,500 girls from being cut.And in that time, she created an alternative ritual, which involved girls coming of age without the cut. When we met her three years ago, we said, \"What could V-Day do for you?\" And she said, \"Well, if you got me a jeep, I could get around a lot faster.\"(Laughter)So we bought her a jeep. And in the year that she had the jeep, she saved 4,500 girls from being cut. So we said to her, \"What else could we do for you?\" She said, \"Well, Eve, if you gave me some money, I could open a house and girls could run away, and they could be saved.\" And I want to tell this little story about my own beginnings, because it's very interrelated to happiness and Agnes.When I was a little girl \u2014 I grew up in a wealthy community; it was an upper-middle class white community, and it had all the trappings and the looks of a perfectly nice, wonderful, great life. And everyone was supposed to be happy in that community, and, in fact, my life was hell. I lived with an alcoholic father who beat me and molested me, and it was all inside that. And always as a child I had this fantasy that somebody would come and rescue me. And I actually made up a little character whose name was Mr. Alligator. I would call him up when things got really bad, and say it was time to come and pick me up. And I would pack a little bag and wait for Mr. Alligator to come.Now, Mr. Alligator never did come, but the idea of Mr. Alligator coming actually saved my sanity and made it OK for me to keep going, because I believed, in the distance, there would be someone coming to rescue me.Cut to 40-some odd years later, we go to Kenya, and we're walking, we arrive at the opening of this house. And Agnes hadn't let me come to the house for days, because they were preparing this whole ritual.I want to tell you a great story. When Agnes first started fighting to stop female genital mutilation in her community, she had become an outcast, and she was exiled and slandered, and the whole community turned against her. But being a vagina warrior, she kept going, and she kept committing herself to transforming consciousness. And in the Maasai community, goats and cows are the most valued possession. They're like the Mercedes-Benz of the Rift Valley. And she said two days before the house opened, two different people arrived to give her a goat each, and she said to me, \"I knew then that female genital mutilation would end one day in Africa.\"Anyway, we arrived, and when we arrived, there were hundreds of girls dressed in red homemade dresses \u2014 which is the color of the Maasai and the color of V-Day \u2014 and they greeted us. They had made up these songs that they were singing, about the end of suffering and the end of mutilation, and they walked us down the path. It was a gorgeous day in the African sun, and the dust was flying and the girls were dancing, and there was this house, and it said, \"V-Day Safe House for the Girls.\"And it hit me in that moment that it had taken 47 years, but that Mr. Alligator had finally shown up. And he had shown up, obviously, in a form that it took me a long time to understand, which is that when we give in the world what we want the most, we heal the broken part inside each of us.And I feel, in the last eight years, that this journey \u2014 this miraculous vagina journey \u2014 has taught me this really simple thing, which is that happiness exists in action; it exists in telling the truth and saying what your truth is; and it exists in giving away what you want the most. And I feel that knowledge and that journey has been an extraordinary privilege, and I feel really blessed to have been here today to communicate that to you.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 64,

00:00:18.232\nI was worried.\n\n00:00:19.115 --> 00:00:20.787\nThat's why I began this piece.\n\n00:00:20.811 --> 00:00:23.799\nI was worried about vaginas.\n\n00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:26.934\nI was worried what we think about vaginas\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:30.200\nand even more worried\nthat we don't think about them.\n\n00:00:30.612 --> 00:00:32.787\nI was worried about my own vagina.\n\n00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:37.243\nIt needed a context, a culture,\na community of other vaginas.\n\n00:00:37.973 --> 00:00:41.678\nThere is so much darkness\nand secrecy surrounding them.\n\n00:00:41.702 --> 00:00:46.350\nLike the Bermuda Triangle,\nnobody ever reports back from there.\n\n00:00:46.374 --> 00:00:47.476\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.293\nIn the first place, it's not so easy\nto even find your vagina.\n\n00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:54.626\nWomen go days, weeks, months,\nwithout looking at it.\n\n00:00:55.094 --> 00:00:57.419\nI interviewed a high-powered\nbusinesswoman;\n\n00:00:57.443 --> 00:00:59.935\nshe told me she didn't have time.\n\n00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:02.813\n\"Looking at your vagina,\"\nshe said, \"is a full day's work.\"\n\n00:01:02.837 --> 00:01:03.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:07.054\n\"You've got to get down there\non your back, in front of a mirror,\n\n00:01:07.078 --> 00:01:08.377\nfull-length preferred.\n\n00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:11.503\nYou've got to get in the perfect position\nwith the perfect light,\n\n00:01:11.527 --> 00:01:13.934\nwhich then becomes shadowed\nby the angle you're at.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:17.169\nYou're twisting your head up,\narching your back, it's exhausting.\"\n\n00:01:17.193 --> 00:01:19.312\nShe was busy; she didn't have time.\n\n00:01:19.836 --> 00:01:22.661\nSo I decided to talk to women\nabout their vaginas.\n\n00:01:23.026 --> 00:01:25.994\nThey began as casual vagina interviews,\n\n00:01:26.018 --> 00:01:28.698\nand they turned into vagina monologues.\n\n00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:30.942\nI talked with over 200 women.\n\n00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:33.367\nI talked to older women, younger women,\n\n00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:36.097\nmarried women, lesbians, single women.\n\n00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:40.934\nI talked to corporate professionals,\ncollege professors, actors, sex workers.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:44.465\nI talked to African-American women,\nAsian-American women,\n\n00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:48.347\nNative-American women,\nCaucasian women, Jewish women.\n\n00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.550\nOK, at first women were a little shy,\na little reluctant to talk.\n\n00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.682\nOnce they got going,\nyou couldn't stop them.\n\n00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.416\nWomen love to talk\nabout their vaginas, they do.\n\n00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.518\nMainly because no one's ever\nasked them before.\n\n00:02:03.542 --> 00:02:04.612\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:04.636 --> 00:02:09.543\nLet's just start with the word\n\"vagina\" -- vagina, vagina.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.153\nIt sounds like an infection, at best.\n\n00:02:12.838 --> 00:02:14.534\nMaybe a medical instrument.\n\n00:02:14.558 --> 00:02:16.318\n\"Hurry, nurse, bring the vagina!\"\n\n00:02:16.342 --> 00:02:17.403\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:17.427 --> 00:02:18.998\nVagina, vagina, vagina.\n\n00:02:19.022 --> 00:02:21.561\nIt doesn't matter how many times\nyou say the word,\n\n00:02:21.585 --> 00:02:23.934\nit never sounds like a word\nyou want to say.\n\n00:02:24.265 --> 00:02:28.440\nIt's a completely ridiculous,\ntotally un-sexy word.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.029\nIf you use it during sex,\ntrying to be politically correct,\n\n00:02:32.053 --> 00:02:35.264\n\"Darling, would you stroke my vagina,\"\n\n00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:37.381\nyou kill the act right there.\n\n00:02:37.405 --> 00:02:39.075\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.397\nI'm worried what we call them\nand don't call them.\n\n00:02:42.775 --> 00:02:45.509\nIn Great Neck, New York,\nthey call it a Pussycat.\n\n00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:47.934\nA woman told me there\nher mother used to tell her,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.366\n\"Don't wear panties, dear,\nunderneath your pajamas.\n\n00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.176\nYou need to air out your Pussycat.\"\n\n00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.648\nIn Westchester, they call it a Pooki,\n\n00:02:58.672 --> 00:03:00.472\nin New Jersey, a twat.\n\n00:03:00.836 --> 00:03:05.146\nThere's Powderbox, derriere,\na Pooky, a Poochi, a Poopi,\n\n00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.645\na Poopelu, a Pooninana,\na Padepachetchki, a Pal, and a Piche.\n\n00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:11.121\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:11.145 --> 00:03:16.545\nThere's Toadie, Dee Dee, Nishi,\nDignity, Coochi Snorcher,\n\n00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.415\nCooter, Labbe, Gladys Seagelman, VA,\n\n00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:25.934\nWee wee, Horsespot, Nappy Dugout,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:32.164\nMongo, Ghoulie, Powderbox,\na Mimi in Miami,\n\n00:03:32.188 --> 00:03:34.295\na Split Knish in Philadelphia ...\n\n00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:35.406\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.316\nand a Schmende in the Bronx.\n\n00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.532\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:38.556 --> 00:03:40.505\nI am worried about vaginas.\n\n00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:43.806\nThis is how the \"Vagina\nMonologues\" begins.\n\n00:03:44.402 --> 00:03:47.008\nBut it really didn't begin there.\n\n00:03:47.032 --> 00:03:50.356\nIt began with a conversation with a woman.\n\n00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:53.170\nWe were having a conversation\nabout menopause,\n\n00:03:53.194 --> 00:03:55.225\nand we got onto the subject of her vagina,\n\n00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:57.598\nwhich you'll do if you're\ntalking about menopause.\n\n00:03:57.622 --> 00:04:00.560\nAnd she said things that really\nshocked me about her vagina --\n\n00:04:00.584 --> 00:04:02.703\nthat it was dried-up\nand finished and dead --\n\n00:04:02.727 --> 00:04:03.980\nand I was kind of shocked.\n\n00:04:04.004 --> 00:04:05.678\nSo I said to a friend casually,\n\n00:04:05.702 --> 00:04:07.756\n\"Well, what do you think\nabout your vagina?\"\n\n00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.798\nAnd that woman said\nsomething more amazing,\n\n00:04:09.822 --> 00:04:12.256\nand then the next woman said\nsomething more amazing,\n\n00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.524\nand before I knew it,\nevery woman was telling me\n\n00:04:14.548 --> 00:04:16.625\nI had to talk to somebody\nabout their vagina\n\n00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.276\nbecause they had an amazing story,\n\n00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.183\nand I was sucked down the vagina trail.\n\n00:04:20.207 --> 00:04:21.517\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:21.541 --> 00:04:23.974\nAnd I really haven't gotten off of it.\n\n00:04:23.998 --> 00:04:26.106\nI think if you had told me\nwhen I was younger\n\n00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.518\nthat I was going to grow up,\nand be in shoe stores,\n\n00:04:28.542 --> 00:04:31.408\nand people would scream out,\n\"There she is, the Vagina Lady!\"\n\n00:04:31.432 --> 00:04:34.069\nI don't know that that would have\nbeen my life ambition.\n\n00:04:34.093 --> 00:04:35.096\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.367\nBut I want to talk a little bit\nabout happiness,\n\n00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:39.744\nand the relationship\nto this whole vagina journey,\n\n00:04:39.768 --> 00:04:41.848\nbecause it has been\nan extraordinary journey\n\n00:04:41.872 --> 00:04:43.564\nthat began eight years ago.\n\n00:04:43.588 --> 00:04:45.854\nI think before I did\nthe \"Vagina Monologues,\"\n\n00:04:45.878 --> 00:04:48.682\nI didn't really believe in happiness.\n\n00:04:48.706 --> 00:04:51.732\nI thought that only idiots\nwere happy, to be honest.\n\n00:04:51.756 --> 00:04:55.550\nI remember when I started\npracticing Buddhism 14 years ago,\n\n00:04:55.574 --> 00:04:58.777\nand I was told that the end\nof this practice was to be happy,\n\n00:04:58.801 --> 00:05:02.149\nI said, \"How could you be happy\nand live in this world of suffering\n\n00:05:02.173 --> 00:05:03.985\nand live in this world of pain?\"\n\n00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.934\nI mistook happiness\nfor a lot of other things,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:11.236\nlike numbness or decadence or selfishness.\n\n00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:14.648\nAnd what happened through the course\nof the \"Vagina Monologues\"\n\n00:05:14.672 --> 00:05:17.209\nand this journey is,\nI think I have come to understand\n\n00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:19.472\na little bit more about happiness.\n\n00:05:19.496 --> 00:05:21.934\nThere are three qualities\nI want to talk about.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:25.871\nOne is seeing what's\nright in front of you,\n\n00:05:25.895 --> 00:05:28.353\nand talking about it, and stating it.\n\n00:05:28.377 --> 00:05:30.934\nI think what I learned\nfrom talking about the vagina\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.101\nand speaking about the vagina,\nis it was the most obvious thing --\n\n00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:37.364\nit was right in the center of my body\nand the center of the world --\n\n00:05:37.388 --> 00:05:40.164\nand yet it was the one thing\nnobody talked about.\n\n00:05:40.188 --> 00:05:44.441\nThe second thing is that what talking\nabout the vagina did\n\n00:05:44.465 --> 00:05:47.376\nis it opened this door\nwhich allowed me to see\n\n00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.421\nthat there was a way to serve\nthe world to make it better.\n\n00:05:50.445 --> 00:05:53.934\nAnd that's where the deepest happiness\nhas actually come from.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:57.665\nAnd the third principle of happiness,\nwhich I've realized recently:\n\n00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:01.934\nEight years ago, this momentum\nand this energy, this \"V-wave\" started --\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:05.188\nand I can only describe it\nas a \"V-wave\" because, to be honest,\n\n00:06:05.212 --> 00:06:08.934\nI really don't understand it completely;\nI feel at the service of it.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.934\nBut this wave started,\nand if I question the wave,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:15.396\nor try to stop the wave\nor look back at the wave,\n\n00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.934\nI often have the experience of whiplash\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.210\nor the potential of my neck breaking.\n\n00:06:20.234 --> 00:06:21.584\nBut if I go with the wave,\n\n00:06:21.608 --> 00:06:24.002\nand I trust the wave\nand I move with the wave,\n\n00:06:24.026 --> 00:06:28.533\nI go to the next place, and it happens\nlogically and organically and truthfully.\n\n00:06:28.557 --> 00:06:34.259\nAnd I started this piece, particularly\nwith stories and narratives,\n\n00:06:34.283 --> 00:06:37.117\nand I was talking to one woman\nand that led to another woman\n\n00:06:37.141 --> 00:06:38.959\nand that led to another woman.\n\n00:06:38.983 --> 00:06:40.828\nAnd then I wrote those stories down,\n\n00:06:40.852 --> 00:06:43.054\nand I put them out\nin front of other people.\n\n00:06:43.078 --> 00:06:45.650\nAnd every single time\nI did the show at the beginning,\n\n00:06:45.674 --> 00:06:48.352\nwomen would literally\nline up after the show,\n\n00:06:48.376 --> 00:06:50.611\nbecause they wanted\nto tell me their stories.\n\n00:06:50.635 --> 00:06:53.945\nAnd at first I thought, \"Oh great,\nI'll hear about wonderful orgasms,\n\n00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:56.571\nand great sex lives, and how women\nlove their vaginas.\"\n\n00:06:56.595 --> 00:06:59.934\nBut in fact, that's not\nwhat women lined up to tell me.\n\n00:07:00.268 --> 00:07:03.360\nWhat women lined up to tell me\nwas how they were raped,\n\n00:07:03.384 --> 00:07:05.862\nand how they were battered,\nand how they were beaten,\n\n00:07:05.886 --> 00:07:08.044\nand how they were gang-raped\nin parking lots,\n\n00:07:08.068 --> 00:07:10.089\nand how they were incested\nby their uncles.\n\n00:07:10.113 --> 00:07:12.811\nAnd I wanted to stop doing\nthe \"Vagina Monologues,\"\n\n00:07:12.835 --> 00:07:14.240\nbecause it felt too daunting.\n\n00:07:14.264 --> 00:07:17.731\nI felt like a war photographer\nwho takes pictures of terrible events,\n\n00:07:17.755 --> 00:07:20.114\nbut doesn't intervene on their behalf.\n\n00:07:20.138 --> 00:07:24.355\nAnd so in 1997, I said,\n\"Let's get women together.\n\n00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:26.555\nWhat could we do with this information\n\n00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:29.123\nthat all these women are being violated?\"\n\n00:07:29.495 --> 00:07:32.680\nAnd it turned out, after thinking\nand investigating,\n\n00:07:32.704 --> 00:07:36.101\nthat I discovered -- and the UN\nhas actually said this recently --\n\n00:07:36.125 --> 00:07:38.934\nthat one out of every three\nwomen on this planet\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.538\nwill be beaten or raped in her lifetime.\n\n00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:43.625\nThat's essentially a gender;\n\n00:07:43.649 --> 00:07:47.044\nthat's essentially the resource\nof the planet, which is women.\n\n00:07:47.068 --> 00:07:50.240\nSo in 1997 we got all these incredible\nwomen together and we said,\n\n00:07:50.264 --> 00:07:54.379\n\"How can we use the play, this energy,\nto stop violence against women?\"\n\n00:07:54.729 --> 00:07:57.404\nAnd we put on one event\nin New York City, in the theater,\n\n00:07:57.428 --> 00:08:00.019\nand all these great actors\ncame -- from Susan Sarandon,\n\n00:08:00.043 --> 00:08:01.853\nto Glenn Close, to Whoopi Goldberg --\n\n00:08:01.877 --> 00:08:04.717\nand we did one performance on one evening,\n\n00:08:04.741 --> 00:08:08.596\nand that catalyzed this wave, this energy.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.009\nAnd within five years,\n\n00:08:11.033 --> 00:08:13.498\nthis extraordinary thing began to happen.\n\n00:08:13.522 --> 00:08:16.934\nOne woman took that energy and she said,\n\"I want to bring this wave,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.523\nthis energy, to college campuses,\"\n\n00:08:19.547 --> 00:08:21.565\nand so she took the play and she said,\n\n00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:24.762\n\"Let's use the play and have\nperformances once a year,\n\n00:08:24.786 --> 00:08:27.375\nwhere we can raise money\nto stop violence against women\n\n00:08:27.399 --> 00:08:29.609\nin local communities\nall around the world.\"\n\n00:08:29.633 --> 00:08:32.792\nAnd in one year, it went to 50 colleges,\nand then it expanded.\n\n00:08:33.125 --> 00:08:35.405\nAnd over the course of the last six years,\n\n00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:38.705\nit's spread and it's spread\nand it's spread around the world.\n\n00:08:39.348 --> 00:08:42.939\nWhat I have learned is two things:\n\n00:08:42.963 --> 00:08:48.934\none, that the epidemic of violence\ntowards women is shocking; it's global;\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.006\nit is so profound\nand it is so devastating,\n\n00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.934\nand it is so in every little pocket\nof every little crater,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.625\nof every little society\nthat we don't even recognize it,\n\n00:08:56.649 --> 00:08:58.149\nbecause it's become ordinary.\n\n00:08:58.812 --> 00:09:01.713\nThis journey has taken me to Afghanistan,\n\n00:09:01.737 --> 00:09:04.466\nwhere I had the extraordinary\nhonor and privilege\n\n00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:08.815\nto go into parts of Afghanistan\nunder the Taliban.\n\n00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:12.483\nI was dressed in a burqa and I went in\nwith an extraordinary group,\n\n00:09:12.507 --> 00:09:15.876\ncalled the Revolutionary Association\nof the Women of Afghanistan.\n\n00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.934\nAnd I saw firsthand\nhow women had been stripped\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:23.123\nof every single right that was possible\nto strip women of --\n\n00:09:23.147 --> 00:09:25.654\nfrom being educated, to being employed,\n\n00:09:25.678 --> 00:09:28.304\nto being actually allowed\nto eat ice cream.\n\n00:09:28.681 --> 00:09:30.222\nFor those of you who don't know,\n\n00:09:30.246 --> 00:09:32.594\nit was illegal to eat ice cream\nunder the Taliban.\n\n00:09:32.618 --> 00:09:36.394\nAnd I actually saw and met\nwomen who had been flogged\n\n00:09:36.418 --> 00:09:38.729\nfor being caught eating vanilla ice cream.\n\n00:09:38.753 --> 00:09:43.155\nI was taken to the secret ice cream-eating\nplace in a little town,\n\n00:09:43.179 --> 00:09:46.022\nwhere we went to a back room,\nand women were seated\n\n00:09:46.046 --> 00:09:49.778\nand a curtain was pulled around us,\nand they were served vanilla ice cream.\n\n00:09:49.802 --> 00:09:53.218\nAnd women lifted their burqas\nand ate this ice cream.\n\n00:09:53.242 --> 00:09:56.362\nAnd I don't think I ever understood\npleasure until that moment,\n\n00:09:56.386 --> 00:09:59.934\nand how women have found a way\nto keep their pleasure alive.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.506\nIt has taken me, this journey,\nto Islamabad,\n\n00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:06.167\nwhere I have witnessed and met women\nwith their faces melted off.\n\n00:10:06.191 --> 00:10:10.043\nIt has taken me to Juarez, Mexico,\nwhere I was a week ago,\n\n00:10:10.067 --> 00:10:12.688\nwhere I have literally been\nthere in parking lots,\n\n00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:14.561\nwhere bones of women have washed up\n\n00:10:14.585 --> 00:10:18.154\nand been dumped next to Coca-Cola bottles.\n\n00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.633\nIt has taken me to universities\nall over this country,\n\n00:10:21.657 --> 00:10:24.149\nwhere girls are date-raped and drugged.\n\n00:10:24.173 --> 00:10:27.934\nI have seen terrible, terrible,\nterrible violence.\n\n00:10:28.334 --> 00:10:32.237\nBut I have also recognized,\nin the course of seeing that violence,\n\n00:10:32.261 --> 00:10:36.879\nthat being in the face of things\nand seeing actually what's in front of us\n\n00:10:36.903 --> 00:10:39.739\nis the antidote to depression,\n\n00:10:39.763 --> 00:10:42.934\nand to a feeling that one\nis worthless and has no value.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.934\nBecause before the \"Vagina Monologues,\"\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.934\nI will say that 80 percent\nof my consciousness was closed off\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.792\nto what was really going on\nin this reality,\n\n00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:55.138\nand that closing-off closed off\nmy vitality and my life energy.\n\n00:10:55.665 --> 00:10:58.475\nWhat has also happened\nis in the course of these travels --\n\n00:10:58.499 --> 00:11:01.031\nand it's been an extraordinary thing --\n\n00:11:01.055 --> 00:11:03.945\nis that every single place\nthat I have gone to in the world,\n\n00:11:03.969 --> 00:11:05.381\nI have met a new species.\n\n00:11:05.405 --> 00:11:09.119\nAnd I really love hearing about all\nthese species at the bottom of the sea.\n\n00:11:09.143 --> 00:11:12.502\nAnd I was thinking about how being\nwith these extraordinary people\n\n00:11:12.526 --> 00:11:14.160\non this particular panel,\n\n00:11:14.184 --> 00:11:16.934\nthat it's beneath, beyond and between,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.934\nand the vagina kind of fits\ninto all those categories.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.420\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:21.444 --> 00:11:23.934\nBut one of the things\nI've seen is this species --\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.933\nand it is a species,\nand it is a new paradigm,\n\n00:11:26.957 --> 00:11:29.591\nand it doesn't get reported\nin the press or in the media\n\n00:11:29.615 --> 00:11:32.653\nbecause I don't think\ngood news ever is news,\n\n00:11:32.677 --> 00:11:35.320\nand I don't think people\nwho are transforming the planet\n\n00:11:35.344 --> 00:11:38.225\nare what gets the ratings on TV shows.\n\n00:11:38.249 --> 00:11:40.273\nBut every single country I have been to --\n\n00:11:40.297 --> 00:11:43.202\nand in the last six years,\nI've been to about 45 countries,\n\n00:11:43.226 --> 00:11:46.280\nand many tiny little villages\nand cities and towns --\n\n00:11:46.304 --> 00:11:50.052\nI have seen something what I've come\nto call \"vagina warriors.\"\n\n00:11:50.076 --> 00:11:54.251\nA \"vagina warrior\" is a woman,\nor a vagina-friendly man,\n\n00:11:54.275 --> 00:11:57.869\nwho has witnessed incredible\nviolence or suffered it,\n\n00:11:57.893 --> 00:12:02.264\nand rather than getting an AK-47\nor a weapon of mass destruction\n\n00:12:02.288 --> 00:12:04.728\nor a machete,\n\n00:12:04.752 --> 00:12:07.489\nthey hold the violence in their bodies;\n\n00:12:07.513 --> 00:12:11.617\nthey grieve it; they experience it;\nand then they go out\n\n00:12:11.641 --> 00:12:15.874\nand devote their lives to making sure\nit doesn't happen to anybody else.\n\n00:12:15.898 --> 00:12:18.618\nI have met these women\neverywhere on the planet,\n\n00:12:18.642 --> 00:12:20.404\nand I want to tell a few stories,\n\n00:12:20.428 --> 00:12:23.934\nbecause I believe that stories are the way\nthat we transmit information,\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.151\nwhere it goes into our bodies.\n\n00:12:26.175 --> 00:12:30.142\nAnd I think one of the things about being\nat TED that's been very interesting\n\n00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:32.076\nis that I live in my body a lot,\n\n00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.342\nand I don't live in my head\nvery much anymore.\n\n00:12:34.366 --> 00:12:36.175\nAnd this is a very heady place.\n\n00:12:36.199 --> 00:12:38.645\nAnd it's been really interesting\nto be in my head\n\n00:12:38.669 --> 00:12:41.387\nfor the last two days;\nI've been very disoriented --\n\n00:12:41.411 --> 00:12:42.412\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:42.436 --> 00:12:45.934\nbecause I think the world, the V-world,\nis very much in your body.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:49.786\nIt's a body world, and the species\nreally exists in the body.\n\n00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:54.119\nAnd I think there's a real significance\nin us attaching our bodies to our heads,\n\n00:12:54.143 --> 00:12:57.249\nthat that separation has created a divide\n\n00:12:57.273 --> 00:13:00.779\nthat is often separating\npurpose from intent.\n\n00:13:00.803 --> 00:13:03.949\nAnd the connection between body and head\n\n00:13:03.973 --> 00:13:06.217\noften brings those things into union.\n\n00:13:06.693 --> 00:13:09.740\nI want to talk about three\nparticular people that I've met,\n\n00:13:09.764 --> 00:13:13.313\nvagina warriors, who really\ntransformed my understanding\n\n00:13:13.337 --> 00:13:15.297\nof this whole principle and species,\n\n00:13:15.321 --> 00:13:17.661\nand one is a woman named Marsha Lopez.\n\n00:13:18.209 --> 00:13:21.270\nMarsha Lopez was a woman\nI met in Guatemala.\n\n00:13:21.294 --> 00:13:24.322\nShe was 14 years old,\nand she was in a marriage\n\n00:13:24.346 --> 00:13:27.346\nand her husband was beating her\non a regular basis.\n\n00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:28.839\nAnd she couldn't get out,\n\n00:13:28.863 --> 00:13:30.981\nbecause she was addicted\nto the relationship,\n\n00:13:31.005 --> 00:13:32.283\nand she had no money.\n\n00:13:32.307 --> 00:13:34.776\nHer sister was younger than her,\nand she applied --\n\n00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.934\nwe had a \"Stop Rape\" contest\na few years ago in New York --\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.934\nand she applied, hoping\nthat she would become a finalist\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.800\nand she could bring her sister.\n\n00:13:43.824 --> 00:13:47.934\nShe did become a finalist;\nshe brought Marsha to New York.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.203\nAnd at that time,\n\n00:13:49.227 --> 00:13:51.918\nwe did this extraordinary V-Day\nat Madison Square Garden,\n\n00:13:51.942 --> 00:13:55.003\nwhere we sold out the entire\ntestosterone-filled dome --\n\n00:13:55.027 --> 00:13:58.614\n18,000 people standing up\nto say \"Yes\" to vaginas,\n\n00:13:58.638 --> 00:14:01.372\nwhich was really a pretty\nincredible transformation.\n\n00:14:01.396 --> 00:14:03.215\nAnd she came, and she witnessed this,\n\n00:14:03.239 --> 00:14:06.325\nand she decided that she would go back\nand leave her husband,\n\n00:14:06.349 --> 00:14:08.412\nand that she would bring\nV-Day to Guatemala.\n\n00:14:08.436 --> 00:14:10.009\nShe was 21 years old.\n\n00:14:10.033 --> 00:14:15.227\nI went to Guatemala and she had sold out\nthe National Theater of Guatemala.\n\n00:14:15.251 --> 00:14:19.685\nAnd I watched her walk up on stage\nin her red short dress and high heels,\n\n00:14:19.709 --> 00:14:23.190\nand she stood there and said,\n\"My name is Marsha.\n\n00:14:23.214 --> 00:14:26.975\nI was beaten by my husband for five years.\nHe almost murdered me.\n\n00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:29.156\nI left and you can, too.\"\n\n00:14:29.514 --> 00:14:32.760\nAnd the entire 2,000 people\nwent absolutely crazy.\n\n00:14:33.283 --> 00:14:36.775\nThere's a woman named Esther Ch\u00e1vez\nwho I met in Juarez, Mexico.\n\n00:14:36.799 --> 00:14:40.034\nAnd Esther Ch\u00e1vez was\na brilliant accountant in Mexico City.\n\n00:14:40.058 --> 00:14:43.113\nShe was 72 years old\nand she was planning to retire.\n\n00:14:43.485 --> 00:14:47.059\nShe went to Juarez\nto take care of an ailing aunt,\n\n00:14:47.083 --> 00:14:50.155\nand in the course of it, she began\nto discover what was happening\n\n00:14:50.179 --> 00:14:53.548\nto the murdered and disappeared\nwomen of Juarez.\n\n00:14:53.572 --> 00:14:56.294\nShe gave up her life; she moved to Juarez.\n\n00:14:56.318 --> 00:15:00.411\nShe started to write the stories\nwhich documented the disappeared women.\n\n00:15:00.435 --> 00:15:04.050\n300 women have disappeared in a border\ntown because they're brown and poor.\n\n00:15:04.074 --> 00:15:06.336\nThere has been no response\nto the disappearance,\n\n00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.597\nand not one person\nhas been held accountable.\n\n00:15:08.621 --> 00:15:10.135\nShe began to document it.\n\n00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:13.738\nShe opened a center called\nCasa Amiga, and in six years,\n\n00:15:13.762 --> 00:15:17.122\nshe has literally brought this\nto the consciousness of the world.\n\n00:15:17.146 --> 00:15:18.535\nWe were there a week ago,\n\n00:15:18.559 --> 00:15:22.245\nwhen there were 7,000 people\nin the street, and it was truly a miracle.\n\n00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:24.109\nAnd as we walked through the streets,\n\n00:15:24.133 --> 00:15:27.344\nthe people of Juarez, who normally\ndon't even come into the streets,\n\n00:15:27.368 --> 00:15:29.146\nbecause the streets are so dangerous,\n\n00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:30.782\nliterally stood there and wept,\n\n00:15:30.806 --> 00:15:33.347\nto see that other people\nfrom the world had showed up\n\n00:15:33.371 --> 00:15:35.057\nfor that particular community.\n\n00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.491\nThere's another woman, named Agnes.\n\n00:15:37.515 --> 00:15:42.176\nAnd Agnes, for me, epitomizes\nwhat a vagina warrior is.\n\n00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.950\nI met her three years ago in Kenya.\n\n00:15:44.974 --> 00:15:47.934\nAnd Agnes was mutilated as a little girl;\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:52.567\nshe was circumcised against her will\nwhen she was 10 years old,\n\n00:15:52.591 --> 00:15:54.091\nand she really made a decision\n\n00:15:54.115 --> 00:15:57.934\nthat she didn't want this practice\nto continue anymore in her community.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:01.069\nSo when she got older,\nshe created this incredible thing:\n\n00:16:01.093 --> 00:16:06.386\nit's an anatomical sculpture\nof a woman's body, half a woman's body.\n\n00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:08.538\nAnd she walked through the Rift Valley,\n\n00:16:08.562 --> 00:16:11.934\nand she had vagina\nand vagina replacement parts,\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.787\nwhere she would teach girls\nand parents and boys and girls\n\n00:16:14.811 --> 00:16:18.267\nwhat a healthy vagina looks like,\nand what a mutilated vagina looks like.\n\n00:16:18.291 --> 00:16:19.934\nAnd in the course of her travel --\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.997\nshe walked literally for eight years\nthrough the Rift Valley,\n\n00:16:23.021 --> 00:16:25.282\nthrough dust, through sleeping\non the ground,\n\n00:16:25.306 --> 00:16:27.481\nbecause the Maasai are nomads,\n\n00:16:27.505 --> 00:16:30.934\nand she would have to find them,\nand they would move,\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.596\nand she would find them again --\n\n00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:35.515\nshe saved 1,500 girls from being cut.\n\n00:16:35.904 --> 00:16:38.485\nAnd in that time, she created\nan alternative ritual,\n\n00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:41.834\nwhich involved girls\ncoming of age without the cut.\n\n00:16:41.858 --> 00:16:43.934\nWhen we met her three years ago,\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.871\nwe said, \"What could V-Day do for you?\"\n\n00:16:45.895 --> 00:16:49.511\nAnd she said, \"Well, if you got me a jeep,\nI could get around a lot faster.\"\n\n00:16:49.535 --> 00:16:50.536\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.875\nSo we bought her a jeep.\n\n00:16:51.899 --> 00:16:56.181\nAnd in the year that she had the jeep,\nshe saved 4,500 girls from being cut.\n\n00:16:56.508 --> 00:16:58.970\nSo we said to her,\n\"What else could we do for you?\"\n\n00:16:58.994 --> 00:17:01.256\nShe said, \"Well, Eve,\nif you gave me some money,\n\n00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.430\nI could open a house\nand girls could run away,\n\n00:17:03.454 --> 00:17:04.848\nand they could be saved.\"\n\n00:17:05.182 --> 00:17:08.063\nAnd I want to tell this little story\nabout my own beginnings,\n\n00:17:08.087 --> 00:17:12.381\nbecause it's very interrelated\nto happiness and Agnes.\n\n00:17:12.405 --> 00:17:16.089\nWhen I was a little girl --\nI grew up in a wealthy community;\n\n00:17:16.113 --> 00:17:19.334\nit was an upper-middle class\nwhite community,\n\n00:17:19.358 --> 00:17:22.217\nand it had all the trappings and the looks\n\n00:17:22.241 --> 00:17:25.876\nof a perfectly nice,\nwonderful, great life.\n\n00:17:26.217 --> 00:17:28.844\nAnd everyone was supposed\nto be happy in that community,\n\n00:17:28.868 --> 00:17:30.449\nand, in fact, my life was hell.\n\n00:17:30.473 --> 00:17:32.006\nI lived with an alcoholic father\n\n00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:34.934\nwho beat me and molested me,\nand it was all inside that.\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:39.934\nAnd always as a child I had this fantasy\nthat somebody would come and rescue me.\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:43.578\nAnd I actually made up a little character\nwhose name was Mr. Alligator.\n\n00:17:43.602 --> 00:17:45.934\nI would call him up\nwhen things got really bad,\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:48.121\nand say it was time\nto come and pick me up.\n\n00:17:48.145 --> 00:17:51.934\nAnd I would pack a little bag\nand wait for Mr. Alligator to come.\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:54.140\nNow, Mr. Alligator never did come,\n\n00:17:54.164 --> 00:17:58.638\nbut the idea of Mr. Alligator coming\nactually saved my sanity\n\n00:17:58.662 --> 00:18:00.424\nand made it OK for me to keep going,\n\n00:18:00.448 --> 00:18:02.179\nbecause I believed, in the distance,\n\n00:18:02.203 --> 00:18:04.934\nthere would be someone\ncoming to rescue me.\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:07.427\nCut to 40-some odd years later,\n\n00:18:07.451 --> 00:18:10.681\nwe go to Kenya, and we're walking,\n\n00:18:10.705 --> 00:18:13.083\nwe arrive at the opening of this house.\n\n00:18:13.448 --> 00:18:15.865\nAnd Agnes hadn't let me come\nto the house for days,\n\n00:18:15.889 --> 00:18:18.042\nbecause they were preparing\nthis whole ritual.\n\n00:18:18.066 --> 00:18:19.656\nI want to tell you a great story.\n\n00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.302\nWhen Agnes first started fighting\n\n00:18:21.326 --> 00:18:23.827\nto stop female genital mutilation\nin her community,\n\n00:18:23.851 --> 00:18:27.390\nshe had become an outcast,\nand she was exiled and slandered,\n\n00:18:27.414 --> 00:18:29.445\nand the whole community\nturned against her.\n\n00:18:29.469 --> 00:18:31.827\nBut being a vagina warrior,\nshe kept going,\n\n00:18:31.851 --> 00:18:35.200\nand she kept committing herself\nto transforming consciousness.\n\n00:18:35.224 --> 00:18:36.832\nAnd in the Maasai community,\n\n00:18:36.856 --> 00:18:39.657\ngoats and cows are the most\nvalued possession.\n\n00:18:39.681 --> 00:18:43.934\nThey're like the Mercedes-Benz\nof the Rift Valley.\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:46.844\nAnd she said two days\nbefore the house opened,\n\n00:18:46.868 --> 00:18:49.731\ntwo different people arrived\nto give her a goat each,\n\n00:18:49.755 --> 00:18:50.906\nand she said to me,\n\n00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:55.336\n\"I knew then that female genital\nmutilation would end one day in Africa.\"\n\n00:18:55.744 --> 00:18:59.442\nAnyway, we arrived, and when we arrived,\n\n00:18:59.466 --> 00:19:03.196\nthere were hundreds of girls\ndressed in red homemade dresses --\n\n00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:06.130\nwhich is the color of the Maasai\nand the color of V-Day --\n\n00:19:06.154 --> 00:19:07.496\nand they greeted us.\n\n00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.972\nThey had made up these songs\nthat they were singing,\n\n00:19:09.996 --> 00:19:12.549\nabout the end of suffering\nand the end of mutilation,\n\n00:19:12.573 --> 00:19:14.268\nand they walked us down the path.\n\n00:19:14.292 --> 00:19:16.657\nIt was a gorgeous day in the African sun,\n\n00:19:16.681 --> 00:19:19.134\nand the dust was flying\nand the girls were dancing,\n\n00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:23.684\nand there was this house, and it said,\n\"V-Day Safe House for the Girls.\"\n\n00:19:23.708 --> 00:19:29.010\nAnd it hit me in that moment\nthat it had taken 47 years,\n\n00:19:29.034 --> 00:19:31.637\nbut that Mr. Alligator\nhad finally shown up.\n\n00:19:32.177 --> 00:19:34.059\nAnd he had shown up, obviously,\n\n00:19:34.083 --> 00:19:37.479\nin a form that it took me\na long time to understand,\n\n00:19:37.503 --> 00:19:42.609\nwhich is that when we give in the world\nwhat we want the most,\n\n00:19:42.633 --> 00:19:45.934\nwe heal the broken part inside each of us.\n\n00:19:46.441 --> 00:19:48.815\nAnd I feel, in the last eight years,\n\n00:19:48.839 --> 00:19:51.934\nthat this journey --\nthis miraculous vagina journey --\n\n00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:54.760\nhas taught me this really simple thing,\n\n00:19:54.784 --> 00:19:59.207\nwhich is that happiness exists in action;\n\n00:19:59.231 --> 00:20:03.366\nit exists in telling the truth\nand saying what your truth is;\n\n00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:06.934\nand it exists in giving away\nwhat you want the most.\n\n00:20:06.958 --> 00:20:10.934\nAnd I feel that knowledge and that journey\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:13.411\nhas been an extraordinary privilege,\n\n00:20:13.435 --> 00:20:15.029\nand I feel really blessed\n\n00:20:15.053 --> 00:20:17.473\nto have been here today\nto communicate that to you.\n\n00:20:17.497 --> 00:20:18.662\nThank you very much.\n\n00:20:18.686 --> 00:20:20.862\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Chemical scum that dream of distant quasars", "duration":

So I'll try and do that, but I want to start with two things that everyone already knows. And the first one, in fact, is something that has been known for most of recorded history, and that is, that the planet Earth, or the solar system, or our environment or whatever, is uniquely suited to sustain our evolution \u2014 or creation, as it used to be thought \u2014 and our present existence, and most important, our future survival.Nowadays, this idea has a dramatic name: Spaceship Earth. And the idea there is that outside the spaceship, the universe is implacably hostile, and inside is all we have, all we depend on, and we only get the one chance: if we mess up our spaceship, we've got nowhere else to go. Now, the second thing that everyone already knows is that, contrary to what was believed for most of human history, human beings are not, in fact, the hub of existence. As Stephen Hawking famously said, we're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet that's in orbit around a typical star, which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy, and so on.Now, the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying that we're at a very un-typical place, uniquely suited and so on, and the second one is saying that we're at a typical place. And, especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by and to inform your life decisions, then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other. But that doesn't prevent them from both being completely false.(Laughter)And they are. So let me start with the second one: \"Typical.\" Well, is this a typical place? Well, let's look around, you know, look in a random direction, and we see a wall, and chemical scum \u2014(Laughter)and that's not typical of the universe at all. All you've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back, and you won't see any walls or chemical scum at all \u2014 all you see is a blue planet. And if you go further than that, you'll see the Sun, the solar system and the stars and so on, but that's still not typical of the universe, because stars come in galaxies. And most places in the universe, a typical place in the universe, is nowhere near any galaxies.So let's go out further, till we're outside the galaxy, and look back, and yeah, there's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us. And at this point, we've come 100,000 light-years from here. But we're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe. To get to a typical place, you've got to go 1,000 times as far as that, into intergalactic space. And so, what does that look like \u2014 \"typical?\" What does a \"typical\" place in the universe look like? Well, at enormous expense, TED has arranged a high-resolution immersion virtual reality rendering of the view from intergalactic space. Can we have the lights off, please, so we can see it?Well, not quite, not quite perfect.You see, intergalactic space is completely dark, pitch dark. It's so dark, that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you, and that star were to explode as a supernova, and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you, you still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer. That's how big and how dark the universe is. And that's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright, so brilliant an event, that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light-years.(Laughter)And yet, from intergalactic space, it's so far away you wouldn't even see it. It's also very cold out there \u2014 less than three degrees above absolute zero. And it's very empty. The vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuum that our best technology on Earth can currently create. So that's how different a typical place is from this place. And that is how un-typical this place is. So can we have the lights back on please? Thank you.Now, how do we know about an environment that's so far away and so different and so alien from anything we're used to? Well, the Earth \u2014 our environment, in the form of us \u2014 is creating knowledge. Well, what does that mean? Well, look out even further than we've just been \u2014 I mean from here, with a telescope \u2014 and you'll see things that look like stars, they're called quasars. \"Quasars\" originally meant \"quasi-stellar object,\" which means \"things that look a bit like stars.\"(Laughter)But they're not stars. And we know what they are. Billions of years ago and billions of light-years away, the material at the center of a galaxy collapsed towards a super-massive black hole. And then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energy of that gravitational collapse and some of the matter back out in the form of tremendous jets, which illuminated lobes with the brilliance of \u2014 I think it's a trillion \u2014 suns.Now, the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlike the physics of such a jet. We couldn't survive for an instant in it. Language breaks down when trying to describe what it would be like in one of those jets. It would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion, but at point-blank range and for millions of years at a time.(Laughter)And yet, that jet happened in precisely such a way that billions of years later, on the other side of the universe, some bit of chemical scum could accurately describe and model and predict and explain, above all \u2014 there's your reference \u2014 what was happening there, in reality. The one physical system, the brain, contains an accurate working model of the other, the quasar. Not just a superficial image of it, though it contains that as well, but an explanatory model, embodying the same mathematical relationships and the same causal structure.Now, that is knowledge. And if that weren't amazing enough, the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time. That is the growth of knowledge. So, the laws of physics have this special property, that physical objects as unlike each other as they could possibly be, can nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure and to do it more and more so over time.So we are a chemical scum that is different. This chemical scum has universality. Its structure contains, with ever-increasing precision, the structure of everything. This place, and not other places in the universe, is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence of the whole of the rest of physical reality. And so, far from being insignificant, the fact that the laws of physics allow this or even mandate that this can happen, is one of the most important things about the physical world.Now how does the solar system \u2014 our environment, in the form of us \u2014 acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe? Well, one thing that's true about Stephen Hawking's remark \u2014 I mean, it is true, but it's the wrong emphasis. One thing that's true about it is that it doesn't do it with any special physics, there's no special dispensation, no miracles involved. It does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance. One of them is matter, because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing. Information processing is computation, computation requires a computer \u2014 there's no known way of making a computer without matter. We also need energy to make the computer, and most important, to make the media, in effect, onto which we record the knowledge that we discover.And then thirdly, less tangible but just as essential for the open-ended creation of knowledge, of explanations, is evidence. Now, our environment is inundated with evidence. We happen to get round to testing, let's say, Newton's Law of Gravity, about 300 years ago. But the evidence that we used to do that was falling down on every square meter of the Earth for billions of years before that, and will continue to fall for billions of years afterwards. And the same is true for all the other sciences. As far as we know, evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciences is here just for the taking, on our planet.Our location is saturated with evidence and also with matter and energy. Out in intergalactic space, those three prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge are at their lowest possible supply \u2014 as I said, it's empty, it's cold and it's dark out there. Or is it? Now actually, that's just another parochial misconception.(Laughter)Because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space, the same size as our home, the solar system. Now that cube is very empty by human standards, but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter. And a million tons is enough to make, say, a self-contained space station, on which there's a colony of scientists that are devoted to creating an open-ended stream of knowledge, and so on.Now, it's way beyond present technology to even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic space and form it into other elements and so on. But the thing is, in a comprehensible universe, if something isn't forbidden by the laws of physics, then what could possibly prevent us from doing it, other than knowing how? In other words, it's a matter of knowledge, not resources. If we could do that, we'd automatically have an energy supply, because this transmutation would be a fusion reactor.And evidence? Well, again, it's dark out there to human senses, but all you've got to do is take a telescope, even one of present-day design, look out, and you'll see the same galaxies as we do from here. And with a more powerful telescope, you'll be able to see stars and planets in those galaxies, you'll be able to do astrophysics and learn the laws of physics. And locally there you could build particle accelerators, and learn elementary particle physics and chemistry, and so on. Probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips \u2014(Laughter)because it would take several hundred million years to get to the nearest life-bearing planet and back. But I have to tell you \u2014 and sorry, Richard \u2014 but I never did like biology field trips much,(Laughter)and I think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years.(Laughter)So in fact, intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge. Any such cube anywhere in the universe could become the same kind of hub that we are, if the knowledge of how to do so were present there. So, we're not in a uniquely hospitable place. If intergalactic space is capable of creating an open-ended stream of explanations, then so is almost every other environment, so is the Earth. So is a polluted Earth. And the limiting factor, there and here, is not resources, because they're plentiful, but knowledge, which is scarce.Now this cosmic knowledge-based view may \u2014 and I think ought to \u2014 make us feel very special. But it should also make us feel vulnerable, because it means that without the specific knowledge that's needed to survive the ongoing challenges of the universe, we won't survive them. All it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light-years away, and we'll all be dead!Martin Rees has recently written a book about our vulnerability to all sorts of things, from astrophysics, to scientific experiments gone wrong, and most importantly, to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction. And he thinks that civilization has only a 50 percent chance of surviving this century. I think he's going to talk about that later in the conference.Now, I don't think that probability is the right category to discuss this issue in, but I do agree with him about this: We can survive and we can fail to survive. But it depends not on chance, but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time. The danger is not at all unprecedented. Species go extinct all the time. Civilizations end. The overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations that have ever existed are now history. And if we want to be the exception to that, then logically, our only hope is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species and civilization from all the others \u2014 namely, our special relationship with the laws of physics, our ability to create new explanations, new knowledge \u2014 to be a hub of existence.So let me now apply this to a current controversy, not because I want to advocate any particular solution, but just to illustrate the kind of thing I mean. And the controversy is global warming. Now, I'm a physicist, but I'm not the right kind of physicist. In regard to global warming, I'm just a layman. And the rational thing for a layman to do is to take seriously the prevailing scientific theory. And according to that theory, it's already too late to avoid a disaster, because if it's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent CO2 emissions with something like the Kyoto Protocol, with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars, or whatever it is, then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure. And the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem, merely to postpone it by a little. So it's already too late to avoid it, and it probably has been too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realized the danger. It was probably already too late in the 1970s, when the best available scientific theory was telling us that industrial emissions were about to precipitate a new ice age, in which billions would die.Now, the lesson of that seems clear to me, and I don't know why it isn't informing public debate. It is that we can't always know. When we know of an impending disaster, and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself, then there's not going to be much argument, really. But no precautions and no precautionary principle can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee.Hence, we need a stance of problem-fixing, not just problem-avoidance. And it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure, but that's only if we know what to prevent. If you've been punched on the nose, then the science of medicine does not consist of teaching you how to avoid punches.(Laughter)If medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only, then it would achieve very little of either.The world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs. It ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature, and with plans to live at the higher temperature \u2014 and not at all costs, but efficiently and cheaply. And some such plans exist, things like swarms of mirrors in space to deflect the sunlight away, and encouraging aquatic organisms to eat more carbon dioxide. At the moment, these things are fringe research; they're not central to the human effort to face this problem, or problems in general. And with problems that we are not aware of yet, the ability to put right \u2014 not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely \u2014 is our only hope, not just of solving problems, but of survival.So take two stone tablets, and carve on them. On one of them, carve: \"Problems are soluble.\" And on the other one, carve: \"Problems are inevitable.\"Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 47, "subtitle":

history,\n\n00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:28.990\nhuman beings are not, in fact,\nthe hub of existence.\n\n00:01:29.294 --> 00:01:31.610\nAs Stephen Hawking famously said,\n\n00:01:31.634 --> 00:01:36.530\nwe're just a chemical scum\non the surface of a typical planet\n\n00:01:36.554 --> 00:01:38.840\nthat's in orbit around a typical star,\n\n00:01:38.864 --> 00:01:42.762\nwhich is on the outskirts\nof a typical galaxy, and so on.\n\n00:01:43.841 --> 00:01:48.739\nNow, the first of those two things\nthat everyone knows is kind of saying\n\n00:01:48.763 --> 00:01:53.400\nthat we're at a very un-typical place,\nuniquely suited and so on,\n\n00:01:53.424 --> 00:01:56.884\nand the second one is saying\nthat we're at a typical place.\n\n00:01:56.908 --> 00:02:01.769\nAnd, especially if you regard\nthese two as deep truths to live by\n\n00:02:01.793 --> 00:02:03.934\nand to inform your life decisions,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:09.255\nthen they seem a little bit\nto conflict with each other.\n\n00:02:10.438 --> 00:02:15.795\nBut that doesn't prevent them\nfrom both being completely false.\n\n00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.200\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:17.224 --> 00:02:19.123\nAnd they are.\n\n00:02:19.147 --> 00:02:24.577\nSo let me start with the second one:\n\n00:02:25.028 --> 00:02:29.109\n\"Typical.\" Well, is this a typical place?\n\n00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:32.098\nWell, let's look around, you know,\nlook in a random direction,\n\n00:02:32.122 --> 00:02:37.711\nand we see a wall, and chemical scum --\n\n00:02:37.735 --> 00:02:38.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:43.786\nand that's not typical\nof the universe at all.\n\n00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.233\nAll you've got to do is go\na few hundred miles in that same direction\n\n00:02:47.257 --> 00:02:48.428\nand look back,\n\n00:02:48.452 --> 00:02:51.782\nand you won't see any walls\nor chemical scum at all --\n\n00:02:51.806 --> 00:02:53.513\nall you see is a blue planet.\n\n00:02:53.537 --> 00:02:56.142\nAnd if you go further than that,\n\n00:02:56.166 --> 00:03:00.548\nyou'll see the Sun, the solar system\nand the stars and so on,\n\n00:03:00.572 --> 00:03:02.703\nbut that's still not typical\nof the universe,\n\n00:03:02.727 --> 00:03:06.051\nbecause stars come in galaxies.\n\n00:03:06.075 --> 00:03:10.853\nAnd most places in the universe,\na typical place in the universe,\n\n00:03:10.877 --> 00:03:12.934\nis nowhere near any galaxies.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:18.485\nSo let's go out further, till we're\noutside the galaxy, and look back,\n\n00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:23.367\nand yeah, there's the huge galaxy\nwith spiral arms laid out in front of us.\n\n00:03:24.224 --> 00:03:29.934\nAnd at this point, we've come\n100,000 light-years from here.\n\n00:03:30.352 --> 00:03:34.934\nBut we're still nowhere near\na typical place in the universe.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.707\nTo get to a typical place,\n\n00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:41.248\nyou've got to go\n1,000 times as far as that,\n\n00:03:41.272 --> 00:03:43.352\ninto intergalactic space.\n\n00:03:43.828 --> 00:03:46.871\nAnd so, what does that\nlook like -- \"typical?\"\n\n00:03:46.895 --> 00:03:49.444\nWhat does a \"typical\" place\nin the universe look like?\n\n00:03:49.468 --> 00:03:53.478\nWell, at enormous expense,\nTED has arranged\n\n00:03:53.502 --> 00:03:58.560\na high-resolution immersion\nvirtual reality rendering\n\n00:03:58.584 --> 00:04:01.934\nof the view from intergalactic space.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.802\nCan we have the lights off,\nplease, so we can see it?\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:13.324\nWell, not quite, not quite perfect.\n\n00:04:13.348 --> 00:04:20.029\nYou see, intergalactic space\nis completely dark, pitch dark.\n\n00:04:20.053 --> 00:04:21.936\nIt's so dark,\n\n00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:27.626\nthat if you were to be looking\nat the nearest star to you,\n\n00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.748\nand that star were to explode\nas a supernova,\n\n00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:36.660\nand you were to be staring directly at it\nat the moment when its light reached you,\n\n00:04:36.684 --> 00:04:39.834\nyou still wouldn't be able\nto see even a glimmer.\n\n00:04:40.625 --> 00:04:43.720\nThat's how big and how dark\nthe universe is.\n\n00:04:43.744 --> 00:04:48.505\nAnd that's despite the fact\nthat a supernova is so bright,\n\n00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:50.979\nso brilliant an event,\n\n00:04:51.003 --> 00:04:55.240\nthat it would kill you stone dead\nat a range of several light-years.\n\n00:04:55.264 --> 00:04:56.883\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:56.907 --> 00:04:58.822\nAnd yet, from intergalactic space,\n\n00:04:58.846 --> 00:05:01.281\nit's so far away you wouldn't even see it.\n\n00:05:01.305 --> 00:05:03.934\nIt's also very cold out there --\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.487\nless than three degrees\nabove absolute zero.\n\n00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:09.369\nAnd it's very empty.\n\n00:05:09.393 --> 00:05:15.234\nThe vacuum there is one million times\nless dense than the highest vacuum\n\n00:05:15.258 --> 00:05:18.195\nthat our best technology on Earth\ncan currently create.\n\n00:05:18.603 --> 00:05:24.934\nSo that's how different\na typical place is from this place.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:28.085\nAnd that is how un-typical this place is.\n\n00:05:28.109 --> 00:05:31.180\nSo can we have the lights\nback on please? Thank you.\n\n00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.562\nNow, how do we know about an environment\nthat's so far away and so different\n\n00:05:38.586 --> 00:05:41.633\nand so alien from anything we're used to?\n\n00:05:41.657 --> 00:05:45.023\nWell, the Earth -- our environment,\nin the form of us --\n\n00:05:45.047 --> 00:05:47.073\nis creating knowledge.\n\n00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:48.437\nWell, what does that mean?\n\n00:05:48.461 --> 00:05:51.934\nWell, look out even further\nthan we've just been --\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.258\nI mean from here, with a telescope --\n\n00:05:54.282 --> 00:05:58.456\nand you'll see things that look\nlike stars, they're called quasars.\n\n00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.693\n\"Quasars\" originally meant\n\"quasi-stellar object,\"\n\n00:06:01.717 --> 00:06:04.460\nwhich means \"things that look\na bit like stars.\"\n\n00:06:04.484 --> 00:06:05.769\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:05.793 --> 00:06:07.147\nBut they're not stars.\n\n00:06:07.171 --> 00:06:09.723\nAnd we know what they are.\n\n00:06:11.436 --> 00:06:14.787\nBillions of years ago\nand billions of light-years away,\n\n00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:18.934\nthe material at the center\nof a galaxy collapsed\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.329\ntowards a super-massive black hole.\n\n00:06:21.353 --> 00:06:23.635\nAnd then intense magnetic fields\n\n00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:27.605\ndirected some of the energy\nof that gravitational collapse\n\n00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:28.934\nand some of the matter\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.057\nback out in the form of tremendous jets,\n\n00:06:31.081 --> 00:06:32.915\nwhich illuminated lobes\n\n00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:37.360\nwith the brilliance of --\nI think it's a trillion -- suns.\n\n00:06:39.844 --> 00:06:44.356\nNow, the physics of the human brain\ncould hardly be more unlike\n\n00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.303\nthe physics of such a jet.\n\n00:06:46.327 --> 00:06:48.679\nWe couldn't survive for an instant in it.\n\n00:06:48.703 --> 00:06:51.712\nLanguage breaks down\nwhen trying to describe\n\n00:06:51.736 --> 00:06:53.934\nwhat it would be like\nin one of those jets.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.016\nIt would be a bit like experiencing\na supernova explosion,\n\n00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.557\nbut at point-blank range\nand for millions of years at a time.\n\n00:07:00.581 --> 00:07:04.108\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:10.222\nAnd yet, that jet happened\nin precisely such a way\n\n00:07:10.246 --> 00:07:13.966\nthat billions of years later,\non the other side of the universe,\n\n00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.132\nsome bit of chemical scum\ncould accurately describe\n\n00:07:18.156 --> 00:07:22.146\nand model and predict\nand explain, above all --\n\n00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.296\nthere's your reference --\n\n00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.958\nwhat was happening there, in reality.\n\n00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:33.265\nThe one physical system, the brain,\ncontains an accurate working model\n\n00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:35.137\nof the other, the quasar.\n\n00:07:35.161 --> 00:07:38.736\nNot just a superficial image of it,\nthough it contains that as well,\n\n00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.741\nbut an explanatory model,\n\n00:07:40.765 --> 00:07:43.812\nembodying the same\nmathematical relationships\n\n00:07:43.836 --> 00:07:46.264\nand the same causal structure.\n\n00:07:46.288 --> 00:07:48.326\nNow, that is knowledge.\n\n00:07:48.941 --> 00:07:50.934\nAnd if that weren't amazing enough,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:54.934\nthe faithfulness with which\nthe one structure resembles the other\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.041\nis increasing with time.\n\n00:07:57.065 --> 00:07:59.538\nThat is the growth of knowledge.\n\n00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:02.934\nSo, the laws of physics\nhave this special property,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:07.715\nthat physical objects as unlike each other\nas they could possibly be,\n\n00:08:07.739 --> 00:08:13.483\ncan nevertheless embody the same\nmathematical and causal structure\n\n00:08:13.507 --> 00:08:16.329\nand to do it more and more so over time.\n\n00:08:17.026 --> 00:08:20.198\nSo we are a chemical scum\nthat is different.\n\n00:08:20.222 --> 00:08:23.395\nThis chemical scum has universality.\n\n00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.206\nIts structure contains,\nwith ever-increasing precision,\n\n00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:29.660\nthe structure of everything.\n\n00:08:29.684 --> 00:08:33.388\nThis place, and not other places\nin the universe,\n\n00:08:33.412 --> 00:08:39.488\nis a hub which contains within itself\nthe structural and causal essence\n\n00:08:39.512 --> 00:08:42.249\nof the whole of the rest\nof physical reality.\n\n00:08:42.273 --> 00:08:44.121\nAnd so, far from being insignificant,\n\n00:08:44.145 --> 00:08:46.849\nthe fact that the laws\nof physics allow this\n\n00:08:46.873 --> 00:08:50.324\nor even mandate that this can happen,\n\n00:08:50.348 --> 00:08:54.440\nis one of the most important things\nabout the physical world.\n\n00:08:55.313 --> 00:09:00.601\nNow how does the solar system --\nour environment, in the form of us --\n\n00:09:00.625 --> 00:09:04.006\nacquire this special relationship\nwith the rest of the universe?\n\n00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:08.848\nWell, one thing that's true\nabout Stephen Hawking's remark --\n\n00:09:08.872 --> 00:09:12.387\nI mean, it is true,\nbut it's the wrong emphasis.\n\n00:09:12.871 --> 00:09:18.860\nOne thing that's true about it is that\nit doesn't do it with any special physics,\n\n00:09:18.884 --> 00:09:21.875\nthere's no special dispensation,\nno miracles involved.\n\n00:09:21.899 --> 00:09:25.934\nIt does it simply with three things\nthat we have here in abundance.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.608\nOne of them is matter,\n\n00:09:27.632 --> 00:09:32.688\nbecause the growth of knowledge\nis a form of information processing.\n\n00:09:32.712 --> 00:09:36.649\nInformation processing is computation,\ncomputation requires a computer --\n\n00:09:36.673 --> 00:09:39.672\nthere's no known way of making\na computer without matter.\n\n00:09:39.696 --> 00:09:43.171\nWe also need energy to make\nthe computer, and most important,\n\n00:09:43.195 --> 00:09:47.165\nto make the media, in effect,\nonto which we record\n\n00:09:47.189 --> 00:09:48.934\nthe knowledge that we discover.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:53.099\nAnd then thirdly,\nless tangible but just as essential\n\n00:09:53.123 --> 00:09:57.321\nfor the open-ended creation\nof knowledge, of explanations,\n\n00:09:57.345 --> 00:10:00.322\nis evidence.\n\n00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.281\nNow, our environment\nis inundated with evidence.\n\n00:10:04.305 --> 00:10:09.934\nWe happen to get round to testing,\nlet's say, Newton's Law of Gravity,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.687\nabout 300 years ago.\n\n00:10:11.711 --> 00:10:15.050\nBut the evidence that we used to do that\n\n00:10:15.074 --> 00:10:18.363\nwas falling down on every\nsquare meter of the Earth\n\n00:10:18.387 --> 00:10:20.040\nfor billions of years before that,\n\n00:10:20.064 --> 00:10:23.881\nand will continue to fall\nfor billions of years afterwards.\n\n00:10:24.442 --> 00:10:26.934\nAnd the same is true\nfor all the other sciences.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:31.934\nAs far as we know, evidence to discover\nthe most fundamental truths\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:35.934\nof all the sciences is here just\nfor the taking, on our planet.\n\n00:10:36.256 --> 00:10:39.120\nOur location is saturated with evidence\n\n00:10:39.144 --> 00:10:41.576\nand also with matter and energy.\n\n00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.838\nOut in intergalactic space,\n\n00:10:43.862 --> 00:10:47.251\nthose three prerequisites\nfor the open-ended creation of knowledge\n\n00:10:47.275 --> 00:10:49.695\nare at their lowest possible supply --\n\n00:10:49.719 --> 00:10:53.311\nas I said, it's empty, it's cold\nand it's dark out there.\n\n00:10:54.454 --> 00:10:55.604\nOr is it?\n\n00:10:56.194 --> 00:10:59.904\nNow actually, that's just\nanother parochial misconception.\n\n00:10:59.928 --> 00:11:01.003\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:01.027 --> 00:11:05.998\nBecause imagine a cube out there\nin intergalactic space,\n\n00:11:06.022 --> 00:11:09.683\nthe same size as our home,\nthe solar system.\n\n00:11:09.707 --> 00:11:12.934\nNow that cube is very empty\nby human standards,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:17.934\nbut that still means that it contains\nover a million tons of matter.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:22.934\nAnd a million tons is enough to make,\nsay, a self-contained space station,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.308\non which there's a colony of scientists\n\n00:11:25.332 --> 00:11:29.368\nthat are devoted to creating an open-ended\nstream of knowledge, and so on.\n\n00:11:29.757 --> 00:11:31.842\nNow, it's way beyond present technology\n\n00:11:31.866 --> 00:11:35.992\nto even gather the hydrogen\nfrom intergalactic space\n\n00:11:36.016 --> 00:11:39.194\nand form it into other elements and so on.\n\n00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.758\nBut the thing is,\nin a comprehensible universe,\n\n00:11:42.782 --> 00:11:46.148\nif something isn't forbidden\nby the laws of physics,\n\n00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:50.317\nthen what could possibly prevent us\nfrom doing it, other than knowing how?\n\n00:11:50.341 --> 00:11:53.718\nIn other words, it's a matter\nof knowledge, not resources.\n\n00:11:53.742 --> 00:11:57.353\nIf we could do that, we'd automatically\nhave an energy supply,\n\n00:11:57.377 --> 00:12:00.821\nbecause this transmutation\nwould be a fusion reactor.\n\n00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:02.582\nAnd evidence?\n\n00:12:02.606 --> 00:12:05.781\nWell, again, it's dark out there\nto human senses,\n\n00:12:05.805 --> 00:12:07.924\nbut all you've got to do\nis take a telescope,\n\n00:12:07.948 --> 00:12:10.091\neven one of present-day design,\n\n00:12:10.115 --> 00:12:14.531\nlook out, and you'll see\nthe same galaxies as we do from here.\n\n00:12:14.555 --> 00:12:16.901\nAnd with a more powerful telescope,\n\n00:12:16.925 --> 00:12:19.647\nyou'll be able to see stars\nand planets in those galaxies,\n\n00:12:19.671 --> 00:12:23.081\nyou'll be able to do astrophysics\nand learn the laws of physics.\n\n00:12:23.105 --> 00:12:25.745\nAnd locally there you could build\nparticle accelerators,\n\n00:12:25.769 --> 00:12:29.006\nand learn elementary particle physics\nand chemistry, and so on.\n\n00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:33.488\nProbably the hardest science to do\nwould be biology field trips --\n\n00:12:33.512 --> 00:12:34.829\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:34.853 --> 00:12:37.792\nbecause it would take\nseveral hundred million years\n\n00:12:37.816 --> 00:12:41.135\nto get to the nearest\nlife-bearing planet and back.\n\n00:12:41.159 --> 00:12:43.441\nBut I have to tell you --\nand sorry, Richard --\n\n00:12:43.465 --> 00:12:46.799\nbut I never did like biology\nfield trips much,\n\n00:12:46.823 --> 00:12:48.131\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:48.155 --> 00:12:50.151\nand I think we can just about make do\n\n00:12:50.175 --> 00:12:52.275\nwith one every few hundred million years.\n\n00:12:52.299 --> 00:12:54.316\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:54.340 --> 00:13:01.296\nSo in fact, intergalactic space\ndoes contain all the prerequisites\n\n00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.700\nfor the open-ended creation of knowledge.\n\n00:13:04.208 --> 00:13:07.384\nAny such cube anywhere in the universe\n\n00:13:07.408 --> 00:13:11.993\ncould become the same kind\nof hub that we are,\n\n00:13:12.017 --> 00:13:16.867\nif the knowledge of how to do so\nwere present there.\n\n00:13:17.716 --> 00:13:21.104\nSo, we're not in a uniquely\nhospitable place.\n\n00:13:21.128 --> 00:13:23.642\nIf intergalactic space\nis capable of creating\n\n00:13:23.666 --> 00:13:26.252\nan open-ended stream of explanations,\n\n00:13:26.276 --> 00:13:28.443\nthen so is almost every other environment,\n\n00:13:28.467 --> 00:13:29.697\nso is the Earth.\n\n00:13:29.721 --> 00:13:32.051\nSo is a polluted Earth.\n\n00:13:32.432 --> 00:13:36.144\nAnd the limiting factor, there and here,\n\n00:13:36.168 --> 00:13:39.024\nis not resources,\nbecause they're plentiful,\n\n00:13:39.048 --> 00:13:41.198\nbut knowledge, which is scarce.\n\n00:13:41.568 --> 00:13:47.537\nNow this cosmic knowledge-based view\nmay -- and I think ought to --\n\n00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:49.877\nmake us feel very special.\n\n00:13:49.901 --> 00:13:52.519\nBut it should also\nmake us feel vulnerable,\n\n00:13:52.543 --> 00:13:55.958\nbecause it means that\nwithout the specific knowledge\n\n00:13:55.982 --> 00:13:59.729\nthat's needed to survive\nthe ongoing challenges of the universe,\n\n00:13:59.753 --> 00:14:00.934\nwe won't survive them.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:04.443\nAll it takes is for a supernova\nto go off a few light-years away,\n\n00:14:04.467 --> 00:14:05.872\nand we'll all be dead!\n\n00:14:06.212 --> 00:14:08.611\nMartin Rees has recently written a book\n\n00:14:08.635 --> 00:14:11.934\nabout our vulnerability\nto all sorts of things,\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:15.934\nfrom astrophysics, to scientific\nexperiments gone wrong,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:20.308\nand most importantly, to terrorism\nwith weapons of mass destruction.\n\n00:14:20.332 --> 00:14:23.759\nAnd he thinks that civilization\nhas only a 50 percent chance\n\n00:14:23.783 --> 00:14:25.210\nof surviving this century.\n\n00:14:25.234 --> 00:14:28.369\nI think he's going to talk\nabout that later in the conference.\n\n00:14:28.393 --> 00:14:33.541\nNow, I don't think that probability\nis the right category\n\n00:14:33.565 --> 00:14:34.934\nto discuss this issue in,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.693\nbut I do agree with him about this:\n\n00:14:36.717 --> 00:14:40.882\nWe can survive and we can fail to survive.\n\n00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.205\nBut it depends not on chance,\n\n00:14:44.229 --> 00:14:47.934\nbut on whether we create\nthe relevant knowledge in time.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.760\nThe danger is not at all unprecedented.\n\n00:14:50.784 --> 00:14:54.005\nSpecies go extinct all the time.\n\n00:14:54.029 --> 00:14:56.187\nCivilizations end.\n\n00:14:56.211 --> 00:14:59.647\nThe overwhelming majority\nof all species and all civilizations\n\n00:14:59.671 --> 00:15:02.256\nthat have ever existed are now history.\n\n00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.154\nAnd if we want to be\nthe exception to that,\n\n00:15:05.178 --> 00:15:11.077\nthen logically, our only hope\nis to make use of the one feature\n\n00:15:11.101 --> 00:15:15.725\nthat distinguishes our species\nand civilization from all the others --\n\n00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:20.196\nnamely, our special relationship\nwith the laws of physics,\n\n00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:24.693\nour ability to create\nnew explanations, new knowledge --\n\n00:15:24.717 --> 00:15:27.488\nto be a hub of existence.\n\n00:15:27.877 --> 00:15:31.597\nSo let me now apply this\nto a current controversy,\n\n00:15:31.621 --> 00:15:34.836\nnot because I want to advocate\nany particular solution,\n\n00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.494\nbut just to illustrate\nthe kind of thing I mean.\n\n00:15:37.518 --> 00:15:39.934\nAnd the controversy is global warming.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.963\nNow, I'm a physicist,\nbut I'm not the right kind of physicist.\n\n00:15:42.987 --> 00:15:46.721\nIn regard to global warming,\nI'm just a layman.\n\n00:15:46.745 --> 00:15:49.576\nAnd the rational thing for a layman to do\n\n00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.101\nis to take seriously\nthe prevailing scientific theory.\n\n00:15:54.125 --> 00:15:58.792\nAnd according to that theory,\nit's already too late to avoid a disaster,\n\n00:15:58.816 --> 00:16:04.584\nbecause if it's true that our best option\nat the moment is to prevent CO2 emissions\n\n00:16:04.608 --> 00:16:06.478\nwith something like the Kyoto Protocol,\n\n00:16:06.502 --> 00:16:10.319\nwith its constraints on economic activity\nand its enormous cost\n\n00:16:10.343 --> 00:16:12.934\nof hundreds of billions of dollars,\nor whatever it is,\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:18.015\nthen that is already a disaster\nby any reasonable measure.\n\n00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:23.409\nAnd the actions that are advocated are not\neven purported to solve the problem,\n\n00:16:23.433 --> 00:16:25.813\nmerely to postpone it by a little.\n\n00:16:25.837 --> 00:16:27.622\nSo it's already too late to avoid it,\n\n00:16:27.646 --> 00:16:30.530\nand it probably has been\ntoo late to avoid it\n\n00:16:30.554 --> 00:16:34.375\never since before anyone\nrealized the danger.\n\n00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:37.463\nIt was probably already\ntoo late in the 1970s,\n\n00:16:37.487 --> 00:16:40.682\nwhen the best available\nscientific theory was telling us\n\n00:16:40.706 --> 00:16:44.220\nthat industrial emissions were\nabout to precipitate a new ice age,\n\n00:16:44.244 --> 00:16:46.362\nin which billions would die.\n\n00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:49.429\nNow, the lesson of that seems clear to me,\n\n00:16:49.453 --> 00:16:53.040\nand I don't know why it isn't\ninforming public debate.\n\n00:16:53.064 --> 00:16:56.370\nIt is that we can't always know.\n\n00:16:56.394 --> 00:16:59.028\nWhen we know of an impending disaster,\n\n00:16:59.052 --> 00:17:03.654\nand how to solve it at a cost less\nthan the cost of the disaster itself,\n\n00:17:03.678 --> 00:17:06.550\nthen there's not going to be\nmuch argument, really.\n\n00:17:06.574 --> 00:17:11.143\nBut no precautions\nand no precautionary principle\n\n00:17:11.167 --> 00:17:15.369\ncan avoid problems\nthat we do not yet foresee.\n\n00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:20.378\nHence, we need a stance of problem-fixing,\n\n00:17:20.402 --> 00:17:23.003\nnot just problem-avoidance.\n\n00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:27.054\nAnd it's true that an ounce of prevention\nequals a pound of cure,\n\n00:17:27.078 --> 00:17:30.006\nbut that's only if we know\nwhat to prevent.\n\n00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.991\nIf you've been punched on the nose,\n\n00:17:32.015 --> 00:17:35.150\nthen the science of medicine\ndoes not consist of teaching you\n\n00:17:35.174 --> 00:17:36.532\nhow to avoid punches.\n\n00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:37.571\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:37.595 --> 00:17:42.934\nIf medical science stopped seeking cures\nand concentrated on prevention only,\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:45.705\nthen it would achieve\nvery little of either.\n\n00:17:45.729 --> 00:17:47.754\nThe world is buzzing at the moment\n\n00:17:47.778 --> 00:17:52.485\nwith plans to force reductions\nin gas emissions at all costs.\n\n00:17:52.908 --> 00:17:57.187\nIt ought to be buzzing with plans\nto reduce the temperature,\n\n00:17:57.211 --> 00:18:00.222\nand with plans to live\nat the higher temperature --\n\n00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:03.466\nand not at all costs,\nbut efficiently and cheaply.\n\n00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:04.817\nAnd some such plans exist,\n\n00:18:04.841 --> 00:18:09.053\nthings like swarms of mirrors in space\nto deflect the sunlight away,\n\n00:18:09.077 --> 00:18:12.934\nand encouraging aquatic organisms\nto eat more carbon dioxide.\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:16.246\nAt the moment, these things\nare fringe research;\n\n00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:19.975\nthey're not central to the human effort\nto face this problem,\n\n00:18:19.999 --> 00:18:21.617\nor problems in general.\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:24.729\nAnd with problems\nthat we are not aware of yet,\n\n00:18:24.753 --> 00:18:30.912\nthe ability to put right -- not the sheer\ngood luck of avoiding indefinitely --\n\n00:18:30.936 --> 00:18:33.729\nis our only hope, not just\nof solving problems,\n\n00:18:33.753 --> 00:18:35.187\nbut of survival.\n\n00:18:35.629 --> 00:18:42.113\nSo take two stone tablets,\nand carve on them.\n\n00:18:43.015 --> 00:18:47.385\nOn one of them, carve:\n\"Problems are soluble.\"\n\n00:18:47.721 --> 00:18:51.902\nAnd on the other one, carve:\n\"Problems are inevitable.\"\n\n00:18:52.354 --> 00:18:53.513\nThank you.\n\n00:18:53.537 --> 00:18:54.687\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why the universe seems so strange", "duration": "1316", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/richard_dawkins_on_our_queer_universe", "transcript": "My title: \"Queerer than we can suppose: the strangeness of science.\" \"Queerer than we can suppose\" comes from J.B.S. Haldane, the famous biologist, who said, \"Now, my own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose. I suspect that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of, or can be dreamed of, in any philosophy.\" Richard Feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories \u2014 experimental predictions \u2014 to specifying the width of North America to within one hair's breadth of accuracy. This means that quantum theory has got to be, in some sense, true. Yet the assumptions that quantum theory needs to make in order to deliver those predictions are so mysterious that even Feynman himself was moved to remark, \"If you think you understand quantum theory, you don't understand quantum theory.\"It's so queer that physicists resort to one or another paradoxical interpretation of it. David Deutsch, who's talking here, in \"The Fabric of Reality,\" embraces the many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory, because the worst that you can say about it is that it's preposterously wasteful. It postulates a vast and rapidly growing number of universes existing in parallel, mutually undetectable, except through the narrow porthole of quantum mechanical experiments. And that's Richard Feynman.The biologist Lewis Wolpert believes that the queerness of modern physics is just an extreme example. Science, as opposed to technology, does violence to common sense. Every time you drink a glass of water, he points out, the odds are that you will imbibe at least one molecule that passed through the bladder of Oliver Cromwell. (Laughter) It's just elementary probability theory.(Laughter)The number of molecules per glassful is hugely greater than the number of glassfuls, or bladdersful, in the world. And of course, there's nothing special about Cromwell or bladders \u2014 you have just breathed in a nitrogen atom that passed through the right lung of the third iguanodon to the left of the tall cycad tree.\"Queerer than we can suppose.\" What is it that makes us capable of supposing anything, and does this tell us anything about what we can suppose? Are there things about the universe that will be forever beyond our grasp, but not beyond the grasp of some superior intelligence? Are there things about the universe that are, in principle, ungraspable by any mind, however superior? The history of science has been one long series of violent brainstorms, as successive generations have come to terms with increasing levels of queerness in the universe. We're now so used to the idea that the Earth spins, rather than the Sun moves across the sky, it's hard for us to realize what a shattering mental revolution that must have been. After all, it seems obvious that the Earth is large and motionless, the Sun, small and mobile. But it's worth recalling Wittgenstein's remark on the subject: \"Tell me,\" he asked a friend, \"why do people always say it was natural for man to assume that the Sun went 'round the Earth, rather than that the Earth was rotating?\" And his friend replied, \"Well, obviously, because it just looks as though the Sun is going round the Earth.\" Wittgenstein replied, \"Well, what would it have looked like if it had looked as though the Earth was rotating?\"(Laughter)Science has taught us, against all intuition, that apparently solid things, like crystals and rocks, are really almost entirely composed of empty space. And the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium, and the next atom is in the next sports stadium. So it would seem the hardest, solidest, densest rock is really almost entirely empty space, broken only by tiny particles so widely spaced they shouldn't count. Why, then, do rocks look and feel solid and hard and impenetrable? As an evolutionary biologist, I'd say this: our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude, of size and speed which our bodies operate at. We never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms. If we had, our brains probably would perceive rocks as full of empty space. Rocks feel hard and impenetrable to our hands, precisely because objects like rocks and hands cannot penetrate each other. It's therefore useful for our brains to construct notions like \"solidity\" and \"impenetrability,\" because such notions help us to navigate our bodies through the middle-sized world in which we have to navigate.Moving to the other end of the scale, our ancestors never had to navigate through the cosmos at speeds close to the speed of light. If they had, our brains would be much better at understanding Einstein. I want to give the name \"Middle World\" to the medium-scaled environment in which we've evolved the ability to take act \u2014 nothing to do with \"Middle Earth\" \u2014 Middle World.(Laughter)We are evolved denizens of Middle World, and that limits what we are capable of imagining. We find it intuitively easy to grasp ideas like, when a rabbit moves at the sort of medium velocity at which rabbits and other Middle World objects move, and hits another Middle World object like a rock, it knocks itself out.May I introduce Major General Albert Stubblebine III, commander of military intelligence in 1983.\"...[He] stared at his wall in Arlington, Virginia, and decided to do it. As frightening as the prospect was, he was going into the next office. He stood up and moved out from behind his desk. 'What is the atom mostly made of?' he thought, 'Space.' He started walking. 'What am I mostly made of? Atoms.' He quickened his pace, almost to a jog now. 'What is the wall mostly made of?'(Laughter)'Atoms!' All I have to do is merge the spaces. Then, General Stubblebine banged his nose hard on the wall of his office. Stubblebine, who commanded 16,000 soldiers, was confounded by his continual failure to walk through the wall. He has no doubt that this ability will one day be a common tool in the military arsenal. Who would screw around with an army that could do that?\"That's from an article in Playboy, which I was reading the other day.(Laughter)I have every reason to think it's true; I was reading Playboy because I, myself, had an article in it.(Laughter)Unaided human intuition, schooled in Middle World, finds it hard to believe Galileo when he tells us a heavy object and a light object, air friction aside, would hit the ground at the same instant. And that's because in Middle World, air friction is always there. If we'd evolved in a vacuum, we would expect them to hit the ground simultaneously. If we were bacteria, constantly buffeted by thermal movements of molecules, it would be different. But we Middle-Worlders are too big to notice Brownian motion. In the same way, our lives are dominated by gravity, but are almost oblivious to the force of surface tension. A small insect would reverse these priorities.Steve Grand \u2014 he's the one on the left, Douglas Adams is on the right. Steve Grand, in his book, \"Creation: Life and How to Make It,\" is positively scathing about our preoccupation with matter itself. We have this tendency to think that only solid, material things are really things at all. Waves of electromagnetic fluctuation in a vacuum seem unreal. Victorians thought the waves had to be waves in some material medium: the ether. But we find real matter comforting only because we've evolved to survive in Middle World, where matter is a useful fiction. A whirlpool, for Steve Grand, is a thing with just as much reality as a rock.In a desert plain in Tanzania, in the shadow of the volcano Ol Doinyo Lengai, there's a dune made of volcanic ash. The beautiful thing is that it moves bodily. It's what's technically known as a \"barchan,\" and the entire dune walks across the desert in a westerly direction at a speed of about 17 meters per year. It retains its crescent shape and moves in the direction of the horns. What happens is that the wind blows the sand up the shallow slope on the other side, and then, as each sand grain hits the top of the ridge, it cascades down on the inside of the crescent, and so the whole horn-shaped dune moves. Steve Grand points out that you and I are, ourselves, more like a wave than a permanent thing. He invites us, the reader, to think of an experience from your childhood, something you remember clearly, something you can see, feel, maybe even smell, as if you were really there. After all, you really were there at the time, weren't you? How else would you remember it? But here is the bombshell: You weren't there. Not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place. Matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you. Whatever you are, therefore, you are not the stuff of which you are made. If that doesn't make the hair stand up on the back of your neck, read it again until it does, because it is important.So \"really\" isn't a word that we should use with simple confidence. If a neutrino had a brain, which it evolved in neutrino-sized ancestors, it would say that rocks really do consist of empty space. We have brains that evolved in medium-sized ancestors which couldn't walk through rocks. \"Really,\" for an animal, is whatever its brain needs it to be in order to assist its survival. And because different species live in different worlds, there will be a discomforting variety of \"reallys.\" What we see of the real world is not the unvarnished world, but a model of the world, regulated and adjusted by sense data, but constructed so it's useful for dealing with the real world.The nature of the model depends on the kind of animal we are. A flying animal needs a different kind of model from a walking, climbing or swimming animal. A monkey's brain must have software capable of simulating a three-dimensional world of branches and trunks. A mole's software for constructing models of its world will be customized for underground use. A water strider's brain doesn't need 3D software at all, since it lives on the surface of the pond, in an Edwin Abbott flatland.I've speculated that bats may see color with their ears. The world model that a bat needs in order to navigate through three dimensions catching insects must be pretty similar to the world model that any flying bird \u2014 a day-flying bird like a swallow \u2014 needs to perform the same kind of tasks. The fact that the bat uses echoes in pitch darkness to input the current variables to its model, while the swallow uses light, is incidental. Bats, I've even suggested, use perceived hues, such as red and blue, as labels, internal labels, for some useful aspect of echoes \u2014 perhaps the acoustic texture of surfaces, furry or smooth and so on \u2014 in the same way as swallows or indeed, we, use those perceived hues \u2014 redness and blueness, etc. \u2014 to label long and short wavelengths of light. There's nothing inherent about red that makes it long wavelength.The point is that the nature of the model is governed by how it is to be used, rather than by the sensory modality involved. J.B.S. Haldane himself had something to say about animals whose world is dominated by smell. Dogs can distinguish two very similar fatty acids, extremely diluted: caprylic acid and caproic acid. The only difference, you see, is that one has an extra pair of carbon atoms in the chain. Haldane guesses that a dog would probably be able to place the acids in the order of their molecular weights by their smells, just as a man could place a number of piano wires in the order of their lengths by means of their notes. Now, there's another fatty acid, capric acid, which is just like the other two, except that it has two more carbon atoms. A dog that had never met capric acid would, perhaps, have no more trouble imagining its smell than we would have trouble imagining a trumpet, say, playing one note higher than we've heard a trumpet play before. Perhaps dogs and rhinos and other smell-oriented animals smell in color. And the argument would be exactly the same as for the bats.Middle World \u2014 the range of sizes and speeds which we have evolved to feel intuitively comfortable with \u2014 is a bit like the narrow range of the electromagnetic spectrum that we see as light of various colors. We're blind to all frequencies outside that, unless we use instruments to help us. Middle World is the narrow range of reality which we judge to be normal, as opposed to the queerness of the very small, the very large and the very fast. We could make a similar scale of improbabilities; nothing is totally impossible. Miracles are just events that are extremely improbable. A marble statue could wave its hand at us; the atoms that make up its crystalline structure are all vibrating back and forth anyway. Because there are so many of them, and because there's no agreement among them in their preferred direction of movement, the marble, as we see it in Middle World, stays rock steady. But the atoms in the hand could all just happen to move the same way at the same time, and again and again. In this case, the hand would move, and we'd see it waving at us in Middle World. The odds against it, of course, are so great that if you set out writing zeros at the time of the origin of the universe, you still would not have written enough zeros to this day.Evolution in Middle World has not equipped us to handle very improbable events; we don't live long enough. In the vastness of astronomical space and geological time, that which seems impossible in Middle World might turn out to be inevitable. One way to think about that is by counting planets. We don't know how many planets there are in the universe, but a good estimate is about 10 to the 20, or 100 billion billion. And that gives us a nice way to express our estimate of life's improbability. We could make some sort of landmark points along a spectrum of improbability, which might look like the electromagnetic spectrum we just looked at.If life has arisen only once on any \u2014 life could originate once per planet, could be extremely common or it could originate once per star or once per galaxy or maybe only once in the entire universe, in which case it would have to be here. And somewhere up there would be the chance that a frog would turn into a prince, and similar magical things like that. If life has arisen on only one planet in the entire universe, that planet has to be our planet, because here we are talking about it. And that means that if we want to avail ourselves of it, we're allowed to postulate chemical events in the origin of life which have a probability as low as one in 100 billion billion. I don't think we shall have to avail ourselves of that, because I suspect that life is quite common in the universe. And when I say quite common, it could still be so rare that no one island of life ever encounters another, which is a sad thought.How shall we interpret \"queerer than we can suppose?\" Queerer than can in principle be supposed, or just queerer than we can suppose, given the limitations of our brain's evolutionary apprenticeship in Middle World? Could we, by training and practice, emancipate ourselves from Middle World and achieve some sort of intuitive as well as mathematical understanding of the very small and the very large? I genuinely don't know the answer. I wonder whether we might help ourselves to understand, say, quantum theory, if we brought up children to play computer games beginning in early childhood, which had a make-believe world of balls going through two slits on a screen, a world in which the strange goings-on of quantum mechanics were enlarged by the computer's make-believe, so that they became familiar on the Middle-World scale of the stream. And similarly, a relativistic computer game, in which objects on the screen manifest the Lorentz contraction, and so on, to try to get ourselves \u2014 to get children into the way of thinking about it.I want to end by applying the idea of Middle World to our perceptions of each other. Most scientists today subscribe to a mechanistic view of the mind: we're the way we are because our brains are wired up as they are, our hormones are the way they are. We'd be different, our characters would be different, if our neuro-anatomy and our physiological chemistry were different. But we scientists are inconsistent. If we were consistent, our response to a misbehaving person, like a child-murderer, should be something like: this unit has a faulty component; it needs repairing. That's not what we say. What we say \u2014 and I include the most austerely mechanistic among us, which is probably me \u2014 what we say is, \"Vile monster, prison is too good for you.\" Or worse, we seek revenge, in all probability thereby triggering the next phase in an escalating cycle of counter-revenge, which we see, of course, all over the world today. In short, when we're thinking like academics, we regard people as elaborate and complicated machines, like computers or cars. But when we revert to being human, we behave more like Basil Fawlty, who, we remember, thrashed his car to teach it a lesson, when it wouldn't start on \"Gourmet Night.\"(Laughter)The reason we personify things like cars and computers is that just as monkeys live in an arboreal world and moles live in an underground world and water striders live in a surface tension-dominated flatland, we live in a social world. We swim through a sea of people \u2014 a social version of Middle World. We are evolved to second-guess the behavior of others by becoming brilliant, intuitive psychologists. Treating people as machines may be scientifically and philosophically accurate, but it's a cumbersome waste of time if you want to guess what this person is going to do next. The economically useful way to model a person is to treat him as a purposeful, goal-seeking agent with pleasures and pains, desires and intentions, guilt, blame-worthiness. Personification and the imputing of intentional purpose is such a brilliantly successful way to model humans, it's hardly surprising the same modeling software often seizes control when we're trying to think about entities for which it's not appropriate, like Basil Fawlty with his car or like millions of deluded people, with the universe as a whole.(Laughter)If the universe is queerer than we can suppose, is it just because we've been naturally selected to suppose only what we needed to suppose in order to survive in the Pleistocene of Africa? Or are our brains so versatile and expandable that we can train ourselves to break out of the box of our evolution? Or finally, are there some things in the universe so queer that no philosophy of beings, however godlike, could dream them?Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 98, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:17.934\nMy title: \"Queerer than we can\nsuppose: the strangeness of science.\"\n\n00:00:18.374 --> 00:00:22.516\n\"Queerer than we can suppose\" comes\nfrom J.B.S.

feel\nsolid and hard and impenetrable?\n\n00:04:53.157 --> 00:04:57.832\nAs an evolutionary biologist,\nI'd say this: our brains have evolved\n\n00:04:57.856 --> 00:05:03.934\nto help us survive within the orders\nof magnitude, of size and speed\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.698\nwhich our bodies operate at.\n\n00:05:06.143 --> 00:05:09.026\nWe never evolved to navigate\nin the world of

00:05:25.287\nIt's therefore useful\n\n00:05:25.311 --> 00:05:31.437\nfor our brains to construct notions\nlike \"solidity\" and \"impenetrability,\"\n\n00:05:31.461 --> 00:05:34.934\nbecause such

left,\n\n00:08:39.502 --> 00:08:41.057\nDouglas Adams is on the right.\n\n00:08:41.081 --> 00:08:44.779\nSteve Grand, in his book,\n\"Creation: Life and How to Make It,\"\n\n00:08:44.803 --> 00:08:49.606\nis positively scathing about our\npreoccupation with matter itself.\n\n00:08:50.656 --> 00:08:54.295\nWe have this tendency to think\nthat only solid, material things\n\n00:08:54.319 --> 00:08:56.200\nare really things at all.\n\n00:08:56.769 --> 00:09:01.200\nWaves of electromagnetic fluctuation\nin a vacuum seem unreal.\n\n00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:06.554\nVictorians thought the waves\nhad to be waves in some material medium:\n\n00:09:06.578 --> 00:09:07.728\nthe ether.\n\n00:09:08.338 --> 00:09:10.705\nBut we find real matter comforting\n\n00:09:10.729 --> 00:09:14.696\nonly because we've evolved\nto survive in Middle World,\n\n00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.466\nwhere matter is a useful fiction.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:22.196\nA whirlpool, for Steve Grand,\nis a thing with just as much reality\n\n00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.370\nas a rock.\n\n00:09:24.936 --> 00:09:27.586\nIn a desert plain in Tanzania,\n\n00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:30.800\nin the shadow of the volcano\nOl Doinyo Lengai,\n\n00:09:30.824 --> 00:09:32.881\nthere's a dune made of volcanic ash.\n\n00:09:33.609 --> 00:09:36.609\nThe beautiful thing\nis that it moves bodily.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.165\nIt's what's technically known\nas a \"barchan,\"\n\n00:09:39.189 --> 00:09:43.393\nand the entire dune walks\nacross the desert in a westerly direction\n\n00:09:43.417 --> 00:09:46.417\nat a speed of about 17 meters per year.\n\n00:09:46.783 --> 00:09:51.274\nIt retains its crescent shape and moves\nin the direction of the horns.\n\n00:09:51.298 --> 00:09:55.274\nWhat happens is that the wind blows\nthe sand up the shallow slope\n\n00:09:55.298 --> 00:09:56.506\non the other side,\n\n00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:00.275\nand then, as each sand grain hits\nthe top of the ridge, it cascades down\n\n00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:01.757\non the inside of the crescent,\n\n00:10:01.781 --> 00:10:04.777\nand so the whole horn-shaped dune moves.\n\n00:10:06.761 --> 00:10:10.251\nSteve Grand points out\nthat you and I are, ourselves,\n\n00:10:10.275 --> 00:10:13.207\nmore like a wave than a permanent thing.\n\n00:10:13.835 --> 00:10:15.686\nHe invites us, the reader,\n\n00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.115\nto think of an experience\nfrom your childhood,\n\n00:10:18.139 --> 00:10:19.697\nsomething you remember clearly,\n\n00:10:19.721 --> 00:10:22.755\nsomething you can see,\nfeel, maybe even smell,\n\n00:10:22.779 --> 00:10:24.494\nas if you were really there.\n\n00:10:24.518 --> 00:10:28.291\nAfter all, you really were there\nat the time, weren't you?\n\n00:10:28.315 --> 00:10:30.419\nHow else would you remember it?\n\n00:10:30.443 --> 00:10:33.101\nBut here is the bombshell:\nYou weren't there.\n\n00:10:33.125 --> 00:10:35.542\nNot a single atom\nthat is in your body today\n\n00:10:35.566 --> 00:10:38.076\nwas there when that event took place.\n\n00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.243\nMatter flows from place to place\n\n00:10:40.267 --> 00:10:43.195\nand momentarily comes together to be you.\n\n00:10:43.219 --> 00:10:44.571\nWhatever you are, therefore,\n\n00:10:44.595 --> 00:10:48.677\nyou are not the stuff\nof which you are made.\n\n00:10:48.701 --> 00:10:51.749\nIf that doesn't make the hair stand up\non the back of your neck,\n\n00:10:51.773 --> 00:10:55.089\nread it again until it does,\nbecause it is important.\n\n00:10:56.241 --> 00:11:00.335\nSo \"really\" isn't a word that we should\nuse with simple confidence.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.230\nIf a neutrino had a brain,\n\n00:11:03.254 --> 00:11:05.996\nwhich it evolved\nin neutrino-sized ancestors,\n\n00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:10.021\nit would say that rocks really\ndo consist of empty space.\n\n00:11:10.791 --> 00:11:13.584\nWe have brains that evolved\nin medium-sized ancestors\n\n00:11:13.608 --> 00:11:15.608\nwhich couldn't walk through rocks.\n\n00:11:15.988 --> 00:11:20.608\n\"Really,\" for an animal, is whatever\nits brain needs it to be\n\n00:11:20.632 --> 00:11:22.632\nin order to assist its survival.\n\n00:11:23.033 --> 00:11:25.780\nAnd because different species\nlive in different worlds,\n\n00:11:25.804 --> 00:11:29.891\nthere will be a discomforting\nvariety of \"reallys.\"\n\n00:11:32.328 --> 00:11:36.565\nWhat we see of the real world\nis not the unvarnished world,\n\n00:11:36.589 --> 00:11:40.870\nbut a model of the world,\nregulated and adjusted by sense data,\n\n00:11:40.894 --> 00:11:44.877\nbut constructed so it's useful\nfor dealing with the real world.\n\n00:11:45.417 --> 00:11:48.575\nThe nature of the model depends\non the kind of animal we are.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.591\nA flying animal needs\na different kind of model\n\n00:11:52.615 --> 00:11:55.315\nfrom a walking, climbing\nor swimming animal.\n\n00:11:55.339 --> 00:11:59.759\nA monkey's brain must have\nsoftware capable of simulating\n\n00:11:59.783 --> 00:12:03.078\na three-dimensional world\nof branches and trunks.\n\n00:12:03.102 --> 00:12:07.479\nA mole's software for constructing models\nof its world will be customized\n\n00:12:07.503 --> 00:12:09.455\nfor underground use.\n\n00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:13.346\nA water strider's brain\ndoesn't need 3D software at all,\n\n00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:15.520\nsince it lives on the surface of the pond,\n\n00:12:15.544 --> 00:12:17.864\nin an Edwin Abbott flatland.\n\n00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:23.639\nI've speculated that bats may see\ncolor with their ears.\n\n00:12:24.348 --> 00:12:27.542\nThe world model that a bat needs\nin order to navigate\n\n00:12:27.566 --> 00:12:29.543\nthrough three dimensions catching insects\n\n00:12:29.567 --> 00:12:32.640\nmust be pretty similar to the world\nmodel that any flying bird --\n\n00:12:32.664 --> 00:12:36.542\na day-flying bird like a swallow --\nneeds to perform the same kind of tasks.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:40.248\nThe fact that the bat uses\nechoes in pitch darkness\n\n00:12:40.272 --> 00:12:43.039\nto input the current\nvariables to its model,\n\n00:12:43.063 --> 00:12:45.832\nwhile the swallow uses\nlight, is incidental.\n\n00:12:46.414 --> 00:12:51.692\nBats, I've even suggested, use\nperceived hues, such as red and blue,\n\n00:12:51.716 --> 00:12:57.831\nas labels, internal labels,\nfor some useful aspect of echoes --\n\n00:12:57.855 --> 00:13:02.402\nperhaps the acoustic texture of surfaces,\nfurry or smooth and so on --\n\n00:13:02.426 --> 00:13:06.989\nin the same way as swallows or indeed,\nwe, use those perceived hues --\n\n00:13:07.013 --> 00:13:08.617\nredness and blueness, etc. --\n\n00:13:08.641 --> 00:13:11.513\nto label long and short\nwavelengths of light.\n\n00:13:11.537 --> 00:13:14.864\nThere's nothing inherent about red\nthat makes it long wavelength.\n\n00:13:15.705 --> 00:13:19.929\nThe point is that the nature of the model\nis governed by how it is to be used,\n\n00:13:19.953 --> 00:13:23.840\nrather than by the sensory\nmodality involved.\n\n00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:27.649\nJ.B.S. Haldane himself had\nsomething to say about animals\n\n00:13:27.673 --> 00:13:29.958\nwhose world is dominated by smell.\n\n00:13:30.493 --> 00:13:36.327\nDogs can distinguish two very similar\nfatty acids, extremely diluted:\n\n00:13:36.351 --> 00:13:39.035\ncaprylic acid and caproic acid.\n\n00:13:39.059 --> 00:13:40.457\nThe only difference, you see,\n\n00:13:40.481 --> 00:13:43.765\nis that one has an extra pair\nof carbon atoms in the chain.\n\n00:13:43.789 --> 00:13:48.277\nHaldane guesses that a dog would probably\nbe able to place the acids\n\n00:13:48.301 --> 00:13:51.745\nin the order of their molecular\nweights by their smells,\n\n00:13:51.769 --> 00:13:54.891\njust as a man could place\na number of piano wires\n\n00:13:54.915 --> 00:13:58.120\nin the order of their lengths\nby means of their notes.\n\n00:13:58.684 --> 00:14:02.471\nNow, there's another\nfatty acid, capric acid,\n\n00:14:02.495 --> 00:14:04.107\nwhich is just like the other two,\n\n00:14:04.131 --> 00:14:06.685\nexcept that it has two more carbon atoms.\n\n00:14:07.439 --> 00:14:10.262\nA dog that had never met\ncapric acid would, perhaps,\n\n00:14:10.286 --> 00:14:13.239\nhave no more trouble imagining its smell\n\n00:14:13.263 --> 00:14:16.419\nthan we would have trouble\nimagining a trumpet, say,\n\n00:14:16.443 --> 00:14:20.833\nplaying one note higher than we've heard\na trumpet play before.\n\n00:14:23.507 --> 00:14:29.789\nPerhaps dogs and rhinos and other\nsmell-oriented animals smell in color.\n\n00:14:30.226 --> 00:14:33.091\nAnd the argument would be exactly\nthe same as for the bats.\n\n00:14:35.211 --> 00:14:38.898\nMiddle World -- the range\nof sizes and speeds\n\n00:14:38.922 --> 00:14:42.510\nwhich we have evolved to feel\nintuitively comfortable with --\n\n00:14:42.534 --> 00:14:46.302\nis a bit like the narrow range\nof the electromagnetic spectrum\n\n00:14:46.326 --> 00:14:49.154\nthat we see as light of various colors.\n\n00:14:49.178 --> 00:14:51.498\nWe're blind to all\nfrequencies outside that,\n\n00:14:51.522 --> 00:14:54.026\nunless we use instruments to help us.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:59.100\nMiddle World is the narrow\nrange of reality\n\n00:14:59.124 --> 00:15:02.378\nwhich we judge to be normal,\nas opposed to the queerness\n\n00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:05.962\nof the very small, the very large\nand the very fast.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.807\nWe could make a similar\nscale of improbabilities;\n\n00:15:09.831 --> 00:15:12.442\nnothing is totally impossible.\n\n00:15:12.466 --> 00:15:15.727\nMiracles are just events\nthat are extremely improbable.\n\n00:15:16.188 --> 00:15:19.017\nA marble statue could wave its hand at us;\n\n00:15:19.041 --> 00:15:21.904\nthe atoms that make up\nits crystalline structure\n\n00:15:21.928 --> 00:15:24.145\nare all vibrating back and forth anyway.\n\n00:15:24.169 --> 00:15:25.827\nBecause there are so many of them,\n\n00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:27.934\nand because there's no\nagreement among them\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.034\nin their preferred direction of movement,\n\n00:15:30.058 --> 00:15:34.123\nthe marble, as we see it\nin Middle World, stays rock steady.\n\n00:15:34.147 --> 00:15:36.757\nBut the atoms in the hand\ncould all just happen to move\n\n00:15:36.781 --> 00:15:39.405\nthe same way at the same time,\nand again and again.\n\n00:15:39.429 --> 00:15:41.078\nIn this case, the hand would move,\n\n00:15:41.102 --> 00:15:44.885\nand we'd see it waving at us\nin Middle World.\n\n00:15:44.909 --> 00:15:47.495\nThe odds against it,\nof course, are so great\n\n00:15:47.519 --> 00:15:51.999\nthat if you set out writing zeros\nat the time of the origin of the universe,\n\n00:15:52.023 --> 00:15:55.038\nyou still would not have written\nenough zeros to this day.\n\n00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:59.192\nEvolution in Middle World\nhas not equipped us\n\n00:15:59.216 --> 00:16:02.843\nto handle very improbable events;\nwe don't live long enough.\n\n00:16:03.455 --> 00:16:08.146\nIn the vastness of astronomical space\nand geological time,\n\n00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.968\nthat which seems impossible\nin Middle World\n\n00:16:10.992 --> 00:16:13.241\nmight turn out to be inevitable.\n\n00:16:15.093 --> 00:16:18.658\nOne way to think about that\nis by counting planets.\n\n00:16:18.682 --> 00:16:21.364\nWe don't know how many planets\nthere are in the universe,\n\n00:16:21.388 --> 00:16:24.839\nbut a good estimate is about 10 to the 20,\nor 100 billion billion.\n\n00:16:25.332 --> 00:16:30.281\nAnd that gives us a nice way to express\nour estimate of life's improbability.\n\n00:16:31.668 --> 00:16:35.361\nWe could make some sort of landmark points\nalong a spectrum of improbability,\n\n00:16:35.385 --> 00:16:39.661\nwhich might look like the electromagnetic\nspectrum we just looked at.\n\n00:16:40.526 --> 00:16:43.367\nIf life has arisen only once on any --\n\n00:16:44.808 --> 00:16:50.031\nlife could originate once per planet,\ncould be extremely common\n\n00:16:50.055 --> 00:16:52.619\nor it could originate once per star\n\n00:16:52.643 --> 00:16:57.635\nor once per galaxy or maybe only\nonce in the entire universe,\n\n00:16:57.659 --> 00:16:59.844\nin which case it would have to be here.\n\n00:16:59.868 --> 00:17:01.919\nAnd somewhere up there would be the chance\n\n00:17:01.943 --> 00:17:03.744\nthat a frog would turn into a prince,\n\n00:17:03.768 --> 00:17:06.649\nand similar magical things like that.\n\n00:17:07.165 --> 00:17:11.033\nIf life has arisen on only one planet\nin the entire universe,\n\n00:17:11.057 --> 00:17:15.053\nthat planet has to be our planet,\nbecause here we are talking about it.\n\n00:17:15.077 --> 00:17:17.729\nAnd that means that if we want\nto avail ourselves of it,\n\n00:17:17.753 --> 00:17:21.590\nwe're allowed to postulate chemical events\nin the origin of life\n\n00:17:21.614 --> 00:17:25.494\nwhich have a probability as low\nas one in 100 billion billion.\n\n00:17:25.994 --> 00:17:28.627\nI don't think we shall have\nto avail ourselves of that,\n\n00:17:28.651 --> 00:17:31.618\nbecause I suspect that life\nis quite common in the universe.\n\n00:17:31.642 --> 00:17:34.680\nAnd when I say quite common,\nit could still be so rare\n\n00:17:34.704 --> 00:17:38.829\nthat no one island of life\never encounters another,\n\n00:17:38.853 --> 00:17:40.433\nwhich is a sad thought.\n\n00:17:41.623 --> 00:17:44.886\nHow shall we interpret\n\"queerer than we can suppose?\"\n\n00:17:45.355 --> 00:17:47.610\nQueerer than can in principle be supposed,\n\n00:17:47.634 --> 00:17:51.072\nor just queerer than we can suppose,\ngiven the limitations\n\n00:17:51.096 --> 00:17:55.358\nof our brain's evolutionary\napprenticeship in Middle World?\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:57.812\nCould we, by training and practice,\n\n00:17:57.836 --> 00:18:00.026\nemancipate ourselves from Middle World\n\n00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:04.693\nand achieve some sort of intuitive\nas well as mathematical understanding\n\n00:18:04.717 --> 00:18:06.856\nof the very small and the very large?\n\n00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.992\nI genuinely don't know the answer.\n\n00:18:09.016 --> 00:18:12.650\nI wonder whether we might help ourselves\nto understand, say, quantum theory,\n\n00:18:12.674 --> 00:18:15.934\nif we brought up children\nto play computer games\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:17.540\nbeginning in early childhood,\n\n00:18:17.564 --> 00:18:21.485\nwhich had a make-believe world of balls\ngoing through two slits on a screen,\n\n00:18:21.509 --> 00:18:25.497\na world in which the strange goings-on\nof quantum mechanics were enlarged\n\n00:18:25.521 --> 00:18:27.415\nby the computer's make-believe,\n\n00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:31.284\nso that they became familiar\non the Middle-World scale of the stream.\n\n00:18:31.308 --> 00:18:33.862\nAnd similarly, a relativistic\ncomputer game,\n\n00:18:33.886 --> 00:18:39.202\nin which objects on the screen manifest\nthe Lorentz contraction, and so on,\n\n00:18:39.226 --> 00:18:43.650\nto try to get ourselves -- to get children\ninto the way of thinking about it.\n\n00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:47.963\nI want to end by applying\nthe idea of Middle World\n\n00:18:47.987 --> 00:18:49.958\nto our perceptions of each other.\n\n00:18:50.693 --> 00:18:54.980\nMost scientists today subscribe\nto a mechanistic view of the mind:\n\n00:18:55.004 --> 00:18:58.408\nwe're the way we are because our brains\nare wired up as they are,\n\n00:18:58.432 --> 00:19:00.084\nour hormones are the way they are.\n\n00:19:00.108 --> 00:19:02.619\nWe'd be different, our characters\nwould be different,\n\n00:19:02.643 --> 00:19:06.506\nif our neuro-anatomy and our\nphysiological chemistry were different.\n\n00:19:06.826 --> 00:19:08.842\nBut we scientists are inconsistent.\n\n00:19:09.382 --> 00:19:10.763\nIf we were consistent,\n\n00:19:10.787 --> 00:19:14.100\nour response to a misbehaving\nperson, like a child-murderer,\n\n00:19:14.124 --> 00:19:15.458\nshould be something like:\n\n00:19:15.482 --> 00:19:18.728\nthis unit has a faulty component;\nit needs repairing.\n\n00:19:18.752 --> 00:19:19.934\nThat's not what we say.\n\n00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:24.121\nWhat we say -- and I include\nthe most austerely mechanistic among us,\n\n00:19:24.145 --> 00:19:25.359\nwhich is probably me --\n\n00:19:25.383 --> 00:19:29.193\nwhat we say is, \"Vile monster,\nprison is too good for you.\"\n\n00:19:29.217 --> 00:19:32.934\nOr worse, we seek revenge,\nin all probability thereby triggering\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:36.528\nthe next phase in an escalating\ncycle of counter-revenge,\n\n00:19:36.552 --> 00:19:39.010\nwhich we see, of course,\nall over the world today.\n\n00:19:39.454 --> 00:19:41.730\nIn short, when we're\nthinking like academics,\n\n00:19:41.754 --> 00:19:45.053\nwe regard people as elaborate\nand complicated machines,\n\n00:19:45.077 --> 00:19:47.222\nlike computers or cars.\n\n00:19:47.621 --> 00:19:49.635\nBut when we revert to being human,\n\n00:19:49.659 --> 00:19:53.370\nwe behave more like Basil Fawlty,\nwho, we remember,\n\n00:19:53.394 --> 00:19:55.233\nthrashed his car to teach it a lesson,\n\n00:19:55.257 --> 00:19:57.532\nwhen it wouldn't start on \"Gourmet Night.\"\n\n00:19:57.556 --> 00:19:58.909\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:59.266 --> 00:20:03.250\nThe reason we personify things\nlike cars and computers\n\n00:20:03.274 --> 00:20:06.642\nis that just as monkeys live\nin an arboreal world\n\n00:20:06.666 --> 00:20:09.328\nand moles live in an underground world\n\n00:20:09.352 --> 00:20:13.166\nand water striders live in a surface\ntension-dominated flatland,\n\n00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.319\nwe live in a social world.\n\n00:20:15.343 --> 00:20:17.529\nWe swim through a sea of people --\n\n00:20:17.553 --> 00:20:19.886\na social version of Middle World.\n\n00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.235\nWe are evolved to second-guess\nthe behavior of others\n\n00:20:24.259 --> 00:20:27.986\nby becoming brilliant,\nintuitive psychologists.\n\n00:20:28.422 --> 00:20:29.814\nTreating people as machines\n\n00:20:29.838 --> 00:20:33.353\nmay be scientifically\nand philosophically accurate,\n\n00:20:33.377 --> 00:20:35.290\nbut it's a cumbersome waste of time\n\n00:20:35.314 --> 00:20:38.475\nif you want to guess what this person\nis going to do next.\n\n00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:41.934\nThe economically useful way\nto model a person\n\n00:20:41.958 --> 00:20:45.569\nis to treat him as a purposeful,\ngoal-seeking agent\n\n00:20:45.593 --> 00:20:48.009\nwith pleasures and pains,\ndesires and intentions,\n\n00:20:48.033 --> 00:20:49.715\nguilt, blame-worthiness.\n\n00:20:50.414 --> 00:20:54.524\nPersonification and the imputing\nof

freakonomics of crack dealing", "duration": "1275", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/steven_levitt_analyzes_crack_economics", "transcript": "You'll be happy to know that I'll be talking not about my own tragedy, but other people's tragedy. It's a lot easier to be lighthearted about other people's tragedy than your own, and I want to keep it in the spirit of the conference.So, if you believe the media accounts, being a drug dealer in the height of the crack cocaine epidemic was a very glamorous life, in the words of Virginia Postrel. There was money, there was drugs, guns, women, you know, you name it \u2014 jewelry, bling-bling \u2014 it had it all.What I'm going to tell you today is that, in fact, based on 10 years of research, a unique opportunity to go inside a gang \u2014 to see the actual books, the financial records of the gang \u2014 that the answer turns out not to be that being in the gang was a glamorous life. But I think, more realistically, that being in a gang \u2014 selling drugs for a gang \u2014 is perhaps the worst job in all of America. And that's what I'd like to convince you of today.So there are three things I want to do. First, I want to explain how and why crack cocaine had such a profound influence on inner-city gangs. Secondly, I want to tell you how somebody like me came to be able to see the inner workings of a gang \u2014 an interesting story, I think. And then third, I want to tell you, in a very superficial way, about some of the things we found when we actually got to look at the financial records, the books, of the gang.So before I do that, just one warning, which is that this presentation has been rated 'R' by the Motion Picture Association of America. It contains adult themes, adult language. Given who is up on the stage, you'll be delighted to know that, in fact, there'll be no nudity \u2014(Laughter)Unexpected wardrobe malfunctions aside.(Laughter)So let me start by talking about crack cocaine, and how it transformed the gang. To do that, you have to actually go back to a time before crack cocaine, in the early '80s, and look at it from the perspective of a gang leader. Being a gang leader in the inner city wasn't such a bad deal in the mid-'80s \u2014 the early '80s, let me say.Now, you had a lot of power, and you got to beat people up \u2014 you got a lot of prestige, a lot of respect. But the thing is, there was no money in it. The gang had no way to make money. You couldn't charge dues to the people in the gang, because the people in the gang didn't have any money. You couldn't really make any money selling marijuana \u2014 marijuana's too cheap, it turns out. You can't get rich selling marijuana. You couldn't sell cocaine; cocaine's a great product \u2014 powdered cocaine \u2014 but you've got to know rich white people. And most of the inner-city gang members didn't know any rich white people, so couldn't sell to that market. You couldn't really do petty crime, either. Turns out, petty crime's a terrible way to make a living.As a result, as a gang leader, you had, you know, power \u2014 it's a pretty good life \u2014 but the thing was, in the end, you were living at home with your mother. And so it wasn't really a career. There were limits to how powerful and important you could be if you had to live at home with your mother.Then along comes crack cocaine. And in the words of Malcolm Gladwell, crack cocaine was the extra-chunky version of tomato sauce for the inner city.(Laughter)Because crack cocaine was an unbelievable innovation. I don't have time to talk about it today, but if you think about it, I would say that in the last 25 years, of every invention or innovation that's occurred in this country, the biggest one in terms of impact on the well-being of people who live in the inner city, was crack cocaine. And for the worse \u2014 not for the better, but for the worse. It had a huge impact on life.So what was it about crack cocaine? It was a brilliant way of getting the brain high. Because you could smoke crack cocaine \u2014 you can't smoke powdered cocaine \u2014 and smoking is a much more efficient mechanism of delivering a high than snorting it. And it turned out there was this audience that didn't know it wanted crack cocaine, but when it came, it really did. And it was a perfect drug; you could buy the cocaine that went into it for a dollar, sell it for five dollars. Highly addictive \u2014 the high was very short. So for fifteen minutes, you get this great high, and then when you come down, all you want to do is get high again.It created a wonderful market. And for the people who were there running the gang, it was a great way, seemingly, to make a lot of money. At least for the people on the top.So this is where we enter the picture. Not really me \u2014 I'm really a bit player in all this. My co-author, Sudhir Venkatesh, is the main character. He was a math major in college who had a good heart, and decided he wanted to get a sociology PhD, came to the University of Chicago. Now, the three months before he came to Chicago, he had spent following the Grateful Dead. And in his own words, he \"looked like a freak.\" He's a South Asian \u2014 very dark-skinned South Asian. Big man, and he had hair, in his words, \"down to his ass.\" Defied all kinds of boundaries: Was he black or white? Was he man or woman? He was really a curious sight to be seen.So he showed up at the University of Chicago, and the famous sociologist William Julius Wilson was doing a book that involved surveying people all across Chicago. He took one look at Sudhir, who was going to go do some surveys for him, and decided he knew exactly the place to send him, which was to one of the toughest, most notorious housing projects not just in Chicago, but in the entire United States.So Sudhir, the suburban boy who had never really been in the inner city, dutifully took his clipboard and walked down to this housing project, gets to the first building. The first building? Well, there's nobody there. But he hears some voices up in the stairwell, so he climbs up the stairwell, comes around the corner, and finds a group of young African-American men playing dice.This is about 1990, peak of the crack epidemic. This is a very dangerous job, being in a gang. You don't like to be surprised. You don't like to be surprised by people who come around the corner. And the mantra was: shoot first; ask questions later. Now, Sudhir was lucky \u2014 he was such a freak, and that clipboard probably saved his life, because they figured no other rival gang member would be coming up to shoot at them with a clipboard.(Laughter)So his greeting was not particularly warm, but they did say, well, OK \u2014 let's hear your questions on your survey. So \u2014 I kid you not \u2014 the first question on the survey that he was sent to ask was: \"How do you feel about being poor and Black in America?\"(Laughter)Makes you wonder about academics.(Laughter)So the choice of answers were:[A) Very Good B) Good C) Bad D) Very Bad](Laughter)What Sudhir found out is, in fact, that the real answer was the following: [A) Very Good B) Good C) Bad D) Very Bad E) Fuck you](Laughter)The survey was not, in the end, going to be what got Sudhir off the hook. He was held hostage overnight in the stairwell. There was a lot of gunfire, there were a lot of philosophical discussions he had with the gang members. By morning, the gang leader arrived, checked out Sudhir, decided he was no threat, and they let him go home. So Sudhir went home, took a shower, took a nap.And you and I, probably, faced with the situation, would think, \"I guess I'm going to write my dissertation on The Grateful Dead, I've been following them for the last three months.\"(Laughter)Sudhir, on the other hand, got right back, walked down to the housing project, went up to the second floor, and said: \"Hey, guys, I had so much fun hanging out with you last night, I wonder if I could do it again tonight.\" And that was the beginning of what turned out to be a beautiful relationship that involved Sudhir living in the housing project on and off for 10 years, hanging out in crack houses, going to jail with the gang members, having the windows shot out of his car, having the police break into his apartment and steal his computer disks \u2014 you name it. But ultimately, the story has a happy ending for Sudhir, who became one of the most respected sociologists in the country. And especially for me, as I sat in my office with my Excel spreadsheet open, waiting for Sudhir to come and deliver to me the latest load of data that he would get from the gang.(Laughter)It was one of the most unequal co-authoring relationships ever \u2014(Laughter)But I was glad to be the beneficiary of it.So what did we find? What did we find in the gang? Well, let me say one thing: We really got access to everybody in the gang. We got an inside look at the gang, from the very bottom up to the very top. They trusted Sudhir, in ways that really no academic has ever \u2014 or really anybody, any outsider \u2014 has ever earned the trust of these gangs, to the point where they actually opened up what was most interesting for me \u2014 their books, the financial records they kept. They made them available to us, and we not only could study them, but we could ask them questions about what was in them.So if I have to kind of summarize very quickly in the short time I have what the bottom line of what I take away from the gang is, it's that, if I had to draw a parallel between the gang and any other organization, it would be that the gang is just like McDonald's, in a lot of different respects \u2014 the restaurant McDonald's.So first, in one way, which isn't maybe the most interesting way, but it's a good way to start \u2014 is in the way it's organized, the hierarchy of the gang, the way it looks. So here's what the org chart of the gang looks like. I don't know if you know much about org charts, but if you were to assign a stripped-down and simplified McDonald's org chart, this is exactly what it would look like. It's amazing, but the top level of the gang, they actually call themselves the \"Board of Directors.\"(Laughter)And Sudhir says it's not like these guys had a very sophisticated view of what happened in American corporate life, but they had seen movies like \"Wall Street,\" and they had learned a little bit about what it was like to be in the real world. Now, below that board of directors, you've got essentially what are regional VPs \u2014 people who control, say, the South Side of Chicago, or the West Side of Chicago.Sudhir got to know very well the guy who had the unfortunate assignment of trying to take the Iowa franchise, which, it turned out, for this black gang, was not one of the more brilliant financial endeavors they undertook.(Laughter)But the thing that really makes the gang seem like McDonald's is its franchisees. The guys who are running the local gangs \u2014 the four-square-block by four-square-block areas \u2014 they're just like the guys, in some sense, who are running the McDonald's. They are the entrepreneurs. They get the exclusive property rights to control the drug-selling. They get the name of the gang behind them, for merchandising and marketing. And they're the ones who basically make the profit or lose a profit, depending on how good they are at running the business.Now, the group I really want you to think about, though, are the ones at the bottom \u2014 the foot soldiers. These are the teenagers, typically, who'd be standing out on the street corner, selling the drugs. Extremely dangerous work. And important to note is that almost all of the weight, all of the people in this organization are at the bottom \u2014 just like McDonald's. So in some sense, the foot soldiers are a lot like the people who are taking your order at McDonald's, and it's not just by chance that they're like them. In fact, in these neighborhoods, they'd be the same people. So the same kids who are working in the gang were actually, at the very same time, typically working part-time at a place like McDonald's. Which already foreshadows the main result that I've talked about, about what a crappy job it was, being in the gang. Because obviously, if being in the gang were such a wonderful, lucrative job, why in the world would these guys moonlight at McDonald's?So what do the wages look like? You might be surprised. But based on being able to talk to them and to see their records, this is what it looks like in terms of the wages. The hourly wage the foot soldiers were earning was $3.50 an hour. It was below the minimum wage. And this is well-documented. It's easy to see by the patterns of consumption they have. It really is not fiction \u2014 it's fact. There was very little money in the gang, especially at the bottom.Now if you managed to rise up, say, and be that local leader, the guy who's the equivalent of the McDonald's franchisee, you'd be making 100,000 dollars a year. And that, in some ways, was the best job you could hope to get if you were growing up in one of these neighborhoods as a young black male. If you managed to rise to the very top, 200,000 or 400,000 dollars a year is what you'd hope to make. Truly, you would be a great success story.And one of the sad parts of this is that, indeed, among the many other ramifications of crack cocaine is that the most talented individuals in these communities \u2014 this is what they were striving for. They weren't trying to make it in legitimate ways, because there were no legitimate channels out. This was the best way out. And it actually was the right choice, probably, to try to make it out this way.You look at this, the relationship to McDonald's breaks down here. The money looks about the same. Why is it such a bad job? Well, the reason it's such a bad job is that there's somebody shooting at you a lot of the time. So, with shooting at you, what are the death rates? We found, in our gang \u2014 and admittedly, this was not really a standard situation; this was a time of intense violence, of a lot of gang wars, as this gang actually became quite successful. But there were costs. And so the death rate \u2014 not to mention the rate of being arrested, sent to prison, being wounded \u2014 the death rate in our sample was seven percent per person per year. You're in the gang for four years, you expect to die with about a 25 percent likelihood. That is about as high as you can get.So for comparison's purposes, let's think about some other walk of life you may expect might be extremely risky. Let's say that you were a murderer and you were convicted of murder, and you're sent to death row. It turns out, the death rates on death row from all causes, including execution: two percent a year.(Laughter)So it's a lot safer being on death row than it is selling drugs out on the street.That gives you some pause, for those of you who believe that a death penalty's going to have an enormous deterrent effect on crime. To give you a sense of just how bad the inner city was during crack \u2014 and I'm not really focusing on the negatives, but really, there's another story to tell you there \u2014 if you look at the death rates just of random, young black males growing up in the inner city in the United States, the death rates during crack were about one percent. That's extremely high. And this is violent death \u2014 it's unbelievable, in some sense.To put it into perspective: if you compare this to the soldiers in Iraq, for instance, right now fighting the war: 0.5 percent. So in some very literal way, the young black men who were growing up in this country were living in a war zone, very much in the sense that the soldiers over in Iraq are fighting in a war.So why in the world, you might ask, would anybody be willing to stand out on a street corner selling drugs for $3.50 an hour, with a 25 percent chance of dying over the next four years? Why would they do that? And I think there are a couple answers.I think the first one is that they got fooled by history. It used to be the gang was a rite of passage; that the young people controlled the gang; that as you got older, you dropped out of the gang. So what happened was, the people who happened to be in the right place at the right time \u2014 the people who happened to be leading the gang in the mid-to-late-'80s \u2014 became very, very wealthy. And so the logical thing to think was that they are going to age out of the gang like everybody else has, and the next generation is going to take over and get the wealth.There are striking similarities, I think, to the Internet boom. The first set of people in Silicon Valley got very, very rich. And then all of my friends said, \"Maybe I should go do that, too.\" And they were willing to work very cheap for stock options that never came. In some sense, that's what happened, exactly, to the set of people we were looking at. They were willing to start at the bottom, just like, say, a first-year lawyer at a law firm is willing to start at the bottom, work 80-hour weeks for not that much money, because they think they're going to make partner. But the rules changed, and they never got to make partner.Indeed, the same people who were running all of the major gangs in the late 1980s are still running the major gangs in Chicago today. They never passed on any of the wealth, So everybody got stuck at that $3.50-an-hour job, and it turned out to be a disaster.The other thing the gang was very good at was marketing and trickery. And so for instance, one thing the gang would do is \u2014 the gang leaders would have big entourages, and they'd drive fancy cars and have fancy jewelry. So what Sudhir eventually realized as he hung out with them more, is that, really, they didn't own those cars \u2014 they just leased them, because they couldn't afford to own the fancy cars. And they didn't really have gold jewelry, they had gold-plated jewelry. It goes back to, you know, the real-real versus the fake-real.And really, they did all sorts of things to trick the young people into thinking what a great deal the gang was going to be. So for instance, they would give a 14-year-old kid a whole roll of bills to hold. That 14-year-old kid would say to his friends, \"Hey, look at all the money I got in the gang.\" It wasn't his money \u2014 until he spent it, and then he was in debt to the gang, and was sort of an indentured servant for a while. So I have a couple minutes.Let me do one last thing I hadn't thought I'd have time to do, which is to talk about what we learned more generally about economics, from the study of the gang.So, economists tend to talk in technical words. Often, our theories fail quite miserably when we over the data, but what's kind of interesting is that in this setting, it turned out that some of the economic theories that worked not so well in the real economy worked very well in the drug economy, in some sense, because it's unfettered capitalism. Here's an economic principle. This is one of the basic ideas in labor economics, called a \"compensating differential.\" It's the idea that the increment to wages that a worker requires to leave him indifferent between performing two tasks, one which is more unpleasant than the other. Compensating differential \u2014 it's why we think garbagemen might be paid more than people who work in parks.The words of one of the members of the gang, I think, make this clear. So it turns out \u2014 I'm sort of getting ahead of myself \u2014 it turns out, in the gang, when there's a war going on, they actually pay the foot soldiers twice as much money. It's exactly this concept. Because they're not willing to be at risk. And the words of a gang member capture it quite nicely, he says: \"Would you stand around here when all this shit ...\" \u2014 the shooting \u2014 \"... if all this shit's going on? No, right? So if I gonna be asked to put my life on the line, then front me the cash, man.\" I think the gang member says it much more articulately than the economist, about what's going on.(Laughter)Here's another one. Economists talk about game theory, that every two-person game has a Nash equilibrium. Here's the translation you get from the gang member. They're talking about the decision of why they don't go shoot \u2014 One thing that turns out to be a great business tactic in the gang: if you go and just shoot guns in the air in the other gang's territory \u2014 people are afraid to go buy drugs there, they're going to come into your neighborhood.Here's what he says about why they don't do that: \"If we start shooting around there, the other gang's territory, nobody, I mean, you dig it, nobody gonna step on their turf. But we gotta be careful, 'cause they can shoot around here too and then we all fucked.\"(Laughter)So that's the same concept. Then again, sometimes economists get it wrong. One thing we observed in the data is that it looked like \u2014 the gang leader always got paid. No matter how bad it was economically, he always got himself paid.We had some theories related to cash flow, and lack of access to capital markets, and things like that. Then we asked the gang member, \"Why is it you always get paid and your workers don't always get paid?\" His response is, \"You got all these niggers below you who want your job, you dig? If you start taking losses, they see you as weak and shit.\" And I thought about it and said, \"CEOs often pay themselves million-dollar bonuses, even when companies are losing a lot of money. And it never would really occur to an economist that this idea of 'weak and shit' could really be important.\"(Laughter)Maybe \"weak and shit\" is an important hypothesis that needs more analysis.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 29, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:16.890\nYou'll be happy to know that\nI'll be talking not about my own tragedy,\n\n00:00:16.914 --> 00:00:18.215\nbut other people's tragedy.\n\n00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:21.308\nIt's a lot easier to be lighthearted\nabout other people's tragedy\n\n00:00:21.332 --> 00:00:22.483\nthan your own,\n\n00:00:22.507 --> 00:00:25.234\nand I want to keep it\nin the spirit of the conference.\n\n00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:29.196\nSo, if you believe the media accounts,\n\n00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.773\nbeing a drug dealer in the height\nof the crack cocaine epidemic\n\n00:00:33.797 --> 00:00:37.623\nwas a very glamorous life,\nin the words of Virginia Postrel.\n\n00:00:37.647 --> 00:00:41.826\nThere was money,\nthere was drugs, guns, women,\n\n00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.338\nyou know, you name it -- jewelry,\nbling-bling -- it had it all.\n\n00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:51.603\nWhat I'm going to tell you today is that,\nin fact, based on 10 years of research,\n\n00:00:51.627 --> 00:00:54.086\na unique opportunity\nto go inside a gang --\n\n00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.018\nto see the actual books,\nthe financial records of the gang --\n\n00:00:57.042 --> 00:00:59.410\nthat the answer turns out not to be\n\n00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:02.934\nthat being in the gang\nwas a glamorous life.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.709\nBut I think, more realistically,\nthat being in a gang --\n\n00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:09.639\nselling drugs for a gang -- is perhaps\nthe worst job in all of America.\n\n00:01:09.663 --> 00:01:12.528\nAnd that's what I'd like\nto convince you of today.\n\n00:01:12.552 --> 00:01:14.463\nSo there are three things I want to do.\n\n00:01:14.487 --> 00:01:18.195\nFirst, I want to explain\nhow and why crack cocaine\n\n00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:22.276\nhad such a profound influence\non inner-city gangs.\n\n00:01:23.752 --> 00:01:25.559\nSecondly, I want to tell you\n\n00:01:25.583 --> 00:01:30.459\nhow somebody like me\ncame to be able to see\n\n00:01:30.483 --> 00:01:33.840\nthe inner workings of a gang --\nan interesting story, I think.\n\n00:01:33.864 --> 00:01:36.774\nAnd then third, I want to tell you,\nin a very superficial way,\n\n00:01:36.798 --> 00:01:38.385\nabout some of the things we found\n\n00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.973\nwhen we actually got to look\nat the financial records,\n\n00:01:40.997 --> 00:01:42.685\nthe books, of the gang.\n\n00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:46.138\nSo before I do that, just one warning,\n\n00:01:46.162 --> 00:01:49.896\nwhich is that this presentation\nhas been rated 'R'\n\n00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.194\nby the Motion Picture\nAssociation of America.\n\n00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.289\nIt contains adult themes, adult language.\n\n00:01:55.668 --> 00:01:58.368\nGiven who is up on the stage,\nyou'll be delighted to know\n\n00:01:58.392 --> 00:02:00.934\nthat, in fact, there'll be no nudity --\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.351\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:03.375 --> 00:02:05.958\nUnexpected wardrobe malfunctions aside.\n\n00:02:05.982 --> 00:02:10.896\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.453\nSo let me start by talking\nabout crack cocaine,\n\n00:02:14.477 --> 00:02:16.151\nand how it transformed the gang.\n\n00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.863\nTo do that, you have to actually go\nback to a time before crack cocaine,\n\n00:02:19.887 --> 00:02:23.297\nin the early '80s, and look at it\nfrom the perspective of a gang leader.\n\n00:02:23.321 --> 00:02:29.261\nBeing a gang leader in the inner city\nwasn't such a bad deal in the mid-'80s --\n\n00:02:29.285 --> 00:02:30.778\nthe early '80s, let me say.\n\n00:02:30.802 --> 00:02:33.701\nNow, you had a lot of power,\nand you got to beat people up --\n\n00:02:33.725 --> 00:02:36.257\nyou got a lot of prestige,\na lot of respect.\n\n00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:38.834\nBut the thing is,\nthere was no money in it.\n\n00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:40.519\nThe gang had no way to make money.\n\n00:02:40.543 --> 00:02:42.945\nYou couldn't charge dues\nto the people in the gang,\n\n00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.579\nbecause the people in the gang\ndidn't have any money.\n\n00:02:45.603 --> 00:02:48.211\nYou couldn't really make any money\nselling marijuana --\n\n00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:50.631\nmarijuana's too cheap, it turns out.\n\n00:02:50.655 --> 00:02:52.521\nYou can't get rich selling marijuana.\n\n00:02:52.545 --> 00:02:54.336\nYou couldn't sell cocaine;\n\n00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.774\ncocaine's a great product --\npowdered cocaine --\n\n00:02:56.798 --> 00:02:58.764\nbut you've got to know rich white people.\n\n00:02:58.788 --> 00:03:02.281\nAnd most of the inner-city gang members\ndidn't know any rich white people,\n\n00:03:02.305 --> 00:03:03.844\nso couldn't sell to that market.\n\n00:03:03.868 --> 00:03:05.888\nYou couldn't really do\npetty crime, either.\n\n00:03:05.912 --> 00:03:08.587\nTurns out, petty crime's\na terrible way to make a living.\n\n00:03:08.611 --> 00:03:11.766\nAs a result, as a gang leader,\nyou had, you know, power --\n\n00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.481\nit's a pretty good life --\nbut the thing was, in the end,\n\n00:03:14.505 --> 00:03:16.472\nyou were living at home with your mother.\n\n00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:18.179\nAnd so it wasn't really a career.\n\n00:03:18.203 --> 00:03:21.041\nThere were limits to how powerful\nand important you could be\n\n00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:23.137\nif you had to live at home\nwith your mother.\n\n00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:25.871\nThen along comes crack cocaine.\n\n00:03:26.264 --> 00:03:29.279\nAnd in the words of Malcolm Gladwell,\n\n00:03:29.303 --> 00:03:33.734\ncrack cocaine was the extra-chunky\nversion of tomato sauce\n\n00:03:33.758 --> 00:03:34.909\nfor the inner city.\n\n00:03:34.933 --> 00:03:35.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.462\nBecause crack cocaine\nwas an unbelievable innovation.\n\n00:03:38.486 --> 00:03:41.707\nI don't have time to talk about it today,\nbut if you think about it,\n\n00:03:41.731 --> 00:03:43.574\nI would say that in the last 25 years,\n\n00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:46.734\nof every invention or innovation\nthat's occurred in this country,\n\n00:03:46.758 --> 00:03:48.537\nthe biggest one in terms of impact\n\n00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:52.427\non the well-being of people\nwho live in the inner city,\n\n00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:53.602\nwas crack cocaine.\n\n00:03:53.626 --> 00:03:56.407\nAnd for the worse --\nnot for the better, but for the worse.\n\n00:03:56.431 --> 00:03:57.885\nIt had a huge impact on life.\n\n00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.773\nSo what was it about crack cocaine?\n\n00:03:59.797 --> 00:04:04.368\nIt was a brilliant way\nof getting the brain high.\n\n00:04:04.392 --> 00:04:09.934\nBecause you could smoke crack cocaine --\nyou can't smoke powdered cocaine --\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:13.343\nand smoking is a much more efficient\nmechanism of delivering a high\n\n00:04:13.367 --> 00:04:14.870\nthan snorting it.\n\n00:04:14.894 --> 00:04:19.343\nAnd it turned out there was this audience\nthat didn't know it wanted crack cocaine,\n\n00:04:19.367 --> 00:04:21.139\nbut when it came, it really did.\n\n00:04:21.163 --> 00:04:22.568\nAnd it was a perfect drug;\n\n00:04:22.592 --> 00:04:26.768\nyou could buy the cocaine\nthat went into it for a dollar,\n\n00:04:26.792 --> 00:04:28.277\nsell it for five dollars.\n\n00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:30.629\nHighly addictive --\nthe high was very short.\n\n00:04:30.653 --> 00:04:33.325\nSo for fifteen minutes,\nyou get this great high,\n\n00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:34.706\nand then when you come down,\n\n00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.426\nall you want to do is get high again.\n\n00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.340\nIt created a wonderful market.\n\n00:04:39.364 --> 00:04:42.496\nAnd for the people who were there\nrunning the gang,\n\n00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.934\nit was a great way, seemingly,\nto make a lot of money.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.143\nAt least for the people on the top.\n\n00:04:48.167 --> 00:04:50.025\nSo this is where we enter the picture.\n\n00:04:50.049 --> 00:04:52.554\nNot really me -- I'm really\na bit player in all this.\n\n00:04:52.578 --> 00:04:55.443\nMy co-author, Sudhir Venkatesh,\nis the main character.\n\n00:04:55.467 --> 00:05:00.934\nHe was a math major in college\nwho had a good heart,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.719\nand decided he wanted\nto get a sociology PhD,\n\n00:05:03.743 --> 00:05:05.372\ncame to the University of Chicago.\n\n00:05:05.396 --> 00:05:08.026\nNow, the three months\nbefore he came to Chicago,\n\n00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.581\nhe had spent following the Grateful Dead.\n\n00:05:10.605 --> 00:05:14.072\nAnd in his own words,\nhe \"looked like a freak.\"\n\n00:05:14.096 --> 00:05:17.958\nHe's a South Asian --\nvery dark-skinned South Asian.\n\n00:05:18.308 --> 00:05:22.054\nBig man, and he had hair,\nin his words, \"down to his ass.\"\n\n00:05:22.753 --> 00:05:24.472\nDefied all kinds of boundaries:\n\n00:05:24.496 --> 00:05:26.734\nWas he black or white?\nWas he man or woman?\n\n00:05:26.758 --> 00:05:29.425\nHe was really a curious sight to be seen.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.093\nSo he showed up\nat the University of Chicago,\n\n00:05:32.117 --> 00:05:34.800\nand the famous sociologist\nWilliam Julius Wilson\n\n00:05:34.824 --> 00:05:39.958\nwas doing a book that involved\nsurveying people all across Chicago.\n\n00:05:40.472 --> 00:05:44.096\nHe took one look at Sudhir, who was going\nto go do some surveys for him,\n\n00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.490\nand decided he knew exactly\nthe place to send him,\n\n00:05:46.514 --> 00:05:49.638\nwhich was to one of the toughest,\nmost notorious housing projects\n\n00:05:49.662 --> 00:05:52.153\nnot just in Chicago,\nbut in the entire United States.\n\n00:05:52.177 --> 00:05:55.846\nSo Sudhir, the suburban boy who had never\nreally been in the inner city,\n\n00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.773\ndutifully took his clipboard\nand walked down to this housing project,\n\n00:06:00.797 --> 00:06:02.336\ngets to the first building.\n\n00:06:02.725 --> 00:06:05.198\nThe first building?\nWell, there's nobody there.\n\n00:06:05.222 --> 00:06:08.352\nBut he hears some voices\nup in the stairwell,\n\n00:06:08.376 --> 00:06:11.934\nso he climbs up the stairwell,\ncomes around the corner,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:16.039\nand finds a group of young\nAfrican-American men playing dice.\n\n00:06:17.251 --> 00:06:20.230\nThis is about 1990,\npeak of the crack epidemic.\n\n00:06:20.254 --> 00:06:22.412\nThis is a very dangerous job,\nbeing in a gang.\n\n00:06:22.436 --> 00:06:23.951\nYou don't like to be surprised.\n\n00:06:23.975 --> 00:06:27.488\nYou don't like to be surprised\nby people who come around the corner.\n\n00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:30.836\nAnd the mantra was:\nshoot first; ask questions later.\n\n00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.042\nNow, Sudhir was lucky --\nhe was such a freak,\n\n00:06:33.066 --> 00:06:35.277\nand that clipboard\nprobably saved his life,\n\n00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:37.524\nbecause they figured no other\nrival gang member\n\n00:06:37.548 --> 00:06:40.043\nwould be coming up to shoot\nat them with a clipboard.\n\n00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:41.068\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:41.092 --> 00:06:44.123\nSo his greeting was not particularly\nwarm, but they did say,\n\n00:06:44.147 --> 00:06:47.790\nwell, OK -- let's hear\nyour questions on your survey.\n\n00:06:48.218 --> 00:06:49.423\nSo -- I kid you not --\n\n00:06:49.447 --> 00:06:53.234\nthe first question on the survey\nthat he was sent to ask was:\n\n00:06:53.258 --> 00:06:55.964\n\"How do you feel about being\npoor and Black in America?\"\n\n00:06:55.988 --> 00:06:59.119\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:59.143 --> 00:07:00.834\nMakes you wonder about academics.\n\n00:07:00.858 --> 00:07:02.762\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:02.786 --> 00:07:04.667\nSo the choice of answers were:\n\n00:07:04.691 --> 00:07:08.338\n[A) Very Good B) Good C) Bad D) Very Bad]\n\n00:07:08.362 --> 00:07:10.363\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:10.387 --> 00:07:13.892\nWhat Sudhir found out is, in fact,\nthat the real answer was the following:\n\n00:07:13.916 --> 00:07:16.791\n[A) Very Good B) Good C) Bad\nD) Very Bad E) Fuck you]\n\n00:07:16.815 --> 00:07:18.412\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:18.436 --> 00:07:21.956\nThe survey was not, in the end, going\nto be what got Sudhir off the hook.\n\n00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.460\nHe was held hostage\novernight in the stairwell.\n\n00:07:25.484 --> 00:07:26.789\nThere was a lot of gunfire,\n\n00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:30.432\nthere were a lot of philosophical\ndiscussions he had with the gang members.\n\n00:07:30.456 --> 00:07:32.206\nBy morning, the gang leader arrived,\n\n00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.348\nchecked out Sudhir,\ndecided he was no threat,\n\n00:07:34.372 --> 00:07:35.594\nand they let him go home.\n\n00:07:35.618 --> 00:07:38.746\nSo Sudhir went home,\ntook a shower, took a nap.\n\n00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.569\nAnd you and I, probably, faced\nwith the situation, would think,\n\n00:07:43.593 --> 00:07:46.665\n\"I guess I'm going to write\nmy dissertation on The Grateful Dead,\n\n00:07:46.689 --> 00:07:49.128\nI've been following them\nfor the last three months.\"\n\n00:07:49.152 --> 00:07:50.160\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:50.184 --> 00:07:51.443\nSudhir, on the other hand,\n\n00:07:51.467 --> 00:07:53.888\ngot right back, walked\ndown to the housing project,\n\n00:07:53.912 --> 00:07:55.255\nwent up to the second floor,\n\n00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:59.181\nand said: \"Hey, guys, I had so much fun\nhanging out with you last night,\n\n00:07:59.205 --> 00:08:01.183\nI wonder if I could do it again tonight.\"\n\n00:08:01.207 --> 00:08:04.838\nAnd that was the beginning of what turned\nout to be a beautiful relationship\n\n00:08:04.862 --> 00:08:08.457\nthat involved Sudhir living in the housing\nproject on and off for 10 years,\n\n00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:13.236\nhanging out in crack houses,\ngoing to jail with the gang members,\n\n00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.798\nhaving the windows shot out of his car,\n\n00:08:15.822 --> 00:08:19.320\nhaving the police break into his apartment\nand steal his computer disks --\n\n00:08:19.344 --> 00:08:20.502\nyou name it.\n\n00:08:20.526 --> 00:08:23.342\nBut ultimately, the story\nhas a happy ending for Sudhir,\n\n00:08:23.366 --> 00:08:26.609\nwho became one of the most\nrespected sociologists in the country.\n\n00:08:26.633 --> 00:08:28.002\nAnd especially for me,\n\n00:08:28.026 --> 00:08:31.445\nas I sat in my office\nwith my Excel spreadsheet open,\n\n00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:34.806\nwaiting for Sudhir to come and deliver\nto me the latest load of data\n\n00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.716\nthat he would get from the gang.\n\n00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.509\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:40.533 --> 00:08:43.937\nIt was one of the most unequal\nco-authoring relationships ever --\n\n00:08:43.961 --> 00:08:44.981\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:45.005 --> 00:08:48.496\nBut I was glad to be\nthe beneficiary of it.\n\n00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.894\nSo what did we find?\n\n00:08:50.347 --> 00:08:52.299\nWhat did we find in the gang?\n\n00:08:52.729 --> 00:08:54.415\nWell, let me say one thing:\n\n00:08:54.439 --> 00:08:58.042\nWe really got access\nto everybody in the gang.\n\n00:08:58.066 --> 00:09:02.390\nWe got an inside look at the gang,\nfrom the very bottom up to the very top.\n\n00:09:02.414 --> 00:09:07.400\nThey trusted Sudhir, in ways\nthat really no academic has ever --\n\n00:09:07.424 --> 00:09:11.976\nor really anybody, any outsider --\nhas ever earned the trust of these gangs,\n\n00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.457\nto the point where they actually opened up\n\n00:09:14.481 --> 00:09:16.738\nwhat was most interesting\nfor me -- their books,\n\n00:09:16.762 --> 00:09:18.301\nthe financial records they kept.\n\n00:09:18.325 --> 00:09:21.397\nThey made them available to us,\nand we not only could study them,\n\n00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:24.017\nbut we could ask them questions\nabout what was in them.\n\n00:09:24.041 --> 00:09:27.467\nSo if I have to kind of summarize\nvery quickly in the short time I have\n\n00:09:27.491 --> 00:09:31.441\nwhat the bottom line of what\nI take away from the gang is,\n\n00:09:31.465 --> 00:09:34.175\nit's that, if I had to draw\na parallel between the gang\n\n00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:36.318\nand any other organization,\n\n00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:39.633\nit would be that the gang\nis just like McDonald's,\n\n00:09:39.657 --> 00:09:42.506\nin a lot of different respects --\nthe restaurant McDonald's.\n\n00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.148\nSo first, in one way,\n\n00:09:44.172 --> 00:09:47.787\nwhich isn't maybe the most interesting\nway, but it's a good way to start --\n\n00:09:47.811 --> 00:09:50.457\nis in the way it's organized,\nthe hierarchy of the gang,\n\n00:09:50.481 --> 00:09:51.632\nthe way it looks.\n\n00:09:51.656 --> 00:09:54.110\nSo here's what the org chart\nof the gang looks like.\n\n00:09:54.134 --> 00:09:56.341\nI don't know if you know much\nabout org charts,\n\n00:09:56.365 --> 00:10:00.072\nbut if you were to assign a stripped-down\nand simplified McDonald's org chart,\n\n00:10:00.096 --> 00:10:02.050\nthis is exactly what it would look like.\n\n00:10:02.074 --> 00:10:04.268\nIt's amazing, but the top\nlevel of the gang,\n\n00:10:04.292 --> 00:10:06.919\nthey actually call themselves\nthe \"Board of Directors.\"\n\n00:10:06.943 --> 00:10:08.022\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:08.046 --> 00:10:09.993\nAnd Sudhir says\n\n00:10:10.017 --> 00:10:13.411\nit's not like these guys\nhad a very sophisticated view\n\n00:10:13.435 --> 00:10:16.900\nof what happened\nin American corporate life,\n\n00:10:16.924 --> 00:10:18.989\nbut they had seen movies\nlike \"Wall Street,\"\n\n00:10:19.013 --> 00:10:22.388\nand they had learned a little bit\nabout what it was like\n\n00:10:22.412 --> 00:10:24.363\nto be in the real world.\n\n00:10:24.387 --> 00:10:26.221\nNow, below that board of directors,\n\n00:10:26.245 --> 00:10:28.650\nyou've got essentially\nwhat are regional VPs --\n\n00:10:28.674 --> 00:10:32.459\npeople who control, say, the South Side\nof Chicago, or the West Side of Chicago.\n\n00:10:32.483 --> 00:10:35.934\nSudhir got to know very well the guy\nwho had the unfortunate assignment\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.297\nof trying to take the Iowa franchise,\n\n00:10:38.321 --> 00:10:40.382\nwhich, it turned out, for this black gang,\n\n00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:44.504\nwas not one of the more brilliant\nfinancial endeavors they undertook.\n\n00:10:44.528 --> 00:10:45.782\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:45.806 --> 00:10:50.102\nBut the thing that really makes the gang\nseem like McDonald's is its franchisees.\n\n00:10:50.126 --> 00:10:54.466\nThe guys who are running\nthe local gangs --\n\n00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:57.441\nthe four-square-block\nby four-square-block areas --\n\n00:10:57.465 --> 00:11:00.967\nthey're just like the guys, in some sense,\nwho are running the McDonald's.\n\n00:11:00.991 --> 00:11:02.460\nThey are the entrepreneurs.\n\n00:11:02.484 --> 00:11:06.220\nThey get the exclusive property rights\nto control the drug-selling.\n\n00:11:06.244 --> 00:11:12.756\nThey get the name of the gang behind them,\nfor merchandising and marketing.\n\n00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:16.597\nAnd they're the ones who basically\nmake the profit or lose a profit,\n\n00:11:16.621 --> 00:11:19.200\ndepending on how good\nthey are at running the business.\n\n00:11:19.224 --> 00:11:22.129\nNow, the group I really want you\nto think about, though,\n\n00:11:22.153 --> 00:11:24.406\nare the ones at the bottom --\nthe foot soldiers.\n\n00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.478\nThese are the teenagers, typically,\n\n00:11:26.502 --> 00:11:29.526\nwho'd be standing out on the street\ncorner, selling the drugs.\n\n00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.970\nExtremely dangerous work.\n\n00:11:31.994 --> 00:11:37.372\nAnd important to note is that almost all\nof the weight, all of the people\n\n00:11:37.396 --> 00:11:40.453\nin this organization are at the bottom --\njust like McDonald's.\n\n00:11:40.477 --> 00:11:43.437\nSo in some sense, the foot soldiers\nare a lot like the people\n\n00:11:43.461 --> 00:11:45.427\nwho are taking your order at McDonald's,\n\n00:11:45.451 --> 00:11:47.889\nand it's not just by chance\nthat they're like them.\n\n00:11:47.913 --> 00:11:50.714\nIn fact, in these neighborhoods,\nthey'd be the same people.\n\n00:11:50.738 --> 00:11:53.639\nSo the same kids who are working\nin the gang were actually,\n\n00:11:53.663 --> 00:11:56.422\nat the very same time,\ntypically working part-time\n\n00:11:56.446 --> 00:11:57.977\nat a place like McDonald's.\n\n00:11:58.001 --> 00:12:01.392\nWhich already foreshadows\nthe main result that I've talked about,\n\n00:12:01.416 --> 00:12:04.506\nabout what a crappy job\nit was, being in the gang.\n\n00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:08.181\nBecause obviously, if being in the gang\nwere such a wonderful, lucrative job,\n\n00:12:08.205 --> 00:12:11.449\nwhy in the world would these guys\nmoonlight at McDonald's?\n\n00:12:11.473 --> 00:12:14.521\nSo what do the wages look like?\nYou might be surprised.\n\n00:12:14.545 --> 00:12:18.172\nBut based on being able to talk to them\nand to see their records,\n\n00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:20.666\nthis is what it looks\nlike in terms of the wages.\n\n00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:24.780\nThe hourly wage the foot soldiers\nwere earning was $3.50 an hour.\n\n00:12:24.804 --> 00:12:28.193\nIt was below the minimum wage.\nAnd this is well-documented.\n\n00:12:28.217 --> 00:12:31.080\nIt's easy to see by the patterns\nof consumption they have.\n\n00:12:31.104 --> 00:12:34.079\nIt really is not fiction -- it's fact.\n\n00:12:34.103 --> 00:12:37.934\nThere was very little money in the gang,\nespecially at the bottom.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:41.343\nNow if you managed to rise up, say,\nand be that local leader,\n\n00:12:41.367 --> 00:12:44.104\nthe guy who's the equivalent\nof the McDonald's franchisee,\n\n00:12:44.128 --> 00:12:46.013\nyou'd be making 100,000 dollars a year.\n\n00:12:46.037 --> 00:12:49.363\nAnd that, in some ways,\nwas the best job you could hope to get\n\n00:12:49.387 --> 00:12:53.045\nif you were growing up in one of these\nneighborhoods as a young black male.\n\n00:12:53.069 --> 00:12:54.964\nIf you managed to rise to the very top,\n\n00:12:54.988 --> 00:12:57.913\n200,000 or 400,000 dollars a year\nis what you'd hope to make.\n\n00:12:57.937 --> 00:13:00.666\nTruly, you would be a great success story.\n\n00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.766\nAnd one of the sad parts\nof this is that, indeed,\n\n00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.335\namong the many other\nramifications of crack cocaine\n\n00:13:06.359 --> 00:13:10.489\nis that the most talented individuals\nin these communities --\n\n00:13:10.513 --> 00:13:12.244\nthis is what they were striving for.\n\n00:13:12.268 --> 00:13:14.736\nThey weren't trying to make it\nin legitimate ways,\n\n00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.950\nbecause there were\nno legitimate channels out.\n\n00:13:16.974 --> 00:13:18.347\nThis was the best way out.\n\n00:13:18.371 --> 00:13:21.042\nAnd it actually was\nthe right choice, probably,\n\n00:13:21.066 --> 00:13:24.392\nto try to make it out this way.\n\n00:13:25.075 --> 00:13:26.359\nYou look at this,\n\n00:13:26.383 --> 00:13:29.302\nthe relationship to McDonald's\nbreaks down here.\n\n00:13:29.326 --> 00:13:31.261\nThe money looks about the same.\n\n00:13:31.285 --> 00:13:32.727\nWhy is it such a bad job?\n\n00:13:32.751 --> 00:13:36.467\nWell, the reason it's such a bad job\nis that there's somebody shooting at you\n\n00:13:36.491 --> 00:13:38.053\na lot of the time.\n\n00:13:38.077 --> 00:13:40.934\nSo, with shooting at you,\nwhat are the death rates?\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.115\nWe found, in our gang --\n\n00:13:42.139 --> 00:13:45.375\nand admittedly, this was not really\na standard situation;\n\n00:13:45.399 --> 00:13:49.841\nthis was a time of intense violence,\nof a lot of gang wars,\n\n00:13:49.865 --> 00:13:52.524\nas this gang actually\nbecame quite successful.\n\n00:13:52.548 --> 00:13:53.784\nBut there were costs.\n\n00:13:53.808 --> 00:13:55.553\nAnd so the death rate --\n\n00:13:55.577 --> 00:14:00.537\nnot to mention the rate of being arrested,\nsent to prison, being wounded --\n\n00:14:00.561 --> 00:14:05.266\nthe death rate in our sample\nwas seven percent per person per year.\n\n00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:07.021\nYou're in the gang for four years,\n\n00:14:07.045 --> 00:14:11.561\nyou expect to die\nwith about a 25 percent likelihood.\n\n00:14:11.585 --> 00:14:13.687\nThat is about as high as you can get.\n\n00:14:13.711 --> 00:14:15.558\nSo for comparison's purposes,\n\n00:14:15.582 --> 00:14:20.584\nlet's think about some other walk of life\nyou may expect might be extremely risky.\n\n00:14:20.608 --> 00:14:22.600\nLet's say that you were a murderer\n\n00:14:22.624 --> 00:14:25.825\nand you were convicted of murder,\nand you're sent to death row.\n\n00:14:25.849 --> 00:14:29.818\nIt turns out, the death rates on death row\nfrom all causes, including execution:\n\n00:14:29.842 --> 00:14:30.998\ntwo percent a year.\n\n00:14:31.022 --> 00:14:32.023\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:32.047 --> 00:14:35.680\nSo it's a lot safer being on death row\n\n00:14:35.704 --> 00:14:38.264\nthan it is selling drugs\nout on the street.\n\n00:14:38.802 --> 00:14:41.680\nThat gives you some pause,\nfor those of you who believe\n\n00:14:41.704 --> 00:14:46.387\nthat a death penalty's going to have\nan enormous deterrent effect on crime.\n\n00:14:47.514 --> 00:14:50.829\nTo give you a sense of just how bad\nthe inner city was during crack --\n\n00:14:50.853 --> 00:14:53.587\nand I'm not really focusing\non the negatives,\n\n00:14:53.611 --> 00:14:56.531\nbut really, there's another story\nto tell you there --\n\n00:14:56.555 --> 00:15:00.293\nif you look at the death rates\njust of random, young black males\n\n00:15:00.317 --> 00:15:02.704\ngrowing up in the inner city\nin the United States,\n\n00:15:02.728 --> 00:15:05.504\nthe death rates during crack\nwere about one percent.\n\n00:15:05.528 --> 00:15:06.680\nThat's extremely high.\n\n00:15:06.704 --> 00:15:09.695\nAnd this is violent death --\nit's unbelievable, in some sense.\n\n00:15:09.719 --> 00:15:14.449\nTo put it into perspective: if you compare\nthis to the soldiers in Iraq,\n\n00:15:14.473 --> 00:15:18.139\nfor instance, right now\nfighting the war: 0.5 percent.\n\n00:15:18.163 --> 00:15:21.200\nSo in some very literal way,\n\n00:15:21.224 --> 00:15:24.132\nthe young black men who were\ngrowing up in this country\n\n00:15:24.156 --> 00:15:25.969\nwere living in a war zone,\n\n00:15:25.993 --> 00:15:32.763\nvery much in the sense that the soldiers\nover in Iraq are fighting in a war.\n\n00:15:32.787 --> 00:15:35.802\nSo why in the world, you might ask,\n\n00:15:35.826 --> 00:15:39.621\nwould anybody be willing\nto stand out on a street corner\n\n00:15:39.645 --> 00:15:41.934\nselling drugs for $3.50 an hour,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.934\nwith a 25 percent chance of dying\nover the next four years?\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.893\nWhy would they do that?\n\n00:15:46.917 --> 00:15:49.288\nAnd I think there are a couple answers.\n\n00:15:49.764 --> 00:15:55.122\nI think the first one\nis that they got fooled by history.\n\n00:15:55.471 --> 00:15:57.788\nIt used to be the gang\nwas a rite of passage;\n\n00:15:57.812 --> 00:15:59.846\nthat the young people controlled the gang;\n\n00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:02.555\nthat as you got older,\nyou dropped out of the gang.\n\n00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:04.597\nSo what happened was,\n\n00:16:04.621 --> 00:16:07.899\nthe people who happened to be\nin the right place at the right time --\n\n00:16:07.923 --> 00:16:13.339\nthe people who happened to be leading\nthe gang in the mid-to-late-'80s --\n\n00:16:13.363 --> 00:16:15.322\nbecame very, very wealthy.\n\n00:16:15.346 --> 00:16:17.450\nAnd so the logical thing to think\n\n00:16:17.474 --> 00:16:20.598\nwas that they are going\nto age out of the gang\n\n00:16:20.622 --> 00:16:21.819\nlike everybody else has,\n\n00:16:21.843 --> 00:16:24.958\nand the next generation is going\nto take over and get the wealth.\n\n00:16:24.982 --> 00:16:27.967\nThere are striking similarities,\nI think, to the Internet boom.\n\n00:16:27.991 --> 00:16:31.217\nThe first set of people in Silicon Valley\ngot very, very rich.\n\n00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:35.331\nAnd then all of my friends said,\n\"Maybe I should go do that, too.\"\n\n00:16:35.355 --> 00:16:39.959\nAnd they were willing to work very cheap\nfor stock options that never came.\n\n00:16:39.983 --> 00:16:42.357\nIn some sense,\nthat's what happened, exactly,\n\n00:16:42.381 --> 00:16:45.895\nto the set of people we were looking at.\n\n00:16:45.919 --> 00:16:48.114\nThey were willing to start at the bottom,\n\n00:16:48.138 --> 00:16:51.195\njust like, say, a first-year\nlawyer at a law firm\n\n00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:53.390\nis willing to start at the bottom,\n\n00:16:53.414 --> 00:16:55.477\nwork 80-hour weeks\nfor not that much money,\n\n00:16:55.501 --> 00:16:57.810\nbecause they think\nthey're going to make partner.\n\n00:16:57.834 --> 00:17:00.620\nBut the rules changed,\nand they never got to make partner.\n\n00:17:00.644 --> 00:17:04.503\nIndeed, the same people who were running\nall of the major gangs in the late 1980s\n\n00:17:04.527 --> 00:17:06.933\nare still running the major gangs\nin Chicago today.\n\n00:17:06.957 --> 00:17:08.840\nThey never passed on any of the wealth,\n\n00:17:08.864 --> 00:17:11.708\nSo everybody got stuck\nat that $3.50-an-hour job,\n\n00:17:11.732 --> 00:17:13.651\nand it turned out to be a disaster.\n\n00:17:14.268 --> 00:17:18.531\nThe other thing the gang was\nvery good at was marketing and trickery.\n\n00:17:18.555 --> 00:17:22.203\nAnd so for instance,\none thing the gang would do is --\n\n00:17:22.227 --> 00:17:24.459\nthe gang leaders would have\nbig entourages,\n\n00:17:24.483 --> 00:17:27.695\nand they'd drive fancy cars\nand have fancy jewelry.\n\n00:17:27.719 --> 00:17:30.805\nSo what Sudhir eventually realized\nas he hung out with them more,\n\n00:17:30.829 --> 00:17:34.089\nis that, really, they didn't own\nthose cars -- they just leased them,\n\n00:17:34.113 --> 00:17:36.792\nbecause they couldn't afford\nto own the fancy cars.\n\n00:17:36.816 --> 00:17:40.278\nAnd they didn't really have gold jewelry,\nthey had gold-plated jewelry.\n\n00:17:40.302 --> 00:17:43.662\nIt goes back to, you know,\nthe real-real versus the fake-real.\n\n00:17:43.686 --> 00:17:47.648\nAnd really, they did all sorts\nof things to trick the young people\n\n00:17:47.672 --> 00:17:50.465\ninto thinking what a great deal\nthe gang was going to be.\n\n00:17:50.489 --> 00:17:53.280\nSo for instance, they would give\na 14-year-old kid\n\n00:17:53.304 --> 00:17:56.430\na whole roll of bills to hold.\n\n00:17:56.454 --> 00:17:59.284\nThat 14-year-old kid\nwould say to his friends,\n\n00:17:59.308 --> 00:18:01.515\n\"Hey, look at all the money\nI got in the gang.\"\n\n00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:03.516\nIt wasn't his money -- until he spent it,\n\n00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.259\nand then he was in debt to the gang,\n\n00:18:05.283 --> 00:18:07.672\nand was sort of an indentured\nservant for a while.\n\n00:18:07.696 --> 00:18:09.246\nSo I have a couple minutes.\n\n00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:13.315\nLet me do one last thing\nI hadn't thought I'd have time to do,\n\n00:18:13.339 --> 00:18:18.593\nwhich is to talk about what we learned\nmore generally about economics,\n\n00:18:18.617 --> 00:18:20.624\nfrom the study of the gang.\n\n00:18:20.648 --> 00:18:24.203\nSo, economists tend to talk\nin technical words.\n\n00:18:24.227 --> 00:18:27.828\nOften, our theories fail quite miserably\nwhen we over the data,\n\n00:18:27.852 --> 00:18:30.638\nbut what's kind of interesting\nis that in this setting,\n\n00:18:30.662 --> 00:18:32.979\nit turned out that\nsome of the economic theories\n\n00:18:33.003 --> 00:18:35.138\nthat worked not so well\nin the real economy\n\n00:18:35.162 --> 00:18:37.352\nworked very well in the drug economy,\n\n00:18:37.376 --> 00:18:39.742\nin some sense, because\nit's unfettered capitalism.\n\n00:18:39.766 --> 00:18:41.159\nHere's an economic principle.\n\n00:18:41.183 --> 00:18:43.525\nThis is one of the basic ideas\nin labor economics,\n\n00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:45.333\ncalled a \"compensating differential.\"\n\n00:18:45.357 --> 00:18:48.799\nIt's the idea that the increment to wages\nthat a worker requires\n\n00:18:48.823 --> 00:18:51.437\nto leave him indifferent\nbetween performing two tasks,\n\n00:18:51.461 --> 00:18:53.566\none which is more unpleasant\nthan the other.\n\n00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:57.236\nCompensating differential -- it's why\nwe think garbagemen might be paid more\n\n00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.794\nthan people who work in parks.\n\n00:18:58.818 --> 00:19:04.740\nThe words of one of the members\nof the gang, I think, make this clear.\n\n00:19:04.764 --> 00:19:07.454\nSo it turns out -- I'm sort\nof getting ahead of myself --\n\n00:19:07.478 --> 00:19:10.631\nit turns out, in the gang,\nwhen there's a war going on,\n\n00:19:10.655 --> 00:19:13.672\nthey actually pay the foot soldiers\ntwice as much money.\n\n00:19:13.696 --> 00:19:14.985\nIt's exactly this concept.\n\n00:19:15.009 --> 00:19:17.641\nBecause they're not willing to be at risk.\n\n00:19:17.665 --> 00:19:20.687\nAnd the words of a gang member\ncapture it quite nicely, he says:\n\n00:19:20.711 --> 00:19:24.061\n\"Would you stand around here when all\nthis shit ...\" -- the shooting --\n\n00:19:24.085 --> 00:19:26.198\n\"... if all this shit's\ngoing on? No, right?\n\n00:19:26.222 --> 00:19:30.028\nSo if I gonna be asked to put my life\non the line, then front me the cash, man.\"\n\n00:19:30.052 --> 00:19:32.600\nI think the gang member says it\nmuch more articulately\n\n00:19:32.624 --> 00:19:34.641\nthan the economist, about what's going on.\n\n00:19:34.665 --> 00:19:36.280\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:36.304 --> 00:19:37.934\nHere's another one.\n\n00:19:37.958 --> 00:19:39.600\nEconomists talk about game theory,\n\n00:19:39.624 --> 00:19:41.982\nthat every two-person game\nhas a Nash equilibrium.\n\n00:19:42.006 --> 00:19:44.464\nHere's the translation\nyou get from the gang member.\n\n00:19:44.488 --> 00:19:47.841\nThey're talking about the decision\nof why they don't go shoot --\n\n00:19:47.865 --> 00:19:51.731\nOne thing that turns out to be a great\nbusiness tactic in the gang:\n\n00:19:51.755 --> 00:19:55.637\nif you go and just shoot guns in the air\nin the other gang's territory --\n\n00:19:55.661 --> 00:19:57.602\npeople are afraid to go buy drugs there,\n\n00:19:57.626 --> 00:19:59.734\nthey're going to come\ninto your neighborhood.\n\n00:19:59.758 --> 00:20:02.054\nHere's what he says\nabout why they don't do that:\n\n00:20:02.078 --> 00:20:05.099\n\"If we start shooting around there,\nthe other gang's territory,\n\n00:20:05.123 --> 00:20:08.006\nnobody, I mean, you dig it,\nnobody gonna step on their turf.\n\n00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:09.182\nBut we gotta be careful,\n\n00:20:09.206 --> 00:20:12.132\n'cause they can shoot around here too\nand then we all fucked.\"\n\n00:20:12.156 --> 00:20:13.157\n(Laughter)\n\n00:20:13.181 --> 00:20:14.479\nSo that's the same concept.\n\n00:20:14.503 --> 00:20:16.717\nThen again, sometimes\neconomists get it wrong.\n\n00:20:16.741 --> 00:20:21.412\nOne thing we observed in the data\nis that it looked like --\n\n00:20:21.436 --> 00:20:24.716\nthe gang leader always got paid.\n\n00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:29.192\nNo matter how bad it was economically,\nhe always got himself paid.\n\n00:20:29.216 --> 00:20:31.366\nWe had some theories related to cash flow,\n\n00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:34.221\nand lack of access to capital markets,\nand things like that.\n\n00:20:34.245 --> 00:20:35.681\nThen we asked the gang member,\n\n00:20:35.705 --> 00:20:39.058\n\"Why is it you always get paid\nand your workers don't always get paid?\"\n\n00:20:39.082 --> 00:20:40.233\nHis response is,\n\n00:20:40.257 --> 00:20:43.344\n\"You got all these niggers below you\nwho want your job, you dig?\n\n00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:46.151\nIf you start taking losses,\nthey see you as weak and shit.\"\n\n00:20:46.175 --> 00:20:47.723\nAnd I thought about it and said,\n\n00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:51.388\n\"CEOs often pay themselves\nmillion-dollar bonuses,\n\n00:20:51.412 --> 00:20:53.724\neven when companies\nare losing a lot of money.\n\n00:20:53.748 --> 00:20:55.963\nAnd it never would really occur\nto an economist\n\n00:20:55.987 --> 00:20:58.883\nthat this idea of 'weak and shit'\ncould really be important.\"\n\n00:20:58.907 --> 00:21:02.173\n(Laughter)\n\n00:21:02.197 --> 00:21:07.934\nMaybe \"weak and shit\" is an important\nhypothesis that needs more analysis.\n\n00:21:07.958 --> 00:21:09.109\nThank you very much.\n\n00:21:09.133 --> 00:21:10.133\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce", "duration": "1050", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/malcolm_gladwell_on_spaghetti_sauce", "transcript": "I think I was supposed to talk about my new book, which is called \"Blink,\" and it's about snap judgments and first impressions. And it comes out in January, and I hope you all buy it in triplicate.(Laughter)But I was thinking about this, and I realized that although my new book makes me happy, and I think would make my mother happy, it's not really about happiness. So I decided instead, I would talk about someone who I think has done as much to make Americans happy as perhaps anyone over the last 20 years, a man who is a great personal hero of mine: someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz, who is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce.Howard's about this high, and he's round, and he's in his 60s, and he has big huge glasses and thinning gray hair, and he has a kind of wonderful exuberance and vitality, and he has a parrot, and he loves the opera, and he's a great aficionado of medieval history. And by profession, he's a psychophysicist. Now, I should tell you that I have no idea what psychophysics is, although at some point in my life, I dated a girl for two years who was getting her doctorate in psychophysics. Which should tell you something about that relationship.(Laughter)As far as I know, psychophysics is about measuring things. And Howard is very interested in measuring things. And he graduated with his doctorate from Harvard, and he set up a little consulting shop in White Plains, New York. And one of his first clients was Pepsi. This is many years ago, back in the early 70s. And Pepsi came to Howard and they said, \"You know, there's this new thing called aspartame, and we would like to make Diet Pepsi. We'd like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put in each can of Diet Pepsi in order to have the perfect drink.\" Now that sounds like an incredibly straightforward question to answer, and that's what Howard thought. Because Pepsi told him, \"We're working with a band between eight and 12 percent. Anything below eight percent sweetness is not sweet enough; anything above 12 percent sweetness is too sweet. We want to know: what's the sweet spot between 8 and 12?\" Now, if I gave you this problem to do, you would all say, it's very simple. What we do is you make up a big experimental batch of Pepsi, at every degree of sweetness \u2014 eight percent, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, all the way up to 12 \u2014 and we try this out with thousands of people, and we plot the results on a curve, and we take the most popular concentration, right? Really simple.Howard does the experiment, and he gets the data back, and he plots it on a curve, and all of a sudden he realizes it's not a nice bell curve. In fact, the data doesn't make any sense. It's a mess. It's all over the place. Now, most people in that business, in the world of testing food and such, are not dismayed when the data comes back a mess. They think, \"Well, you know, figuring out what people think about cola's not that easy.\" \"You know, maybe we made an error somewhere along the way.\" \"You know, let's just make an educated guess,\" and they simply point and they go for 10 percent, right in the middle. Howard is not so easily placated. Howard is a man of a certain degree of intellectual standards. And this was not good enough for him, and this question bedeviled him for years. And he would think it through and say, \"What was wrong? Why could we not make sense of this experiment with Diet Pepsi?\"And one day, he was sitting in a diner in White Plains, about to go trying to dream up some work for Nescaf\u00e9. And suddenly, like a bolt of lightning, the answer came to him. And that is, that when they analyzed the Diet Pepsi data, they were asking the wrong question. They were looking for the perfect Pepsi, and they should have been looking for the perfect Pepsis. Trust me. This was an enormous revelation. This was one of the most brilliant breakthroughs in all of food science. Howard immediately went on the road, and he would go to conferences around the country, and he would stand up and say, \"You had been looking for the perfect Pepsi. You're wrong. You should be looking for the perfect Pepsis.\" And people would look at him blankly and say, \"What are you talking about? Craziness.\" And they would say, \"Move! Next!\" Tried to get business, nobody would hire him \u2014 he was obsessed, though, and he talked about it and talked about it. Howard loves the Yiddish expression \"To a worm in horseradish, the world is horseradish.\" This was his horseradish.(Laughter)He was obsessed with it!And finally, he had a breakthrough. Vlasic Pickles came to him, and they said, \"Doctor Moskowitz, we want to make the perfect pickle.\" And he said, \"There is no perfect pickle; there are only perfect pickles.\" And he came back to them and he said, \"You don't just need to improve your regular; you need to create zesty.\" And that's where we got zesty pickles. Then the next person came to him: Campbell's Soup. And this was even more important.In fact, Campbell's Soup is where Howard made his reputation. Campbell's made Prego, and Prego, in the early 80s, was struggling next to Rag\u00f9, which was the dominant spaghetti sauce of the 70s and 80s. In the industry \u2014 I don't know whether you care about this, or how much time I have to go into this. But it was, technically speaking \u2014 this is an aside \u2014 Prego is a better tomato sauce than Rag\u00f9. The quality of the tomato paste is much better; the spice mix is far superior; it adheres to the pasta in a much more pleasing way. In fact, they would do the famous bowl test back in the 70s with Rag\u00f9 and Prego. You'd have a plate of spaghetti, and you would pour it on, right? And the Rag\u00f9 would all go to the bottom, and the Prego would sit on top. That's called \"adherence.\" And, anyway, despite the fact that they were far superior in adherence, and the quality of their tomato paste, Prego was struggling.So they came to Howard, and they said, fix us. And Howard looked at their product line, and he said, what you have is a dead tomato society. So he said, this is what I want to do. And he got together with the Campbell's soup kitchen, and he made 45 varieties of spaghetti sauce. And he varied them according to every conceivable way that you can vary tomato sauce: by sweetness, by level of garlic, by tomatoey-ness, by tartness, by sourness, by visible solids \u2014 my favorite term in the spaghetti sauce business.(Laughter)Every conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce, he varied spaghetti sauce. And then he took this whole raft of 45 spaghetti sauces, and he went on the road. He went to New York, to Chicago, he went to Jacksonville, to Los Angeles. And he brought in people by the truckload into big halls. And he sat them down for two hours, and over the course of that two hours, he gave them ten bowls. Ten small bowls of pasta, with a different spaghetti sauce on each one. And after they ate each bowl, they had to rate, from 0 to 100, how good they thought the spaghetti sauce was.At the end of that process, after doing it for months and months, he had a mountain of data about how the American people feel about spaghetti sauce. And then he analyzed the data. Did he look for the most popular variety of spaghetti sauce? No! Howard doesn't believe that there is such a thing. Instead, he looked at the data, and he said, let's see if we can group all these different data points into clusters. Let's see if they congregate around certain ideas. And sure enough, if you sit down, and you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce, you realize that all Americans fall into one of three groups. There are people who like their spaghetti sauce plain; there are people who like their spaghetti sauce spicy; and there are people who like it extra chunky.And of those three facts, the third one was the most significant, because at the time, in the early 1980s, if you went to a supermarket, you would not find extra-chunky spaghetti sauce. And Prego turned to Howard, and they said, \"You're telling me that one third of Americans crave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce and yet no one is servicing their needs?\" And he said \"Yes!\"(Laughter)And Prego then went back, and completely reformulated their spaghetti sauce, and came out with a line of extra chunky that immediately and completely took over the spaghetti sauce business in this country. And over the next 10 years, they made 600 million dollars off their line of extra-chunky sauces.Everyone else in the industry looked at what Howard had done, and they said, \"Oh my god! We've been thinking all wrong!\" And that's when you started to get seven different kinds of vinegar, and 14 different kinds of mustard, and 71 different kinds of olive oil. And then eventually even Rag\u00f9 hired Howard, and Howard did the exact same thing for Rag\u00f9 that he did for Prego. And today, if you go to a really good supermarket, do you know how many Rag\u00f9s there are? 36! In six varieties: Cheese, Light, Robusto, Rich & Hearty, Old World Traditional \u2014 Extra-Chunky Garden.(Laughter)That's Howard's doing. That is Howard's gift to the American people.Now why is that important?(Laughter)It is, in fact, enormously important. I'll explain to you why. What Howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks about making you happy. Assumption number one in the food industry used to be that the way to find out what people want to eat, what will make people happy, is to ask them. And for years and years and years, Rag\u00f9 and Prego would have focus groups, and they would sit you down, and they would say, \"What do you want in a spaghetti sauce? Tell us what you want in a spaghetti sauce.\" And for all those years \u2014 20, 30 years \u2014 through all those focus group sessions, no one ever said they wanted extra-chunky. Even though at least a third of them, deep in their hearts, actually did.(Laughter)People don't know what they want! As Howard loves to say, \"The mind knows not what the tongue wants.\" It's a mystery!(Laughter)And a critically important step in understanding our own desires and tastes is to realize that we cannot always explain what we want, deep down. If I asked all of you, for example, in this room, what you want in a coffee, you know what you'd say? Every one of you would say, \"I want a dark, rich, hearty roast.\" It's what people always say when you ask them. \"What do you like?\" \"Dark, rich, hearty roast!\" What percentage of you actually like a dark, rich, hearty roast? According to Howard, somewhere between 25 and 27 percent of you. Most of you like milky, weak coffee.(Laughter)But you will never, ever say to someone who asks you what you want that \"I want a milky, weak coffee.\"So that's number one thing that Howard did. Number two thing that Howard did is he made us realize \u2014 it's another very critical point \u2014 he made us realize the importance of what he likes to call \"horizontal segmentation.\" Why is this critical? Because this is the way the food industry thought before Howard. What were they obsessed with in the early 80s? They were obsessed with mustard. In particular, they were obsessed with the story of Grey Poupon. Used to be, there were two mustards: French's and Gulden's. What were they? Yellow mustard. What's in it? Yellow mustard seeds, turmeric, and paprika. That was mustard. Grey Poupon came along, with a Dijon. Right? Much more volatile brown mustard seed, some white wine, a nose hit, much more delicate aromatics. And what do they do? They put it in a little tiny glass jar, with a wonderful enameled label on it, made it look French, even though it's made in Oxnard, California.(Laughter)And instead of charging a dollar fifty for the eight-ounce bottle, the way that French's and Gulden's did, they decided to charge four dollars. And they had those ads. With the guy in the Rolls Royce, eating the Grey Poupon. Another pulls up, and says, \"Do you have any Grey Poupon?\" And the whole thing, after they did that, Grey Poupon takes off! Takes over the mustard business!And everyone's take-home lesson from that was that the way to make people happy is to give them something that is more expensive, something to aspire to. It's to make them turn their back on what they think they like now, and reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy.(Laughter)A better mustard! A more expensive mustard! A mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning. And Howard looked to that and said, \"That's wrong!\" Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy. Mustard exists, just like tomato sauce, on a horizontal plane. There is no good mustard or bad mustard. There is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard. There are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kinds of people. He fundamentally democratized the way we think about taste. And for that, as well, we owe Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks.Third thing that Howard did, and perhaps the most important, is Howard confronted the notion of the Platonic dish.(Laughter)What do I mean by that?(Laughter)For the longest time in the food industry, there was a sense that there was one way, a perfect way, to make a dish. You go to Chez Panisse, they give you the red-tail sashimi with roasted pumpkin seeds in a something something reduction. They don't give you five options on the reduction. They don't say, \"Do you want the extra-chunky reduction, or ...?\" No! You just get the reduction. Why? Because the chef at Chez Panisse has a Platonic notion about red-tail sashimi. \"This is the way it ought to be.\" And she serves it that way time and time again, and if you quarrel with her, she will say, \"You know what? You're wrong! This is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant.\"Now that same idea fueled the commercial food industry as well. They had a Platonic notion of what tomato sauce was. And where did that come from? It came from Italy. Italian tomato sauce is what? It's blended; it's thin. The culture of tomato sauce was thin. When we talked about \"authentic tomato sauce\" in the 1970s, we talked about Italian tomato sauce, we talked about the earliest Rag\u00f9s, which had no visible solids, right? Which were thin, you just put a little bit and it sunk down to the bottom of the pasta. That's what it was. And why were we attached to that? Because we thought that what it took to make people happy was to provide them with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce, A. And B, we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce, then they would embrace it. And that's what would please the maximum number of people.In other words, people in the cooking world were looking for cooking universals. They were looking for one way to treat all of us. And it's good reason for them to be obsessed with the idea of universals, because all of science, through the 19th century and much of the 20th, was obsessed with universals. Psychologists, medical scientists, economists were all interested in finding out the rules that govern the way all of us behave. But that changed, right? What is the great revolution in science of the last 10, 15 years? It is the movement from the search for universals to the understanding of variability. Now in medical science, we don't want to know, necessarily, just how cancer works, we want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer. I guess my cancer different from your cancer. Genetics has opened the door to the study of human variability. What Howard Moskowitz was doing was saying, \"This same revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce.\" And for that, we owe him a great vote of thanks.I'll give you one last illustration of variability, and that is \u2014 oh, I'm sorry. Howard not only believed that, but he took it a second step, which was to say that when we pursue universal principles in food, we aren't just making an error; we are actually doing ourselves a massive disservice. And the example he used was coffee. And coffee is something he did a lot of work with, with Nescaf\u00e9. If I were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee \u2014 a type of coffee, a brew \u2014 that made all of you happy, and then I asked you to rate that coffee, the average score in this room for coffee would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100. If, however, you allowed me to break you into coffee clusters, maybe three or four coffee clusters, and I could make coffee just for each of those individual clusters, your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78. The difference between coffee at 60 and coffee at 78 is a difference between coffee that makes you wince, and coffee that makes you deliriously happy.That is the final, and I think most beautiful lesson, of Howard Moskowitz: that in embracing the diversity of human beings, we will find a surer way to true happiness.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 20, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.473 --> 00:00:14.934\nI think I was supposed\nto talk about my new book,\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.837\nwhich is called \"Blink,\"\n\n00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:19.605\nand it's about snap judgments\nand first impressions.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:23.749\nAnd it comes out in January,\nand I hope you all buy it in triplicate.\n\n00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:25.247\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:26.934\nBut I was thinking about this,\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:31.168\nand I realized that although\nmy new book makes me happy,\n\n00:00:31.192 --> 00:00:33.828\nand I think would make my mother happy,\n\n00:00:33.852 --> 00:00:36.310\nit's not really about happiness.\n\n00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:39.934\nSo I decided instead,\nI would talk about someone\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:43.637\nwho I think has done as much\nto make Americans happy\n\n00:00:43.661 --> 00:00:46.934\nas perhaps anyone over the last 20 years,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.934\na man who is a great\npersonal hero of mine:\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.934\nsomeone by the name of Howard Moskowitz,\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:56.058\nwho is most famous\nfor reinventing spaghetti sauce.\n\n00:00:57.281 --> 00:01:01.934\nHoward's about this high, and he's round,\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:07.047\nand he's in his 60s,\nand he has big huge glasses\n\n00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:08.864\nand thinning gray hair,\n\n00:01:08.888 --> 00:01:12.712\nand he has a kind of wonderful\nexuberance and vitality,\n\n00:01:12.736 --> 00:01:15.744\nand he has a parrot,\nand he loves the opera,\n\n00:01:15.768 --> 00:01:19.859\nand he's a great aficionado\nof medieval history.\n\n00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:22.765\nAnd by profession, he's a psychophysicist.\n\n00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.426\nNow, I should tell you that I have no idea\nwhat psychophysics is,\n\n00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.140\nalthough at some point in my life,\n\n00:01:29.164 --> 00:01:30.610\nI dated a girl for two years\n\n00:01:30.634 --> 00:01:32.874\nwho was getting\nher doctorate in psychophysics.\n\n00:01:32.898 --> 00:01:36.442\nWhich should tell you something\nabout that relationship.\n\n00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:38.763\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:38.787 --> 00:01:41.934\nAs far as I know, psychophysics\nis about measuring things.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.589\nAnd Howard is very interested\nin measuring things.\n\n00:01:44.613 --> 00:01:46.986\nAnd he graduated\nwith his doctorate from Harvard,\n\n00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.258\nand he set up a little consulting shop\nin White Plains, New York.\n\n00:01:51.013 --> 00:01:53.371\nAnd one of his first clients was Pepsi.\n\n00:01:53.395 --> 00:01:56.473\nThis is many years ago,\nback in the early 70s.\n\n00:01:57.402 --> 00:01:59.314\nAnd Pepsi came to Howard and they said,\n\n00:01:59.338 --> 00:02:01.736\n\"You know, there's this new\nthing called aspartame,\n\n00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.644\nand we would like to make Diet Pepsi.\n\n00:02:03.668 --> 00:02:05.645\nWe'd like you to figure out\n\n00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:09.175\nhow much aspartame we should put\nin each can of Diet Pepsi\n\n00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.956\nin order to have the perfect drink.\"\n\n00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:15.934\nNow that sounds like an incredibly\nstraightforward question to answer,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.435\nand that's what Howard thought.\n\n00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.760\nBecause Pepsi told him,\n\n00:02:18.784 --> 00:02:21.467\n\"We're working with a band\nbetween eight and 12 percent.\n\n00:02:21.491 --> 00:02:24.410\nAnything below eight percent\nsweetness is not sweet enough;\n\n00:02:24.434 --> 00:02:27.673\nanything above 12 percent\nsweetness is too sweet.\n\n00:02:27.697 --> 00:02:30.780\nWe want to know: what's the sweet\nspot between 8 and 12?\"\n\n00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.291\nNow, if I gave you this problem to do,\nyou would all say, it's very simple.\n\n00:02:35.315 --> 00:02:38.934\nWhat we do is you make up\na big experimental batch of Pepsi,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:43.444\nat every degree of sweetness --\neight percent, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3,\n\n00:02:43.468 --> 00:02:44.749\nall the way up to 12 --\n\n00:02:44.773 --> 00:02:47.262\nand we try this out\nwith thousands of people,\n\n00:02:47.286 --> 00:02:49.492\nand we plot the results on a curve,\n\n00:02:49.516 --> 00:02:52.497\nand we take the most popular\nconcentration, right?\n\n00:02:52.521 --> 00:02:53.776\nReally simple.\n\n00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.340\nHoward does the experiment,\nand he gets the data back,\n\n00:02:56.364 --> 00:02:57.705\nand he plots it on a curve,\n\n00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:00.593\nand all of a sudden he realizes\nit's not a nice bell curve.\n\n00:03:00.617 --> 00:03:02.571\nIn fact, the data doesn't make any sense.\n\n00:03:02.595 --> 00:03:04.377\nIt's a mess. It's all over the place.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:09.571\nNow, most people in that business,\nin the world of testing food and such,\n\n00:03:09.595 --> 00:03:12.412\nare not dismayed\nwhen the data comes back a mess.\n\n00:03:12.436 --> 00:03:13.928\nThey think, \"Well, you know,\n\n00:03:13.952 --> 00:03:16.786\nfiguring out what people think\nabout cola's not that easy.\"\n\n00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.635\n\"You know, maybe we made an error\nsomewhere along the way.\"\n\n00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:21.856\n\"You know, let's just\nmake an educated guess,\"\n\n00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.265\nand they simply point\nand they go for 10 percent,\n\n00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:25.364\nright in the middle.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.934\nHoward is not so easily placated.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.870\nHoward is a man of a certain degree\nof intellectual standards.\n\n00:03:30.894 --> 00:03:32.934\nAnd this was not good enough for him,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.240\nand this question bedeviled him for years.\n\n00:03:35.264 --> 00:03:37.934\nAnd he would think it through\nand say, \"What was wrong?\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:41.643\nWhy could we not make sense\nof this experiment with Diet Pepsi?\"\n\n00:03:42.318 --> 00:03:44.934\nAnd one day, he was sitting\nin a diner in White Plains,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.934\nabout to go trying to dream up\nsome work for Nescaf\u00e9.\n\n00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:51.778\nAnd suddenly, like a bolt of lightning,\nthe answer came to him.\n\n00:03:52.111 --> 00:03:54.785\nAnd that is, that when they analyzed\nthe Diet Pepsi data,\n\n00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:56.531\nthey were asking the wrong question.\n\n00:03:56.555 --> 00:03:58.685\nThey were looking for the perfect Pepsi,\n\n00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.672\nand they should have been\nlooking for the perfect Pepsis.\n\n00:04:02.772 --> 00:04:03.783\nTrust me.\n\n00:04:03.807 --> 00:04:05.934\nThis was an enormous revelation.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.633\nThis was one of the most brilliant\nbreakthroughs in all of food science.\n\n00:04:09.657 --> 00:04:11.375\nHoward immediately went on the road,\n\n00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:13.757\nand he would go to conferences\naround the country,\n\n00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:15.339\nand he would stand up and say,\n\n00:04:15.363 --> 00:04:17.426\n\"You had been looking\nfor the perfect Pepsi.\n\n00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.680\nYou're wrong.\n\n00:04:18.704 --> 00:04:21.212\nYou should be looking\nfor the perfect Pepsis.\"\n\n00:04:21.815 --> 00:04:24.251\nAnd people would look at him\nblankly and say,\n\n00:04:24.275 --> 00:04:26.338\n\"What are you talking about? Craziness.\"\n\n00:04:26.362 --> 00:04:27.934\nAnd they would say, \"Move! Next!\"\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.172\nTried to get business,\nnobody would hire him --\n\n00:04:30.196 --> 00:04:31.580\nhe was obsessed, though,\n\n00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:33.611\nand he talked about it\nand talked about it.\n\n00:04:33.635 --> 00:04:35.428\nHoward loves the Yiddish expression\n\n00:04:35.452 --> 00:04:37.934\n\"To a worm in horseradish,\nthe world is horseradish.\"\n\n00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:40.099\nThis was his horseradish.\n\n00:04:40.123 --> 00:04:41.785\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:43.248\nHe was obsessed with it!\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.769\nAnd finally, he had a breakthrough.\n\n00:04:46.793 --> 00:04:48.934\nVlasic Pickles came to him,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:53.607\nand they said, \"Doctor Moskowitz,\nwe want to make the perfect pickle.\"\n\n00:04:53.631 --> 00:04:54.655\nAnd he said,\n\n00:04:54.679 --> 00:04:57.608\n\"There is no perfect pickle;\nthere are only perfect pickles.\"\n\n00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.059\nAnd he came back to them and he said,\n\n00:05:00.083 --> 00:05:02.293\n\"You don't just need\nto improve your regular;\n\n00:05:02.317 --> 00:05:03.810\nyou need to create zesty.\"\n\n00:05:03.834 --> 00:05:05.659\nAnd that's where we got zesty pickles.\n\n00:05:06.474 --> 00:05:08.934\nThen the next person came to him:\nCampbell's Soup.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nAnd this was even more important.\n\n00:05:10.982 --> 00:05:14.028\nIn fact, Campbell's Soup\nis where Howard made his reputation.\n\n00:05:14.378 --> 00:05:15.771\nCampbell's made Prego,\n\n00:05:15.795 --> 00:05:19.663\nand Prego, in the early 80s,\nwas struggling next to Rag\u00f9,\n\n00:05:19.687 --> 00:05:23.052\nwhich was the dominant\nspaghetti sauce of the 70s and 80s.\n\n00:05:23.504 --> 00:05:26.347\nIn the industry -- I don't\nknow whether you care about this,\n\n00:05:26.371 --> 00:05:28.371\nor how much time I have to go into this.\n\n00:05:28.395 --> 00:05:31.025\nBut it was, technically speaking\n-- this is an aside --\n\n00:05:31.049 --> 00:05:33.109\nPrego is a better tomato sauce than Rag\u00f9.\n\n00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:35.414\nThe quality of the tomato paste\nis much better;\n\n00:05:35.438 --> 00:05:37.258\nthe spice mix is far superior;\n\n00:05:37.282 --> 00:05:39.768\nit adheres to the pasta\nin a much more pleasing way.\n\n00:05:39.792 --> 00:05:41.869\nIn fact, they would do\nthe famous bowl test\n\n00:05:41.893 --> 00:05:44.538\nback in the 70s with Rag\u00f9 and Prego.\n\n00:05:44.562 --> 00:05:48.054\nYou'd have a plate of spaghetti,\nand you would pour it on, right?\n\n00:05:48.418 --> 00:05:53.063\nAnd the Rag\u00f9 would all go to the bottom,\nand the Prego would sit on top.\n\n00:05:53.087 --> 00:05:54.618\nThat's called \"adherence.\"\n\n00:05:54.642 --> 00:05:59.182\nAnd, anyway, despite the fact\nthat they were far superior in adherence,\n\n00:05:59.206 --> 00:06:01.977\nand the quality of their tomato paste,\n\n00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:03.370\nPrego was struggling.\n\n00:06:03.394 --> 00:06:06.396\nSo they came to Howard,\nand they said, fix us.\n\n00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:09.268\nAnd Howard looked\nat their product line, and he said,\n\n00:06:09.292 --> 00:06:12.395\nwhat you have is a dead tomato society.\n\n00:06:13.141 --> 00:06:15.323\nSo he said, this is what I want to do.\n\n00:06:15.347 --> 00:06:17.903\nAnd he got together\nwith the Campbell's soup kitchen,\n\n00:06:17.927 --> 00:06:21.388\nand he made 45 varieties\nof spaghetti sauce.\n\n00:06:21.412 --> 00:06:24.265\nAnd he varied them according\nto every conceivable way\n\n00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:25.934\nthat you can vary tomato sauce:\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.816\nby sweetness, by level of garlic,\n\n00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.055\nby tomatoey-ness,\nby tartness, by sourness,\n\n00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:32.419\nby visible solids --\n\n00:06:32.443 --> 00:06:35.704\nmy favorite term\nin the spaghetti sauce business.\n\n00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:36.729\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:36.753 --> 00:06:40.291\nEvery conceivable way\nyou can vary spaghetti sauce,\n\n00:06:40.315 --> 00:06:42.094\nhe varied spaghetti sauce.\n\n00:06:42.118 --> 00:06:45.851\nAnd then he took this whole raft\nof 45 spaghetti sauces,\n\n00:06:45.875 --> 00:06:47.032\nand he went on the road.\n\n00:06:47.056 --> 00:06:48.935\nHe went to New York, to Chicago,\n\n00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:50.888\nhe went to Jacksonville, to Los Angeles.\n\n00:06:50.912 --> 00:06:54.674\nAnd he brought in people\nby the truckload into big halls.\n\n00:06:54.698 --> 00:06:56.423\nAnd he sat them down for two hours,\n\n00:06:56.447 --> 00:06:59.774\nand over the course of that two hours,\nhe gave them ten bowls.\n\n00:06:59.798 --> 00:07:01.056\nTen small bowls of pasta,\n\n00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.538\nwith a different spaghetti\nsauce on each one.\n\n00:07:04.143 --> 00:07:08.289\nAnd after they ate each bowl,\nthey had to rate, from 0 to 100,\n\n00:07:08.313 --> 00:07:10.934\nhow good they thought\nthe spaghetti sauce was.\n\n00:07:11.448 --> 00:07:14.519\nAt the end of that process,\nafter doing it for months and months,\n\n00:07:14.543 --> 00:07:16.086\nhe had a mountain of data\n\n00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.934\nabout how the American people\nfeel about spaghetti sauce.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.425\nAnd then he analyzed the data.\n\n00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:25.426\nDid he look for the most popular\nvariety of spaghetti sauce?\n\n00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.204\nNo! Howard doesn't believe\nthat there is such a thing.\n\n00:07:28.228 --> 00:07:30.291\nInstead, he looked\nat the data, and he said,\n\n00:07:30.315 --> 00:07:35.934\nlet's see if we can group all these\ndifferent data points into clusters.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.410\nLet's see if they congregate\naround certain ideas.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.163\nAnd sure enough, if you sit down,\n\n00:07:41.187 --> 00:07:44.752\nand you analyze all this data\non spaghetti sauce,\n\n00:07:44.776 --> 00:07:47.886\nyou realize that all Americans\nfall into one of three groups.\n\n00:07:48.298 --> 00:07:51.211\nThere are people\nwho like their spaghetti sauce plain;\n\n00:07:51.235 --> 00:07:53.934\nthere are people\nwho like their spaghetti sauce spicy;\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.202\nand there are people\nwho like it extra chunky.\n\n00:07:56.887 --> 00:08:00.934\nAnd of those three facts,\nthe third one was the most significant,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.612\nbecause at the time, in the early 1980s,\n\n00:08:03.636 --> 00:08:05.136\nif you went to a supermarket,\n\n00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.475\nyou would not find\nextra-chunky spaghetti sauce.\n\n00:08:08.945 --> 00:08:10.958\nAnd Prego turned to Howard, and they said,\n\n00:08:10.982 --> 00:08:13.679\n\"You're telling me\nthat one third of Americans\n\n00:08:13.703 --> 00:08:16.934\ncrave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.457\nand yet no one is servicing their needs?\"\n\n00:08:19.481 --> 00:08:20.505\nAnd he said \"Yes!\"\n\n00:08:20.529 --> 00:08:21.821\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:21.845 --> 00:08:23.187\nAnd Prego then went back,\n\n00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:25.583\nand completely reformulated\ntheir spaghetti sauce,\n\n00:08:25.607 --> 00:08:29.261\nand came out with a line of extra chunky\nthat immediately and completely\n\n00:08:29.285 --> 00:08:32.269\ntook over the spaghetti sauce\nbusiness in this country.\n\n00:08:32.293 --> 00:08:36.696\nAnd over the next 10 years,\nthey made 600 million dollars\n\n00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.117\noff their line of extra-chunky sauces.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:43.448\nEveryone else in the industry looked\nat what Howard had done, and they said,\n\n00:08:43.472 --> 00:08:45.879\n\"Oh my god!

well.\n\n00:14:16.252 --> 00:14:19.469\nThey had a Platonic notion\nof what tomato sauce was.\n\n00:14:19.493 --> 00:14:21.934\nAnd where did that come from?\nIt came from Italy.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.977\nItalian tomato sauce is what?\n\n00:14:24.333 --> 00:14:25.933\nIt's blended; it's thin.\n\n00:14:26.489 --> 00:14:28.798\nThe culture of tomato sauce was thin.\n\n00:14:28.822 --> 00:14:31.799\nWhen we talked about \"authentic\ntomato sauce\" in the 1970s,\n\n00:14:31.823 --> 00:14:33.632\nwe talked about Italian tomato sauce,\n\n00:14:33.656 --> 00:14:35.435\nwe talked about the earliest Rag\u00f9s,\n\n00:14:35.459 --> 00:14:37.611\nwhich had no visible solids, right?\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.075\nWhich were thin, you just put a little bit\n\n00:14:40.099 --> 00:14:42.147\nand it sunk down to the bottom\nof the pasta.\n\n00:14:42.171 --> 00:14:43.363\nThat's what it was.\n\n00:14:43.387 --> 00:14:45.048\nAnd why were we attached to that?\n\n00:14:45.072 --> 00:14:47.810\nBecause we thought\nthat what it took to make people happy\n\n00:14:47.834 --> 00:14:52.428\nwas to provide them with the most\nculturally authentic tomato sauce, A.\n\n00:14:52.452 --> 00:14:57.536\nAnd B, we thought that if we gave them\nthe culturally authentic tomato sauce,\n\n00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.988\nthen they would embrace it.\n\n00:14:59.012 --> 00:15:01.746\nAnd that's what would please\nthe maximum number of people.\n\n00:15:02.246 --> 00:15:04.532\nIn other words,\n\n00:15:04.556 --> 00:15:07.955\npeople in the cooking world\nwere looking for cooking universals.\n\n00:15:08.294 --> 00:15:10.732\nThey were looking for one way\nto treat all of us.\n\n00:15:10.756 --> 00:15:13.336\nAnd it's good reason for them\nto be obsessed\n\n00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.742\nwith the idea of universals,\n\n00:15:14.766 --> 00:15:16.163\nbecause all of science,\n\n00:15:16.187 --> 00:15:18.436\nthrough the 19th century\nand much of the 20th,\n\n00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.129\nwas obsessed with universals.\n\n00:15:20.153 --> 00:15:24.141\nPsychologists, medical scientists,\neconomists\n\n00:15:24.165 --> 00:15:26.253\nwere all interested\nin finding out the rules\n\n00:15:26.277 --> 00:15:28.467\nthat govern the way all of us behave.\n\n00:15:29.217 --> 00:15:30.615\nBut that changed, right?\n\n00:15:30.639 --> 00:15:34.250\nWhat is the great revolution\nin science of the last 10, 15 years?\n\n00:15:34.274 --> 00:15:37.789\nIt is the movement\nfrom the search for universals\n\n00:15:37.813 --> 00:15:39.662\nto the understanding of variability.\n\n00:15:40.297 --> 00:15:43.934\nNow in medical science,\nwe don't want to know, necessarily,\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.659\njust how cancer works,\n\n00:15:45.683 --> 00:15:48.934\nwe want to know how your cancer\nis different from my cancer.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.705\nI guess my cancer different\nfrom your cancer.\n\n00:15:51.729 --> 00:15:55.817\nGenetics has opened the door\nto the study of human variability.\n\n00:15:55.841 --> 00:15:57.936\nWhat Howard Moskowitz\nwas doing was saying,\n\n00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:02.071\n\"This same revolution needs to happen\nin the world of tomato sauce.\"\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.530\nAnd for that, we owe him\na great vote of thanks.\n\n00:16:07.159 --> 00:16:10.001\nI'll give you one last\nillustration of variability,\n\n00:16:10.025 --> 00:16:11.866\nand that is -- oh, I'm sorry.\n\n00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:15.378\nHoward not only believed that,\nbut he took it a second step,\n\n00:16:15.402 --> 00:16:20.554\nwhich was to say that when we pursue\nuniversal principles in food,\n\n00:16:20.578 --> 00:16:22.198\nwe aren't just making an error;\n\n00:16:22.222 --> 00:16:25.570\nwe are actually doing ourselves\na massive disservice.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.768\nAnd the example he used was coffee.\n\n00:16:28.181 --> 00:16:32.226\nAnd coffee is something he did\na lot of work with, with Nescaf\u00e9.\n\n00:16:32.704 --> 00:16:36.202\nIf I were to ask all of you to try\nand come up with a brand of coffee --\n\n00:16:36.226 --> 00:16:39.248\na type of coffee, a brew --\nthat made all of you happy,\n\n00:16:39.272 --> 00:16:41.225\nand then I asked you to rate that coffee,\n\n00:16:41.249 --> 00:16:45.306\nthe average score in this room for coffee\nwould be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100.\n\n00:16:45.783 --> 00:16:49.406\nIf, however, you allowed me\nto break you into coffee clusters,\n\n00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:51.215\nmaybe three or four coffee clusters,\n\n00:16:51.239 --> 00:16:55.934\nand I could make coffee just\nfor each of those individual clusters,\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:59.513\nyour scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:05.195\nThe difference between coffee\nat 60 and coffee at 78\n\n00:17:05.219 --> 00:17:07.934\nis a difference between coffee\nthat makes you wince,\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:10.962\nand coffee that makes you\ndeliriously happy.\n\n00:17:11.648 --> 00:17:14.842\nThat is the final, and I think\nmost beautiful lesson,\n\n00:17:14.866 --> 00:17:16.201\nof Howard Moskowitz:\n\n00:17:16.225 --> 00:17:19.934\nthat in embracing the diversity\nof human beings,\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:22.323\nwe will find a surer way\nto true happiness.\n\n00:17:22.727 --> 00:17:23.744\nThank you.\n\n00:17:23.768 --> 00:17:24.934\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The surprising science of happiness", "duration": "1276", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy", "transcript": "When you have 21 minutes to speak, two million years seems like a really long time. But evolutionarily, two million years is nothing. And yet in two million years, the human brain has nearly tripled in mass, going from the one-and-a-quarter pound brain of our ancestor here, Habilis, to the almost three-pound meatloaf that everybody here has between their ears. What is it about a big brain that nature was so eager for every one of us to have one?Well, it turns out when brains triple in size, they don't just get three times bigger; they gain new structures. And one of the main reasons our brain got so big is because it got a new part, called the \"frontal lobe.\" Particularly, a part called the \"pre-frontal cortex.\" What does a pre-frontal cortex do for you that should justify the entire architectural overhaul of the human skull in the blink of evolutionary time?It turns out the pre-frontal cortex does lots of things, but one of the most important things it does is an experience simulator. Pilots practice in flight simulators so that they don't make real mistakes in planes. Human beings have this marvelous adaptation that they can actually have experiences in their heads before they try them out in real life. This is a trick that none of our ancestors could do, and that no other animal can do quite like we can. It's a marvelous adaptation. It's up there with opposable thumbs and standing upright and language as one of the things that got our species out of the trees and into the shopping mall.(Laughter)All of you have done this. Ben and Jerry's doesn't have liver-and-onion ice cream, and it's not because they whipped some up, tried it and went, \"Yuck.\" It's because, without leaving your armchair, you can simulate that flavor and say \"yuck\" before you make it.Let's see how your experience simulators are working. Let's just run a quick diagnostic before I proceed with the rest of the talk. Here's two different futures that I invite you to contemplate. You can try to simulate them and tell me which one you think you might prefer. One of them is winning the lottery. This is about 314 million dollars. And the other is becoming paraplegic.(Laughter)Just give it a moment of thought. You probably don't feel like you need a moment of thought.Interestingly, there are data on these two groups of people, data on how happy they are. And this is exactly what you expected, isn't it? But these aren't the data. I made these up!These are the data. You failed the pop quiz, and you're hardly five minutes into the lecture. Because the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs, and a year after winning the lotto, lottery winners and paraplegics are equally happy with their lives.Don't feel too bad about failing the first pop quiz, because everybody fails all of the pop quizzes all of the time. The research that my laboratory has been doing, that economists and psychologists around the country have been doing, has revealed something really quite startling to us, something we call the \"impact bias,\" which is the tendency for the simulator to work badly. For the simulator to make you believe that different outcomes are more different than in fact they really are.From field studies to laboratory studies, we see that winning or losing an election, gaining or losing a romantic partner, getting or not getting a promotion, passing or not passing a college test, on and on, have far less impact, less intensity and much less duration than people expect them to have. This almost floors me \u2014 a recent study showing how major life traumas affect people suggests that if it happened over three months ago, with only a few exceptions, it has no impact whatsoever on your happiness.Why? Because happiness can be synthesized. Sir Thomas Brown wrote in 1642, \"I am the happiest man alive. I have that in me that can convert poverty to riches, adversity to prosperity. I am more invulnerable than Achilles; fortune hath not one place to hit me.\" What kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head?Well, it turns out it's precisely the same remarkable machinery that all off us have. Human beings have something that we might think of as a \"psychological immune system.\" A system of cognitive processes, largely non-conscious cognitive processes, that help them change their views of the world, so that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves. Like Sir Thomas, you have this machine. Unlike Sir Thomas, you seem not to know it.We synthesize happiness, but we think happiness is a thing to be found. Now, you don't need me to give you too many examples of people synthesizing happiness, I suspect. Though I'm going to show you some experimental evidence, you don't have to look very far for evidence. I took a copy of the New York Times and tried to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness. Here are three guys synthesizing happiness. \"I'm better off physically, financially, mentally ... \"I don't have one minute's regret. It was a glorious experience.\" \"I believe it turned out for the best.\"Who are these characters who are so damn happy? The first one is Jim Wright. Some of you are old enough to remember: he was the chairman of the House of Representatives and he resigned in disgrace when this young Republican named Newt Gingrich found out about a shady book deal he had done. He lost everything. The most powerful Democrat in the country lost everything. He lost his money, he lost his power. What does he have to say all these years later? \"I am so much better off physically, financially, mentally and in almost every other way.\" What other way would there be to be better off? Vegetably? Minerally? Animally? He's pretty much covered them there.Moreese Bickham is somebody you've never heard of. Moreese Bickham uttered these words upon being released. He was 78 years old. He'd spent 37 years in a Louisiana State Penitentiary for a crime he didn't commit. [He was ultimately released for good behavior halfway through his sentence.] What did he say about his experience? \"I don't have one minute's regret. It was a glorious experience.\" Glorious! He is not saying, \"Well, there were some nice guys. They had a gym.\" \"Glorious,\" a word we usually reserve for something like a religious experience.Harry S. Langerman uttered these words, and he's somebody you might have known but didn't, because in 1949 he read a little article in the paper about a hamburger stand owned by two brothers named McDonalds. And he thought, \"That's a really neat idea!\" So he went to find them. They said, \"We can give you a franchise on this for 3,000 bucks.\" Harry went back to New York, asked his brother, an investment banker, to loan him the $3,000, and his brother's immortal words were, \"You idiot, nobody eats hamburgers.\" He wouldn't lend him the money, and of course, six months later Ray Kroc had exactly the same idea. It turns out people do eat hamburgers, and Ray Kroc, for a while, became the richest man in America.And then, finally, some of you recognize this young photo of Pete Best, who was the original drummer for the Beatles, until they, you know, sent him out on an errand and snuck away and picked up Ringo on a tour. Well, in 1994, when Pete Best was interviewed \u2014 yes, he's still a drummer; yes, he's a studio musician \u2014 he had this to say: \"I'm happier than I would have been with the Beatles.\"Okay. There's something important to be learned from these people, and it is the secret of happiness. Here it is, finally to be revealed. First: accrue wealth, power, and prestige, then lose it.(Laughter)Second: spend as much of your life in prison as you possibly can.(Laughter)Third: make somebody else really, really rich. And finally: never ever join the Beatles.(Laughter) Yeah, right. Because when people synthesize happiness, as these gentlemen seem to have done, we all smile at them, but we kind of roll our eyes and say, \"Yeah right, you never really wanted the job.\" \"Oh yeah, right. You really didn't have that much in common with her, and you figured that out just about the time she threw the engagement ring in your face.\" We smirk because we believe that synthetic happiness is not of the same quality as what we might call \"natural happiness.\"What are these terms? Natural happiness is what we get when we get what we wanted, and synthetic happiness is what we make when we don't get what we wanted. And in our society, we have a strong belief that synthetic happiness is of an inferior kind.Why do we have that belief? Well, it's very simple. What kind of economic engine would keep churning if we believed that not getting what we want could make us just as happy as getting it? With all apologies to my friend Matthieu Ricard, a shopping mall full of Zen monks is not going to be particularly profitable, because they don't want stuff enough.(Laughter)I want to suggest to you that synthetic happiness is every bit as real and enduring as the kind of happiness you stumble upon when you get exactly what you were aiming for. I'm a scientist, so I'm going to do this not with rhetoric, but by marinating you in a little bit of data.Let me first show you an experimental paradigm that is used to demonstrate the synthesis of happiness among regular old folks. And this isn't mine. It's a 50-year-old paradigm called the \"free choice paradigm.\" It's very simple. You bring in, say, six objects, and you ask a subject to rank them from the most to the least liked. In this case, because this experiment uses them, these are Monet prints. So, everybody can rank these Monet prints from the one they like the most, to the one they like the least. Now we give you a choice: \"We happen to have some extra prints in the closet. We're going to give you one as your prize to take home. We happen to have number three and number four,\" we tell the subject. This is a bit of a difficult choice, because neither one is preferred strongly to the other, but naturally, people tend to pick number three because they liked it a little better than number four.Sometime later \u2014 it could be 15 minutes; it could be 15 days \u2014 the same stimuli are put before the subject, and the subject is asked to re-rank the stimuli. \"Tell us how much you like them now.\" What happens? Watch as happiness is synthesized. This is the result that has been replicated over and over again. You're watching happiness be synthesized. Would you like to see it again? Happiness! \"The one I got is really better than I thought! That other one I didn't get sucks!\" That's the synthesis of happiness.(Laughter)Now, what's the right response to that? \"Yeah, right!\" Now, here's the experiment we did, and I hope this is going to convince you that \"Yeah, right!\" was not the right response.We did this experiment with a group of patients who had anterograde amnesia. These are hospitalized patients. Most of them have Korsakoff's syndrome, a polyneuritic psychosis. They drank way too much, and they can't make new memories. OK? They remember their childhood, but if you walk in and introduce yourself, and then leave the room, when you come back, they don't know who you are.We took our Monet prints to the hospital. And we asked these patients to rank them from the one they liked the most to the one they liked the least. We then gave them the choice between number three and number four. Like everybody else, they said, \"Gee, thanks Doc! That's great! I could use a new print. I'll take number three.\" We explained we would have number three mailed to them. We gathered up our materials and we went out of the room, and counted to a half hour.(Laughter)Back into the room, we say, \"Hi, we're back.\" The patients, bless them, say, \"Ah, Doc, I'm sorry, I've got a memory problem; that's why I'm here. If I've met you before, I don't remember.\" \"Really, you don't remember? I was just here with the Monet prints?\" \"Sorry, Doc, I just don't have a clue.\" \"No problem, Jim. All I want you to do is rank these for me from the one you like the most to the one you like the least.\"What do they do? Well, let's first check and make sure they're really amnesiac. We ask these amnesiac patients to tell us which one they own, which one they chose last time, which one is theirs. And what we find is amnesiac patients just guess. These are normal controls, where if I did this with you, all of you would know which print you chose. But if I do this with amnesiac patients, they don't have a clue. They can't pick their print out of a lineup.Here's what normal controls do: they synthesize happiness. Right? This is the change in liking score, the change from the first time they ranked to the second time they ranked. Normal controls show \u2014 that was the magic I showed you; now I'm showing it to you in graphical form \u2014 \"The one I own is better than I thought. The one I didn't own, the one I left behind, is not as good as I thought.\" Amnesiacs do exactly the same thing. Think about this result.These people like better the one they own, but they don't know they own it. \"Yeah, right\" is not the right response! What these people did when they synthesized happiness is they really, truly changed their affective, hedonic, aesthetic reactions to that poster. They're not just saying it because they own it, because they don't know they own it.When psychologists show you bars, you know that they are showing you averages of lots of people. And yet, all of us have this psychological immune system, this capacity to synthesize happiness, but some of us do this trick better than others. And some situations allow anybody to do it more effectively than other situations do. It turns out that freedom, the ability to make up your mind and change your mind, is the friend of natural happiness, because it allows you to choose among all those delicious futures and find the one that you would most enjoy. But freedom to choose, to change and make up your mind, is the enemy of synthetic happiness.And I'm going to show you why. Dilbert already knows, of course. \"Dogbert's tech support. How may I abuse you?\" \"My printer prints a blank page after every document.\" \"Why complain about getting free paper?\" \"Free? Aren't you just giving me my own paper?\" \"Look at the quality of the free paper compared to your lousy regular paper! Only a fool or a liar would say that they look the same!\" \"Now that you mention it, it does seem a little silkier!\" \"What are you doing?\" \"I'm helping people accept the things they cannot change.\" Indeed.The psychological immune system works best when we are totally stuck, when we are trapped. This is the difference between dating and marriage. You go out on a date with a guy, and he picks his nose; you don't go out on another date. You're married to a guy and he picks his nose? He has a heart of gold. Don't touch the fruitcake! You find a way to be happy with what's happened.(Laughter)Now, what I want to show you is that people don't know this about themselves, and not knowing this can work to our supreme disadvantage.Here's an experiment we did at Harvard. We created a black-and-white photography course, and we allowed students to come in and learn how to use a darkroom. So we gave them cameras; they went around campus; they took 12 pictures of their favorite professors and their dorm room and their dog, and all the other things they wanted to have Harvard memories of. They bring us the camera; we make up a contact sheet; they figure out which are the two best pictures; and we now spend six hours teaching them about darkrooms. And they blow two of them up, and they have two gorgeous eight-by-10 glossies of meaningful things to them, and we say, \"Which one would you like to give up?\" \"I have to give one up?\" \"Yes, we need one as evidence of the class project. So you have to give me one. You have to make a choice. You get to keep one, and I get to keep one.\"Now, there are two conditions in this experiment. In one case, the students are told, \"But you know, if you want to change your mind, I'll always have the other one here, and in the next four days, before I actually mail it to headquarters\" \u2014 Yeah, \"headquarters\" \u2014 \"I'll be glad to swap it out with you. In fact, I'll come to your dorm room, just give me an email. Better yet, I'll check with you. You ever want to change your mind, it's totally returnable.\" The other half of the students are told exactly the opposite: \"Make your choice, and by the way, the mail is going out, gosh, in two minutes, to England. Your picture will be winging its way over the Atlantic. You will never see it again.\" Half of the students in each of these conditions are asked to make predictions about how much they're going to come to like the picture that they keep and the picture they leave behind. Other students are just sent back to their little dorm rooms and they are measured over the next three to six days on their liking, satisfaction with the pictures. And look at what we find.First of all, here's what students think is going to happen. They think they're going to maybe come to like the picture they chose a little more than the one they left behind, but these are not statistically significant differences. It's a very small increase, and it doesn't much matter whether they were in the reversible or irreversible condition.Wrong-o. Bad simulators. Because here's what's really happening. Both right before the swap and five days later, people who are stuck with that picture, who have no choice, who can never change their mind, like it a lot! And people who are deliberating \u2014 \"Should I return it? Have I gotten the right one? Maybe this isn't the good one? Maybe I left the good one?\" \u2014 have killed themselves. They don't like their picture, and in fact even after the opportunity to swap has expired, they still don't like their picture. Why? Because the [reversible] condition is not conducive to the synthesis of happiness.So here's the final piece of this experiment. We bring in a whole new group of naive Harvard students and we say, \"You know, we're doing a photography course, and we can do it one of two ways. We could do it so that when you take the two pictures, you'd have four days to change your mind, or we're doing another course where you take the two pictures and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it. Which course would you like to be in?\" Duh! 66 percent of the students, two-thirds, prefer to be in the course where they have the opportunity to change their mind. Hello? 66 percent of the students choose to be in the course in which they will ultimately be deeply dissatisfied with the picture. Because they do not know the conditions under which synthetic happiness grows.The Bard said everything best, of course, and he's making my point here but he's making it hyperbolically: \"'Tis nothing good or bad / But thinking makes it so.\" It's nice poetry, but that can't exactly be right. Is there really nothing good or bad? Is it really the case that gall bladder surgery and a trip to Paris are just the same thing? (Laughter) That seems like a one-question IQ test. They can't be exactly the same.In more turgid prose, but closer to the truth, was the father of modern capitalism, Adam Smith, and he said this. This is worth contemplating: \"The great source of both the misery and disorders of human life seems to arise from overrating the difference between one permanent situation and another \u2014 Some of these situations may, no doubt, deserve to be preferred to others, but none of them can deserve to be pursued with that passionate ardor which drives us to violate the rules either of prudence or of justice, or to corrupt the future tranquility of our minds, either by shame from the remembrance of our own folly, or by remorse for the horror of our own injustice.\" In other words: yes, some things are better than others.We should have preferences that lead us into one future over another. But when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast because we have overrated the difference between these futures, we are at risk. When our ambition is bounded, it leads us to work joyfully. When our ambition is unbounded, it leads us to lie, to cheat, to steal, to hurt others, to sacrifice things of real value. When our fears are bounded, we're prudent, we're cautious, we're thoughtful. When our fears are unbounded and overblown, we're reckless, and we're cowardly.The lesson I want to leave you with, from these data, is that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown, because we have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity we are constantly chasing when we choose experience.Thank you.

00:01:57.942\nand it's not because they whipped\nsome up, tried it and went, \"Yuck.\"\n\n00:01:57.966 --> 00:02:00.988\nIt's because, without\nleaving your armchair,\n\n00:02:01.012 --> 00:02:05.419\nyou can simulate that flavor\nand say \"yuck\" before you make it.\n\n00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.182\nLet's see how your experience\nsimulators are working.\n\n00:02:10.206 --> 00:02:12.045\nLet's just run a quick diagnostic\n\n00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.207\nbefore I proceed\nwith the rest of the talk.\n\n00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:17.946\nHere's two different futures\nthat I invite you to contemplate.\n\n00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.996\nYou can try to simulate them and tell me\nwhich one you think you might prefer.\n\n00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.554\nOne of them is winning the lottery.\nThis is about 314 million dollars.\n\n00:02:27.578 --> 00:02:30.458\nAnd the other is becoming paraplegic.\n\n00:02:30.482 --> 00:02:31.500\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:31.524 --> 00:02:33.152\nJust give it a moment of thought.\n\n00:02:33.176 --> 00:02:35.987\nYou probably don't feel\nlike you need a moment of thought.\n\n00:02:36.011 --> 00:02:40.129\nInterestingly, there are data\non these two groups of people,\n\n00:02:40.153 --> 00:02:42.131\ndata on how happy they are.\n\n00:02:42.155 --> 00:02:44.849\nAnd this is exactly\nwhat you expected, isn't it?\n\n00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:47.972\nBut these aren't the data.\nI made these up!\n\n00:02:47.996 --> 00:02:49.186\nThese are the data.\n\n00:02:49.672 --> 00:02:53.168\nYou failed the pop quiz, and you're hardly\nfive minutes into the lecture.\n\n00:02:53.192 --> 00:02:57.364\nBecause the fact is that a year\nafter losing the use of their legs,\n\n00:02:57.388 --> 00:03:02.115\nand a year after winning the lotto,\nlottery winners and paraplegics\n\n00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.692\nare equally happy with their lives.\n\n00:03:05.314 --> 00:03:07.770\nDon't feel too bad\nabout failing the first pop quiz,\n\n00:03:07.794 --> 00:03:11.421\nbecause everybody fails\nall of the pop quizzes all of the time.\n\n00:03:11.753 --> 00:03:14.142\nThe research that my laboratory\nhas been doing,\n\n00:03:14.166 --> 00:03:17.499\nthat economists and psychologists\naround the country have been doing,\n\n00:03:17.523 --> 00:03:20.319\nhas revealed something\nreally quite startling to us,\n\n00:03:20.343 --> 00:03:22.188\nsomething we call the \"impact bias,\"\n\n00:03:22.212 --> 00:03:25.381\nwhich is the tendency\nfor the simulator to work badly.\n\n00:03:25.753 --> 00:03:29.952\nFor the simulator to make you\nbelieve that different outcomes\n\n00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:32.335\nare more different\nthan in fact they really are.\n\n00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:34.642\nFrom field studies to laboratory studies,\n\n00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:39.405\nwe see that winning or losing an election,\ngaining or losing a romantic partner,\n\n00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:43.256\ngetting or not getting a promotion,\npassing or not passing a college test,\n\n00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.178\non and on, have far less impact,\nless intensity and much less duration\n\n00:03:49.202 --> 00:03:51.668\nthan people expect them to have.\n\n00:03:52.972 --> 00:03:58.019\nThis almost floors me --\n\n00:03:58.043 --> 00:04:02.529\na recent study showing\nhow major life traumas affect people\n\n00:04:02.553 --> 00:04:05.529\nsuggests that if it happened\nover three months ago,\n\n00:04:05.553 --> 00:04:07.115\nwith only a few exceptions,\n\n00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.897\nit has no impact whatsoever\non your happiness.\n\n00:04:11.756 --> 00:04:12.906\nWhy?\n\n00:04:13.446 --> 00:04:17.079\nBecause happiness can be synthesized.\n\n00:04:17.103 --> 00:04:21.389\nSir Thomas Brown wrote in 1642,\n\"I am the happiest man alive.\n\n00:04:21.413 --> 00:04:26.529\nI have that in me that can convert poverty\nto riches, adversity to prosperity.\n\n00:04:26.553 --> 00:04:31.499\nI am more invulnerable than Achilles;\nfortune hath not one place to hit me.\"\n\n00:04:31.523 --> 00:04:34.712\nWhat kind of remarkable machinery\ndoes this guy have in his head?\n\n00:04:34.736 --> 00:04:39.681\nWell, it turns out it's precisely the same\nremarkable machinery that all off us have.\n\n00:04:40.733 --> 00:04:42.597\nHuman beings have something\n\n00:04:42.621 --> 00:04:45.862\nthat we might think of\nas a \"psychological immune system.\"\n\n00:04:45.886 --> 00:04:50.879\nA system of cognitive processes, largely\nnon-conscious cognitive processes,\n\n00:04:50.903 --> 00:04:54.337\nthat help them change\ntheir views of the world,\n\n00:04:54.361 --> 00:04:55.758\nso that they can feel better\n\n00:04:55.782 --> 00:04:58.710\nabout the worlds\nin which they find themselves.\n\n00:04:58.734 --> 00:05:00.600\nLike Sir Thomas, you have this machine.\n\n00:05:00.624 --> 00:05:04.529\nUnlike Sir Thomas,\nyou seem not to know it.\n\n00:05:05.444 --> 00:05:10.529\nWe synthesize happiness, but we think\nhappiness is a thing to be found.\n\n00:05:10.553 --> 00:05:12.227\nNow, you don't need me to give you\n\n00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:16.339\ntoo many examples of people\nsynthesizing happiness, I suspect.\n\n00:05:16.363 --> 00:05:18.987\nThough I'm going to show\nyou some experimental evidence,\n\n00:05:19.011 --> 00:05:21.155\nyou don't have to look\nvery far for evidence.\n\n00:05:21.179 --> 00:05:22.850\nI took a copy of the New York Times\n\n00:05:22.874 --> 00:05:26.058\nand tried to find some instances\nof people synthesizing happiness.\n\n00:05:26.082 --> 00:05:28.095\nHere are three guys\nsynthesizing happiness.\n\n00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:30.800\n\"I'm better off physically,\nfinancially, mentally ...\n\n00:05:30.824 --> 00:05:33.873\n\"I don't have one minute's regret.\nIt was a glorious experience.\"\n\n00:05:33.897 --> 00:05:35.828\n\"I believe it turned out for the best.\"\n\n00:05:35.852 --> 00:05:38.101\nWho are these characters\nwho are so damn happy?\n\n00:05:38.125 --> 00:05:39.495\nThe first one is Jim Wright.\n\n00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:41.390\nSome of you are old enough to remember:\n\n00:05:41.414 --> 00:05:43.877\nhe was the chairman\nof the House of Representatives\n\n00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:45.273\nand he resigned in disgrace\n\n00:05:45.297 --> 00:05:47.452\nwhen this young Republican\nnamed Newt Gingrich\n\n00:05:47.476 --> 00:05:49.620\nfound out about a shady\nbook deal he had done.\n\n00:05:49.644 --> 00:05:50.886\nHe lost everything.\n\n00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.688\nThe most powerful Democrat\nin the country lost everything.\n\n00:05:53.712 --> 00:05:55.508\nHe lost his money, he lost his power.\n\n00:05:55.532 --> 00:05:57.820\nWhat does he have to say\nall these years later?\n\n00:05:57.844 --> 00:06:00.583\n\"I am so much better off physically,\nfinancially, mentally\n\n00:06:00.607 --> 00:06:02.408\nand in almost every other way.\"\n\n00:06:02.432 --> 00:06:04.671\nWhat other way would there\nbe to be better off?\n\n00:06:04.695 --> 00:06:06.523\nVegetably? Minerally? Animally?\n\n00:06:06.547 --> 00:06:09.261\nHe's pretty much covered them there.\n\n00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:11.766\nMoreese Bickham is somebody\nyou've never heard of.\n\n00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.470\nMoreese Bickham uttered\nthese words upon being released.\n\n00:06:14.494 --> 00:06:15.803\nHe was 78 years old.\n\n00:06:15.827 --> 00:06:18.750\nHe'd spent 37 years\nin a Louisiana State Penitentiary\n\n00:06:18.774 --> 00:06:20.258\nfor a crime he didn't commit.\n\n00:06:20.282 --> 00:06:22.115\n[He was ultimately released\n\n00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:24.408\nfor good behavior\nhalfway through his sentence.]\n\n00:06:24.432 --> 00:06:26.408\nWhat did he say about his experience?\n\n00:06:26.432 --> 00:06:29.990\n\"I don't have one minute's regret.\nIt was a glorious experience.\" Glorious!\n\n00:06:30.014 --> 00:06:31.264\nHe is not saying,\n\n00:06:31.288 --> 00:06:33.684\n\"Well, there were some nice guys.\nThey had a gym.\"\n\n00:06:33.708 --> 00:06:34.859\n\"Glorious,\"\n\n00:06:34.883 --> 00:06:38.161\na word we usually reserve for something\nlike a religious experience.\n\n00:06:38.185 --> 00:06:41.914\nHarry S. Langerman uttered these words,\nand he's somebody you might have known\n\n00:06:41.938 --> 00:06:45.547\nbut didn't, because in 1949\nhe read a little article in the paper\n\n00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:48.537\nabout a hamburger stand owned\nby two brothers named McDonalds.\n\n00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:50.792\nAnd he thought,\n\"That's a really neat idea!\"\n\n00:06:50.816 --> 00:06:52.498\nSo he went to find them. They said,\n\n00:06:52.523 --> 00:06:55.067\n\"We can give you a franchise\non this for 3,000 bucks.\"\n\n00:06:55.091 --> 00:06:58.331\nHarry went back to New York,\nasked his brother, an investment banker,\n\n00:06:58.355 --> 00:07:01.263\nto loan him the $3,000,\nand his brother's immortal words were,\n\n00:07:01.287 --> 00:07:03.005\n\"You idiot, nobody eats hamburgers.\"\n\n00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:04.518\nHe wouldn't lend him the money,\n\n00:07:04.542 --> 00:07:07.756\nand of course, six months later\nRay Kroc had exactly the same idea.\n\n00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.974\nIt turns out people do eat hamburgers,\n\n00:07:09.998 --> 00:07:13.132\nand Ray Kroc, for a while,\nbecame the richest man in America.\n\n00:07:13.822 --> 00:07:14.980\nAnd then, finally,\n\n00:07:15.004 --> 00:07:18.464\nsome of you recognize\nthis young photo of Pete Best,\n\n00:07:18.488 --> 00:07:20.631\nwho was the original\ndrummer for the Beatles,\n\n00:07:20.655 --> 00:07:24.480\nuntil they, you know, sent him\nout on an errand and snuck away\n\n00:07:24.504 --> 00:07:26.464\nand picked up Ringo on a tour.\n\n00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:28.784\nWell, in 1994, when Pete Best\nwas interviewed --\n\n00:07:28.808 --> 00:07:31.844\nyes, he's still a drummer;\nyes, he's a studio musician --\n\n00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:35.375\nhe had this to say: \"I'm happier\nthan I would have been with the Beatles.\"\n\n00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:38.531\nOkay.

told,\n\n00:16:02.603 --> 00:16:04.959\n\"But you know,\nif you want to change your mind,\n\n00:16:04.983 --> 00:16:06.836\nI'll always have the other one here,\n\n00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:11.223\nand

picture they leave behind.\n\n00:16:45.801 --> 00:16:48.708\nOther students are just sent back\nto their little dorm rooms\n\n00:16:48.732 --> 00:16:51.843\nand they are measured\nover the next three

all, here's what students\nthink is going to happen.\n\n00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:02.330\nThey think they're going to maybe\ncome to like the picture they chose\n\n00:17:02.354 --> 00:17:04.843\na little more\nthan the one they left behind,\n\n00:17:04.867 --> 00:17:07.927\nbut these are not statistically\nsignificant differences.\n\n00:17:07.951 --> 00:17:11.615\nIt's a very small increase,\nand it

The official dogma of all Western industrial societies. And the official dogma runs like this: if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens, the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom. The reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good, valuable, worthwhile, essential to being human. And because if people have freedom, then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare, and no one has to decide on our behalf. The way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice.The more choice people have, the more freedom they have, and the more freedom they have, the more welfare they have. This, I think, is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it. And it's also deeply embedded in our lives. I'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us.This is my supermarket. Not such a big one. I want to say just a word about salad dressing. 175 salad dressings in my supermarket, if you don't count the 10 extra-virgin olive oils and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings, in the off-chance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you. So this is what the supermarket is like. And then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system \u2014 speakers, CD player, tape player, tuner, amplifier \u2014 and in this one single consumer electronics store, there are that many stereo systems. We can construct six-and-a-half-million different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store.You've got to admit that's a lot of choice. In other domains \u2014 the world of communications. There was a time, when I was a boy, when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted, as long as it came from Ma Bell. You rented your phone. You didn't buy it. One consequence of that, by the way, is that the phone never broke. And those days are gone. We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones, especially in the world of cell phones. These are cell phones of the future. My favorite is the middle one \u2014 the MP3 player, nose hair trimmer, and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e torch.(Laughter)And if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet, you can rest assured that one day soon, you will. And what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question. And do you know what the answer to this question now is? The answer is \"no.\" It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much.So, in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things, the same explosion of choice is true. Health care. It is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you what to do. Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you, \"Well, we could do A, or we could do B. A has these benefits, and these risks. B has these benefits, and these risks. What do you want to do?\" And you say, \"Doc, what should I do?\" And the doc says, \"A has these benefits and risks, and B has these benefits and risks. What do you want to do?\" And you say, \"If you were me, Doc, what would you do?\" And the doc says, \"But I'm not you.\" And the result is \u2014 we call it \"patient autonomy,\" which makes it sound like a good thing, but it really is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision-making from somebody who knows something \u2014 namely, the doctor \u2014 to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions \u2014 namely, the patient. There's enormous marketing of prescription drugs to people like you and me, which, if you think about it, makes no sense at all, since we can't buy them. Why do they market to us if we can't buy them? The answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescriptions to be changed.Something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice, as this slide is meant to indicate. We don't inherit an identity; we get to invent it. And we get to re-invent ourselves as often as we like. And that means that every day, when you wake up in the morning, you have to decide what kind of person you want to be. With respect to marriage and family, there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could, and then you started having kids as soon as you could. The only real choice was who, not when, and not what you did after.Nowadays, everything is very much up for grabs. I teach wonderfully intelligent students, and I assign 20 percent less work than I used to. And it's not because they're less smart, and it's not because they're less diligent. It's because they are preoccupied, asking themselves, \"Should I get married or not? Should I get married now? Should I get married later? Should I have kids first, or a career first?\" All of these are consuming questions. And they're going to answer these questions, whether or not it means not doing all the work I assign and not getting a good grade in my courses. And indeed they should. These are important questions to answer.Work \u2014 we are blessed, as Carl was pointing out, with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet \u2014 except the Randolph Hotel.(Laughter)(Applause)There is one corner, by the way, that I'm not going to tell anybody about, where the WiFi actually works. I'm not telling you about it because I want to use it. So what this means, this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work, is that we have to make a decision, again and again and again, about whether we should or shouldn't be working. We can go to watch our kid play soccer, and we have our cell phone on one hip, and our Blackberry on our other hip, and our laptop, presumably, on our laps. And even if they're all shut off, every minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game, we are also asking ourselves, \"Should I answer this cell phone call? Should I respond to this email? Should I draft this letter?\" And even if the answer to the question is \"no,\" it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would've been.So everywhere we look, big things and small things, material things and lifestyle things, life is a matter of choice. And the world we used to live in looked like this. [Well, actually, they are written in stone.] That is to say, there were some choices, but not everything was a matter of choice. And the world we now live in looks like this.[The Ten Commandments DYI Kit]And the question is, is this good news, or bad news? And the answer is, \"yes.\"(Laughter)We all know what's good about it, so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it. All of this choice has two effects, two negative effects on people. One effect, paradoxically, is that it produces paralysis, rather than liberation. With so many options to choose from, people find it very difficult to choose at all. I'll give you one very dramatic example of this: a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans. A colleague of mine got access to investment records from Vanguard, the gigantic mutual-fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different workplaces. And what she found is that for every 10 mutual funds the employer offered, rate of participation went down two percent. You offer 50 funds \u2014 10 percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five. Why? Because with 50 funds to choose from, it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose, that you'll just put it off until tomorrow. And then tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, and of course tomorrow never comes. Understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away, it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer. By not participating, they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the employer, who would happily match their contribution.So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices. And I think it makes the world look like this.[And lastly, for all eternity, French, bleu cheese, or ranch?](Laughter)You really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity, right? You don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund, or the wrong salad dressing. So that's one effect. The second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice, we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from. And there are several reasons for this. One of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from, if you buy one, and it's not perfect \u2014 and what salad dressing is? \u2014 it's easy to imagine you could have made a different choice that would have been better. And what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made, and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made, even if it was a good decision. The more options there are, the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose.Second, what economists call \"opportunity costs.\" Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to. Well, when there are lots of alternatives to consider, it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen. Here's an example.[I can't stop thinking about those other available parking spaces on W 85th street]Sorry if you're not New Yorkers. Here's what you're supposed to be thinking. Here's this couple on the Hamptons. Very expensive real estate. Gorgeous beach. Beautiful day. They have it all to themselves. What could be better? \"Well, damn it,\" this guy is thinking, \"It's August. Everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away. I could be parking right in front of my building.\" And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity, day after day, to have a great parking space. Opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose, even when what we choose is terrific. And the more options there are to consider, the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs.Here's another example.(Laughter)Now this cartoon makes a lot of points. It makes points about living in the moment as well, and probably about doing things slowly. But one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing, you're choosing not to do other things that may have lots of attractive features, and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive.Third: escalation of expectations. This hit me when I went to replace my jeans. I wear jeans almost all the time. There was a time when jeans came in one flavor, and you bought them, and they fit like crap, they were incredibly uncomfortable, if you wore them and washed them enough times, they started to feel OK. I went to replace my jeans after years of wearing these old ones, and I said, \"I want a pair of jeans. Here's my size.\" And the shopkeeper said, \"Do you want slim fit, easy fit, relaxed fit? You want button fly or zipper fly? You want stonewashed or acid-washed? Do you want them distressed? You want boot cut, tapered, blah blah.\" On and on he went. My jaw dropped. And after I recovered, I said, \"I want the kind that used to be the only kind.\"(Laughter)He had no idea what that was,(Laughter)so I spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans, and I walked out of the store \u2014 truth! \u2014 with the best-fitting jeans I had ever had. I did better.All this choice made it possible for me to do better. But \u2014 I felt worse. Why? I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself. The reason \u2014(Laughter)The reason I felt worse is that, with all of these options available, my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up. I had very low, no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor. When they came in 100 flavors, damn it, one of them should've been perfect. And what I got was good, but it wasn't perfect. And so I compared what I got to what I expected, and what I got was disappointing in comparison to what I expected. Adding options to people's lives can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be. And what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results, even when they're good results. Nobody in the world of marketing knows this.[It all looks so great. I can't wait to be disappointed.]Because if they did, you wouldn't all know what this was about. The truth is more like this.[Everything was better back when everything was worse]The reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse, it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise. Nowadays, the world we live in \u2014 we affluent, industrialized citizens, with perfection the expectation \u2014 the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be. You will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations, my expectations, have gone through the roof. The secret to happiness \u2014 this is what you all came for \u2014 the secret to happiness is low expectations.(Laughter)[You'll do](Applause)(Laughter)I want to say \u2014 just a little autobiographical moment \u2014 that I actually am married to a wife, and she's really quite wonderful. I couldn't have done better. I didn't settle. But settling isn't always such a bad thing.Finally \u2014 One consequence of buying a bad-fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied, and you ask why, who's responsible, the answer is clear: the world is responsible. What could you do? When there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available, and you buy one that is disappointing, and you ask why, who's responsible? It is equally clear that the answer to the question is \"you.\" You could have done better. With a hundred different kinds of jeans on display, there is no excuse for failure. And so when people make decisions, and even though the results of the decisions are good, they feel disappointed about them; they blame themselves.Clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation. I believe a significant \u2014 not the only, but a significant \u2014 contributor to this explosion of depression, and also suicide, is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high, and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves, they think they're at fault. And so the net result is that we do better in general, objectively, and we feel worse. So let me remind you. This is the official dogma, the one that we all take to be true, and it's all false. It is not true. There's no question that some choice is better than none, but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice. There's some magical amount. I don't know what it is. I'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our welfare.Now, as a policy matter \u2014 I'm almost done \u2014 as a policy matter, the thing to think about is this: what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material affluence. There are lots of places in the world, and we have heard about several of them, where their problem is not that they have too much choice. Their problem is that they have too little. So the stuff I'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern, affluent, Western societies. And what is so frustrating and infuriating is this: Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult-to-install child seats don't help. It's a waste of money. What I'm telling you is that these expensive, complicated choices \u2014 it's not simply that they don't help. They actually hurt. They actually make us worse off.If some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options, not only would those people's lives be improved, but ours would be improved also, which is what economists call a \"Pareto-improving move.\" Income redistribution will make everyone better off \u2014 not just poor people \u2014 because of how all this excess choice plagues us. So to conclude. [You can be anything you want to be \u2014 no limits] You're supposed to read this cartoon, and, being a sophisticated person, say, \"Ah! What does this fish know? You know, nothing is possible in this fishbowl.\" Impoverished imagination, a myopic view of the world \u2014 and that's the way I read it at first. The more I thought about it, however, the more I came to the view that this fish knows something. Because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible, you don't have freedom. You have paralysis. If you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible, you decrease satisfaction. You increase paralysis, and you decrease satisfaction.Everybody needs a fishbowl. This one is almost certainly too limited \u2014 perhaps even for the fish, certainly for us. But the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery, and, I suspect, disaster.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 93, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.244\nI'm going to talk to you about some stuff\nthat's in this book of mine\n\n00:00:15.268 --> 00:00:18.365\nthat I hope will resonate with other\nthings you've already heard,\n\n00:00:18.389 --> 00:00:20.690\nand I'll try to make\nsome connections myself,\n\n00:00:20.714 --> 00:00:22.034\nin case you missed them.\n\n00:00:22.058 --> 00:00:26.251\nBut I want to start with\nwhat I call the \"official dogma.\"\n\n00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:28.346\nThe official dogma of what?\n\n00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.676\nThe official dogma of all Western\nindustrial societies.\n\n00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.013\nAnd the official dogma runs like this:\n\n00:00:34.037 --> 00:00:38.735\nif we are interested in maximizing\nthe welfare of our citizens,\n\n00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:43.699\nthe way to do that\nis to maximize individual freedom.\n\n00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.934\nThe reason for this is both that freedom\nis in and of itself good,\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:52.080\nvaluable, worthwhile,\nessential to being human.\n\n00:00:52.477 --> 00:00:54.934\nAnd because if people have freedom,\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.934\nthen each of us can act on our own\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.244\nto do the things\nthat will maximize our welfare,\n\n00:00:59.268 --> 00:01:01.568\nand no one has to decide on our behalf.\n\n00:01:02.656 --> 00:01:06.695\nThe way to maximize freedom\nis to maximize choice.\n\n00:01:07.696 --> 00:01:11.386\nThe more choice people have,\nthe more freedom they have,\n\n00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.093\nand the more freedom they have,\n\n00:01:13.117 --> 00:01:14.744\nthe more welfare they have.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:20.934\nThis, I think, is so deeply embedded\nin the water supply\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:24.198\nthat it wouldn't occur\nto anyone to question it.\n\n00:01:25.253 --> 00:01:28.934\nAnd it's also deeply\nembedded in our lives.\n\n00:01:29.606 --> 00:01:31.270\nI'll give you some examples\n\n00:01:31.294 --> 00:01:34.934\nof what modern progress\nhas made possible for us.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.311\nThis is my supermarket.\n\n00:01:36.788 --> 00:01:38.055\nNot such a big one.\n\n00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:41.197\nI want to say just a word\nabout salad dressing.\n\n00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:43.934\n175 salad dressings in my supermarket,\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.934\nif you don't count the 10\nextra-virgin olive oils\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.934\nand 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.934\nto make a very large number\nof your own salad dressings,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:57.711\nin the off-chance that none of the 175\nthe store has on offer suit you.\n\n00:01:58.434 --> 00:02:00.371\nSo this is what the supermarket is like.\n\n00:02:00.395 --> 00:02:02.823\nAnd then you go\nto the consumer electronics store\n\n00:02:02.847 --> 00:02:04.442\nto set up a stereo system --\n\n00:02:04.466 --> 00:02:07.934\nspeakers, CD player,\ntape player, tuner, amplifier --\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:11.934\nand in this one single\nconsumer electronics store,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:15.237\nthere are that many stereo systems.\n\n00:02:15.878 --> 00:02:20.855\nWe can construct six-and-a-half-million\ndifferent stereo systems\n\n00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.537\nout of the components\nthat are on offer in one store.\n\n00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:25.575\nYou've got to admit\nthat's a lot of choice.\n\n00:02:26.252 --> 00:02:29.934\nIn other domains --\nthe world of communications.\n\n00:02:30.347 --> 00:02:32.189\nThere was a time, when I was a boy,\n\n00:02:32.213 --> 00:02:35.030\nwhen you could get any kind\nof telephone service you wanted,\n\n00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:36.872\nas long as it came from Ma Bell.\n\n00:02:36.896 --> 00:02:38.934\nYou rented your phone.

question.\n\n00:03:12.743 --> 00:03:15.411\nAnd do you know what the answer\nto this question now is?\n\n00:03:15.435 --> 00:03:16.950\nThe answer is \"no.\"\n\n00:03:17.474 --> 00:03:20.934\nIt is

00:03:29.451\nthe same explosion of choice is true.\n\n00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:30.981\nHealth care.\n\n00:03:31.005 --> 00:03:33.538\nIt is no longer the case\nin the United States\n\n00:03:33.562 --> 00:03:37.057\nthat you go to the doctor,\nand the doctor tells you what to do.\n\n00:03:37.438 --> 00:03:39.097\nInstead, you go to the doctor,\n\n00:03:39.121 --> 00:03:42.271\nand the doctor tells you,\n\"Well, we could do A, or we could do B.\n\n00:03:42.295 --> 00:03:44.677\nA has these benefits, and these risks.\n\n00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:46.906\nB has these benefits, and these

has\nthese benefits and risks,\n\n00:03:54.738 --> 00:03:56.696\nand B has these benefits and risks.\n\n00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.259\nWhat do you want to do?\"\n\n00:03:58.735 --> 00:04:02.068\nAnd you say, \"If you were me,\nDoc, what would you do?\"\n\n00:04:02.751 --> 00:04:04.792\nAnd the doc says, \"But I'm not you.\"\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.776\nAnd the result is --\nwe call it \"patient autonomy,\"\n\n00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.673\nwhich makes it sound like a good thing,\n\n00:04:10.697 --> 00:04:13.760\nbut it really is a shifting\nof the burden and the responsibility\n\n00:04:13.784 --> 00:04:16.433\nfor decision-making from somebody\nwho knows something --\n\n00:04:16.457 --> 00:04:17.471\nnamely, the doctor --\n\n00:04:17.495 --> 00:04:20.227\nto somebody who knows nothing\nand is almost certainly sick\n\n00:04:20.251 --> 00:04:22.934\nand thus not in the best shape\nto be making decisions --\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.830\nnamely, the patient.\n\n00:04:24.854 --> 00:04:27.680\nThere's enormous marketing\nof prescription drugs\n\n00:04:27.704 --> 00:04:28.955\nto people like you and me,\n\n00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.435\nwhich, if you think about it,\nmakes no sense at all,\n\n00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:32.672\nsince we can't buy them.\n\n00:04:32.696 --> 00:04:35.149\nWhy do they market to us\nif we can't buy them?\n\n00:04:35.173 --> 00:04:38.934\nThe answer is that they expect us\nto call our doctors the next morning\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.207\nand ask for our prescriptions\nto be changed.\n\n00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.467\nSomething as dramatic as our identity\n\n00:04:46.491 --> 00:04:49.251\nhas now become a matter of choice,\n\n00:04:49.275 --> 00:04:52.728\nas this slide is meant to indicate.\n\n00:04:52.752 --> 00:04:55.580\nWe don't inherit an identity;\nwe get to invent it.\n\n00:04:55.604 --> 00:04:58.934\nAnd we get to re-invent\nourselves as often as we like.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.911\nAnd that means that every day,\nwhen you wake up in the morning,\n\n00:05:01.935 --> 00:05:04.870\nyou have to decide what kind\nof person you want to be.\n\n00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:09.378\nWith respect to marriage and family,\n\n00:05:09.402 --> 00:05:14.223\nthere was a time when the default\nassumption that almost everyone had\n\n00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:16.349\nis that you got married\nas soon as you could,\n\n00:05:16.373 --> 00:05:18.983\nand then you started having kids\nas soon as you could.\n\n00:05:19.007 --> 00:05:21.862\nThe only real choice was who,\n\n00:05:21.886 --> 00:05:24.499\nnot when, and not what you did after.\n\n00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.934\nNowadays, everything\nis very much up for grabs.\n\n00:05:27.958 -->

freedom of choice\nwe have with respect to work,\n\n00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.402\nis that we have to make a decision,\n\n00:06:38.426 --> 00:06:40.514\nagain and again and again,\n\n00:06:40.538 --> 00:06:42.934\nabout whether we should\nor shouldn't be working.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.563\nWe can go to watch our kid play soccer,\n\n00:06:45.587 --> 00:06:47.564\nand we have our cell phone

if they're all shut off,\n\n00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:57.600\nevery minute that we're watching\nour kid mutilate a soccer game,\n\n00:06:57.624 --> 00:06:59.406\nwe are also asking ourselves,\n\n00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.456\n\"Should I answer this cell phone call?\n\n00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.353\nShould I respond to this email?\nShould I draft this letter?\"\n\n00:07:04.377 --> 00:07:06.934\nAnd even if the answer\nto the question is \"no,\"\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:10.244\nit's certainly going to make\nthe experience of your kid's soccer game\n\n00:07:10.268 --> 00:07:12.182\nvery different than it would've been.\n\n00:07:12.624 --> 00:07:14.665\nSo everywhere we look,\n\n00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:18.447\nbig things and small things,\nmaterial things and lifestyle things,\n\n00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:20.639\nlife is a matter of choice.\n\n00:07:21.402 --> 00:07:24.934\nAnd the world we used\nto live in looked like this.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.169\n[Well, actually,\nthey are written in stone.]\n\n00:07:27.193 --> 00:07:29.135\nThat is to say, there were some choices,\n\n00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:31.160\nbut not everything was a matter of choice.\n\n00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:33.319\nAnd the world we now live in\nlooks like this.\n\n00:07:33.343 --> 00:07:34.919\n[The Ten Commandments DYI Kit]\n\n00:07:34.943 --> 00:07:38.674\nAnd the question is,\nis this good news, or bad news?\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.157\nAnd the answer is, \"yes.\"\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.569\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:45.315 --> 00:07:47.421\nWe all know

00:07:55.378\ntwo negative effects on people.\n\n00:07:56.118 --> 00:07:58.570\nOne effect, paradoxically,\n\n00:07:58.594 --> 00:08:02.051\nis that it produces paralysis,\nrather than liberation.\n\n00:08:02.656 --> 00:08:04.934\nWith so many options to choose from,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:08.526\npeople find it very difficult\nto choose at all.\n\n00:08:09.251 --> 00:08:11.934\nI'll give you one very\ndramatic example of this:\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:17.514\na study that was done of investments\nin voluntary retirement plans.\n\n00:08:18.067 --> 00:08:23.389\nA colleague of mine got access\nto investment records from Vanguard,\n\n00:08:23.413 --> 00:08:25.034\nthe gigantic mutual-fund company\n\n00:08:25.058 --> 00:08:28.934\nof about a million employees\nand about 2,000 different workplaces.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.326\nAnd what she found\n\n00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:34.618\nis that for every 10 mutual funds\nthe employer offered,\n\n00:08:34.642 --> 00:08:38.324\nrate of participation\nwent down two percent.\n\n00:08:39.228 --> 00:08:43.456\nYou offer 50 funds -- 10 percent\nfewer employees participate\n\n00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.137\nthan if you only offer five.\n\n00:08:45.972 --> 00:08:47.131\nWhy?\n\n00:08:47.155 --> 00:08:49.139\nBecause with 50 funds to choose from,\n\n00:08:49.163 --> 00:08:52.934\nit's so damn hard to decide\nwhich fund to choose,\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.006\nthat you'll just put it off\nuntil tomorrow.\n\n00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.229\nAnd then tomorrow,\n\n00:08:56.253 --> 00:08:58.230\nand tomorrow, and tomorrow,\n\n00:08:58.254 --> 00:09:00.259\nand of course tomorrow never comes.\n\n00:09:00.283 --> 00:09:02.412\nUnderstand that not only does this mean\n\n00:09:02.436 --> 00:09:05.386\nthat people are going to have\nto eat dog food when they retire\n\n00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:07.592\nbecause they don't have\nenough money put away,\n\n00:09:07.616 --> 00:09:10.203\nit also means that making\nthe decision is so hard\n\n00:09:10.227 --> 00:09:13.934\nthat they pass up significant\nmatching money from the employer.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:17.934\nBy not participating, they are passing up\nas much as 5,000 dollars a year\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.255\nfrom the employer,\n\n00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:21.378\nwho would happily\nmatch their contribution.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.638\nSo paralysis is a consequence\nof having too many choices.\n\n00:09:25.662 --> 00:09:28.148\nAnd I think it makes\nthe world look like this.\n\n00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:33.164\n[And lastly, for all eternity,\nFrench, bleu cheese, or ranch?]\n\n00:09:33.188 --> 00:09:34.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:38.832\nYou really want to get the decision\nright if it's for all eternity, right?\n\n00:09:38.856 --> 00:09:42.398\nYou don't want to pick the wrong\nmutual fund, or the wrong salad dressing.\n\n00:09:42.422 --> 00:09:43.574\nSo that's one effect.\n\n00:09:43.598 --> 00:09:44.732\nThe second effect\n\n00:09:44.756 --> 00:09:50.314\nis that even if we manage to overcome\nthe paralysis and make a choice,\n\n00:09:50.338 --> 00:09:54.251\nwe end up less satisfied\nwith the result of the choice\n\n00:09:54.275 --> 00:09:56.934\nthan we would be if we had\nfewer options to choose from.\n\n00:09:57.727 --> 00:09:59.605\nAnd there are several reasons for this.\n\n00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.327\nOne of them\n\n00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:04.308\nis that with a lot of different\nsalad dressings to choose from,\n\n00:10:04.332 --> 00:10:07.675\nif you buy one, and it's not perfect --\nand what salad dressing is? --\n\n00:10:07.699 --> 00:10:10.518\nit's easy to imagine\nyou could have made a different choice\n\n00:10:10.542 --> 00:10:11.919\nthat would have been better.\n\n00:10:12.666 --> 00:10:13.934\nAnd what happens\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:18.760\nis this imagined alternative induces you\nto regret the decision you made,\n\n00:10:18.784 --> 00:10:21.362\nand this regret subtracts\nfrom the satisfaction\n\n00:10:21.386 --> 00:10:23.164\nyou get out of the decision you made,\n\n00:10:23.188 --> 00:10:24.766\neven if it was a good decision.\n\n00:10:25.568 --> 00:10:29.292\nThe more options there are,\nthe easier it is to regret anything at all\n\n00:10:29.316 --> 00:10:31.840\nthat is disappointing\nabout the option that you chose.\n\n00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.934\nSecond, what economists\ncall \"opportunity costs.\"\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.934\nDan Gilbert made a big point this morning\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:41.934\nof talking about how much the way\nin which we value things\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.934\ndepends on what we compare them to.\n\n00:10:44.349 --> 00:10:47.934\nWell, when there are lots\nof alternatives to consider,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:51.113\nit is easy to imagine\nthe attractive features\n\n00:10:51.137 --> 00:10:53.934\nof alternatives that you reject\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:58.591\nthat make you less satisfied\nwith the alternative that you've chosen.\n\n00:10:58.615 --> 00:10:59.698\nHere's an example.\n\n00:10:59.722 --> 00:11:03.631\n[I can't stop thinking about those other\navailable parking spaces on W 85th street]\n\n00:11:03.655 --> 00:11:05.195\nSorry if you're not New Yorkers.\n\n00:11:05.219 --> 00:11:07.228\nHere's what you're\nsupposed to be thinking.\n\n00:11:07.252 --> 00:11:09.014\nHere's this couple on the Hamptons.\n\n00:11:09.038 -->

Beautiful day.\nThey have it all to themselves.\n\n00:11:13.358 --> 00:11:14.729\nWhat could be better?\n\n00:11:14.753 --> 00:11:16.630\n\"Well, damn it,\" this guy is thinking,\n\n00:11:16.654 --> 00:11:20.628\n\"It's August.

Here's my size.\"\n\n00:12:37.982 --> 00:12:39.168\nAnd the shopkeeper said,\n\n00:12:39.192 --> 00:12:41.934\n\"Do you want slim fit,\neasy fit, relaxed fit?\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:45.339\nYou want button fly or zipper fly?\nYou want stonewashed or acid-washed?\n\n00:12:45.363 --> 00:12:46.728\nDo you want them distressed?\n\n00:12:46.752 --> 00:12:49.589\nYou want boot cut, tapered, blah blah.\"\nOn and on he went.\n\n00:12:49.613 --> 00:12:50.762\nMy jaw dropped.\n\n00:12:51.524 --> 00:12:53.024\nAnd after I recovered, I said,\n\n00:12:53.048 --> 00:12:56.048\n\"I want the kind that used\nto be the only kind.\"\n\n00:12:56.246 --> 00:13:00.841\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.935\nHe had no idea what that was,\n\n00:13:02.959 --> 00:13:04.116\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.934\nso I spent an hour trying on\nall these damn jeans,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.005\nand I walked out of the store -- truth! --\n\n00:13:09.029 --> 00:13:11.670\nwith the best-fitting jeans\nI had ever had.\n\n00:13:11.694 --> 00:13:12.853\nI did better.\n\n00:13:12.877 --> 00:13:16.121\nAll this choice made\nit possible for me to do better.\n\n00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:17.812\nBut --\n\n00:13:17.836 --> 00:13:19.256\nI felt worse.\n\n00:13:20.502 --> 00:13:23.934\nWhy? I wrote a whole book\nto try to explain this to myself.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.300\nThe reason --\n\n00:13:25.324 --> 00:13:29.557\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:29.703 --> 00:13:31.934\nThe reason I felt worse is that,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.672\nwith all of these options available,\n\n00:13:34.696 --> 00:13:39.877\nmy expectations about how good\na pair of jeans should be went up.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:45.172\nI had very low, no particular expectations\nwhen they only came in one flavor.\n\n00:13:45.196 --> 00:13:48.836\nWhen they came in 100 flavors, damn it,\none of them should've been perfect.\n\n00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.197\nAnd what I got was good,\nbut it wasn't perfect.\n\n00:13:51.221 --> 00:13:54.307\nAnd so I compared what I got\nto what I expected,\n\n00:13:54.331 --> 00:13:57.561\nand what I got was disappointing\nin comparison to what I expected.\n\n00:13:58.156 --> 00:14:00.196\nAdding options to people's lives\n\n00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.824\ncan't help but increase\nthe expectations people have\n\n00:14:03.848 --> 00:14:05.934\nabout how good those options will be.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:09.149\nAnd what that's going to produce\nis less satisfaction with results,\n\n00:14:09.173 --> 00:14:10.926\neven when they're good results.\n\n00:14:11.736 --> 00:14:14.200\nNobody in the world\nof marketing knows this.\n\n00:14:14.224 --> 00:14:16.993\n[It all looks so great.\nI can't wait to be disappointed.]\n\n00:14:17.017 --> 00:14:20.502\nBecause if they did, you wouldn't all know\nwhat this was about.\n\n00:14:20.917 --> 00:14:22.821\nThe truth is more like this.\n\n00:14:23.479 --> 00:14:26.548\n[Everything was better back\nwhen everything was worse]\n\n00:14:26.572 --> 00:14:30.584\nThe reason that everything was better\nback when everything was worse\n\n00:14:30.608 --> 00:14:32.750\nis that when everything was worse,\n\n00:14:32.774 --> 00:14:34.545\nit was actually possible for people\n\n00:14:34.569 --> 00:14:36.964\nto have experiences\nthat were a pleasant surprise.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:42.243\nNowadays, the world we live in --\nwe affluent, industrialized

good\nas you expect it to be.\n\n00:14:48.712 --> 00:14:50.554\nYou will never be pleasantly surprised\n\n00:14:50.578 --> 00:14:52.624\nbecause your expectations,\nmy expectations,\n\n00:14:52.648 --> 00:14:53.997\nhave gone through the roof.\n\n00:14:54.021 --> 00:14:57.442\nThe secret to happiness --\nthis is what you all came for --\n\n00:14:57.466 --> 00:15:00.015\nthe secret to happiness\n\n00:15:00.039 --> 00:15:02.007\nis low expectations.\n\n00:15:02.031 --> 00:15:05.275\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:05.575 --> 00:15:06.784\n[You'll do]\n\n00:15:06.808 -->

better.\n\n00:15:21.556 --> 00:15:23.116\nI didn't settle.\n\n00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.553\nBut settling isn't\nalways such a bad thing.\n\n00:15:26.116 --> 00:15:27.124\nFinally --\n\n00:15:28.038 --> 00:15:31.355\nOne consequence of buying\na bad-fitting pair of jeans\n\n00:15:31.379 --> 00:15:33.427\nwhen there is only one kind to buy\n\n00:15:33.451 --> 00:15:35.934\nis that when you are dissatisfied,\nand you ask why,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.195\nwho's responsible,\n\n00:15:37.219 --> 00:15:39.727\nthe answer is clear:\nthe world is responsible.\n\n00:15:39.751 --> 00:15:41.344\nWhat could you do?\n\n00:15:41.368 --> 00:15:44.336\nWhen there are hundreds\nof different styles of jeans available,\n\n00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.732\nand you buy one that is disappointing,\n\n00:15:46.756 --> 00:15:48.934\nand you ask why, who's responsible?\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:53.277\nIt is equally clear that the answer\nto the question is \"you.\"\n\n00:15:54.118 --> 00:15:55.934\nYou could have done better.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.934\nWith a hundred different kinds\nof jeans on display,\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.934\nthere is no excuse for failure.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.342\nAnd so when people make decisions,\n\n00:16:03.366 --> 00:16:05.934\nand even though the results\nof the decisions are good,\n\n00:16:05.958 -->

00:16:15.175\nin the industrial world\nin the last generation.\n\n00:16:15.199 --> 00:16:18.934\nI believe a significant -- not the only,\nbut a significant -- contributor\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:22.231\nto this explosion of depression,\nand also suicide,\n\n00:16:22.255 --> 00:16:24.934\nis that people have experiences\nthat are disappointing\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.816\nbecause their standards are so high,\n\n00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.032\nand then when they have to explain\nthese experiences to themselves,\n\n00:16:30.056 --> 00:16:31.398\nthey think they're at fault.\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:35.934\nAnd so the net result is that we do\nbetter in general, objectively,\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.968\nand we feel worse.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:41.512\nSo let me remind you.\n\n00:16:41.536 --> 00:16:45.934\nThis is the official dogma,\nthe one that we all take to be true,\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.072\nand it's all false.\n\n00:16:48.599 --> 00:16:49.666\nIt is not true.\n\n00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:54.449\nThere's no question that some choice\nis better than none,\n\n00:16:54.473 --> 00:16:56.572\nbut it doesn't follow from that\n\n00:16:56.596 --> 00:16:58.934\nthat more choice\nis better than some choice.\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:01.835\nThere's some magical amount.\nI don't know what it is.\n\n00:17:01.859 --> 00:17:04.752\nI'm pretty confident that we have\nlong since passed the point\n\n00:17:04.776 --> 00:17:06.862\nwhere options improve our welfare.\n\n00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:10.266\nNow, as a policy matter --\nI'm almost done --\n\n00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:13.775\nas a policy matter,\nthe thing to think about is this:\n\n00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:16.421\nwhat enables all of this choice\n\n00:17:16.445 --> 00:17:20.516\nin industrial societies\nis material affluence.\n\n00:17:21.341 --> 00:17:23.245\nThere are lots of places in the world,\n\n00:17:23.269 --> 00:17:25.234\nand we have heard about several of them,\n\n00:17:25.258 --> 00:17:28.020\nwhere their problem\nis not that they have too much choice.\n\n00:17:28.044 --> 00:17:30.142\nTheir problem\nis that they have too little.\n\n00:17:30.166 --> 00:17:32.934\nSo the stuff I'm talking about\nis the peculiar problem\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:36.606\nof modern, affluent, Western societies.\n\n00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:39.855\nAnd what is so frustrating\nand infuriating is this:\n\n00:17:39.879 --> 00:17:42.149\nSteve Levitt talked to you yesterday\n\n00:17:42.173 --> 00:17:48.428\nabout how these expensive\nand difficult-to-install child seats\n\n00:17:48.452 --> 00:17:50.062\ndon't help.\n\n00:17:50.952 --> 00:17:52.619\nIt's a waste of money.\n\n00:17:52.643 --> 00:17:53.928\nWhat I'm telling you\n\n00:17:53.952 --> 00:17:57.153\nis that these expensive,\ncomplicated choices --\n\n00:17:57.177 --> 00:17:59.341\nit's not simply that they don't help.\n\n00:17:59.365 --> 00:18:00.934\nThey actually hurt.\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:03.341\nThey actually make us worse off.\n\n00:18:03.886 --> 00:18:07.637\nIf some of what enables\npeople in our societies\n\n00:18:07.661 --> 00:18:09.660\nto make all of the choices we make\n\n00:18:09.684 --> 00:18:14.272\nwere shifted to societies\nin which people have too few options,\n\n00:18:14.296 --> 00:18:16.576\nnot only would those\npeople's lives be improved,\n\n00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.934\nbut ours would be improved also,\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.935\nwhich is what economists call\na \"Pareto-improving move.\"\n\n00:18:21.959 --> 00:18:25.671\nIncome redistribution will make\neveryone better off --\n\n00:18:25.695 --> 00:18:27.107\nnot just poor people --\n\n00:18:27.131 --> 00:18:30.038\nbecause of how all this excess\nchoice plagues us.\n\n00:18:30.672 --> 00:18:31.720\nSo to conclude.\n\n00:18:31.744 --> 00:18:34.054\n[You can be anything\nyou want to be -- no limits]\n\n00:18:34.078 -->

It's really an honor and a privilege to be here spending my last day as a teenager. Today I want to talk to you about the future, but first I'm going to tell you a bit about the past. My story starts way before I was born. My grandmother was on a train to Auschwitz, the death camp. And she was going along the tracks, and the tracks split. And somehow \u2014 we don't really know exactly the whole story \u2014 but the train took the wrong track and went to a work camp rather than the death camp. My grandmother survived and married my grandfather. They were living in Hungary, and my mother was born. And when my mother was two years old, the Hungarian revolution was raging, and they decided to escape Hungary. They got on a boat, and yet another divergence \u2014 the boat was either going to Canada or to Australia. They got on and didn't know where they were going, and ended up in Canada. So, to make a long story short, they came to Canada. My grandmother was a chemist. She worked at the Banting Institute in Toronto, and at 44 she died of stomach cancer. I never met my grandmother, but I carry on her name \u2014 her exact name, Eva Vertes \u2014 and I like to think I carry on her scientific passion, too.I found this passion not far from here, actually, when I was nine years old. My family was on a road trip and we were in the Grand Canyon. And I had never been a reader when I was young \u2014 my dad had tried me with the Hardy Boys; I tried Nancy Drew; I tried all that \u2014 and I just didn't like reading books. And my mother bought this book when we were at the Grand Canyon called \"The Hot Zone.\" It was all about the outbreak of the Ebola virus. And something about it just kind of drew me towards it. There was this big sort of bumpy-looking virus on the cover, and I just wanted to read it. I picked up that book, and as we drove from the edge of the Grand Canyon to Big Sur, and to, actually, here where we are today, in Monterey, I read that book, and from when I was reading that book, I knew that I wanted to have a life in medicine. I wanted to be like the explorers I'd read about in the book, who went into the jungles of Africa, went into the research labs and just tried to figure out what this deadly virus was. So from that moment on, I read every medical book I could get my hands on, and I just loved it so much. I was a passive observer of the medical world.It wasn't until I entered high school that I thought, \"Maybe now, you know \u2014 being a big high school kid \u2014 I can maybe become an active part of this big medical world.\" I was 14, and I emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe I could go work in their lab. And hardly anyone responded. But I mean, why would they respond to a 14-year-old, anyway? And I got to go talk to one professor, Dr. Jacobs, who accepted me into the lab. At that time, I was really interested in neuroscience and wanted to do a research project in neurology \u2014 specifically looking at the effects of heavy metals on the developing nervous system. So I started that, and worked in his lab for a year, and found the results that I guess you'd expect to find when you feed fruit flies heavy metals \u2014 that it really, really impaired the nervous system. The spinal cord had breaks. The neurons were crossing in every which way. And from then I wanted to look not at impairment, but at prevention of impairment.So that's what led me to Alzheimer's. I started reading about Alzheimer's and tried to familiarize myself with the research, and at the same time when I was in the \u2014 I was reading in the medical library one day, and I read this article about something called \"purine derivatives.\" And they seemed to have cell growth-promoting properties. And being naive about the whole field, I kind of thought, \"Oh, you have cell death in Alzheimer's which is causing the memory deficit, and then you have this compound \u2014 purine derivatives \u2014 that are promoting cell growth.\" And so I thought, \"Maybe if it can promote cell growth, it can inhibit cell death, too.\" And so that's the project that I pursued for that year, and it's continuing now as well, and found that a specific purine derivative called \"guanidine\" had inhibited the cell growth by approximately 60 percent. So I presented those results at the International Science Fair, which was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life. And there I was awarded \"Best in the World in Medicine,\" which allowed me to get in, or at least get a foot in the door of the big medical world.And from then on, since I was now in this huge exciting world, I wanted to explore it all. I wanted it all at once, but knew I couldn't really get that. And I stumbled across something called \"cancer stem cells.\" And this is really what I want to talk to you about today \u2014 about cancer. At first when I heard of cancer stem cells, I didn't really know how to put the two together. I'd heard of stem cells, and I'd heard of them as the panacea of the future \u2014 the therapy of many diseases to come in the future, perhaps. But I'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time, so how did the good and bad go together? Last summer I worked at Stanford University, doing some research on cancer stem cells. And while I was doing this, I was reading the cancer literature, trying to \u2014 again \u2014 familiarize myself with this new medical field. And it seemed that tumors actually begin from a stem cell. This fascinated me. The more I read, the more I looked at cancer differently and almost became less fearful of it.It seems that cancer is a direct result to injury. If you smoke, you damage your lung tissue, and then lung cancer arises. If you drink, you damage your liver, and then liver cancer occurs. And it was really interesting \u2014 there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture, and then bone cancer arises. Because what stem cells are \u2014 they're these phenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue. So, if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ and then it's initiating cancer, it's almost as if this is a repair response. And the cancer, the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged, we need to repair the lung. And cancer is originating in the lung trying to repair \u2014 because you have this excessive proliferation of these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue. But it's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response, but can't quite control it. It hasn't yet become fine-tuned enough to finish what has been initiated. So this really, really fascinated me.And I really think that we can't think about cancer \u2014 let alone any disease \u2014 in such black-and-white terms. If we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now, with chemotherapy and radiation, we're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins, or with radiation, trying to kill it. It's almost as if we're getting back to this starting point. We're removing the cancer cells, but we're revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix. Shouldn't we think about manipulation, rather than elimination? If somehow we can cause these cells to differentiate \u2014 to become bone tissue, lung tissue, liver tissue, whatever that cancer has been put there to do \u2014 it would be a repair process. We'd end up better than we were before cancer. So, this really changed my view of looking at cancer. And while I was reading all these articles about cancer, it seemed that the articles \u2014 a lot of them \u2014 focused on, you know, the genetics of breast cancer, and the genesis and the progression of breast cancer \u2014 tracking the cancer through the body, tracing where it is, where it goes.But it struck me that I'd never heard of cancer of the heart, or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter. And skeletal muscle constitutes 50 percent of our body, or over 50 percent of our body. And so at first I kind of thought, \"Well, maybe there's some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle doesn't get cancer \u2014 at least not that I know of.\" So, I looked further into it, found as many articles as I could, and it was amazing \u2014 because it turned out that it was very rare. Some articles even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue is resistant to cancer, and furthermore, not only to cancer, but of metastases going to skeletal muscle. And what metastases are is when the tumor \u2014 when a piece \u2014 breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ. That's what a metastasis is. It's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous. If cancer was localized, we could likely remove it, or somehow \u2014 you know, it's contained. It's very contained. But once it starts moving throughout the body, that's when it becomes deadly. So the fact that not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal muscles, but cancer didn't seem to go to skeletal muscle \u2014 there seemed to be something here. So these articles were saying, you know, \"Skeletal \u2014 metastasis to skeletal muscle \u2014 is very rare.\" But it was left at that. No one seemed to be asking why.So I decided to ask why. At first \u2014 the first thing I did was I emailed some professors who specialized in skeletal muscle physiology, and pretty much said, \"Hey, it seems like cancer doesn't really go to skeletal muscle. Is there a reason for this?\" And a lot of the replies I got were that muscle is terminally differentiated tissue. Meaning that you have muscle cells, but they're not dividing, so it doesn't seem like a good target for cancer to hijack. But then again, this fact that the metastases didn't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely. And furthermore, that nervous tissue \u2014 brain \u2014 gets cancer, and brain cells are also terminally differentiated. So I decided to ask why. And here's some of, I guess, my hypotheses that I'll be starting to investigate this May at the Sylvester Cancer Institute in Miami. And I guess I'll keep investigating until I get the answers. But I know that in science, once you get the answers, inevitably you're going to have more questions. So I guess you could say that I'll probably be doing this for the rest of my life.Some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle, there's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle. And the first thing that makes me think is that blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells. Tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels. And you think, the more highways there are in a tissue, the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases. So first of all I thought, you know, \"Wouldn't it be favorable to cancer getting to skeletal muscle?\" And as well, cancer tumors require a process called angiogenesis, which is really, the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself to supply itself with nutrients so it can grow. Without angiogenesis, the tumor remains the size of a pinpoint and it's not harmful. So angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer.And one article that really stood out to me when I was just reading about this, trying to figure out why cancer doesn't go to skeletal muscle, was that it had reported 16 percent of micro-metastases to skeletal muscle upon autopsy. 16 percent! Meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle, but only .16 percent of actual metastases \u2014 suggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis, is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels. We use skeletal muscles so much. It's the one portion of our body \u2014 our heart's always beating. We're always moving our muscles. Is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply? It needs to be constantly contracting, so therefore it's almost selfish. It's grabbing its blood vessels for itself. Therefore, when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue, it can't get a blood supply, and can't grow.So this suggests that maybe if there is an anti-angiogenic factor in skeletal muscle \u2014 or perhaps even more, an angiogenic routing factor, so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow \u2014 this could be a potential future therapy for cancer. And another thing that's really interesting is that there's this whole \u2014 the way tumors move throughout the body, it's a very complex system \u2014 and there's something called the chemokine network. And chemokines are essentially chemical attractants, and they're the stop and go signals for cancer. So a tumor expresses chemokine receptors, and another organ \u2014 a distant organ somewhere in the body \u2014 will have the corresponding chemokines, and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it. Is it possible that skeletal muscle doesn't express this type of molecules? And the other really interesting thing is that when skeletal muscle \u2014 there's been several reports that when skeletal muscle is injured, that's what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle.And, furthermore, when skeletal muscle is injured, that's what causes chemokines \u2014 these signals saying, \"Cancer, you can come to me,\" the \"go signs\" for the tumors \u2014 it causes them to highly express these chemokines. So, there's so much interplay here. I mean, there are so many possibilities for why tumors don't go to skeletal muscle. But it seems like by investigating, by attacking cancer, by searching where cancer is not, there has got to be something \u2014 there's got to be something \u2014 that's making this tissue resistant to tumors. And can we utilize \u2014 can we take this property, this compound, this receptor, whatever it is that's controlling these anti-tumor properties and apply it to cancer therapy in general? Now, one thing that kind of ties the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer \u2014 to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body \u2014 is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called \"MyoD.\" And what MyoD essentially does is, it causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells. So this compound, MyoD, has been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells. So, is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue, but once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue, MyoD acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become skeletal muscle cells? Maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells, and this is why it seems as if it is so rare.It's not harmful; it has just repaired the muscle. Muscle is constantly being used \u2014 constantly being damaged. If every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way, cancer occurred \u2014 I mean, everybody would have cancer almost. And I hate to say that. But it seems as though muscle cell, possibly because of all its use, has adapted faster than other body tissues to respond to injury, to fine-tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process which the body wants to finish. I really believe that the human body is very, very smart, and we can't counteract something the body is saying to do.It's different when a bacteria comes into the body \u2014 that's a foreign object \u2014 we want that out. But when the body is actually initiating a process and we're calling it a disease, it doesn't seem as though elimination is the right solution. So even to go from there, it's possible, although far-fetched, that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy. If those diseases where tissues are deteriorating \u2014 for example Alzheimer's, where the brain, the brain cells, die and we need to restore new brain cells, new functional brain cells \u2014 what if we could, in the future, use cancer? A tumor \u2014 put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate into brain cells?That's a very far-fetched idea, but I really believe that it may be possible. These cells are so versatile, these cancer cells are so versatile \u2014 we just have to manipulate them in the right way. And again, some of these may be far-fetched, but I figured if there's anywhere to present far-fetched ideas, it's here at TED, so thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 12, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nThank you.

I never met my grandmother,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nbut I carry on her name -- her exact name, Eva Vertes --\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nand I like to think I carry on her scientific passion, too.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nI found this passion not far from here, actually, when I was nine years old.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nMy family was on a road trip and we were in the Grand Canyon.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nAnd I had never been a reader when I was young --\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nmy dad had tried me with the Hardy Boys; I tried Nancy Drew;\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nI tried all that -- and I just didn't like reading books.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nAnd my mother bought this book when we were at the Grand Canyon\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\ncalled \"The Hot Zone.\" It was all about the outbreak of the Ebola virus.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nAnd something about it just kind of drew me towards it.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nThere was this big sort of bumpy-looking virus on the cover,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nand I just wanted to read it. I picked up that book,\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nand as we drove from the edge of the Grand Canyon\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nto Big Sur, and to, actually, here where we are today, in Monterey,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nI read that book, and from when I was reading that book,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nI knew that I wanted to have a life in medicine.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nI wanted to be like the explorers I'd read about in the book,\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nwho went into the jungles of Africa,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nwent into the research labs and just tried to figure out\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nwhat this deadly virus was. So from that moment on, I read every medical book\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nI could get my hands on, and I just loved it so much.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nI was a passive observer of the medical world.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nIt wasn't until I entered high school that I thought,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\n\"Maybe now, you know -- being a big high school kid --\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nI can maybe become an active part of this big medical world.\"\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nI was 14, and I emailed professors at the local university\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nto see if maybe I could go work in their lab. And hardly anyone responded.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nBut I mean, why would they respond to a 14-year-old, anyway?\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nAnd I got to go talk to one professor, Dr. Jacobs,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nwho accepted me into the lab.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nAt that time, I was really interested in neuroscience\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nand wanted to do a research project in neurology --\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nspecifically looking at the effects of heavy metals on the developing nervous system.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nSo I started that, and worked in his lab for a year,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nand found the results that I guess you'd expect to find\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nwhen you feed fruit flies heavy metals -- that it really, really impaired the nervous system.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nThe spinal cord had breaks. The neurons were crossing in every which way.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nAnd from then I wanted to look not at impairment, but at prevention of impairment.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nSo that's what led me to Alzheimer's. I started reading about Alzheimer's\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nand tried to familiarize myself with the research,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nand at the same time when I was in the --\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nI was reading in the medical library one day, and I read this article\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nabout something called \"purine derivatives.\"\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nAnd they seemed to have cell growth-promoting properties.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nAnd being naive about the whole field, I kind of thought,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\n\"Oh, you have cell death in Alzheimer's\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nwhich is causing the memory deficit, and then you have this compound --\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\npurine derivatives -- that are promoting cell growth.\"\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nAnd so I thought, \"Maybe if it can promote cell growth,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nit can inhibit cell death, too.\"\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nAnd so that's the project that I pursued for that year,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nand it's continuing now as well,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nand found that a specific purine derivative called \"guanidine\"\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nhad inhibited the cell growth by approximately 60 percent.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nSo I presented those results at the International Science Fair,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nwhich was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAnd there I was awarded \"Best in the World in Medicine,\"\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nwhich allowed me to get in, or at least get a foot in the door of the big medical world.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nAnd from then on, since I was now in this huge exciting world,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nI wanted to explore it all. I wanted it all at once, but knew I couldn't really get that.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nAnd I stumbled across something called \"cancer stem cells.\"\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nAnd this is really what I want to talk to you about today -- about cancer.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nAt first when I heard of cancer stem cells,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nI didn't really know how to put the two together. I'd heard of stem cells,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nand I'd heard of them as the panacea of the future --\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nthe therapy of many diseases to come in the future, perhaps.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nBut I'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nso how did the good and bad go together?\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nLast summer I worked at Stanford University, doing some research on cancer stem cells.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nAnd while I was doing this, I was reading the cancer literature,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:06:01.958\ntrying to -- again -- familiarize myself with this new medical field.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nAnd it seemed that tumors actually begin from a stem cell.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nThis fascinated me. The more I read, the more I looked at cancer differently\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nand almost became less fearful of it.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nIt seems that cancer is a direct result to injury.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nIf you smoke, you damage your lung tissue, and then lung cancer arises.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nIf you drink, you damage your liver, and then liver cancer occurs.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nAnd it was really interesting -- there were articles correlating\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nif you have a bone fracture, and then bone cancer arises.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nBecause what stem cells are -- they're these\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nphenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\ninto any type of tissue.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nSo, if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nand then it's initiating cancer, it's almost as if this is a repair response.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nAnd the cancer, the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nwe need to repair the lung. And cancer is originating in the lung\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:13.958\ntrying to repair -- because you have this excessive proliferation\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nof these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nBut it's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nbut can't quite control it.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nIt hasn't yet become fine-tuned enough to finish what has been initiated.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nSo this really, really fascinated me.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nAnd I really think that we can't think about cancer --\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nlet alone any disease -- in such black-and-white terms.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nIf we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now, with chemotherapy and radiation,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nwe're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins, or with radiation, trying to kill it.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nIt's almost as if we're getting back to this starting point.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nWe're removing the cancer cells, but we're revealing the previous damage\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nthat the body has tried to fix.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nShouldn't we think about manipulation, rather than elimination?\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nIf somehow we can cause these cells to differentiate --\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nto become bone tissue, lung tissue, liver tissue,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nwhatever that cancer has been put there to do --\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nit would be a repair process. We'd end up better than we were before cancer.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nSo, this really changed my view of looking at cancer.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nAnd while I was reading all these articles about cancer,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nit seemed that the articles -- a lot of them -- focused on, you know,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nthe genetics of breast cancer, and the genesis\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand the progression of breast cancer --\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:46.958\ntracking the cancer through the body, tracing where it is, where it goes.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nBut it struck me that I'd never heard of cancer of the heart,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nor cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nAnd skeletal muscle constitutes 50 percent of our body,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nor over 50 percent of our body. And so at first I kind of thought,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\n\"Well, maybe there's some obvious explanation\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nwhy skeletal muscle doesn't get cancer -- at least not that I know of.\"\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nSo, I looked further into it, found as many articles as I could,\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nand it was amazing -- because it turned out that it was very rare.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nSome articles even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nis resistant to cancer, and furthermore, not only to cancer,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nbut of metastases going to skeletal muscle.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nAnd what metastases are is when the tumor --\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nwhen a piece -- breaks off and travels through the blood stream\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nand goes to a different organ. That's what a metastasis is.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nIt's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nIf cancer was localized, we could likely remove it,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nor somehow -- you know, it's contained. It's very contained.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nBut once it starts moving throughout the body, that's when it becomes deadly.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nSo the fact that not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal muscles,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nbut cancer didn't seem to go to skeletal muscle --\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nthere seemed to be something here.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nSo these articles were saying, you know, \"Skeletal --\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nmetastasis to skeletal muscle -- is very rare.\"\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nBut it was left at that. No one seemed to be asking why.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nSo I decided to ask why. At first -- the first thing I did\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nwas I emailed some professors who\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nspecialized in skeletal muscle physiology, and pretty much said,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:31.958\n\"Hey, it seems like cancer doesn't really go to skeletal muscle.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nIs there a reason for this?\" And a lot of the replies I got were that\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nmuscle is terminally differentiated tissue.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nMeaning that you have muscle cells, but they're not dividing,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nso it doesn't seem like a good target for cancer to hijack.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nBut then again, this fact that the metastases\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.958\ndidn't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nAnd furthermore, that nervous tissue -- brain -- gets cancer,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nand brain cells are also terminally differentiated.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nSo I decided to ask why. And here's some of, I guess, my hypotheses\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nthat I'll be starting to investigate this May at the Sylvester Cancer Institute in Miami.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nAnd I guess I'll keep investigating until I get the answers.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nBut I know that in science, once you get the answers,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\ninevitably you're going to have more questions.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nSo I guess you could say that I'll probably be doing this for the rest of my life.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nSome of my hypotheses are that\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nwhen you first think about skeletal muscle,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nthere's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nAnd the first thing that makes me think is that\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nblood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nTumor cells can travel through the blood vessels.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nAnd you think, the more highways there are in a tissue,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nthe more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nSo first of all I thought, you know, \"Wouldn't it be favorable\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nto cancer getting to skeletal muscle?\" And as well,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:08.958\ncancer tumors require a process called angiogenesis,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nwhich is really, the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nto supply itself with nutrients so it can grow.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nWithout angiogenesis, the tumor remains the size of a pinpoint and it's not harmful.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nSo angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nAnd one article that really stood out to me\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nwhen I was just reading about this, trying to figure out why cancer doesn't go to skeletal\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nmuscle, was that it had reported 16 percent of micro-metastases\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nto skeletal muscle upon autopsy.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:49.958\n16 percent! Meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle,\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nbut only .16 percent of actual metastases --\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nsuggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nis able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nWe use skeletal muscles so much. It's the one portion of our body --\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nour heart's always beating. We're always moving our muscles.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nIs it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nthat it needs this blood supply? It needs to be constantly contracting,\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nso therefore it's almost selfish. It's grabbing its blood vessels for itself.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nTherefore, when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nit can't get a blood supply, and can't grow.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nSo this suggests that maybe if there is an anti-angiogenic factor\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nin skeletal muscle -- or perhaps even more,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nan angiogenic routing factor, so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow --\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nthis could be a potential future therapy for cancer.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nAnd another thing that's really interesting is that\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nthere's this whole -- the way tumors move throughout the body,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nit's a very complex system -- and there's something called the chemokine network.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nAnd chemokines are essentially chemical attractants,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nand they're the stop and go signals for cancer.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nSo a tumor expresses chemokine receptors,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nand another organ -- a distant organ somewhere in the body --\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nwill have the corresponding chemokines,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nand the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nIs it possible that skeletal muscle doesn't express this type of molecules?\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nAnd the other really interesting thing is that\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nwhen skeletal muscle -- there's been several reports that when skeletal\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nmuscle is injured, that's what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nAnd, furthermore, when skeletal muscle is injured,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nthat's what causes chemokines -- these signals saying,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:51.958\n\"Cancer, you can come to me,\" the \"go signs\" for the tumors --\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nit causes them to highly express these chemokines.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nSo, there's so much interplay here.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nI mean, there are so many possibilities\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nfor why tumors don't go to skeletal muscle.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nBut it seems like by investigating, by attacking cancer,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nby searching where cancer is not, there has got to be something --\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nthere's got to be something -- that's making this tissue resistant to tumors.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nAnd can we utilize -- can we take this property,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nthis compound, this receptor, whatever it is that's controlling these\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nanti-tumor properties and apply it to cancer therapy in general?\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nNow, one thing that kind of ties the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer --\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nto the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body --\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nis that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called \"MyoD.\"\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nAnd what MyoD essentially does is, it causes cells to differentiate\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:06.958\ninto muscle cells. So this compound, MyoD,\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nhas been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nactually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells.\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nSo, is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue,\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nbut once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue,\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nMyoD acts upon these tumor cells and causes them\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nto become skeletal muscle cells?\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nMaybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells,\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nand this is why it seems as if it is so rare.\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nIt's not harmful; it has just repaired the muscle.\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nMuscle is constantly being used -- constantly being damaged.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nIf every time we tore a muscle\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nor every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way,\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:59.958\ncancer occurred -- I mean, everybody would have cancer almost.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nAnd I hate to say that. But it seems as though muscle cell,\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:06.958\npossibly because of all its use, has adapted\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nfaster than other body tissues to respond to injury,\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nto fine-tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nwhich the body wants to finish. I really believe that the human body is very,\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nvery smart, and we can't counteract something the body is saying to do.\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nIt's different when a bacteria comes into the body --\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nthat's a foreign object -- we want that out.\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nBut when the body is actually initiating a process\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nand we're calling it a disease, it doesn't seem as though elimination is\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nthe right solution. So even to go from there, it's possible, although far-fetched,\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nthat in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy.\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nIf those diseases where tissues are deteriorating --\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nfor example Alzheimer's, where the brain, the brain cells, die\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nand we need to restore new brain cells, new functional brain cells --\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nwhat if we could, in the future, use cancer? A tumor --\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:15.958\nput it in the brain and cause it to differentiate into brain cells?\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nThat's a very far-fetched idea, but I really believe that it may be possible.\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:25.958\nThese cells are so versatile, these cancer cells are so versatile --\n\n00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nwe just have to manipulate them in the right way.\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nAnd again, some of these may be far-fetched, but\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nI figured if there's anywhere to present far-fetched ideas, it's here at TED, so\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nthank you very much.\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:42.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A roadmap to end aging", "duration": "1365", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/aubrey_de_grey_says_we_can_avoid_aging", "transcript": "18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit, so I'm going to dive straight in, right at the point where I get this thing to work. Here we go. I'm going to talk about five different things. I'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable. I'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together, and actually talk about this a bit more than we do. I'm going to talk about feasibility as well, of course. I'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging. And then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about, you know, how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong, namely, by actually doing something about it.I'm going to do that in two steps. The first one I'm going to talk about is how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension \u2014 which I'm going to define as 30 years, applied to people who are already in middle-age when you start \u2014 to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging. Namely, essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year \u2014 or indeed, to get sick in the first place. And of course, the last thing I'm going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step, that point of maybe 30 years life extension.So I'm going to start with why we should. Now, I want to ask a question. Hands up: anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria? That was easy. OK. OK. Hands up: anyone in the audience who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing? OK. So we all think malaria is a bad thing. That's very good news, because I thought that was what the answer would be. Now the thing is, I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging. And here is that characteristic. The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does.Now, I like in an audience, in Britain especially, to talk about the comparison with foxhunting, which is something that was banned after a long struggle, by the government not very many months ago. I mean, I know I'm with a sympathetic audience here, but, as we know, a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic. And this is actually a rather good comparison, it seems to me. You know, a lot of people said, \"Well, you know, city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time. It's a traditional part of the way of life, and we should be allowed to carry on doing it. It's ecologically sound; it stops the population explosion of foxes.\" But ultimately, the government prevailed in the end, because the majority of the British public, and certainly the majority of members of Parliament, came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society.And I think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades. What part of this do people not understand? It's not just about life, of course \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 it's about healthy life, you know \u2014 getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun, whether or not dying may be fun. So really, this is how I would like to describe it. It's a global trance. These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging. And, I mean, OK, I'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless. There are some good points to be made here, things that we ought to be thinking about, forward planning so that nothing goes too \u2014 well, so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging.But these are completely crazy, when you actually remember your sense of proportion. You know, these are arguments; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about. But the question is, are they so dangerous \u2014 these risks of doing something about aging \u2014 that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite, namely, leaving aging as it is? Are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death? You know, if you haven't got an argument that's that strong, then just don't waste my time, is what I say. (Laughter)Now, there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong, and here it is. People worry about overpopulation; they say, \"Well, if we fix aging, no one's going to die to speak of, or at least the death toll is going to be much lower, only from crossing St. Giles carelessly. And therefore, we're not going to be able to have many kids, and kids are really important to most people.\" And that's true. And you know, a lot of people try to fudge this question, and give answers like this. I don't agree with those answers. I think they basically don't work. I think it's true, that we will face a dilemma in this respect. We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate, or a high death rate. A high death rate will, of course, arise from simply rejecting these therapies, in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids.And, I say that that's fine \u2014 the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice. What's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future. If we vacillate, hesitate, and do not actually develop these therapies, then we are condemning a whole cohort of people \u2014 who would have been young enough and healthy enough to benefit from those therapies, but will not be, because we haven't developed them as quickly as we could \u2014 we'll be denying those people an indefinite life span, and I consider that that is immoral. That's my answer to the overpopulation question.Right. So the next thing is, now why should we get a little bit more active on this? And the fundamental answer is that the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks. It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging. Aging is ghastly, but it's inevitable, so, you know, we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds, and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do, to do that. Like, for example, making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all. But of course, that only works when we have both of these components. And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear \u2014 and we might be in range of doing something about aging \u2014 this becomes part of the problem. This pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things. And that's why we have to really talk about this a lot \u2014 evangelize, I will go so far as to say, quite a lot \u2014 in order to get people's attention, and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard. So that's all I'm going to say about that.I'm now going to talk about feasibility. And the fundamental reason, I think, why we feel that aging is inevitable is summed up in a definition of aging that I'm giving here. A very simple definition. Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place, which is to say, metabolism. This is not a completely tautological statement; it's a reasonable statement. Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars, and it also happens to us, despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms, because those self-repair mechanisms are not perfect.So basically, metabolism, which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next, has side effects. Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology. That's a fine definition. So we can put it this way: we can say that, you know, we have this chain of events. And there are really two games in town, according to most people, with regard to postponing aging. They're what I'm calling here the \"gerontology approach\" and the \"geriatrics approach.\" The geriatrician will intervene late in the day, when pathology is becoming evident, and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time, and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon. Of course, it's a very short-term-ist strategy; it's a losing battle, because the things that are causing the pathology are becoming more abundant as time goes on.The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface, because, you know, prevention is better than cure. But unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well. In fact, we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work \u2014 even cells we're not really too good on yet. We've discovered things like, for example, RNA interference only a few years ago, and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work. Basically, gerontology is a fine approach in the end, but it is not an approach whose time has come when we're talking about intervention. So then, what do we do about that? I mean, that's a fine logic, that sounds pretty convincing, pretty ironclad, doesn't it?But it isn't. Before I tell you why it isn't, I'm going to go a little bit into what I'm calling step two. Just suppose, as I said, that we do acquire \u2014 let's say we do it today for the sake of argument \u2014 the ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age, let's say 55. I'm going to call that \"robust human rejuvenation.\" OK. What would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today \u2014 or equivalently, of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive \u2014 would actually live? In order to answer that question \u2014 you might think it's simple, but it's not simple. We can't just say, \"Well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies, then they'll live 30 years longer.\" That's the wrong answer. And the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress.There are two sorts of technological progress really, for this purpose. There are fundamental, major breakthroughs, and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs. Now, they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames. Fundamental breakthroughs: very hard to predict how long it's going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough. It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun, and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it. But after that, things were pretty steady and pretty uniform. I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight. We can think, really, that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one, if you like. The incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore.This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough. And you see it in all sorts of technologies. Computers: you can look at a more or less parallel time line, happening of course a bit later. You can look at medical care. I mean, hygiene, vaccines, antibiotics \u2014 you know, the same sort of time frame. So I think that actually step two, that I called a step a moment ago, isn't a step at all. That in fact, the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension, even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive, will be at some sort of cusp. They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years. In other words, they will be staying ahead of the game. The therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us.This is a very important point for me to get across. Because, you know, most people, when they hear that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more, they think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more. I'm not saying that at all. I'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough. They'll never be perfect, but we'll be able to fix the things that 200-year-olds die of, before we have any 200-year-olds. And the same for 300 and 400 and so on. I decided to give this a little name, which is \"longevity escape velocity.\" (Laughter) Well, it seems to get the point across.So, these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live, in terms of remaining life expectancy, as measured by their health, for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive. If you're already 100, or even if you're 80 \u2014 and an average 80-year-old, we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies, because you're too close to death's door for the really initial, experimental therapies to be good enough for you. You won't be able to withstand them. But if you're only 50, then there's a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and, you know \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense, in terms of your youthfulness, both physical and mental, and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes. And of course, if you're a bit younger than that, then you're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes.So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to, that the first 150-year-old \u2014 we don't know how old that person is today, because we don't know how long it's going to take to get these first-generation therapies. But irrespective of that age, I'm claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 \u2014 subject of course, to, you know, global catastrophes \u2014 is actually, probably, only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old. And that's quite a thought.Alright, so finally I'm going to spend the rest of the talk, my last seven-and-a-half minutes, on step one; namely, how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to escape velocity? And in order to do that, I need to talk about mice a little bit. I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation. I'm calling it \"robust mouse rejuvenation,\" not very imaginatively. And this is what it is. I say we're going to take a long-lived strain of mouse, which basically means mice that live about three years on average. We do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old. And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them, and with those therapies, we get them to live, on average, to their fifth birthday. So, in other words, we add two years \u2014 we treble their remaining lifespan, starting from the point that we started the therapies.The question then is, what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans? Which we can now, as I've explained, equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity. Secondly, what does it mean for the public's perception of how long it's going to take for us to get to those things, starting from the time we get the mice? And thirdly, the question is, what will it do to actually how much people want it? And it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question, and it's extremely hard to answer. One has to be very speculative, and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation, that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more.I say that's nonsense. I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this. We need to give our best guess as to the time frame, in order to give people a sense of proportion so that they can assess their priorities. So, I say that we have a 50/50 chance of reaching this RHR milestone, robust human rejuvenation, within 15 years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation. 15 years from the robust mouse. The public's perception will probably be somewhat better than that. The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are. So they'll probably think it's five years away. They'll be wrong, but that actually won't matter too much. And finally, of course, I think it's fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance I spoke about earlier, the coping strategy. That will be history at this point, because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans, since it's been postponed so very effectively in mice. So we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes, and of course that has enormous implications.So in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice, I'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging. I'm going to use this word \"damage\" to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology. Because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology, the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life, starting before we're born. But it is not part of metabolism itself. And this turns out to be useful. Because we can re-draw our original diagram this way. We can say that, fundamentally, the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage. And I'm going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment. And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology. And the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate.So there's a third approach, if we look at it this way. We can call it the \"engineering approach,\" and I claim that the engineering approach is within range. The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes. It does not intervene in this process or this one. And that's good because it means that it's not a losing battle, and it's something that we are within range of being able to do, because it doesn't involve improving on evolution. The engineering approach simply says, \"Let's go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage \u2014 not necessarily repair them completely, but repair them quite a lot, so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist, that causes it to be pathogenic.\" We know that this threshold exists, because we don't get age-related diseases until we're in middle age, even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born.Why do I say that we're in range? Well, this is basically it. The point about this slide is actually the bottom. If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging, we will be here all night, because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another. This list is just for illustration; it is incomplete. The list on the right is also incomplete. It's a list of types of pathology that are age-related, and it's just an incomplete list. But I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete \u2014 this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage, side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end, or that might cause pathology. And there are only seven of them. They're categories of things, of course, but there's only seven of them. Cell loss, mutations in chromosomes, mutations in the mitochondria and so on.First of all, I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete. Of course one can make a biological argument. One can say, \"OK, what are we made of?\" We're made of cells and stuff between cells. What can damage accumulate in? The answer is: long-lived molecules, because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage, but then the molecule is destroyed \u2014 like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis \u2014 then the damage is gone, too. It's got to be long-lived molecules. So, these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news, because it means that, you know, we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years, so the fact that we haven't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done. However, it's better than that; we actually know how to fix them all, in mice, in principle \u2014 and what I mean by in principle is, we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade. Some of them are partially implemented already, the ones at the top.I haven't got time to go through them at all, but my conclusion is that, if we can actually get suitable funding for this, then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years, but we do need to get serious about it. We do need to really start trying. So of course, there are some biologists in the audience, and I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have. You may have been dissatisfied with this talk, but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff. I've published a great deal on this; I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based, and there's quite a lot of detail there. The detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive time frames that I'm predicting here. So if you think that I'm wrong, you'd better damn well go and find out why you think I'm wrong.And of course the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people who call themselves gerontologists because, as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field, you know, you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously. So, you know, you've got to actually do your homework, in order to understand whether this is true.And we'll just end with a few things. One thing is, you know, you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time, and everyone said, \"Well, it's obviously impossible.\" And you know what happened. So, you know, this does happen. We have various strategies \u2014 there's the Methuselah Mouse Prize, which is basically an incentive to innovate, and to do what you think is going to work, and you get money for it if you win. There's a proposal to actually put together an institute. This is what's going to take a bit of money. But, I mean, look \u2014 how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq? Not very long. OK. (Laughter) It's got to be philanthropic, because profits distract biotech, but it's basically got a 90 percent chance, I think, of succeeding in this. And I think we know how to do it. And I'll stop there. Thank you. (Applause)Chris Anderson: OK. I don't know if there's going to be any questions but I thought I would give people the chance. Audience: Since you've been talking about aging and trying to defeat it, why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man? (Laughter)AG: Because I am an old man. I am actually 158. (Laughter) (Applause)Audience: Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate. However, as far as I know, all the species have evolved to actually die, so when cells divide, the telomerase get shorter, and eventually species die. So, why does \u2014 evolution has \u2014 seems to have selected against immortality, when it is so advantageous, or is evolution just incomplete?AG: Brilliant. Thank you for asking a question that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer. I'm going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question, which I happen to agree with, which is that, no, aging is not a product of selection, evolution; [aging] is simply a product of evolutionary neglect. In other words, we have aging because it's hard work not to have aging; you need more genetic pathways, more sophistication in your genes in order to age more slowly, and that carries on being true the longer you push it out. So, to the extent that evolution doesn't matter, doesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals, living a long time or by procreation, there's a certain amount of modulation of that, which is why different species have different lifespans, but that's why there are no immortal species.CA: The genes don't care but we do?AG: That's right.Audience: Hello. I read somewhere that in the last 20 years, the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years. If I project that, that would make me think that I would live until 120 if I don't crash on my motorbike. That means that I'm one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old?AG: If you lose a bit of weight. (Laughter) Your numbers are a bit out. The standard numbers are that lifespans have been growing at between one and two years per decade. So, it's not quite as good as you might think, you might hope. But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible.Audience: I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embryo, and that the brain cells last 80 years or so. If that is indeed true, biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation? If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years, as opposed to a typical, you know, couple of months?AG: There are technical implications certainly. Basically what we need to do is replace cells in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate, especially neurons, but we don't want to replace them any faster than that \u2014 or not much faster anyway, because replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function. What I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification. There are species that have no aging \u2014 Hydra for example \u2014 but they do it by not having a nervous system \u2014 and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very long-lived cells.", "id": 39, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\n18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit,\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nso I'm going to dive straight in, right at the point\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nwhere I get this thing to work.\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nHere we go. I'm going to talk about five different things.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nI'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nI'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together,\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nand actually talk about this a bit more than we do.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nI'm going to talk about feasibility as well, of course.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nI'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nabout doing anything about aging.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nAnd then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:39.958\ntalking about, you know, how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong,\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nnamely, by actually doing something about it.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nI'm going to do that in two steps.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nThe first one I'm going to talk about is\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nhow to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension --\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nwhich I'm going to define as 30 years, applied to people\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nwho are already in middle-age when you start --\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nto a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nNamely, essentially an elimination of the relationship between\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nhow old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year --\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nor indeed, to get sick in the first place.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nAnd of course, the last thing I'm going to talk about\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nis how to reach that intermediate step,\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nthat point of maybe 30 years life extension.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nSo I'm going to start with why we should.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nNow, I want to ask a question.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nHands up: anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria?\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nThat was easy. OK.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nOK. Hands up: anyone in the audience\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nwho's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing?\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nOK. So we all think malaria is a bad thing.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nThat's very good news, because I thought that was what the answer would be.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nNow the thing is, I would like to put it to you\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nthat the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nis because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nAnd here is that characteristic.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nThe only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nNow, I like in an audience, in Britain especially,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nto talk about the comparison with foxhunting,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nwhich is something that was banned after a long struggle,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nby the government not very many months ago.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nI mean, I know I'm with a sympathetic audience here,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nbut, as we know, a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nAnd this is actually a rather good comparison, it seems to me.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nYou know, a lot of people said, \"Well, you know,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:11.958\ncity boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nIt's a traditional part of the way of life,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nand we should be allowed to carry on doing it.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nIt's ecologically sound; it stops the population explosion of foxes.\"\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nBut ultimately, the government prevailed in the end,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nbecause the majority of the British public,\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nand certainly the majority of members of Parliament,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\ncame to the conclusion that it was really something\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nthat should not be tolerated in a civilized society.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nAnd I think that human aging shares\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nall of these characteristics in spades.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nWhat part of this do people not understand?\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nIt's not just about life, of course --\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:36.958\n(Laughter) --\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nit's about healthy life, you know --\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\ngetting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nwhether or not dying may be fun.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nSo really, this is how I would like to describe it.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nIt's a global trance.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nThese are the sorts of unbelievable excuses\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nthat people give for aging.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nAnd, I mean, OK, I'm not actually saying\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nthat these excuses are completely valueless.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nThere are some good points to be made here,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nthings that we ought to be thinking about, forward planning\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nso that nothing goes too -- well, so that we minimize\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nthe turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nBut these are completely crazy, when you actually\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nremember your sense of proportion.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nYou know, these are arguments; these are things that\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nwould be legitimate to be concerned about.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nBut the question is, are they so dangerous --\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nthese risks of doing something about aging --\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nthat they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nnamely, leaving aging as it is?\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAre these so bad that they outweigh\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:36.958\ncondemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death?\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nYou know, if you haven't got an argument that's that strong,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nthen just don't waste my time, is what I say.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:42.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nNow, there is one argument\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nthat some people do think really is that strong, and here it is.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nPeople worry about overpopulation; they say,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\n\"Well, if we fix aging, no one's going to die to speak of,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nor at least the death toll is going to be much lower,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nonly from crossing St. Giles carelessly.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nAnd therefore, we're not going to be able to have many kids,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nand kids are really important to most people.\"\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nAnd that's true.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nAnd you know, a lot of people try to fudge this question,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nand give answers like this.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nI don't agree with those answers. I think they basically don't work.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nI think it's true, that we will face a dilemma in this respect.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nWe will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nor a high death rate.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nA high death rate will, of course, arise from simply rejecting these therapies,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nin favor of carrying on having a lot of kids.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nAnd, I say that that's fine --\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nthe future of humanity is entitled to make that choice.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nWhat's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nIf we vacillate, hesitate,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nand do not actually develop these therapies,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nthen we are condemning a whole cohort of people --\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nwho would have been young enough and healthy enough\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nto benefit from those therapies, but will not be,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nbecause we haven't developed them as quickly as we could --\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nwe'll be denying those people an indefinite life span,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nand I consider that that is immoral.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nThat's my answer to the overpopulation question.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nRight. So the next thing is,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nnow why should we get a little bit more active on this?\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nAnd the fundamental answer is that\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nthe pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nIt's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nAging is ghastly, but it's inevitable, so, you know,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nwe've got to find some way to put it out of our minds,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nand it's rational to do anything that we might want to do, to do that.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nLike, for example, making up these ridiculous reasons\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nwhy aging is actually a good thing after all.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nBut of course, that only works when we have both of these components.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nAnd as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear --\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nand we might be in range of doing something about aging --\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nthis becomes part of the problem.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nThis pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nAnd that's why we have to really talk about this a lot --\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nevangelize, I will go so far as to say, quite a lot --\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nin order to get people's attention, and make people realize\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nthat they are in a trance in this regard.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nSo that's all I'm going to say about that.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nI'm now going to talk about feasibility.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nAnd the fundamental reason, I think, why we feel that aging is inevitable\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nis summed up in a definition of aging that I'm giving here.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nA very simple definition.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nAging is a side effect of being alive in the first place,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nwhich is to say, metabolism.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nThis is not a completely tautological statement;\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nit's a reasonable statement.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nAging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nand it also happens to us,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\ndespite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nbecause those self-repair mechanisms are not perfect.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nSo basically, metabolism, which is defined as\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nbasically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nhas side effects.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nThose side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nThat's a fine definition. So we can put it this way:\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nwe can say that, you know, we have this chain of events.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nAnd there are really two games in town,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\naccording to most people, with regard to postponing aging.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nThey're what I'm calling here the \"gerontology approach\" and the \"geriatrics approach.\"\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nThe geriatrician will intervene late in the day,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nwhen pathology is becoming evident,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nand the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nand stop the accumulation of side effects\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nfrom causing the pathology quite so soon.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nOf course, it's a very short-term-ist strategy; it's a losing battle,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nbecause the things that are causing the pathology\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nare becoming more abundant as time goes on.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nThe gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nbecause, you know, prevention is better than cure.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nBut unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nIn fact, we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work --\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\neven cells we're not really too good on yet.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nWe've discovered things like, for example,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nRNA interference only a few years ago,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nand this is a really fundamental component of how cells work.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nBasically, gerontology is a fine approach in the end,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nbut it is not an approach whose time has come\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nwhen we're talking about intervention.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nSo then, what do we do about that?\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nI mean, that's a fine logic, that sounds pretty convincing,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\npretty ironclad, doesn't it?\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nBut it isn't.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nBefore I tell you why it isn't, I'm going to go a little bit\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\ninto what I'm calling step two.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nJust suppose, as I said, that we do acquire --\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nlet's say we do it today for the sake of argument --\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nthe ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\non people who are already in middle age, let's say 55.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nI'm going to call that \"robust human rejuvenation.\" OK.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nWhat would that actually mean\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nfor how long people of various ages today --\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nor equivalently, of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive --\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nwould actually live?\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nIn order to answer that question -- you might think it's simple,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nbut it's not simple.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nWe can't just say, \"Well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nthen they'll live 30 years longer.\"\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nThat's the wrong answer.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nAnd the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nThere are two sorts of technological progress really,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nfor this purpose.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nThere are fundamental, major breakthroughs,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nand there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nNow, they differ a great deal\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nin terms of the predictability of time frames.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nFundamental breakthroughs:\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nvery hard to predict how long it's going to take\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nto make a fundamental breakthrough.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nIt was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nand it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nBut after that, things were pretty steady and pretty uniform.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nI think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nin the progression of the technology of powered flight.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nWe can think, really, that each one is sort of\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nbeyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one, if you like.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nThe incremental advances have added up to something\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nwhich is not incremental anymore.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nThis is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nAnd you see it in all sorts of technologies.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nComputers: you can look at a more or less parallel time line,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nhappening of course a bit later.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nYou can look at medical care. I mean, hygiene, vaccines, antibiotics --\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nyou know, the same sort of time frame.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nSo I think that actually step two, that I called a step a moment ago,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nisn't a step at all.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nThat in fact, the people who are young enough\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nto benefit from these first therapies\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nthat give this moderate amount of life extension,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:42.958\neven though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nwill be at some sort of cusp.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nThey will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nthat will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nIn other words, they will be staying ahead of the game.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nThe therapies will be improving faster than\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nthe remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nThis is a very important point for me to get across.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nBecause, you know, most people, when they hear\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nthat I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nthey think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nthat are so thoroughly eliminating aging\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nthat those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nI'm not saying that at all.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nI'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nwill be enough.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nThey'll never be perfect, but we'll be able to fix the things\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nthat 200-year-olds die of, before we have any 200-year-olds.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nAnd the same for 300 and 400 and so on.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nI decided to give this a little name,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nwhich is \"longevity escape velocity.\"\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nWell, it seems to get the point across.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nSo, these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nin terms of remaining life expectancy,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nas measured by their health,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nfor given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nIf you're already 100, or even if you're 80 --\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nand an average 80-year-old,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nwe probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nbecause you're too close to death's door\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nfor the really initial, experimental therapies to be good enough for you.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nYou won't be able to withstand them.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nBut if you're only 50, then there's a chance\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nthat you might be able to pull out of the dive and, you know --\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:13.958\n(Laughter) --\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\neventually get through this\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nand start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nin terms of your youthfulness, both physical and mental,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nand in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAnd of course, if you're a bit younger than that,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nthen you're never really even going\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nto get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nSo this is a genuine conclusion that I come to, that the first 150-year-old --\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nwe don't know how old that person is today,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nbecause we don't know how long it's going to take\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nto get these first-generation therapies.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nBut irrespective of that age,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nI'm claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 --\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nsubject of course, to, you know, global catastrophes --\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nis actually, probably, only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nAnd that's quite a thought.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nAlright, so finally I'm going to spend the rest of the talk,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nmy last seven-and-a-half minutes, on step one;\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nnamely, how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nthat will allow us to get to escape velocity?\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nAnd in order to do that, I need to talk about mice a little bit.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nI have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nI'm calling it \"robust mouse rejuvenation,\" not very imaginatively.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAnd this is what it is.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nI say we're going to take a long-lived strain of mouse,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nwhich basically means mice that live about three years on average.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nWe do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nAnd then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them,\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nand with those therapies, we get them to live,\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\non average, to their fifth birthday.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nSo, in other words, we add two years --\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nwe treble their remaining lifespan,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nstarting from the point that we started the therapies.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nThe question then is, what would that actually mean for the time frame\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nuntil we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans?\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nWhich we can now, as I've explained,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nequivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nSecondly, what does it mean for the public's perception\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nof how long it's going to take for us to get to those things,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nstarting from the time we get the mice?\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nAnd thirdly, the question is, what will it do\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nto actually how much people want it?\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nAnd it seems to me that the first question\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nis entirely a biology question,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nand it's extremely hard to answer.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nOne has to be very speculative,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nand many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nthat we should simply keep our counsel until we know more.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nI say that's nonsense.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nI say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nWe need to give our best guess as to the time frame,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nin order to give people a sense of proportion\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nso that they can assess their priorities.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nSo, I say that we have a 50/50 chance\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nof reaching this RHR milestone,\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nrobust human rejuvenation, within 15 years from the point\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nthat we get to robust mouse rejuvenation.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\n15 years from the robust mouse.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nThe public's perception will probably be somewhat better than that.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nThe public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nSo they'll probably think it's five years away.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nThey'll be wrong, but that actually won't matter too much.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nAnd finally, of course, I think it's fair to say\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nthat a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nis the global trance I spoke about earlier, the coping strategy.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nThat will be history at this point,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nbecause it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nsince it's been postponed so very effectively in mice.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nSo we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nand of course that has enormous implications.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nSo in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nI'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nI'm going to use this word \"damage\"\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nto denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nand that eventually cause pathology.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nBecause the critical thing about this\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nis that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nthe damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life, starting before we're born.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nBut it is not part of metabolism itself.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nAnd this turns out to be useful.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nBecause we can re-draw our original diagram this way.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nWe can say that, fundamentally, the difference between gerontology and geriatrics\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nis that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nat which metabolism lays down this damage.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nAnd I'm going to explain exactly what damage is\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nin concrete biological terms in a moment.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nAnd geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nby stopping the damage converting into pathology.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nAnd the reason it's a losing battle\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nis because the damage is continuing to accumulate.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nSo there's a third approach, if we look at it this way.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nWe can call it the \"engineering approach,\"\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nand I claim that the engineering approach is within range.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nThe engineering approach does not intervene in any processes.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nIt does not intervene in this process or this one.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nAnd that's good because it means that it's not a losing battle,\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nand it's something that we are within range of being able to do,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nbecause it doesn't involve improving on evolution.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nThe engineering approach simply says,\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:34.958\n\"Let's go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage --\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nnot necessarily repair them completely, but repair them quite a lot,\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nso that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nthat must exist, that causes it to be pathogenic.\"\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nWe know that this threshold exists,\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nbecause we don't get age-related diseases until we're in middle age,\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:52.958\neven though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nWhy do I say that we're in range? Well, this is basically it.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nThe point about this slide is actually the bottom.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nIf we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging,\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nwe will be here all night, because basically all of metabolism\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nis important for aging in one way or another.\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nThis list is just for illustration; it is incomplete.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nThe list on the right is also incomplete.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nIt's a list of types of pathology that are age-related,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nand it's just an incomplete list.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nBut I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete --\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nthis is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage,\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nside effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nor that might cause pathology.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nAnd there are only seven of them.\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nThey're categories of things, of course, but there's only seven of them.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nCell loss, mutations in chromosomes, mutations in the mitochondria and so on.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nFirst of all, I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete.\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nOf course one can make a biological argument.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nOne can say, \"OK, what are we made of?\"\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nWe're made of cells and stuff between cells.\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nWhat can damage accumulate in?\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nThe answer is: long-lived molecules,\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nbecause if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage, but then the molecule is destroyed --\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nlike by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis -- then the damage is gone, too.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nIt's got to be long-lived molecules.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nSo, these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nand that is pretty good news, because it means that,\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nyou know, we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years,\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nso the fact that we haven't extended this list\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nis a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done.\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nHowever, it's better than that; we actually know how to fix them all,\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nin mice, in principle -- and what I mean by in principle is,\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nwe probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade.\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nSome of them are partially implemented already, the ones at the top.\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nI haven't got time to go through them at all, but\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nmy conclusion is that, if we can actually get suitable funding for this,\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nthen we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years,\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nbut we do need to get serious about it.\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nWe do need to really start trying.\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nSo of course, there are some biologists in the audience,\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nand I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nYou may have been dissatisfied with this talk,\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nbut fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff.\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nI've published a great deal on this;\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nI cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based,\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nand there's quite a lot of detail there.\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nThe detail is what makes me confident\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nof my rather aggressive time frames that I'm predicting here.\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nSo if you think that I'm wrong,\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nyou'd better damn well go and find out why you think I'm wrong.\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nAnd of course the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nwho call themselves gerontologists because,\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:23.958\nas with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field,\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nyou know, you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nand not really to take it seriously.\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:31.958\nSo, you know, you've got to actually do your homework,\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nin order to understand whether this is true.\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nAnd we'll just end with a few things.\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nOne thing is, you know, you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nwho said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time,\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nand everyone said, \"Well, it's obviously impossible.\"\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:44.958\nAnd you know what happened.\n\n00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:48.958\nSo, you know, this does happen.\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nWe have various strategies -- there's the Methuselah Mouse Prize,\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nwhich is basically an incentive to innovate,\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nand to do what you think is going to work,\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nand you get money for it if you win.\n\n00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nThere's a proposal to actually put together an institute.\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:04.958\nThis is what's going to take a bit of money.\n\n00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nBut, I mean, look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq?\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nNot very long.

I mean, there is plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthroughs. We all live in the same planet, but there's still a great deal of poverty in the world. And I think \u2014 so I want to throw a perspective that I have, so that we can assess this project, or any other project, for that matter, to see whether it's contributing or \u2014 contributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it.Rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last 60 years. And by and large, this has failed. And you can see this book, written by someone who worked in the World Bank for 20 years, and he finds economic growth in this country to be elusive. By and large, it did not work. So the question is, why is that?In my mind, there is something to learn from the history of Europe. I mean, even here, yesterday I was walking across the street, and they showed three bishops were executed 500 years ago, right across the street from here. So my point is, there's a lot of struggle has gone in Europe, where citizens were empowered by technologies. And they demanded authorities from \u2014 to come down from their high horses. And in the end, there's better bargaining between the authorities and citizens, and democracies, capitalism \u2014 everything else flourished. And so you can see, the real process of \u2014 and this is backed up by this 500-page book \u2014 that the authorities came down and citizens got up.But if you look, if you have that perspective, then you can see what happened in the last 60 years. Aid actually did the opposite. It empowered authorities, and, as a result, marginalized citizens. The authorities did not have the reason to make economic growth happen so that they could tax people and make more money for to run their business. Because they were getting it from abroad. And in fact, if you see oil-rich countries, where citizens are not yet empowered, the same thing goes \u2014 Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, all sorts of countries. Because the aid and oil or mineral money acts the same way. It empowers authorities, without activating the citizens \u2014 their hands, legs, brains, what have you.And if you agree with that, then I think the best way to improve these countries is to recognize that economic development is of the people, by the people, for the people. And that is the real network effect. If citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive, so that their voices are heard, so then things would improve.And to contrast that, you can see the most important institution in the world, the World Bank, is an organization of the government, by the government, for the governments. Just see the contrast. And that is the perspective I have, and then I can start my story.Of course, how would you empower citizens? There could be all sorts of technologies. And one is cell phones. Recently \"The Economist\" recognized this, but I stumbled upon the idea 12 years ago, and that's what I've been working on. So 12 years ago, I was trying to be an investment banker in New York.We had \u2014 quite a few our colleagues were connected by a computer network. And we got more productive because we didn't have to exchange floppy disks; we could update each other more often. But one time it broke down. And it reminded me of a day in 1971. There was a war going on in my country. And my family moved out of an urban place, where we used to live, to a remote rural area where it was safer. And one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling. And I walked 10 miles or so, all morning, to get there, to the medicine man. And he wasn't there, so I walked all afternoon back. So I had another unproductive day.So while I was sitting in a tall building in New York, I put those two experiences together side by side, and basically concluded that connectivity is productivity \u2014 whether it's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village. So naturally, I \u2014 the implication of that is that the telephone is a weapon against poverty. And if that's the case, then the question is how many telephones did we have at that time?And it turns out, that there was one telephone in Bangladesh for every 500 people. And all those phones were in the few urban places. The vast rural areas, where 100 million people lived, there were no telephones. So just imagine how many man-months or man-years are wasted, just like I wasted a day. If you just multiply by 100 million people, let's say losing one day a month, whatever, and you see a vast amount of resource wasted. And after all, poor countries, like rich countries, one thing we've got equal, is their days are the same length: 24 hours. So if you lose that precious resource, where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries, that's a huge waste.So I started looking for any evidence that \u2014 does connectivity really increase productivity? And I couldn't find much, really, but I found this graph produced by the ITU, which is the International Telecommunication Union, based in Geneva. They show an interesting thing. That you see, the horizontal axis is where you place your country. So the United States or the UK would be here, outside. And so the impact of one new telephone, which is on the vertical axis, is very little.But if you come back to a poorer country, where the GNP per capita is, let's say, 500 dollars, or 300 dollars, then the impact is huge: 6,000 dollars. Or 5,000 dollars. The question was, how much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh? It turns out: 2,000 dollars. So if you spend 2,000 dollars, and let's say the telephone lasts 10 years, and if 5,000 dollars every year \u2014 so that's 50,000 dollars.So obviously this was a gadget to have. And of course, if the cost of installing a telephone is going down, because there's a digital revolution going on, then it would be even more dramatic.And I knew a little economics by then \u2014 it says Adam Smith taught us that specialization leads to productivity. But how would you specialize? Let's say I'm a fisherman and a farmer. And Chris is a fisherman farmer. Both are generalists. So the point is that we could only \u2014 the only way we could depend on each other, is if we can connect with each other. And if we are neighbors, I could just walk over to his house.But then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area. But in order to expand that, you need a river, or you need a highway, or you need telephone lines. But in any event, it's connectivity that leads to dependability. And that leads to specialization. That leads to productivity.So the question was, I started looking at this issue, and going back and forth between Bangladesh and New York. There were a lot of reasons people told me why we don't have enough telephones. And one of them is the lacking buying power. Poor people apparently don't have the power to buy.But the point is, if it's a production tool, why do we have to worry about that? I mean, in America, people buy cars, and they put very little money down. They get a car, and they go to work. The work pays them a salary; the salary allows them to pay for the car over time. The car pays for itself.So if the telephone is a production tool, then we don't quite have to worry about the purchasing power. And of course, even if that's true, then what about initial buying power? So then the question is, why can't we have some kind of shared access? In the United States, we have \u2014 everybody needs a banking service, but very few of us are trying to buy a bank. So it's \u2014 a bank tends to serve a whole community. So we could do that for telephones.And also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet: food, clothing, shelter, whatever. But again, it's very paternalistic. You should be raising income and let people decide what they want to do with their money.But the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures. See, you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing. For instance, the Internet was booming in the U.S. because there were \u2014 there were people who had computers. They had modems. They had telephone lines, so it's very easy to bring in a new idea, like the Internet. But that's what's lacking in a poor country.So for example, we didn't have ways to have credit checks, few banks to collect bills, etc. But that's why I noticed Grameen Bank, which is a bank for poor people, and had 1,100 branches, 12,000 employees, 2.3 million borrowers. And they had these branches. I thought I could put cell towers and create a network.And anyway, to cut the time short \u2014 so I started \u2014 I first went to them and said, \"You know, perhaps I could connect all your branches and make you more efficient.\" But you know, they have, after all, evolved in a country without telephones, so they are decentralized. I mean, of course there might be other good reasons, but this was one of the reasons \u2014 they had to be. And so they were not that interested to connect all their branches, and then to be \u2014 and rock the boat.So I started focusing. What is it that they really do? So what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank. She typically buys a cow. The cow gives milk. And she sells the milk to the villagers, and pays off the loan. And this is a business for her, but it's milk for everybody else.And suddenly I realized that a cell phone could be a cow. Because some way she could borrow 200 dollars from the bank, get a phone and have the phone for everybody. And it's a business for her.So I wrote to the bank, and they thought for a while, and they said, \"It's a little crazy, but logical. If you think it can be done, come and make it happen.\" So I quit my job; I went back to Bangladesh. I created a company in America called Gonofone, which in Bengali means \"people's phone.\"And angel investors in America put in money into that. I flew around the world. After about a million \u2014 I mean, I got rejected from lots of places, because I was not only trying to go to a poor country, I was trying to go to the poor of the poor country.After about a million miles, and a meaningful \u2014 a substantial loss of hair, I eventually put together a consortium, and \u2014 which involved the Norwegian telephone company, which provided the know-how, and the Grameen Bank provided the infrastructure to spread the service.To make the story short, here is the coverage of the country. You can see it's pretty much covered. Even in Bangladesh, there are some empty places. But we are also investing around another 300 million dollars this year to extend that coverage.Now, about that cow model I talked about. There are about 115,000 people who are retailing telephone services in their neighborhoods. And it's serving 52,000 villages, which represent about 80 million people.And these phones are generating about 100 million dollars for the company. And two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day, which is like 700 dollars per year.And of course, it's very beneficial in a lot of ways. It increases income, improves welfare, etc. And the result is, right now, this company is the largest telephone company, with 3.5 million subscribers, 115,000 of these phones I talked about \u2014 that produces about a third of the traffic in the network. And 2004, the net profit, after taxes \u2014 very serious taxes \u2014 was 120 million dollars. And the company contributed about 190 million dollars to the government coffers.And again, here are some of the lessons. \"The government needs to provide economically viable services.\" Actually, this is an instance where private companies can provide that. \"Governments need to subsidize private companies.\" This is what some people think. And actually, private companies help governments with taxes. \"Poor people are recipients.\" Poor people are a resource. \"Services cost too much for the poor.\" Their involvement reduces the cost. \"The poor are uneducated and cannot do much.\" They are very eager learners and very capable survivors. I've been very surprised. Most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day. \"Poor countries need aid.\" Businesses \u2014 this one company has raised the \u2014 if the ideal figures are even five percent true, this one company is raising the GNP of the country much more than the aid the country receives. And as I was trying to show you, as far as I'm concerned, aid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens.And this is a new project I have with Dean Kamen, the famous inventor in America. He has produced some power generators, which we are now doing an experiment in Bangladesh, in two villages where cow manure is producing biogas, which is running these generators. And each of these generators is selling electricity to 20 houses each. It's just an experiment. We don't know how far it will go, but it's going on.Thank you.", "id": 79, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nI'll just take you to

00:03:12.958\nwhere citizens are not yet empowered, the same thing goes --\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nNigeria, Saudi Arabia, all sorts of countries.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nBecause the aid and oil or mineral money acts the same way.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nIt empowers authorities, without activating the citizens --\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:28.958\ntheir hands, legs, brains, what have you.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nAnd if you agree with that, then I think the best way to improve these countries\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nis to recognize that economic development is of the people,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nby the people, for the people.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nAnd that is the real network effect.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nIf citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nso that their voices are heard,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nso then things would improve.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nAnd to contrast that, you can see the most important institution in the world,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nthe World Bank, is an organization of the government,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nby the government, for the governments.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nJust see the contrast.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nAnd that is the perspective I have, and then I can start my story.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nOf course, how would you empower citizens?\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nThere could be all sorts of technologies. And one is cell phones.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nRecently \"The Economist\" recognized this,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nbut I stumbled upon the idea 12 years ago,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nand that's what I've been working on.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nSo 12 years ago, I was trying to be an investment banker in New York.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nWe had -- quite a few our colleagues were connected by a computer network.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nAnd we got more productive because we didn't have to exchange floppy disks;\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nwe could update each other more often.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nBut one time it broke down.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nAnd it reminded me of a day in 1971.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nThere was a war going on in my country.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nAnd my family moved out of an urban place, where we used to live,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nto a remote rural area where it was safer.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nAnd one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAnd I walked 10 miles or so, all morning, to get there, to the medicine man.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nAnd he wasn't there, so I walked all afternoon back.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nSo I had another unproductive day.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nSo while I was sitting in a tall building in New York,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nI put those two experiences together side by side,\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nand basically concluded that connectivity is productivity --\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nwhether it's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nSo naturally, I -- the implication of that is\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nthat the telephone is a weapon against poverty.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAnd if that's the case, then the question is\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nhow many telephones did we have at that time?\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nAnd it turns out, that there was one telephone in Bangladesh\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nfor every 500 people.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nAnd all those phones were in the few urban places.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nThe vast rural areas, where 100 million people lived,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nthere were no telephones.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nSo just imagine how many man-months or man-years are wasted,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\njust like I wasted a day.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nIf you just multiply by 100 million people, let's say losing one day a month,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nwhatever, and you see a vast amount of resource wasted.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nAnd after all, poor countries, like rich countries, one thing we've got equal,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nis their days are the same length: 24 hours.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nSo if you lose that precious resource,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nwhere you are somewhat equal to the richer countries,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nthat's a huge waste.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nSo I started looking for any evidence that --\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:44.958\ndoes connectivity really increase productivity?\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd I couldn't find much, really, but I found this graph produced by the ITU,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nwhich is the International Telecommunication Union, based in Geneva.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nThey show an interesting thing.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nThat you see, the horizontal axis is where you place your country.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nSo the United States or the UK would be here, outside.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nAnd so the impact of one new telephone,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nwhich is on the vertical axis, is very little.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nBut if you come back to a poorer country, where the GNP per capita is,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nlet's say, 500 dollars, or 300 dollars,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nthen the impact is huge: 6,000 dollars. Or 5,000 dollars.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nThe question was,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nhow much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh?\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nIt turns out: 2,000 dollars.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nSo if you spend 2,000 dollars, and let's say the telephone lasts 10 years,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nand if 5,000 dollars every year -- so that's 50,000 dollars.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nSo obviously this was a gadget to have.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nAnd of course, if the cost of installing a telephone is going down,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nbecause there's a digital revolution going on,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nthen it would be even more dramatic.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nAnd I knew a little economics by then --\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nit says Adam Smith taught us that specialization leads to productivity.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nBut how would you specialize?\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nLet's say I'm a fisherman and a farmer.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nAnd Chris is a fisherman farmer. Both are generalists.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nSo the point is that we could only -- the only way we could depend on each other,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nis if we can connect with each other.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nAnd if we are neighbors, I could just walk over to his house.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nBut then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nBut in order to expand that, you need a river,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nor you need a highway, or you need telephone lines.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nBut in any event, it's connectivity that leads to dependability.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nAnd that leads to specialization.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nThat leads to productivity.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nSo the question was, I started looking at this issue,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nand going back and forth between Bangladesh and New York.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nThere were a lot of reasons people told me\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nwhy we don't have enough telephones.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nAnd one of them is the lacking buying power.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nPoor people apparently don't have the power to buy.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nBut the point is, if it's a production tool, why do we have to worry about that?\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nI mean, in America, people buy cars,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nand they put very little money down.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nThey get a car, and they go to work.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nThe work pays them a salary;\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nthe salary allows them to pay for the car over time.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nThe car pays for itself.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nSo if the telephone is a production tool,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nthen we don't quite have to worry about the purchasing power.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nAnd of course, even if that's true, then what about initial buying power?\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nSo then the question is, why can't we have some kind of shared access?\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nIn the United States, we have -- everybody needs a banking service,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nbut very few of us are trying to buy a bank.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nSo it's -- a bank tends to serve a whole community.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nSo we could do that for telephones.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nAnd also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet:\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nfood, clothing, shelter, whatever.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nBut again, it's very paternalistic.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nYou should be raising income\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nand let people decide what they want to do with their money.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nBut the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nSee, you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nFor instance, the Internet was booming in the U.S.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nbecause there were -- there were people who had computers.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nThey had modems.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nThey had telephone lines, so it's very easy to bring in a new idea, like the Internet.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nBut that's what's lacking in a poor country.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nSo for example, we didn't have ways to have credit checks,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nfew banks to collect bills, etc.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nBut that's why I noticed Grameen Bank, which is a bank for poor people,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nand had 1,100 branches, 12,000 employees, 2.3 million borrowers.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nAnd they had these branches.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nI thought I could put cell towers and create a network.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nAnd anyway, to cut the time short -- so I started --\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nI first went to them and said,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\n\"You know, perhaps I could connect all your branches and make you more efficient.\"\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nBut you know, they have, after all, evolved in a country without telephones,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nso they are decentralized. I mean, of course there might be other good reasons,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nbut this was one of the reasons -- they had to be.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nAnd so they were not that interested to connect all their branches,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nand then to be -- and rock the boat.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nSo I started focusing. What is it that they really do?\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nSo what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nShe typically buys a cow. The cow gives milk.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nAnd she sells the milk to the villagers, and pays off the loan.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nAnd this is a business for her, but it's milk for everybody else.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nAnd suddenly I realized that a cell phone could be a cow.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nBecause some way she could borrow 200 dollars from the bank,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nget a phone and have the phone for everybody.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nAnd it's a business for her.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nSo I wrote to the bank, and they thought for a while, and they said,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\n\"It's a little crazy, but logical.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nIf you think it can be done, come and make it happen.\"\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nSo I quit my job; I went back to Bangladesh.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nI created a company in America called Gonofone,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nwhich in Bengali means \"people's phone.\"\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nAnd angel investors in America put in money into that.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nI flew around the world.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAfter about a million -- I mean, I got rejected from lots of places,\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nbecause I was not only trying to go to a poor country,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nI was trying to go to the poor of the poor country.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nAfter about a million miles, and a meaningful --\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\na substantial loss of hair, I eventually put together a consortium, and --\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nwhich involved the Norwegian telephone company,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nwhich provided the know-how,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nand the Grameen Bank provided the infrastructure to spread the service.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nTo make the story short, here is the coverage of the country.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nYou can see it's pretty much covered.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nEven in Bangladesh, there are some empty places.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nBut we are also investing around another 300 million dollars this year\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nto extend that coverage.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nNow, about that cow model I talked about.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nThere are about 115,000 people who are retailing telephone services\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nin their neighborhoods.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nAnd it's serving 52,000 villages, which represent about 80 million people.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nAnd these phones are generating\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nabout 100 million dollars for the company.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nAnd two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day, which is like 700 dollars per year.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nAnd of course, it's very beneficial in a lot of ways.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nIt increases income, improves welfare, etc.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nAnd the result is, right now, this company is the largest telephone company,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nwith 3.5 million subscribers,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\n115,000 of these phones I talked about --\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nthat produces about a third of the traffic in the network.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nAnd 2004, the net profit, after taxes --\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nvery serious taxes -- was 120 million dollars.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nAnd the company contributed about 190 million dollars to the government coffers.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nAnd again, here are some of the lessons.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\n\"The government needs to provide economically viable services.\"\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nActually, this is an instance where private companies can provide that.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\n\"Governments need to subsidize private companies.\"\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nThis is what some people think.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd actually, private companies help governments with taxes.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\n\"Poor people are recipients.\"\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nPoor people are a resource.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\n\"Services cost too much for the poor.\"\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nTheir involvement reduces the cost.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\n\"The poor are uneducated and cannot do much.\"\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nThey are very eager learners and very capable survivors.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nI've been very surprised.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nMost of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\n\"Poor countries need aid.\"\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nBusinesses -- this one company has raised the --\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nif the ideal figures are even five percent true, this one company\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nis raising the GNP of the country much more than the aid the country receives.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nAnd as I was trying to show you, as far as I'm concerned,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:13.958\naid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nAnd this is a new project I have with Dean Kamen, the famous inventor in America.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nHe has produced some power generators,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nwhich we are now doing an experiment in Bangladesh,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nin two villages where cow manure is producing biogas,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nwhich is running these generators.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nAnd each of these generators is selling electricity to 20 houses each.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nIt's just an experiment.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nWe don't know how far it will go,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nbut it's going on.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nThank you."}, {"title": "Invest in Africa's own solutions", "duration": "773", "url":

My uncle Ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater \u2014 at least I thought it was beautiful. And it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach, and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru were kind of right across the chest, that were also fuzzy. And I wore it whenever I could, thinking it was the most fabulous thing I owned.Until one day in ninth grade, when I was standing with a number of the football players. And my body had clearly changed, and Matt, who was undeniably my nemesis in high school, said in a booming voice that we no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips, but we could all ski on Mount Novogratz. (Laughter) And I was so humiliated and mortified that I immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her for ever letting me wear the hideous sweater. We drove to the Goodwill and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously, my idea being that I would never have to think about the sweater nor see it ever again.Fast forward \u2014 11 years later, I'm a 25-year-old kid. I'm working in Kigali, Rwanda, jogging through the steep slopes, when I see, 10 feet in front of me, a little boy \u2014 11 years old \u2014 running toward me, wearing my sweater. And I'm thinking, no, this is not possible. But so, curious, I run up to the child \u2014 of course scaring the living bejesus out of him \u2014 grab him by the collar, turn it over, and there is my name written on the collar of this sweater.I tell that story, because it has served and continues to serve as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness that we all have on this Earth. We so often don't realize what our action and our inaction does to people we think we will never see and never know. I also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story of what aid is and can be. That this traveled into the Goodwill in Virginia, and moved its way into the larger industry, which at that point was giving millions of tons of secondhand clothing to Africa and Asia. Which was a very good thing, providing low cost clothing. And at the same time, certainly in Rwanda, it destroyed the local retailing industry. Not to say that it shouldn't have, but that we have to get better at answering the questions that need to be considered when we think about consequences and responses.So, I'm going to stick in Rwanda, circa 1985, 1986, where I was doing two things. I had started a bakery with 20 unwed mothers. We were called the \"Bad News Bears,\" and our notion was we were going to corner the snack food business in Kigali, which was not hard because there were no snacks before us. And because we had a good business model, we actually did it, and I watched these women transform on a micro-level. But at the same time, I started a micro-finance bank, and tomorrow Iqbal Quadir is going to talk about Grameen, which is the grandfather of all micro-finance banks, which now is a worldwide movement \u2014 you talk about a meme \u2014 but then it was quite new, especially in an economy that was moving from barter into trade.We got a lot of things right. We focused on a business model; we insisted on skin in the game. The women made their own decisions at the end of the day as to how they would use this access to credit to build their little businesses, earn more income so they could take care of their families better.What we didn't understand, what was happening all around us, with the confluence of fear, ethnic strife and certainly an aid game, if you will, that was playing into this invisible but certainly palpable movement inside Rwanda, that at that time, 30 percent of the budget was all foreign aid. The genocide happened in 1994, seven years after these women all worked together to build this dream. And the good news was that the institution, the banking institution, lasted. In fact, it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country. The bakery was completely wiped out, but the lessons for me were that accountability counts \u2014 got to build things with people on the ground, using business models where, as Steven Levitt would say, the incentives matter. Understand, however complex we may be, incentives matter.So when Chris raised to me how wonderful everything that was happening in the world, that we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist, on the one hand I absolutely agree with him, and I was so thrilled to see what happened with the G8 \u2014 that the world, because of people like Tony Blair and Bono and Bob Geldof \u2014 the world is talking about global poverty; the world is talking about Africa in ways I have never seen in my life. It's thrilling. And at the same time, what keeps me up at night is a fear that we'll look at the victories of the G8 \u2014 50 billion dollars in increased aid to Africa, 40 billion in reduced debt \u2014 as the victory, as more than chapter one, as our moral absolution.And in fact, what we need to do is see that as chapter one, celebrate it, close it, and recognize that we need a chapter two that is all about execution, all about the how-to. And if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today, it's that the only way to end poverty, to make it history, is to build viable systems on the ground that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor, in ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable. If we do that, we really can make poverty history.And it was that \u2014 that whole philosophy \u2014 that encouraged me to start my current endeavor called \"Acumen Fund,\" which is trying to build some mini-blueprints for how we might do that in water, health and housing in Pakistan, India, Kenya, Tanzania and Egypt. And I want to talk a little bit about that, and some of the examples, so you can see what it is that we're doing. But before I do this \u2014 and this is another one of my pet peeves \u2014 I want to talk a little bit about who the poor are. Because we too often talk about them as these strong, huge masses of people yearning to be free, when in fact, it's quite an amazing story. On a macro level, four billion people on Earth make less than four dollars a day.That's who we talk about when we think about \"the poor.\" If you aggregate it, it's the third largest economy on Earth, and yet most of these people go invisible. Where we typically work, there's people making between one and three dollars a day. Who are these people? They are farmers and factory workers. They work in government offices. They're drivers. They are domestics. They typically pay for critical goods and services like water, like healthcare, like housing, and they pay 30 to 40 times what their middleclass counterparts pay \u2014 certainly where we work in Karachi and Nairobi. The poor also are willing to make, and do make, smart decisions, if you give them that opportunity.So, two examples. One is in India, where there are 240 million farmers, most of whom make less than two dollars a day. Where we work in Aurangabad, the land is extraordinarily parched. You see people on average making 60 cents to a dollar. This guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named Ami Tabar. What he did was see what was happening in Israel, larger approaches, and figure out how to do a drip irrigation, which is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock. But previously it's only been created for large-scale farms, so Ami Tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre. A couple of principles: build small. Make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor.This family, Sarita and her husband, bought a 15-dollar unit when they were living in a \u2014 literally a three-walled lean-to with a corrugated iron roof. After one harvest, they had increased their income enough to buy a second system to do their full quarter-acre. A couple of years later, I meet them. They now make four dollars a day, which is pretty much middle class for India, and they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laid to build their house. And I swear, you could see the future in that woman's eyes. Something I truly believe.You can't talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets, and I again give Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard huge kudos for bringing to the world this notion of his rage \u2014 for five dollars you can save a life. Malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year. 300 to 500 million cases are reported. It's estimated that Africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year to the disease. Five dollars can save a life. We can send people to the moon; we can see if there's life on Mars \u2014 why can't we get five-dollar nets to 500 million people?The question, though, is not \"Why can't we?\" The question is how can we help Africans do this for themselves? A lot of hurdles. One: production is too low. Two: price is too high. Three: this is a good road in \u2014 right near where our factory is located. Distribution is a nightmare, but not impossible. We started by making a 350,000-dollar loan to the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africa so that they could transfer technology from Japan and build these long-lasting, five-year nets. Here are just some pictures of the factory.Today, three years later, the company has employed another thousand women. It contributes about 600,000 dollars in wages to the economy of Tanzania. It's the largest company in Tanzania. The throughput rate right now is 1.5 million nets, three million by the end of the year. We hope to have seven million at the end of next year. So the production side is working. On the distribution side, though, as a world, we have a lot of work to do. Right now, 95 percent of these nets are being bought by the U.N., and then given primarily to people around Africa. We're looking at building on some of the most precious resources of Africa: people. Their women.And so I want you to meet Jacqueline, my namesake, 21 years old. If she were born anywhere else but Tanzania, I'm telling you, she could run Wall Street. She runs two of the lines, and has already saved enough money to put a down payment on her house. She makes about two dollars a day, is creating an education fund, and told me she is not marrying nor having children until these things are completed. And so, when I told her about our idea \u2014 that maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States, and find a way for the women themselves to go out and sell these nets to others \u2014 she quickly started calculating what she herself could make and signed up.We took a lesson from IDEO, one of our favorite companies, and quickly did a prototyping on this, and took Jacqueline into the area where she lives. She brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts together to see if she could sell these nets, five dollars apiece, despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one, and we learned a lot about how you sell things. Not coming in with our own notions, because she didn't even talk about malaria until the very end. First, she talked about comfort, status, beauty. These nets, she said, you put them on the floor, bugs leave your house. Children can sleep through the night; the house looks beautiful; you hang them in the window. And we've started making curtains, and not only is it beautiful, but people can see status \u2014 that you care about your children. Only then did she talk about saving your children's lives. A lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell goods and services to the poor.I want to end just by saying that there's enormous opportunity to make poverty history. To do it right, we have to build business models that matter, that are scaleable and that work with Africans, Indians, people all over the developing world who fit in this category, to do it themselves. Because at the end of the day, it's about engagement. It's about understanding that people really don't want handouts, that they want to make their own decisions; they want to solve their own problems; and that by engaging with them, not only do we create much more dignity for them, but for us as well. And so I urge all of you to think next time as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity that we all have \u2014 to make poverty history \u2014 by really becoming part of the process and moving away from an us-and-them world, and realizing that it's about all of us, and the kind of world that we, together, want to live in and share. Thank you.

00:04:05.958\nAnd the good news was that the institution,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nthe banking institution, lasted.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nIn fact, it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nThe bakery was completely wiped out,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nbut the lessons for me were that accountability counts --\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\ngot to build things with people on the ground,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nusing business models where, as Steven Levitt would say,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nthe incentives matter.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nUnderstand, however complex we may be, incentives matter.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nSo when Chris raised to me how wonderful everything\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nthat was happening in the world,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nthat we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\non the one hand I absolutely agree with him,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nand I was so thrilled to see what happened with the G8 --\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nthat the world, because of people like Tony Blair and Bono\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nand Bob Geldof -- the world is talking about global poverty;\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nthe world is talking about Africa\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nin ways I have never seen in my life.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nIt's thrilling.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nAnd at the same time, what keeps me up at night\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nis a fear that we'll look at the victories of the G8 --\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\n50 billion dollars in increased aid to Africa,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\n40 billion in reduced debt -- as the victory,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nas more than chapter one, as our moral absolution.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nAnd in fact, what we need to do is see that as chapter one,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.958\ncelebrate it, close it, and recognize that we need a chapter two\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nthat is all about execution, all about the how-to.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nit's that the only way to end poverty, to make it history,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nis to build viable systems on the ground\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nthat deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nin ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nIf we do that, we really can make poverty history.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAnd it was that -- that whole philosophy --\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nthat encouraged me to start my current endeavor\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\ncalled \"Acumen Fund,\"\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nwhich is trying to build some mini-blueprints\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nfor how we might do that in water, health and housing\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nin Pakistan, India, Kenya, Tanzania and Egypt.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nAnd I want to talk a little bit about that, and some of the examples,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nso you can see what it is that we're doing.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nBut before I do this -- and this is another one of my pet peeves --\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nI want to talk a little bit about who the poor are.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nBecause we too often talk about them as these\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nstrong, huge masses of people yearning to be free,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nwhen in fact, it's quite an amazing story.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nOn a macro level, four billion people on Earth make less than four dollars a day.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nThat's who we talk about when we think about \"the poor.\"\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nIf you aggregate it, it's the third largest economy on Earth,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nand yet most of these people go invisible.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nWhere we typically work, there's people making between\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\none and three dollars a day.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nWho are these people?\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nThey are farmers and factory workers.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nThey work in government offices. They're drivers.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nThey are domestics.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nThey typically pay for critical goods and services like water,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nlike healthcare, like housing, and they pay 30 to 40 times\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nwhat their middleclass counterparts pay --\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\ncertainly where we work in Karachi and Nairobi.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nThe poor also are willing to make, and do make, smart decisions,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nif you give them that opportunity.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nSo, two examples.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nOne is in India, where there are 240 million farmers,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nmost of whom make less than two dollars a day.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nWhere we work in Aurangabad, the land is extraordinarily parched.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nYou see people on average making 60 cents to a dollar.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nThis guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named Ami Tabar.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nWhat he did was see what was happening in Israel, larger approaches,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nand figure out how to do a drip irrigation,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nwhich is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nBut previously it's only been created for large-scale farms,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nso Ami Tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nA couple of principles:\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nbuild small.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nMake it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nThis family, Sarita and her husband, bought a 15-dollar unit\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nwhen they were living in a -- literally a three-walled lean-to\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nwith a corrugated iron roof.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nAfter one harvest, they had increased their income enough\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nto buy a second system to do their full quarter-acre.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nA couple of years later, I meet them.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nThey now make four dollars a day, which is pretty much middle class for India,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nand they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laid\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nto build their house.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nAnd I swear, you could see the future in that woman's eyes.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nSomething I truly believe.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nYou can't talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nand I again give Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nhuge kudos for bringing to the world\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nthis notion of his rage -- for five dollars you can save a life.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nMalaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\n300 to 500 million cases are reported.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nIt's estimated that Africa loses\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nabout 13 billion dollars a year to the disease.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nFive dollars can save a life.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nWe can send people to the moon; we can see if there's life on Mars --\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nwhy can't we get five-dollar nets to 500 million people?\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nThe question, though, is not \"Why can't we?\"\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nThe question is how can we help Africans do this for themselves?\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nA lot of hurdles.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nOne: production is too low. Two: price is too high.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nThree: this is a good road in -- right near where our factory is located.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nDistribution is a nightmare, but not impossible.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nWe started by making a 350,000-dollar loan\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nto the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africa\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nso that they could transfer technology from Japan\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nand build these long-lasting, five-year nets.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nHere are just some pictures of the factory.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nToday, three years later, the company has employed\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nanother thousand women.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nIt contributes about 600,000 dollars in wages to the economy of Tanzania.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nIt's the largest company in Tanzania.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nThe throughput rate right now is 1.5 million nets,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nthree million by the end of the year.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nWe hope to have seven million at the end of next year.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nSo the production side is working.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nOn the distribution side, though,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nas a world, we have a lot of work to do.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nRight now, 95 percent of these nets are being bought by the U.N.,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nand then given primarily to people around Africa.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nWe're looking at building\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\non some of the most precious resources of Africa: people.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nTheir women.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nAnd so I want you to meet Jacqueline,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nmy namesake, 21 years old.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nIf she were born anywhere else but Tanzania,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nI'm telling you, she could run Wall Street.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nShe runs two of the lines, and has already saved enough money\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nto put a down payment on her house.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nShe makes about two dollars a day, is creating an education fund,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nand told me she is not marrying nor having children\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nuntil these things are completed.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nAnd so, when I told her about our idea --\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nthat maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nand find a way for the women themselves to go out\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nand sell these nets to others --\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nshe quickly started calculating what she herself could make\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nand signed up.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nWe took a lesson from IDEO, one of our favorite companies,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nand quickly did a prototyping on this,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nand took Jacqueline into the area where she lives.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nShe brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\ntogether to see if she could sell these nets, five dollars apiece,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\ndespite the fact that people say nobody will buy one,\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nand we learned a lot about how you sell things.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nNot coming in with our own notions,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nbecause she didn't even talk about malaria until the very end.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nFirst, she talked about comfort, status, beauty.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nThese nets, she said, you put them on the floor, bugs leave your house.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nChildren can sleep through the night;\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nthe house looks beautiful; you hang them in the window.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nAnd we've started making curtains,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nand not only is it beautiful, but people can see status --\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nthat you care about your children.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nOnly then did she talk about saving your children's lives.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nA lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\ngoods and services to the poor.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nI want to end just by saying that there's enormous opportunity\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nto make poverty history.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nTo do it right, we have to build business models that matter,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nthat are scaleable and that work with Africans, Indians,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\npeople all over the developing world\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nwho fit in this category, to do it themselves.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nBecause at the end of the day, it's about engagement.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nIt's about understanding that people really don't want handouts,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nthat they want to make their own decisions;\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nthey want to solve their own problems;\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nand that by engaging with them,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nnot only do we create much more dignity for them,\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nbut for us as well.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nAnd so I urge all of you to think next time\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nas to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nthat we all have -- to make poverty history --\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nby really becoming part of the process\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nand moving away from an us-and-them world,\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nand realizing that it's about all of us,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nand the kind of world that we, together, want to live in and share.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nThank you.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why we should invest in a free press", "duration": "1080", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/sasa_vucinic_invests_in_free_press", "transcript": "Video: Narrator: An event seen from one point of view gives one impression. Seen from another point of view, it gives quite a different impression. But it's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand what's going on.Sasha Vucinic: It's a great clip, isn't it? And I found that in 29 seconds, it tells more about the power of, and importance of, independent media than I could say in an hour. So I thought that it will be good to start with it. And also start with a little bit of statistics. According to relevant researchers, 83 percent of the population of this planet lives in the societies without independent press. Think about that number: 83 percent of the population on the whole planet does not really know what is going on in their countries. The information they get gets filtered through somebody who either twists that information, or colors that information, does something with it. So they're deprived of understanding their reality. That is just to understand how big and important this problem is. Now those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies that represent 17 percent, I think should enjoy it until it lasts. You know, Sunday morning, you flick the paper, get your cappuccino. Enjoy it while it lasts. Because as we heard yesterday, countries can lose stars from their flags, but they can also lose press freedom, as I guess Americans among us can tell us more about. But that's totally another and separate topic. So I can go back to my story.My story starts \u2014 the story I want to share \u2014 starts in 1991. At that time I was running B92, the only independent, for that matter the only electronic media, in the country. And I guess we were sharing \u2014 we had that regular life of the only independent media in the country, operating in hostile environment, where government really wants to make your life miserable. And there are different ways. Yeah, it was the usual cocktail: a little bit of threats, a little bit of friendly advice, a little bit of financial police, a little bit of text control, so you always have somebody who never leaves your office. But what they really do, which is very powerful, and that is what governments in the late '90s started doing if they don't like independent media companies \u2014 you know, they threaten your advertisers. Once they threaten your advertisers, market forces are actually, you know, destroyed, and the advertisers do not want to come \u2014 no matter how much does it make sense for them \u2014 do not want to come and advertise. And you have a problem making ends meet.At that time at the beginning of the '90s, we had that problem, which was, you know, survival below one side, but what was really painful for me was, remember, the beginning of the '90s, Yugoslavia is falling apart. We were sitting over there with a country in a downfall, in a slow-motion downfall. And we all had all of that on tapes. We had the ability to understand what was going on. We were actually recording history. The problem was that we had to re-tape that history a week later; because if we did not, we could not afford enough tapes to keep archives of that history. So if I gave you that picture, I don't want to go too long on that. In that context a gentleman came to my office at that time. It was still 1991. He was running a media systems organization which is still in business, the gentleman is still in business. And what did I know at that time about media systems? I would think media systems were organizations, which means they should help you. So I prepared two plans for that meeting, two strategic plans: the small one and the big one. The small one was, I just wanted him to help us get those damn tapes, so we can keep that archive for the next 50 years. The big plan was to ask him for a 1,000,000-dollar loan. Because I thought, I still maintain, that serious and independent media companies are great business. And I thought that B92 will survive and be a great company once Milosevic is gone, which turned out to be true. It's now probably either the biggest or the second biggest media company in the country. And I thought that the only thing that we needed at that time was 1,000,000-dollar loan to take us through those hard times.To make a long story short, the gentleman comes into the office, great suit and tie. I gave him what I thought was a brilliant explanation of the political situation and explained how hard and difficult the war will be. Actually, I underestimated the atrocities, I have to admit. Anyway, after that whole, big, long explanation, the only question he had for me \u2014 and this is not a joke \u2014 is, are we paying royalties after we broadcast music of Michael Jackson? That was really the only question he had. He left, and I remember being actually very angry at myself because I thought there must be an institution in the world that is providing loans to media companies. It's so obvious, straight in your face, and somebody must have thought of it. Somebody must have started something like that. And I thought, I'm just dumb and I cannot find it. You know, in my defense, there was no Google at that time; you could not just Google in '91. So I thought that that's actually my problem. Now we go from here, fast forward to 1995.I have \u2014 I left the country, I have a meeting with George Soros, trying for the third time to convince him that his foundation should invest in something that should operate like a media bank. And basically what I was saying is very simple. You know, forget about charity; it doesn't work. Forget about handouts; 20,000 dollars do not help anybody. What you should do is you should treat media companies as a business. It's business anywhere. Media business, or any other business, it needs to be capitalized. And what these guys need, actually, is access to capital. So third meeting, arguments are pretty well exercised. At the end of the meeting he says, look, it is not going to work; you will never see your money back; but my foundations will put 500,000 dollars so you can test the idea. See that it will not work. He said, I'll give you a rope to hang yourself. (Laughter) I knew two things after that meeting. First, under no circumstances I want to hang myself. And second, that I have no idea how to make it work. You see, at the level of a concept, it was a great concept. But it's one thing to have a concept; it's a totally separate thing to actually make it work.So I had absolutely no idea how that could actually work. Had the wrong idea; I thought that we can be a bank. You see banks \u2014 I don't know if there are any bankers over here; I apologize in advance \u2014 but it's the best job in the world. You know, you find somebody who is respectable and has a lot of money. You give them more money; they repay you that over a time. You collect interest and do nothing in between. So I thought, why don't we get into that business? (Laughter) So here we are having our first client, brilliant. First independent newspaper in Slovakia. The government cutting them off from all the printing facilities in Bratislava. So here's the daily newspaper that has to be printed 400 kilometers away from the capital. It's a daily newspaper with a deadline of 4 p.m. That means that they have no sports; they have no latest news; circulation goes down. It's a kind of very nice, sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper. They come to us with a request for a loan. They want to \u2014 the only way for them to survive is to get a printing press. And we said, that's fine; let's meet; you'll bring us your business plan, which eventually they did.We start the meeting. I get these two pieces of paper, not like this, A4 format, so it's much bigger. A lot of numbers there. A lot of numbers. But however you put it, you know, the numbers do not make any sense. And that's the best they could do. We were the best that they could do. So that is how we understood what our method is. It's not a bank. We had to actually go into these companies and earn our return by fixing them \u2014 by establishing management systems, by providing all that knowledge, how do you run a business on one side \u2014 while they all know how to run, how to create content.Just quickly on the results. Over these 10 years, 40 million dollars in affordable financing, average interest rate five percent to six percent. Lately we are going wild, charging seven percent from time to time. We do it in 17 countries of the developing world. And here is the most stunning number. Return rate \u2014 the one that Soros was so worried about \u2014 97 percent. 97 percent of all the scheduled repayments came back to us on time. What do we typically finance? We finance anything that a media company would need, from printing presses to transmitters. What is most important is we do it either in form of loans, equities, lease \u2014 whatever is appropriate for, you know, supporting anybody. But what is most important here is, who do we finance? We believe that in the last 10 years companies that we've financed are actually the best media companies in the developing world. That is a \"Who is Who\" list. And I could spend hours talking about them, because they're all kind of heroes. And I can, but I'll give you just, maybe one, and depending on time I may give you two examples who we work with.You see we started working in Eastern and Central Europe, and moved to Russia. Our first loan in Russia was in Chelyabinsk. I'll bet half of you have never heard of that place. In the south of Russia there's a guy called Boris Nikolayevich Kirshin, who is running an independent newspaper there. The city was closed until early '90s because, of all things, they were producing glass for Tupolev planes. Anyway, he's running independent newspaper there. After two years working with us, he becomes the most respected newspaper in that small place. Governor comes to him one day, actually invites him to come to his office. He goes and sees the governor. The governor says, Boris Nikolayevich, I understand you are doing a great job, and you are the most respected newspaper in our district. And I want to offer you a deal. Can you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months, because I have elections \u2014 there are elections coming up in nine months. I will not run, but it's very important for me who is going to succeed me. So give me the paper for nine months. I'll give it back to you. I have no interest in being in media business. How much would that cost? Boris Nikolayevich says, \"It's not for sale.\" The governor says, \"We will close you.\" Boris Nikolayevich says, \"No, you cannot do it.\" Six months later the newspaper was closed. Luckily, we had enough time to help Boris Nikolayevich take all the assets out of that company and bring him into a new one, to get all the subscription lists, rehire staff. So what the governor got was an empty shell. But that is what happens if you're in business of independent media, and if you are a banker for independent media. So it sounds like a great story.Somewhere down the road we opened a media management center. We started our media lab, sounds like a real great story. But there is a second angle to that. The second angle, like in this clip. If you take the camera above, you start thinking about these numbers again. 40 million dollars over 10 years spread over 17 countries. That is not too much, is it? It's actually just a drop in the sea. Because when you think about the importance, some of the issues that we were talking about last night \u2014 this last session we had about Africa and his hypothetical 50 billion dollars destined for Africa. All of those, not all, half of those problems mentioned last night \u2014 government accountability, corruption, how do you fight corruption, giving voice to unheard, to poor \u2014 it's why independent media is in business. And it's why it was invented. So from that perspective, what we did is just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify. Now ours is just one story.I'm sure that in this room there are, like, 15 other wonderful stories of nonprofits doing spectacular work. Here is where the problem is, and I'll explain to you as well as I can what the problem is. And it's called fundraising. Imagine that this third of this room is filled with people who represent different foundations. Imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations, doing very important work. Now imagine that every second person over here is deaf, does not hear, and switch the lights off. Now that is how difficult it is to match people from this side of the room with people of that side of the room. So we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed to reform, to totally rethink fundraising. You know, instead of people running in this dark, trying to find their own match, who will be willing, who has the same goals. Instead of all of that we thought there is \u2014 something new needs to be invented. And we came up with this idea of issuing bonds, press freedom bonds. If there are investors willing to finance U.S. government budget deficit, why wouldn't we find investors willing to finance press freedom deficit? We've decided to do it this fall; we will issue them, probably in denominations of 1,000 dollars. I don't want to advertise them too much; that's not the point. But the point is, if we ever survive to actually issue them, find enough investors that this can be considered a success, there's nothing stopping the next organization to start to issue bonds next spring. And those can be environmental bonds. And then two weeks later, Iqbal Quadir can issue his electricity in Bangladesh bonds. And before you know it, any social cause can be actually financed in this way.Now we do daydreaming in 11:30 with 55 seconds left. But let's take the idea further. You do it, you start it in the States, because it's, you know, concepts are very, very close to American minds. But you can actually bring it to Europe, too. You can bring it to Asia. You can, once you have all of those different points, you can make it easy for investors. Put all of those bonds at one place and they sit down and click. Once you have more than 10 of them you have to develop some kind of a matrix. What do investors get? On one side financial, on the other side social. So that brings the idea of some kind of rating agency, Morningstar type. It says, you know, social impact over here is spectacular, five stars. Financial, they give you one percent, only one star. Now take it to the last step. Once you have all of that put together, there's not one reason why you couldn't actually have a marketplace for all of that, where you cannot dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way. And in that way you organize the financing so there are no dark rooms, no blind people running around to find each other.Thank you.", "id": 75, "subtitle":

in 29 seconds, it tells more about\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nthe power of, and importance of, independent media\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nthan I could say in an hour.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nSo I thought that it will be good to start with it.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nAnd also start with a little bit of statistics.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nAccording to relevant researchers, 83 percent of the population of this planet\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nlives in the societies without independent press.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nThink about that number: 83 percent of the population on the whole planet\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:12.958\ndoes not really know what is going on in their countries.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nThe information

it.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nSo they're deprived of understanding their reality.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nThat is just to understand how big and important this problem

office,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:22.958\ngreat suit and tie.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nI gave him what I thought was a brilliant explanation\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nof the political situation and explained how hard and difficult\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nthe war will be.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nActually, I underestimated the atrocities, I have to admit.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nAnyway, after that whole, big, long explanation,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nthe only question he had for me -- and this is not a joke --\n\n00:05:44.958

had.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nHe left, and I remember being actually very angry at myself\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nbecause I thought there must be an institution in the

somebody must have thought of it.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nSomebody must have started something like that.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nAnd I thought, I'm just dumb and I cannot find it.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nYou know, in my defense, there was no Google at that time;\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nyou could not just Google in '91.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nSo I thought that that's actually my problem.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nNow we go from here, fast forward to 1995.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nI have -- I left the country, I have a meeting with George Soros,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:44.958\ntrying for the third time to convince him that\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nhis foundation should invest in something that should\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.958\noperate like a media bank.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nAnd basically what I was saying is very simple.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nYou know, forget about charity; it doesn't work.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nForget about handouts; 20,000 dollars do not help anybody.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nWhat you should do is you should treat media companies as a business.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nIt's business anywhere.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nMedia business, or any other business, it needs to be capitalized.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nAnd what these guys need, actually, is access to capital.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nSo third meeting, arguments are pretty well exercised.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nAt the end of the meeting he says,\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nlook, it is not going to work; you will never see your money back;\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nbut my foundations will put 500,000 dollars so you can test the idea.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nSee that it will not work.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nHe said, I'll give you a rope to hang yourself.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nI knew two things after that meeting.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nFirst, under no circumstances I want to hang myself.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nAnd second, that I have no idea how to make it work.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nYou see, at the level of a concept, it was a great concept.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nBut it's one thing to have a concept;\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nit's a totally separate thing to actually make it work.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nSo I had absolutely no idea how that could actually work.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nHad the wrong idea; I thought that we can be a bank.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nYou see banks -- I don't know if there are any bankers over here;\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nI apologize in advance -- but it's the best job in the world.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nYou know, you find somebody who is respectable\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nand has a lot of money.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nYou give them more money; they repay you that over a time.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nYou collect interest and do nothing in between.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nSo I thought, why don't we get into that business?\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nSo here we are having our first client, brilliant.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nFirst independent newspaper in Slovakia.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nThe government cutting them off\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nfrom all the printing facilities in Bratislava.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nSo here's the daily newspaper\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nthat has to be printed 400 kilometers away from the capital.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nIt's a daily newspaper with a deadline of 4 p.m.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nThat means that they have no sports;\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nthey have no latest news; circulation goes down.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nIt's a kind of very nice, sophisticated way\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nhow to economically strangle a daily newspaper.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nThey come to us with a request for a loan.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nThey want to -- the only way for them to survive\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nis to get a printing press.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nAnd we said, that's fine; let's meet;\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nyou'll bring us your business plan, which eventually they did.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nWe start the meeting.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nI get these two pieces of paper, not like this, A4 format,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nso it's much bigger.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nA lot of numbers there. A lot of numbers.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nBut however you put it, you know, the numbers\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\ndo not make any sense.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nAnd that's the best they could do.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nWe were the best that they could do.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nSo that is how we understood what our method is.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nIt's not a bank. We had to actually\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:43.958\ngo into these companies and earn our return\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nby fixing them -- by establishing management systems,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nby providing all that knowledge, how do you run a business\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:54.958\non one side -- while they all know how to run, how to create content.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nJust quickly on the results.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nOver these 10 years, 40 million dollars in affordable financing,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\naverage interest rate five percent to six percent.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nLately we are going wild, charging seven percent from time to time.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nWe do it in 17 countries of the developing world.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nAnd here is the most stunning number.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nReturn rate -- the one that Soros was so worried about -- 97 percent.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:33.958\n97 percent of all the scheduled repayments came back to us on time.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nWhat do we typically finance?\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nWe finance anything that a media company would need,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nfrom printing presses to transmitters.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nWhat is most important is we do it\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\neither in form of loans, equities, lease --\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nwhatever is appropriate for, you know, supporting anybody.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nBut what is most important here is, who do we finance?\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nWe believe that in the last 10 years companies\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nthat we've financed are actually the best media companies\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nin the developing world.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nThat is a \"Who is Who\" list.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nAnd I could spend hours talking about them,\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nbecause they're all kind of heroes.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nAnd I can, but I'll give you just, maybe one,\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nand depending on time I may give you two examples\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nwho we work with.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nYou see we started working in Eastern and Central Europe,\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nand moved to Russia.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nOur first loan in Russia was in Chelyabinsk.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nI'll bet half of you have never heard of that place.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nIn the south of Russia there's a guy called\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nBoris Nikolayevich Kirshin, who is running\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nan independent newspaper there.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nThe city was closed until early '90s\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nbecause, of all things, they were producing glass for Tupolev planes.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nAnyway, he's running independent newspaper there.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nAfter two years working with us, he becomes\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nthe most respected newspaper in that small place.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nGovernor comes to him one day,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nactually invites him to come to his office.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nHe goes and sees the governor. The governor says,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nBoris Nikolayevich, I understand you are doing a great job,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nand you are the most respected newspaper in our district.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nAnd I want to offer you a deal.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nCan you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nbecause I have elections --\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nthere are elections coming up in nine months.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nI will not run, but it's very important for me\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nwho is going to succeed me.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nSo give me the paper for nine months. I'll give it back to you.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nI have no interest in being in media business.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nHow much would that cost?\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nBoris Nikolayevich says, \"It's not for sale.\"\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nThe governor says, \"We will close you.\"\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nBoris Nikolayevich says, \"No, you cannot do it.\"\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nSix months later the newspaper was closed.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nLuckily, we had enough time to help Boris Nikolayevich\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:57.958\ntake all the assets out of that company and bring him into a new one,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nto get all the subscription lists, rehire staff.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nSo what the governor got was an empty shell.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nBut that is what happens if you're in business of independent media,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nand if you are a banker for independent media.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nSo it sounds like a great story.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nSomewhere down the road we opened a media management center.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nWe started our media lab, sounds like a real great story.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nBut there is a second angle to that.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nThe second angle, like in this clip.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nIf you take the camera above, you start thinking\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nabout these numbers again.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:40.958\n40 million dollars over 10 years spread over 17 countries.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nThat is not too much, is it?\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nIt's actually just a drop in the sea.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nBecause when you think about the importance,\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nsome of the issues that we were talking about last night --\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nthis last session we had about Africa and his\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nhypothetical 50 billion dollars destined for Africa.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nAll of those, not all, half of those problems mentioned last night --\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:07.958\ngovernment accountability, corruption, how do you fight corruption,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\ngiving voice to unheard, to poor --\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nit's why independent media is in business.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nAnd it's why it was invented.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nSo from that perspective, what we did is just really\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:26.958\none drop in the sea of that need that we can identify.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nNow ours is just one story.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nI'm sure that in this room there are, like, 15 other wonderful stories\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nof nonprofits doing spectacular work.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nHere is where the problem is,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nand I'll explain to you as well as I can what the problem is.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nAnd it's called fundraising.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nImagine that this third of this room is filled\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nwith people who represent different foundations.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nImagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\ndoing very important work.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nNow imagine that every second person over here\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nis deaf, does not hear, and switch the lights off.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nNow that is how difficult it is to match people\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nfrom this side of the room\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nwith people of that side of the room.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nSo we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nto reform, to totally rethink fundraising.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nYou know, instead of people running in this dark,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\ntrying to find their own match, who will be willing,\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nwho has the same goals.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nInstead of all of that we thought there is --\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nsomething new needs to be invented.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nAnd we came up with this idea of issuing bonds,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:42.958\npress freedom bonds.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nIf there are investors willing to finance\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nU.S. government budget deficit,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nwhy wouldn't we find investors willing to finance\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\npress freedom deficit?\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nWe've decided to do it this fall; we will issue them,\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nprobably in denominations of 1,000 dollars.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nI don't want to advertise them too much; that's not the point.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nBut the point is, if we ever survive to actually issue them,\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nfind enough investors that this can be considered a success,\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nthere's nothing stopping the next organization\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nto start to issue bonds next spring.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nAnd those can be environmental bonds.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nAnd then two weeks later, Iqbal Quadir can issue his\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nelectricity in Bangladesh bonds.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nAnd before you know it, any social cause\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:36.958\ncan be actually financed in this way.\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nNow we do daydreaming in 11:30 with 55 seconds left.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nBut let's take the idea further.\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nYou do it, you start it in the States, because it's,\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nyou know, concepts are very, very close to American minds.\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nBut you can actually bring it to Europe, too.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nYou can bring it to Asia.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nYou can, once you have all of those different points,\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nyou can make it easy for investors.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nPut all of those bonds at one place\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nand they sit down and click.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nOnce you have more than 10 of them\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nyou have to develop some kind of a matrix.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nWhat do investors get?\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nOn one side financial, on the other side social.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nSo that brings the idea of some kind of rating agency,\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nMorningstar type.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nIt says, you know, social impact over here is spectacular, five stars.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nFinancial, they give you one percent, only one star.\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nNow take it to the last step.\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nOnce you have all of that put together,\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nthere's not one reason why you couldn't actually have\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.958\na marketplace for all of that,\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nwhere you cannot dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way.\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nAnd in that way you organize the financing\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nso there are no dark rooms, no blind people\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nrunning around to find each other.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nThank you."}, {"title": "How to rebuild a broken state", "duration": "1125", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ashraf_ghani_on_rebuilding_broken_states", "transcript": "A public, Dewey long ago observed, is constituted through discussion and debate. If we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question, and avoid doxa, the realm of the unquestioned, then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions to debate and discussion. It is in this spirit that I join into a discussion of one of the critical issues of our time, namely, how to mobilize different forms of capital for the project of state building.To put the assumptions very clearly: capitalism, after 150 years, has become acceptable, and so has democracy. If we looked in the world of 1945 and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities, they were the rare exception, not the norm. The question now, however, is both about which form of capitalism and which type of democratic participation. But we must acknowledge that this moment has brought about a rare consensus of assumptions. And that provides the ground for a type of action, because consensus of each moment allows us to act. And it is necessary, no matter how fragile or how provisional our consensus, to be able to move forward.But the majority of the world neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems. Most of the globe experiences the state as repressive, as an organization that is concerned about denial of rights, about denial of justice, rather than provision of it. And in terms of experience of capitalism, there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences. First, extractive industry. Blood diamonds, smuggled emeralds, timber, that is cut right from under the poorest. Second is technical assistance. And technical assistance might shock you, but it's the worst form of \u2014 today \u2014 of the ugly face of the developed world to the developing countries. Tens of billions of dollars are supposedly spent on building capacity with people who are paid up to 1,500 dollars a day, who are incapable of thinking creatively, or organically.Next assumption \u2014 and of course the events of July 7, I express my deep sympathy, and before that, September 11 \u2014 have reminded us we do not live in three different worlds. We live in one world. But that's easily said. But we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in. And that is that if we want to have one world, this one world cannot be based on huge pockets of exclusion, and then inclusion for some. We must now finally come to think about the premises of a truly global world, in relationship to the regime of rights and responsibilities and accountabilities that are truly global in scope. Otherwise we will be missing this open moment in history, where we have a consensus on both the form of politics and the form of economics.What is one of these organizations to pick? We have three critical terms: economy, civil society and the state. I will not deal with those first two, except to say that uncritical transfer of assumptions, from one context to another, can only make for disaster. Economics taught in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context. My country is dominated by drug economy and a mafia. Textbook economics does not work in my context, and I have very few recommendations from anybody as to how to put together a legal economy. The poverty of our knowledge must become the first basis of moving forward, and not imposition of the framework that works on the basis of mathematical modeling, for which I have enormous respect. My colleagues at Johns Hopkins were among the best.Second, instead of debating endlessly about what is the structure of the state, why don't we simplify and say, what are a series of functions that the state in the 21st century must perform? Clare Lockhart and I are writing a book on this; we hope to share that much widely with \u2014 and third is that we could actually construct an index to measure comparatively how well these functions that we would agree on are being performed in different places.So what are these functions? We propose 10. And it's legitimate monopoly of means of violence, administrative control, management of public finances, investment in human capital, provision of citizenship rights, provision of infrastructure, management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state through regulation, creation of the market, international agreements, including public borrowing, and then, most importantly, rule of law.I won't elaborate. I hope the questions will give me an opportunity. This is a feasible goal, basically because, contrary to widespread assumption, I would argue that we know how to do this. Who would have imagined that Germany would be either united or democratic today, if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of 1943? But people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany and engaged in planning. And there are lots of other examples.Now in order to do this \u2014 and this brings this group \u2014 we have to rethink the notion of capital. The least important form of capital, in this project, is financial capital \u2014 money. Money is not capital in most of the developing countries. It's just cash. Because it lacks the institutional, organizational, managerial forms to turn it into capital. And what is required is a combination of physical capital, institutional capital, human capital \u2014 and security, of course, is critical, but so is information.Now, the issue that should concern us here \u2014 and that's the challenge that I would like to pose to this group \u2014 is again, it takes 16 years in your countries to produce somebody with a B.S. degree. It takes 20 years to produce somebody with a Ph.D. The first challenge is to rethink, fundamentally, the issue of the time. Do we need to repeat the modalities that we have inherited? Our educational systems are inherited from the 19th century. What is it that we need to do fundamentally to re-engage in a project, that capital formation is rapid? The absolute majority of the world's population are below 20, and they are growing larger and faster. They need different ways of being approached, different ways of being enfranchised, different ways of being skilled. And that's the first thing.Second is, you're problem solvers, but you're not engaging your global responsibility. You've stayed away from the problems of corruption. You only want clean environments in which to function. But if you don't think through the problems of corruption, who will? You stay away from design for development. You're great designers, but your designs are selfish. It's for your own immediate use. The world in which I operate operates with designs regarding roads, or dams, or provision of electricity that have not been revisited in 60 years. This is not right. It requires thinking.But, particularly, what we need more than anything else from this group is your imagination to be brought to bear on problems the way a meme is supposed to work. As the work on paradigms, long time ago showed \u2014 Thomas Kuhn's work \u2014 it's in the intersection of ideas that new developments \u2014 true breakthroughs \u2014 occur. And I hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the empowerment of the majority of the world's poor, through this means. Thank you. (Applause)Chris Anderson: So, Ashraf, until recently, you were the finance minister of Afghanistan, a country right at the middle of much of the world's agenda. Is the country gonna make it? Will democracy flourish? What scares you most?Ashraf Ghani: What scares me most is \u2014 is you, lack of your engagement. (Laughter) You asked me. You know I always give the unconventional answer. No. But seriously, the issue of Afghanistan first has to be seen as, at least, a 10- to 20-year perspective. Today the world of globalization is on speed. Time has been compressed. And space does not exist for most people. But in my world \u2014 you know, when I went back to Afghanistan after 23 years, space had expanded. Every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down. I rode \u2014 traveled \u2014 travel between two cities that used to take three hours now took 12. So the first is when the scale is that, we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure \u2014 it takes six years to deliver infrastructure. In our world. Any meaningful sort of thing. But the modality of attention, or what is happening today, what's happening tomorrow.Second is, when a country has been subjected to one of the most immense, brutal forms of exercise of power \u2014 we had the Red Army for 10 continuous years, 110,000 strong, literally terrorizing. The sky: every Afghan sees the sky as a source of fear. We were bombed practically out of existence. Then, tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism \u2014 from all sides. The United States, Great Britain, joined for instance, Egyptian intelligence service to train thousands of people in resistance and urban terrorism. How to turn a bicycle into an instrument of terror. How to turn a donkey, a carthorse, anything. And the Russians, equally. So, when violence erupts in a country like Afghanistan, it's because of that legacy. But we have to understand that we've been incredibly lucky. I mean, I really can't believe how lucky I am here, standing in front of you, speaking. When I joined as finance minister, I thought that the chances of my living more than three years would not be more than five percent. Those were the risks. They were worth it.I think we can make it, and the reason we can make it is because of the people. You see, because, I mean \u2014 I give you one statistic. 91 percent of the men in Afghanistan, 86 percent of the women, listen to at least three radio stations a day. In terms of their discourse, in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world, I think that I would dare say, they're much more sophisticated than rural Americans with college degrees and the bulk of Europeans \u2014 because the world matters to them. And what is their predominant concern? Abandonment. Afghans have become deeply internationalist.You know, when I went back in December of 2001, I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government because I'd lived as a nationalist. And I told them \u2014 my people, with the Americans here \u2014 separate. Yes, I have an advisory position with the U.N. I went through 10 Afghan provinces very rapidly. And everybody was telling me it was a different world. You know, they engage. They see engagement, global engagement, as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people. And the thing that the ordinary Afghan is most concerned with is \u2014 Clare Lockhart is here, so I'll recite a discussion she had with an illiterate woman in Northern Afghanistan. And that woman said she didn't care whether she had food on her table. What she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future, where her children could really have a different life. That gives me hope. CA: How is Afghanistan going to provide alternative income to the many people who are making their living off the drugs trade?AG: Certainly. Well, the first is, instead of sending a billion dollars on drug eradication and paying it to a couple of security companies, they should give this hundred billion dollars to 50 of the most critically innovative companies in the world to ask them to create one million jobs. The key to the drug eradication is jobs. Look, there's a very little known fact: countries that have a legal average income per capita of 1,000 dollars don't produce drugs.Second, textile. Trade is the key, not aid. The U.S. and Europe should give us a zero percent tariff. The textile industry is incredibly mobile. If you want us to be able to compete with China and to attract investment, we could probably attract four to six billion dollars quite easily in the textile sector, if there was zero tariffs \u2014 would create the type of job. Cotton does not compete with opium; a t-shirt does. And we need to understand, it's the value chain. Look, the ordinary Afghan is sick and tired of hearing about microcredit. It is important, but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro-production want is global access. They don't want to sell to the charity bazaars that are only for foreigners \u2014 and the same bloody shirt embroidered time and again. What we want is a partnership with the Italian design firms. Yeah, we have the best embroiderers in the world! Why can't we do what was done with northern Italy? With the Put Out system? So I think economically, the critical issue really is to now think through.And what I will say here is that aid doesn't work. You know, the aid system is broken. The aid system does not have the knowledge, the vision, the ability. I'm all for it; after all, I raised a lot of it. Yeah, to be exact, you know, I managed to persuade the world that they had to give my country 27.5 billion. They didn't want to give us the money.CA: And it still didn't work?AG: No. It's not that it didn't work. It's that a dollar of private investment, in my judgment, is equal at least to 20 dollars of aid, in terms of the dynamic that it generates. Second is that one dollar of aid could be 10 cents; it could be 20 cents; or it could be four dollars. It depends on what form it comes, what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it. You know, the aid system, at first, was designed to benefit entrepreneurs of the developed countries, not to generate growth in the poor countries. And this is, again, one of those assumptions \u2014 the way car seats are an assumption that we've inherited in governments, and doors. You would think that the US government would not think that American firms needed subsidizing to function in developing countries, provide advice, but they do. There's an entire weight of history vis-a-vis aid that now needs to be reexamined. If the goal is to build states that can credibly take care of themselves \u2014 and I'm putting that proposition equally; you know I'm very harsh on my counterparts \u2014 aid must end in each country in a definable period. And every year there must be progress on mobilization of domestic revenue and generation of the economy.

assumptions into question,\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nand avoid doxa, the realm of the unquestioned,\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nthen we must be willing to subject our own assumptions\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nto debate and discussion.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nIt is in this spirit that I join into a discussion\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nof one of the critical issues of our time,\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nnamely, how to mobilize different forms of capital\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nfor the project of state building.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nTo put the assumptions very clearly:\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:57.958\ncapitalism, after 150 years, has become acceptable,\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nand so has democracy.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nIf we looked in the world of 1945\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nand looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nthey were the rare exception, not the norm.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nThe question now, however,\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nis both about which form of capitalism\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nand which type of democratic participation.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nBut we must acknowledge\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nthat this moment has brought about\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\na rare consensus of assumptions.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nAnd that provides the ground\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nfor a type of action,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nbecause consensus of each moment\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nallows us to act.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nAnd it is necessary, no matter how fragile\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nor how provisional our consensus,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nto be able to move forward.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nBut the majority of the world\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nneither benefits from capitalism\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nnor from democratic systems.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nMost of the globe\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nexperiences the state as repressive,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nas an organization that is concerned\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nabout denial of rights,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nabout denial of justice,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nrather than provision of it.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nAnd in terms of experience of capitalism,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nthere are two aspects\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nthat the rest of the globe experiences.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nFirst, extractive industry.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nBlood diamonds, smuggled emeralds,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\ntimber,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nthat is cut right from under the poorest.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nSecond is technical assistance.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nAnd technical assistance might shock you,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nbut it's the worst form\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nof -- today -- of the ugly face\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nof the developed world to the developing countries.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nTens of billions of dollars\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nare supposedly spent on building capacity\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nwith people who are paid up to 1,500 dollars a day,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nwho are incapable\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nof thinking creatively,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nor organically.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nNext assumption --\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nand of course the events of July 7,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nI express my deep sympathy, and before that, September 11 --\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nhave reminded us\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nwe do not live in three different worlds.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nWe live in one world.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nBut that's easily said.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nBut we are not dealing with the implications\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nof the one world that we are living in.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd that is that if we want to have one world,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nthis one world cannot be based\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\non huge pockets of exclusion,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nand then inclusion for some.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nWe must now finally come\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nto think about the premises\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nof a truly global world,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nin relationship to the regime of rights\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nand responsibilities and accountabilities\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nthat are truly global in scope.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nOtherwise we will be missing\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nthis open moment in history,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nwhere we have a consensus\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\non both the form of politics\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nand the form of economics.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nWhat is one of these organizations to pick?\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nWe have three critical terms:\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\neconomy,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\ncivil society\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nand the state.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nI will not deal with those first two, except to say\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nthat uncritical transfer of assumptions,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nfrom one context to another,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\ncan only make for disaster.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nEconomics\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\ntaught in most of the elite universities\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nare practically useless in my context.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nMy country is dominated\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nby drug economy and a mafia.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nTextbook economics does not work in my context,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nand I have very few recommendations from anybody\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nas to how to put together a legal economy.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nThe poverty of our knowledge\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nmust become the first basis\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nof moving forward,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nand not imposition of the framework\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nthat works on the basis of mathematical modeling,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nfor which I have enormous respect.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nMy colleagues at Johns Hopkins were among the best.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nSecond,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\ninstead of debating endlessly\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nabout what is the structure of the state,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nwhy don't we simplify\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nand say, what are a series of functions\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nthat the state in the 21st century must perform?\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nClare Lockhart and I are writing a book on this;\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nwe hope to share that much widely with --\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nand third is that we could actually construct an index\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nto measure comparatively\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nhow well these functions that we would agree on\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nare being performed in different places.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nSo what are these functions?\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nWe propose 10.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAnd it's legitimate monopoly of means of violence,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nadministrative control, management of public finances,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\ninvestment in human capital, provision of citizenship rights,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nprovision of infrastructure,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nmanagement of the tangible and intangible assets of the state\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nthrough regulation, creation of the market,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\ninternational agreements, including public borrowing,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nand then, most importantly, rule of law.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nI won't elaborate.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nI hope the questions will give me an opportunity.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nThis is a feasible goal,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nbasically because, contrary to widespread assumption,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nI would argue that we know how to do this.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nWho would have imagined that Germany\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nwould be either united or democratic today,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nif you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of 1943?\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nBut people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nand engaged in planning.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nAnd there are lots of other examples.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nNow in order to do this -- and this brings this group --\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nwe have to rethink the notion of capital.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nThe least important form of capital, in this project,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nis financial capital -- money.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nMoney is not capital in most of the developing countries.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nIt's just cash.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nBecause it lacks the institutional,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\norganizational, managerial forms\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nto turn it into capital.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nAnd what is required\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nis a combination of physical capital,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\ninstitutional capital, human capital --\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nand security, of course, is critical,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nbut so is information.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nNow, the issue that should concern us here --\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nand that's the challenge\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nthat I would like to pose to this group --\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nis again, it takes 16 years\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nin your countries\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nto produce somebody with a B.S. degree.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nIt takes 20 years\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nto produce somebody with a Ph.D.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nThe first challenge is to rethink,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nfundamentally,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nthe issue of the time.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nDo we need to repeat\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nthe modalities that we have inherited?\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nOur educational systems are inherited from the 19th century.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nWhat is it that we need to do fundamentally\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nto re-engage in a project,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nthat capital formation is rapid?\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nThe absolute majority of the world's population\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nare below 20,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nand they are growing larger and faster.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nThey need different ways\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nof being approached,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\ndifferent ways of being enfranchised,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\ndifferent ways of being skilled.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nAnd that's the first thing.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nSecond is, you're problem solvers,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nbut you're not engaging your global responsibility.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nYou've stayed away\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nfrom the problems of corruption.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nYou only want clean environments in which to function.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nBut if you don't think through the problems of corruption,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nwho will?\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nYou stay away from design for development.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nYou're great designers,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nbut your designs are selfish.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nIt's for your own immediate use.\n\n00:09:02.958 -->

We're entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space. In fact, we've regressed. We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always done. And that is, instinctively we've gone out and climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places, and found out later, maybe to our surprise, that that's the reason we survived. And I feel very strongly that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it's OK to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it. They need to look forward to exploration; they need to look forward to colonization; they need to look forward to breakthroughs. We need to inspire them, because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future.I'm particularly troubled that what NASA's doing right now with this new Bush doctrine to \u2014 for this next decade and a half \u2014 oh shoot, I screwed up. We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics.(Laughter)What we're looking forward to is \u2014(Applause)what we're looking forward to is not only the inspiration of our children, but the current plan right now is not really even allowing the most creative people in this country \u2014 the Boeing's and Lockheed's space engineers \u2014 to go out and take risks and try new stuff. We're going to go back to the moon ... 50 years later? And we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new. I'm really troubled by that. But anyway that's \u2014 the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today, though, is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later. That's the theme of my next 15 minutes here. And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young: three-year-olds, up to 12-, 14-year-olds. What they look at is the most important thing.Let's take a snapshot at aviation. And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period when marvelous things happened. It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said, \"Ooh, hey, I can do that.\" There's only a few people that have flown in early 1908. In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes, thousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection. Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today, but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes. There were probably at least 30,000 different things tried, and when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again. The ones that flew and landed OK because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition. So we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts, in that four-year time period, we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe, as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good. That has not happened at all in space flying. There's only been two concepts tried \u2014 two by the U.S. and one by the Russians.Well, who was inspired during that time period? Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation. And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation. Well, what happened when I was a little kid was \u2014 some pretty heavy stuff too. The jet age started: the missile age started. Von Braun was on there showing how to go to Mars \u2014 and this was before Sputnik. And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now. We thought there'd be animals there; we knew there were plants there; the colors change, right? But, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots and they've landed it only in the deserts.(Laughter)If you look at what happened \u2014 this little black line is as fast as man ever flew, and the red line is top-of-the-line military fighters and the blue line is commercial air transport. You notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid \u2014 and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try. Well, what did I do when I was a kid? I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and, well, we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes. I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War flight-testing airplanes for the Air Force. And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages. And some 3,000 of those are flying. Of course, one of them is around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '82, which is my company now. And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982. And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart.The most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet. Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service. We retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56. What? The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe, was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a \u2014 you know, it landed on the moon, take off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys \u2014 that's kind of cool. We've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '72. This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961. Three years, and we can't do that now. Crazy.Talk very briefly about innovation cycles, things that grow, have a lot of activity; they die out when they're replaced by something else. These things tend to happen every 25 years. 40 years long, with an overlap. You can put that statement on all kinds of different technologies. The interesting thing \u2014 by the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher-speed travel is the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here. These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958. Here's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it. You know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net. Computers were used for artillery first, then IRS. But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity, all the benefit from it. Private sector has to do it. Keep that in mind. I put down innovation \u2014 I've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none.The very first year, starting when Gagarin went in space, and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd, there were five manned space flights in the world \u2014 the very first year. In 2003, everyone that the United States sent to space was killed. There were only three or four flights in 2003. In 2004, there were only two flights: two Russian Soyuz flights to the international manned station. And I had to fly three in Mojave with my little group of a couple dozen people in order to get to a total of five, which was the number the same year back in 1961. There is no growth. There's no activity. There's no nothing.This is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne. This is a picture here taken from orbit. Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that. We know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now, do it safe enough \u2014 at least as safe as the early airlines \u2014 so that can be done. And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company.Well, first of all, what's going to happen next? The first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players. There's another one announced just last week. And it will be sub-orbital. And the reason it has to be sub-orbital is, there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit. The governments have been doing this \u2014 three governments have been doing this for 45 years, and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died. That's \u2014 You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record. It'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020. I can't tell you when this will start, because I don't want my competition to know my schedule. But I think once it does, we will find solutions, and very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit. And that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view. And that will be really cool. Because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere \u2014 you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want. Oh, it's going to be so much fun.(Laughter)OK. My critics say, \"Hey, Rutan's just spending a lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires. What's this? This is not a transportation system; it's just for fun.\" And I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking, well, wait a minute. I bought my first Apple computer in 1978 and I bought it because I could say, \"I got a computer at my house and you don't. 'What do you use it for?' Come over. It does Frogger.\" OK.(Laughter)Not the bank's computer or Lockheed's computer, but the home computer was for games. For a whole decade it was for fun \u2014 we didn't even know what it was for. But what happened, the fact that we had this big industry, big development, big improvement and capability and so on, and they get out there in enough homes \u2014 we were ripe for a new invention. And the inventor is in this audience. Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that, something that we used for a whole year \u2014 excuse me \u2014 a whole decade for fun, became everything \u2014 our commerce, our research, our communication and, if we let the Google guys think for another couple weekends, we can add a dozen more things to the list. (Laughter) And it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids that we didn't always have computers in our homes. So fun is defendable.OK, I want to show you kind of a busy chart, but in it is my prediction with what's going to happen. And in it also brings up another point, right here. There's a group of people that have come forward \u2014 and you don't know all of them \u2014 but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age, by us going to orbit and going to the moon here, right in this time period. Paul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family, which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing, Bob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack. These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area, and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something \u2014 but they're putting it in very \u2014 areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability, and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct.They were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that. There were a couple of examples here. The military fighters had a \u2014 highest-performance military airplane was the SR71. It went a whole life cycle, got too rusty to fly, and was taken out of service. The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel. It went a whole life cycle without competition, took out of service. And we're stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '50s.But something is out there to inspire our kids now. And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now, or if you've got a 10-year-old now. What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here. Relatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance military operational airplane. It's never happened before. The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes; why do you need something better? But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying sub-orbital flights to space, very soon \u2014 wait a minute, what's happening here, we'll have military fighters with sub-orbital capability, and I think very soon this. But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first. OK, I look forward to a new \"capitalist's space race,\" let's call it.You remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige, because we lost the first two milestones. We didn't lose them technically. The fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it \u2014 you can argue that's not a technical loss. Sputnik wasn't a technical loss, but it was a prestige loss. America \u2014 the world saw America as not being the leader in technology, and that was a very strong thing. And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin, not months or decades, or whatever. So we had the capability. But America lost. We lost. And because of that, we made a big jump to recover it.Well, again, what's interesting here is we've lost to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already. You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America \u2014 can't do it. You can buy it in Russia. You can fly with Russian hardware. This is available because a Russian space program is starving, and it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats. It's commercial. It can be defined as space tourism. They are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon, like Apollo 8 was done. 100 million bucks \u2014 hey, I can go to the moon. But, you know, would you have thought back in the '60s, when the space race was going on, that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware? And would you have thought, would the Russians have thought, that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware, the guys inside won't be Russians? Maybe it'll probably be a Japanese or an American billionaire? Well, that's weird: you know, it really is. But anyway, I think we need to beat them again.I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful, private space flight industry. Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter. The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde. And then they flew a few cargo flights, and took it out of service. I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered.OK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight. This little thing says here: five times what NASA's doing by 2020. I want to tell you, already there's about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion investment in private space flight that is not government at all \u2014 already, worldwide. If you read \u2014 if you Google it, you'll find about half of that money, but there's twice of that being committed out there \u2014 not spent yet, but being committed and planned for the next few years. Hey, that's pretty big. I'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be \u2014 and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost, or less \u2014 this is going to be very profitable. I predict, also, that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer spends for NASA's manned spacecraft work. And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15. And what that means is before we know it, the progress in human space flight, with no taxpayer dollars, will be at a level of about five times as much as the current NASA budgets for human space flight. And that is because it's us. It's private industry. You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff \u2014 and we've done it for a long time. The NACA, before NASA, never developed an airliner and never ran an airline. But NASA is developing the space liner, always has, and runs the only space line, OK. And we've shied away from it because we're afraid of it. But starting back in June of 2004, when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it, can get a start with it, everything changed after that time.OK, thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 4, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nI want to start off by saying, Houston, we have a problem.\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nWe're entering a second generation of no progress\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nin terms of human flight in space. In fact, we've regressed.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nWe stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nto go out and continue this very important thing\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nthat we as a species have always done.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nAnd that is, instinctively we've gone out\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nand climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places,\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nand found out later, maybe to our surprise, that that's the reason we survived.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nAnd I feel very strongly\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nthat it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nthat think that it's OK to look forward to a better version\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nof a cell phone with a video in it.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nThey need to look forward to exploration; they need to look forward to colonization;\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nthey need to look forward to breakthroughs.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nWe need to inspire them, because they need to lead us\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nand help us survive in the future.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nI'm particularly troubled that what NASA's doing right now with this new Bush doctrine\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nto -- for this next decade and a half -- oh shoot, I screwed up.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nWe have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nWhat we're looking forward to is --\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:41.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nwhat we're looking forward to\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nis not only the inspiration of our children,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nbut the current plan right now is not really even allowing\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nthe most creative people in this country -- the Boeing's and Lockheed's\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nspace engineers -- to go out and take risks and try new stuff.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nWe're going to go back to the moon ... 50 years later?\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nAnd we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nI'm really troubled by that. But anyway that's --\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nthe basis of the thing that I want to share with you today, though,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nis that right back to where we inspire people\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nwho will be our great leaders later.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nThat's the theme of my next 15 minutes here.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nAnd I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young:\n\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nthree-year-olds, up to 12-, 14-year-olds.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nWhat they look at is the most important thing.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nLet's take a snapshot at aviation.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nAnd there was a wonderful little short four-year time period\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nwhen marvelous things happened.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nIt started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:01.958\n\"Ooh, hey, I can do that.\" There's only a few people that have flown\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nin early 1908. In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nthousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nNow you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nbut there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nThere were probably at least 30,000 different things tried,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nand when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nThe ones that flew and landed OK\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nbecause there were no trained pilots\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nwho had good flying qualities by definition.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nSo we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nin that four-year time period, we invented the concepts\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nof the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nas we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nThat has not happened at all in space flying.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nThere's only been two concepts tried -- two by the U.S. and one by the Russians.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nWell, who was inspired during that time period?\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nAviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nwere the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nAnd I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nwas a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nWell, what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nThe jet age started: the missile age started. Von Braun was on there\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nshowing how to go to Mars -- and this was before Sputnik.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nAnd this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nthan it is now. We thought there'd be animals there;\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nwe knew there were plants there; the colors change, right?\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nBut, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nand they've landed it only in the deserts.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nIf you look at what happened -- this little black line is as fast as man ever flew,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nand the red line is top-of-the-line military fighters\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nand the blue line is commercial air transport.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nYou notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid --\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nand I think that had something to do with giving me the courage\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nto go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nWell, what did I do when I was a kid?\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nI didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nand, well, we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nI spent about seven years during the Vietnam War\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nflight-testing airplanes for the Air Force.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nAnd then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nthat people could build in their garages.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nAnd some 3,000 of those are flying. Of course, one of them\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nis around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '82,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nwhich is my company now.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAnd we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nAnd there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nThe most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nonly a dozen years after the first operational jet.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nStayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nWe retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56. What?\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nThe most impressive spaceship ever, I believe,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nwas a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a -- you know, it landed on the moon,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\ntake off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys --\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nthat's kind of cool.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nWe've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '72.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nThis thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nThree years, and we can't do that now. Crazy.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nTalk very briefly about innovation cycles, things that grow,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nhave a lot of activity; they die out when they're replaced by something else.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nThese things tend to happen every 25 years.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:50.958\n40 years long, with an overlap. You can put that statement\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\non all kinds of different technologies. The interesting thing --\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nby the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher-speed travel\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nis the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nThese two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nHere's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cycles\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nif the government develops and the government uses it.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nYou know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nComputers were used for artillery first, then IRS.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nBut when we got it, now you have all the level of activity,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nall the benefit from it. Private sector has to do it.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nKeep that in mind. I put down innovation --\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nI've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nThe very first year, starting when Gagarin went in space,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nand a few weeks later Alan Shepherd, there were five manned\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nspace flights in the world -- the very first year.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nIn 2003, everyone that the United States sent to space was killed.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nThere were only three or four flights in 2003.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nIn 2004, there were only two flights: two Russian Soyuz flights\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nto the international manned station. And I had to fly three in Mojave\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nwith my little group of a couple dozen people\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nin order to get to a total of five,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nwhich was the number the same year back in 1961.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nThere is no growth. There's no activity. There's no nothing.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nThis is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nThis is a picture here taken from orbit.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nOur goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nWe know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now, do it safe enough --\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nat least as safe as the early airlines -- so that can be done.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nAnd I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nto go out and try that as a small company.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nWell, first of all, what's going to happen next?\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nThe first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nThere's another one announced just last week.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nAnd it will be sub-orbital. And the reason it has to be sub-orbital\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nis, there is not solutions for adequate safety\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nto fly the public to orbit. The governments have been doing this --\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nthree governments have been doing this for 45 years,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nand still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nThat's -- You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nIt'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nI can't tell you when this will start,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nbecause I don't want my competition to know my schedule.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nBut I think once it does, we will find solutions,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nand very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nAnd that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nso you have this cool view. And that will be really cool.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nBecause the moon doesn't have an atmosphere --\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nyou can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nOh, it's going to be so much fun.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nOK. My critics say, \"Hey, Rutan's just spending\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:12.958\na lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nWhat's this? This is not a transportation system; it's just for fun.\"\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nAnd I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nwell, wait a minute. I bought my first Apple computer in 1978\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nand I bought it because I could say, \"I got a computer at my house and you don't.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:36.958\n'What do you use it for?' Come over. It does Frogger.\" OK.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nNot the bank's computer or Lockheed's computer,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nbut the home computer was for games.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nFor a whole decade it was for fun -- we didn't even know what it was for.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nBut what happened, the fact that we had this big industry,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nbig development, big improvement and capability and so on,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nand they get out there in enough homes -- we were ripe for a new invention.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nAnd the inventor is in this audience.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nAl Gore invented the Internet and because of that,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nsomething that we used for a whole year -- excuse me --\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:15.958\na whole decade for fun, became everything -- our commerce, our research,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nour communication and, if we let the Google guys\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nthink for another couple weekends, we can add a dozen more things to the list. (Laughter)\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nAnd it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nthat we didn't always have computers in our homes.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nSo fun is defendable.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nOK, I want to show you kind of a busy chart,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nbut in it is my prediction with what's going to happen.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nAnd in it also brings up another point, right here.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nThere's a group of people that have come forward --\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nand you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nwere inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nby us going to orbit and going to the moon here,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nright in this time period.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nPaul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family,\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nwhich is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nBob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nThese people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nand I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nof a better cell phone or something -- but they're putting it in very --\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nareas and this will lead us into this kind of capability,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nand it will lead us into the next really big thing\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nand it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nit will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nThey were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nThere were a couple of examples here.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nThe military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nwas the SR71. It went a whole life cycle, got too rusty to fly,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nand was taken out of service. The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nIt went a whole life cycle without competition,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\ntook out of service. And we're stuck back here\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nwith the same kind of capability for military fighters\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nand commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '50s.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nBut something is out there to inspire our kids now.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nAnd I'm talking about if you've got a baby now,\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nor if you've got a 10-year-old now.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nWhat's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nRelatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nand fly higher and faster than the highest-performance\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nmilitary operational airplane. It's never happened before.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nThe fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nhas been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes;\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nwhy do you need something better?\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nBut I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nsub-orbital flights to space, very soon -- wait a minute,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nwhat's happening here, we'll have military fighters\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nwith sub-orbital capability, and I think very soon this.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nBut the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nOK, I look forward to a new \"capitalist's space race,\" let's call it.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nYou remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nbecause we lost the first two milestones.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nWe didn't lose them technically. The fact that we had the hardware\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nto put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it --\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nyou can argue that's not a technical loss.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nSputnik wasn't a technical loss, but it was a prestige loss.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nAmerica -- the world saw America as not being the leader in technology,\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nand that was a very strong thing.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nAnd then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin,\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nnot months or decades, or whatever. So we had the capability.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nBut America lost. We lost. And because of that, we made a big jump to recover it.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nWell, again, what's interesting here is we've lost\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nto the Russians on the first couple of milestones already.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nYou cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America --\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:29.958\ncan't do it. You can buy it in Russia.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nYou can fly with Russian hardware. This is available\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nbecause a Russian space program is starving,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nand it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nIt's commercial. It can be defined as space tourism. They are also offering a trip\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nto go on this whip around the moon, like Apollo 8 was done.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\n100 million bucks -- hey, I can go to the moon.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nBut, you know, would you have thought back in the '60s,\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nwhen the space race was going on,\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nthat the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nto buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware?\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nAnd would you have thought, would the Russians have thought,\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nthat when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware,\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nthe guys inside won't be Russians? Maybe it'll probably be a Japanese\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nor an American billionaire? Well, that's weird: you know, it really is.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nBut anyway, I think we need to beat them again.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nI think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful,\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nprivate space flight industry. Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter.\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nThe Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nAnd then they flew a few cargo flights, and took it out of service.\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nI think you kind of see the same kind of parallel\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nwhen the commercial stuff is offered.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nOK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight.\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nThis little thing says here: five times\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nwhat NASA's doing by 2020. I want to tell you, already\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nthere's about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:21.958\ninvestment in private space flight that is not government at all --\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nalready, worldwide. If you read -- if you Google it,\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nyou'll find about half of that money, but there's twice of that\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nbeing committed out there -- not spent yet, but being committed\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nand planned for the next few years. Hey, that's pretty big.\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nI'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be --\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nand it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:49.958\non something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost,\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nor less -- this is going to be very profitable.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nI predict, also, that the investment that will flow into this\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nwill be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nspends for NASA's manned spacecraft work.\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nAnd every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nby a factor of 10 to 15. And what that means is before we know it,\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nthe progress in human space flight, with no taxpayer dollars,\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nwill be at a level of about five times as much\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nas the current NASA budgets for human space flight.\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nAnd that is because it's us. It's private industry.\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nYou should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff --\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:52.958\nand we've done it for a long time. The NACA, before NASA,\n\n00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nnever developed an airliner and never ran an airline.\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nBut NASA is developing the space liner, always has,\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nand runs the only space line, OK. And we've shied away from it\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:13.958\nbecause we're afraid of it. But starting back in June of 2004,\n\n00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nwhen I showed that a little group out there actually can do it,\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:21.958\ncan get a start with it, everything changed after that time.\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:23.958\nOK, thank you very much.\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:25.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why did I ski to the North Pole?", "duration": "1083", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ben_saunders_skis_to_the_north_pole", "transcript": "This is me. My name is Ben Saunders. I specialize in dragging heavy things around cold places.On May 11th last year, I stood alone at the North geographic Pole. I was the only human being in an area one-and-a-half times the size of America, five-and-a-half thousand square miles. More than 2,000 people have climbed Everest. 12 people have stood on the moon. Including me, only four people have skied solo to the North Pole. And I think the reason for that \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 thank you \u2014 I think the reason for that is that it's \u2014 it's \u2014 well, it's as Chris said, bonkers. It's a journey that is right at the limit of human capability. I skied the equivalent of 31 marathons back to back. 800 miles in 10 weeks. And I was dragging all the food I needed, the supplies, the equipment, sleeping bag, one change of underwear \u2014 everything I needed for nearly three months. (Laughter) What we're going to try and do today, in the 16 and a bit minutes I've got left, is to try and answer three questions. The first one is, why? The second one is, how do you go to the loo at minus 40? \"Ben, I've read somewhere that at minus 40, exposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute, so how do you answer the call of nature?\" I don't want to answer these now. I'll come on to them at the end. Third one: how do you top that? What's next?It all started back in 2001. My first expedition was with a guy called Pen Hadow \u2014 enormously experienced chap. This was like my polar apprenticeship. We were trying to ski from this group of islands up here, Severnaya Zemlya, to the North Pole. And the thing that fascinates me about the North Pole, geographic North Pole, is that it's slap bang in the middle of the sea. This is about as good as maps get, and to reach it you've got to ski literally over the frozen crust, the floating skin of ice on the Artic Ocean. I'd spoken to all the experts. I'd read lots of books. I studied maps and charts. But I realized on the morning of day one that I had no idea exactly what I'd let myself in for.I was 23 years old. No one my age had attempted anything like this, and pretty quickly, almost everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong. We were attacked by a polar bear on day two. I had frostbite in my left big toe. We started running very low on food. We were both pretty hungry, losing lots of weight. Some very unusual weather conditions, very difficult ice conditions. We had decidedly low-tech communications. We couldn't afford a satellite phone, so we had HF radio. You can see two ski poles sticking out of the roof of the tent. There's a wire dangling down either side. That was our HF radio antenna. We had less than two hours two-way communication with the outside world in two months. Ultimately, we ran out of time. We'd skied 400 miles. We were just over 200 miles left to go to the Pole, and we'd run out of time. We were too late into the summer; the ice was starting to melt; we spoke to the Russian helicopter pilots on the radio, and they said, \"Look boys, you've run out of time. We've got to pick you up.\" And I felt that I had failed, wholeheartedly. I was a failure.The one goal, the one dream I'd had for as long as I could remember \u2014 I hadn't even come close. And skiing along that first trip, I had two imaginary video clips that I'd replay over and over again in my mind when the going got tough, just to keep my motivation going. The first one was reaching the Pole itself. I could see vividly, I suppose, being filmed out of the door of a helicopter, there was, kind of, rock music playing in the background, and I had a ski pole with a Union Jack, you know, flying in the wind. I could see myself sticking the flag in a pole, you know \u2014 ah, glorious moment \u2014 the music kind of reaching a crescendo. The second video clip that I imagined was getting back to Heathrow airport, and I could see again, vividly, the camera flashbulbs going off, the paparazzi, the autograph hunters, the book agents coming to sign me up for a deal. And of course, neither of these things happened. We didn't get to the Pole, and we didn't have any money to pay anyone to do the PR, so no one had heard of this expedition.And I got back to Heathrow. My mum was there; my brother was there; my granddad was there \u2014 had a little Union Jack \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 and that was about it. I went back to live with my mum. I was physically exhausted, mentally an absolute wreck, considered myself a failure. In a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition, and lying on my mum's sofa, day in day out, watching daytime TV. My brother sent me a text message, an SMS \u2014 it was a quote from the \"Simpsons.\" It said, \"You tried your hardest and failed miserably. The lesson is: don't even try.\" (Laughter)Fast forward three years. I did eventually get off the sofa, and start planning another expedition. This time, I wanted to go right across, on my own this time, from Russia, at the top of the map, to the North Pole, where the sort of kink in the middle is, and then on to Canada. No one has made a complete crossing of the Arctic Ocean on their own. Two Norwegians did it as a team in 2000. No one's done it solo. Very famous, very accomplished Italian mountaineer, Reinhold Messner, tried it in 1995, and he was rescued after a week. He described this expedition as 10 times as dangerous as Everest. So for some reason, this was what I wanted to have a crack at, but I knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece, let alone make it across to Canada, I had to take a radical approach. This meant everything from perfecting the sawn-off, sub-two-gram toothbrush, to working with one of the world's leading nutritionists in developing a completely new, revolutionary nutritional strategy from scratch: 6,000 calories a day.And the expedition started in February last year. Big support team. We had a film crew, a couple of logistics people with us, my girlfriend, a photographer. At first it was pretty sensible. We flew British Airways to Moscow. The next bit in Siberia to Krasnoyarsk, on a Russian internal airline called KrasAir, spelled K-R-A-S. The next bit, we'd chartered a pretty elderly Russian plane to fly us up to a town called Khatanga, which was the sort of last bit of civilization. Our cameraman, who it turned out was a pretty nervous flier at the best of times, actually asked the pilot, before we got on the plane, how long this flight would take, and the pilot \u2014 Russian pilot \u2014 completely deadpan, replied, \"Six hours \u2014 if we live.\" (Laughter) We got to Khatanga. I think the joke is that Khatanga isn't the end of the world, but you can see it from there. (Laughter) It was supposed to be an overnight stay. We were stuck there for 10 days. There was a kind of vodka-fueled pay dispute between the helicopter pilots and the people that owned the helicopter, so we were stuck. We couldn't move. Finally, morning of day 11, we got the all-clear, loaded up the helicopters \u2014 two helicopters flying in tandem \u2014 dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice. We had a frantic sort of 45 minutes of filming, photography; while the helicopter was still there, I did an interview on the satellite phone; and then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter, wham, the door closed, and I was alone.And I don't know if words will ever quite do that moment justice. All I could think about was running back up to the door, banging on the door, and saying, \"Look guys, I haven't quite thought this through.\" (Laughter) To make things worse, you can just see the white dot up at the top right hand side of the screen; that's a full moon.Because we'd been held up in Russia, of course, the full moon brings the highest and lowest tides; when you're standing on the frozen surface of the sea, high and low tides generally mean that interesting things are going to happen \u2014 the ice is going to start moving around a bit. I was, you can see there, pulling two sledges. Grand total in all, 95 days of food and fuel, 180 kilos \u2014 that's almost exactly 400 pounds. When the ice was flat or flattish, I could just about pull both. When the ice wasn't flat, I didn't have a hope in hell. I had to pull one, leave it, and go back and get the other one. Literally scrambling through what's called pressure ice \u2014 the ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean, the wind and the tides. NASA described the ice conditions last year as the worst since records began. And it's always drifting. The pack ice is always drifting. I was skiing into headwinds for nine out of the 10 weeks I was alone last year, and I was drifting backwards most of the time. My record was minus 2.5 miles. I got up in the morning, took the tent down, skied north for seven-and-a-half hours, put the tent up, and I was two and a half miles further back than when I'd started. I literally couldn't keep up with the drift of the ice.(Video): So it's day 22. I'm lying in the tent, getting ready to go. The weather is just appalling \u2014 oh, drifted back about five miles in the last \u2014 last night. Later in the expedition, the problem was no longer the ice. It was a lack of ice \u2014 open water. I knew this was happening. I knew the Artic was warming. I knew there was more open water. And I had a secret weapon up my sleeve. This was my little bit of bio-mimicry. Polar bears on the Artic Ocean move in dead straight lines. If they come to water, they'll climb in, swim across it. So we had a dry suit developed \u2014 I worked with a team in Norway \u2014 based on a sort of survival suit \u2014 I suppose, that helicopter pilots would wear \u2014 that I could climb into. It would go on over my boots, over my mittens, it would pull up around my face,  and seal pretty tightly around my face. And this meant I could ski over very thin ice, and if I fell through, it wasn't the end of the world. It also meant, if the worst came to the worst, I could actually jump in and swim across and drag the sledge over after me. Some pretty radical technology, a radical approach \u2014but it worked perfectly.Another exciting thing we did last year was with communications technology. In 1912, Shackleton's Endurance expedition \u2014 there was \u2014 one of his crew, a guy called Thomas Orde-Lees. He said, \"The explorers of 2012, if there is anything left to explore, will no doubt carry pocket wireless telephones fitted with wireless telescopes.\" Well, Orde-Lees guessed wrong by about eight years. This is my pocket wireless telephone, Iridium satellite phone. The wireless telescope was a digital camera I had tucked in my pocket. And every single day of the 72 days I was alone on the ice, I was blogging live from my tent, sending back a little diary piece, sending back information on the distance I'd covered \u2014 the ice conditions, the temperature \u2014 and a daily photo. Remember, 2001, we had less than two hours radio contact with the outside world. Last year, blogging live from an expedition that's been described as 10 times as dangerous as Everest. It wasn't all high-tech. This is navigating in what's called a whiteout. When you get lots of mist, low cloud, the wind starts blowing the snow up. You can't see an awful lot. You can just see, there's a yellow ribbon tied to one of my ski poles. I'd navigate using the direction of the wind. So, kind of a weird combination of high-tech and low-tech.I got to the Pole on the 11th of May. It took me 68 days to get there from Russia, and there is nothing there. (Laughter). There isn't even a pole at the Pole. There's nothing there, purely because it's sea ice. It's drifting. Stick a flag there, leave it there, pretty soon it will drift off, usually towards Canada or Greenland. I knew this, but I was expecting something. Strange mixture of feelings: it was extremely warm by this stage, a lot of open water around, and of course, elated that I'd got there under my own steam, but starting to really realize that my chances of making it all the way across to Canada, which was still 400 miles away, were slim at best. The only proof I've got that I was there is a blurry photo of my GPS, the little satellite navigation gadget. You can just see \u2014 there's a nine and a string of zeros here. Ninety degrees north \u2014 that is slap bang in the North Pole. I took a photo of that. Sat down on my sledge. Did a sort of video diary piece. Took a few photos. I got my satellite phone out. I warmed the battery up in my armpit. I dialed three numbers. I dialed my mum. I dialed my girlfriend. I dialed the CEO of my sponsor. And I got three voicemails. (Laughter) (Video): Ninety. It's a special feeling. The entire planet is rotating beneath my feet. The \u2014 the whole world underneath me. I finally got through to my mum. She was at the queue of the supermarket. She started crying. She asked me to call her back. (Laughter)I skied on for a week past the Pole. I wanted to get as close to Canada as I could before conditions just got too dangerous to continue. This was the last day I had on the ice. When I spoke to the \u2014 my project management team, they said, \"Look, Ben, conditions are getting too dangerous. There are huge areas of open water just south of your position. We'd like to pick you up. Ben, could you please look for an airstrip?\" This was the view outside my tent when I had this fateful phone call. I'd never tried to build an airstrip before. Tony, the expedition manager, he said, \"Look Ben, you've got to find 500 meters of flat, thick safe ice.\" The only bit of ice I could find \u2014 it took me 36 hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip \u2014 was exactly 473 meters. I could measure it with my skis. I didn't tell Tony that. I didn't tell the pilots that. I thought, it'll have to do. (Video): Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.It just about worked. A pretty dramatic landing \u2014 the plane actually passed over four times, and I was a bit worried it wasn't going to land at all. The pilot, I knew, was called Troy. I was expecting someone called Troy that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy. I was bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed \u2014 a pretty emotional moment. So I thought, I've got to compose myself for Troy. I'm supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type. The plane taxied up to where I was standing. The door opened. This guy jumped out. He's about that tall. He said, \"Hi, my name is Troy.\" (Laughter). The co-pilot was a lady called Monica. She sat there in a sort of hand-knitted jumper. They were the least macho people I've ever met, but they made my day. Troy was smoking a cigarette on the ice; we took a few photos. He climbed up the ladder. He said, \"Just \u2014 just get in the back.\" He threw his cigarette out as he got on the front, and I climbed in the back. (Laughter) Taxied up and down the runway a few times, just to flatten it out a bit, and he said, \"Right, I'm going to \u2014 I'm going to give it a go.\" And he \u2014 I've now learned that this is standard practice, but it had me worried at the time. He put his hand on the throttle. You can see the control for the engines is actually on the roof of the cockpit. It's that little bar there. He put his hand on the throttle. Monica very gently put her hand sort of on top of his. I thought, \"God, here we go. We're, we're \u2014 this is all or nothing.\" Rammed it forwards. Bounced down the runway. Just took off. One of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway, banking. I could see into the cockpit, Troy battling the controls, and he just took one hand off, reached back, flipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit, and it was the \"fasten seat belt\" sign you can see on the wall. (Laughter) And only from the air did I see the big picture. Of course, when you're on the ice, you only ever see one obstacle at a time, whether it's a pressure ridge or there's a bit of water. This is probably why I didn't get into trouble about the length of my airstrip. I mean, it really was starting to break up.Why? I'm not an explorer in the traditional sense. I'm not skiing along drawing maps; everyone knows where the North Pole is. At the South Pole there's a big scientific base. There's an airstrip. There's a cafe and there's a tourist shop. For me, this is about exploring human limits, about exploring the limits of physiology, of psychology and of technology. They're the things that excite me. And it's also about potential, on a personal level. This, for me, is a chance to explore the limits \u2014 really push the limits of my own potential, see how far they stretch. And on a wider scale, it amazes me how people go through life just scratching the surface of their potential, just doing three or four or five percent of what they're truly capable of. So, on a wider scale, I hope that this journey was a chance to inspire other people to think about what they want to do with their potential, and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time we each have on this planet. That's as close as I can come to summing that up.The next question is, how do you answer the call of nature at minus 40? The answer, of course, to which is a trade secret \u2014 and the last question, what's next? As quickly as possible, if I have a minute left at the end, I'll go into more detail. What's next: Antarctica. It's the coldest, highest, windiest and driest continent on Earth. Late 1911, early 1912, there was a race to be the first to the South Pole: the heart of the Antarctic continent. If you include the coastal ice shelves, you can see that the Ross Ice Shelf \u2014 it's the big one down here \u2014 the Ross Ice Shelf is the size of France. Antarctica, if you include the ice shelves, is twice the size of Australia \u2014 it's a big place. And there's a race to get to the Pole between Amundsen, the Norwegian \u2014 Amundsen had dog sleds and huskies \u2014 and Scott, the British guy, Captain Scott. Scott had sort of ponies and some tractors and a few dogs, all of which went wrong, and Scott and his team of four people ended up on foot. They got to the Pole late January 1912 to find a Norwegian flag already there. There was a tent, a letter to the Norwegian king. And they turned around, headed back to the coast, and all five of them died on the return journey. Since then, no one has ever skied \u2014 this was 93 years ago \u2014 since then, no one has ever skied from the coast of Antarctica to the Pole and back. Every South Pole expedition you may have heard about is either flown out from the Pole or has used vehicles or dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing \u2014 no one has ever made a return journey. So that's the plan. Two of us are doing it. That's pretty much it.One final thought before I get to the toilet bit, is \u2014 is, I have a \u2014 and I meant to scan this and I've forgotten \u2014 but I have a \u2014 I have a school report. I was 13 years old, and it's framed above my desk at home. It says, \"Ben lacks sufficient impetus to achieve anything worthwhile.\" (Laughter) (Applause) I think if I've learned anything, it's this: that no one else is the authority on your potential. You're the only person that decides how far you go and what you're capable of. Ladies and gentlemen, that's my story.

What's next?\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nIt all started back in 2001.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nMy first expedition was with a guy called Pen Hadow -- enormously experienced chap.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nThis was like my polar apprenticeship.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nWe were trying to ski from this group of islands up here,\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nSevernaya Zemlya, to the North Pole.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nAnd the thing that fascinates me about the North Pole,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\ngeographic North Pole, is that it's slap bang in the middle of the sea.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nThis is about as good as maps get,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nand to reach it you've got to ski literally\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nover the frozen crust,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nthe floating skin of ice on the Artic Ocean.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nI'd spoken to all the experts.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nI'd read lots of books. I studied maps and charts.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nBut I realized on the morning of day one\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nthat I had no idea exactly\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nwhat I'd let myself in for.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nI was 23 years old. No one my age\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nhad attempted anything like this,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nand pretty quickly, almost everything\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nthat could have gone wrong did go wrong.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nWe were attacked by a polar bear on day two.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nI had frostbite in my left big toe.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nWe started running very low on food. We were both pretty hungry, losing lots of weight.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nSome very unusual weather conditions, very difficult ice conditions.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nWe had\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\ndecidedly low-tech communications.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nWe couldn't afford a satellite phone, so we had HF radio.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nYou can see two ski poles sticking out of the roof of the tent.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nThere's a wire dangling down either side.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nThat was our HF radio antenna.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nWe had less than two hours\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\ntwo-way communication with the outside world in two months.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nUltimately, we ran out of time.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nWe'd skied 400 miles. We were just over 200 miles left\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nto go to the Pole, and we'd run out of time.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nWe were too late into the summer; the ice was starting to melt;\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nwe spoke to the Russian helicopter pilots on the radio,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nand they said, \"Look boys, you've run out of time.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nWe've got to pick you up.\"\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nAnd I felt that I had failed, wholeheartedly.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nI was a failure.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nThe one goal, the one dream I'd had\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nfor as long as I could remember -- I hadn't even come close.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nAnd skiing along that first trip, I had two\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nimaginary video clips that I'd replay over and over again in my mind\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nwhen the going got tough, just to keep my motivation going.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nThe first one was reaching the Pole itself.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nI could see vividly, I suppose,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nbeing filmed out of the door of a helicopter, there was, kind of, rock music playing in the background,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nand I had a ski pole with a Union Jack, you know, flying in the wind.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nI could see myself sticking the flag in a pole, you know --\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nah, glorious moment -- the music kind of reaching a crescendo.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nThe second video clip\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nthat I imagined was getting back to Heathrow airport,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nand I could see again, vividly,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nthe camera flashbulbs going off,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nthe paparazzi, the autograph hunters,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nthe book agents coming to sign me up for a deal.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nAnd of course, neither of these things happened.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nWe didn't get to the Pole, and we didn't have any money\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nto pay anyone to do the PR, so no one had heard\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nof this expedition.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nAnd I got back to Heathrow. My mum was there; my brother was there;\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nmy granddad was there -- had a little Union Jack --\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\n-- and that was about it. I went back to live with my mum.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nI was physically exhausted,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nmentally an absolute wreck, considered myself a failure.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nIn a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nand lying on my mum's sofa,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nday in day out, watching daytime TV.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nMy brother sent me a text message, an SMS --\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nit was a quote from the \"Simpsons.\" It said,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\n\"You tried your hardest and failed miserably.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nThe lesson is: don't even try.\"\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nFast forward three years. I did eventually get off the sofa,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nand start planning another expedition. This time,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nI wanted to go right across, on my own this time,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nfrom Russia, at the top of the map,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nto the North Pole, where the sort of kink in the middle is,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nand then on to Canada.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nNo one has made a complete crossing of the Arctic Ocean on their own.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nTwo Norwegians did it as a team in 2000. No one's done it solo.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nVery famous, very accomplished Italian mountaineer,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nReinhold Messner, tried it in 1995,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nand he was rescued after a week.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nHe described this expedition as 10 times\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nas dangerous as Everest.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nSo for some reason, this was what I wanted to have a crack at,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nbut I knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nlet alone make it across to Canada,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nI had to take a radical approach.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nThis meant everything from perfecting the\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nsawn-off, sub-two-gram toothbrush,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nto working with one of the world's leading nutritionists\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nin developing a completely new,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nrevolutionary nutritional strategy from scratch:\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\n6,000 calories a day.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nAnd the expedition started in February last year.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nBig support team. We had a film crew,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\na couple of logistics people with us,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nmy girlfriend, a photographer.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nAt first it was pretty sensible. We flew British Airways to Moscow.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nThe next bit in Siberia to Krasnoyarsk,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\non a Russian internal airline called KrasAir,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nspelled K-R-A-S.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nThe next bit, we'd chartered a pretty elderly Russian plane\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nto fly us up to a town called Khatanga,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nwhich was the sort of last bit of civilization.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nOur cameraman, who it turned out was a pretty nervous flier at the best of times,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nactually asked the pilot, before we got on the plane, how long this flight would take,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nand the pilot -- Russian pilot -- completely deadpan, replied,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\n\"Six hours -- if we live.\"\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nWe got to Khatanga.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nI think the joke is that Khatanga isn't the end of the world,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nbut you can see it from there.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nIt was supposed to be an overnight stay. We were stuck there for 10 days.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nThere was a kind of vodka-fueled pay dispute between\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nthe helicopter pilots and the people that owned the helicopter,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nso we were stuck. We couldn't move.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nFinally, morning of day 11, we got the all-clear,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nloaded up the helicopters -- two helicopters flying in tandem --\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\ndropped me off at the edge of the pack ice.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nWe had a frantic sort of 45 minutes of filming,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nphotography; while the helicopter was still there,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nI did an interview on the satellite phone;\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nand then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nwham, the door closed, and I was alone.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nAnd I don't know if words will ever quite do that moment justice.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAll I could think about was running back up to the door,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nbanging on the door, and saying, \"Look guys,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nI haven't quite thought this through.\"\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:11.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nTo make things worse, you can just see the white dot\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nup at the top right hand side of the screen; that's a full moon.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nBecause we'd been held up in Russia, of course,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nthe full moon brings the highest and lowest tides;\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nwhen you're standing on the frozen surface of the sea,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nhigh and low tides generally mean\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nthat interesting things are going to happen -- the ice is going to start moving around a bit.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nI was, you can see there, pulling two sledges.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nGrand total in all, 95 days of food and fuel,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\n180 kilos -- that's almost exactly 400 pounds.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nWhen the ice was flat or flattish,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nI could just about pull both.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nWhen the ice wasn't flat, I didn't have a hope in hell.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nI had to pull one, leave it, and go back and get the other one.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nLiterally scrambling through what's called pressure ice --\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nthe ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nthe wind and the tides.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nNASA described the ice conditions last year as the worst since records began.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nAnd it's always drifting. The pack ice is always drifting.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nI was skiing into headwinds for nine\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nout of the 10 weeks I was alone last year,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nand I was drifting backwards most of the time.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nMy record was minus 2.5 miles.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nI got up in the morning, took the tent down, skied north for seven-and-a-half hours,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nput the tent up, and I was two and a half miles further back\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nthan when I'd started.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nI literally couldn't keep up with the drift of the ice.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\n(Video): So it's day 22.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nI'm lying in the tent, getting ready to go.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nThe weather is just appalling --\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\noh, drifted back about five miles\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nin the last -- last night.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nLater in the expedition, the problem was no longer the ice.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nIt was a lack of ice -- open water.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nI knew this was happening. I knew the Artic was warming.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nI knew there was more open water. And I had a secret weapon up my sleeve.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nThis was my little bit of bio-mimicry.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nPolar bears on the Artic Ocean move in dead straight lines.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nIf they come to water, they'll climb in, swim across it.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nSo we had a dry suit developed -- I worked with a team in Norway --\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nbased on a sort of survival suit --\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nI suppose, that helicopter pilots would wear --\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nthat I could climb into. It would go on over my boots, over my mittens,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nit would pull up around my face, \nand seal pretty tightly around my face.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nAnd this meant I could ski\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nover very thin ice,\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nand if I fell through, it wasn't the end of the world.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nIt also meant, if the worst came to the worst,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nI could actually jump in and swim across\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nand drag the sledge over after me.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nSome pretty radical technology,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\na radical approach --but it worked perfectly.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nAnother exciting thing we did last year\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nwas with communications technology.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nIn 1912, Shackleton's Endurance expedition --\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nthere was -- one of his crew, a guy called Thomas Orde-Lees.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nHe said, \"The explorers of 2012,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nif there is anything left to explore,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nwill no doubt carry pocket wireless telephones\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nfitted with wireless telescopes.\"\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nWell, Orde-Lees guessed wrong by about eight years. This is my pocket wireless telephone,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nIridium satellite phone.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nThe wireless telescope was a digital camera I had tucked in my pocket.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nAnd every single day of the 72 days I was alone on the ice,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nI was blogging live from my tent,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nsending back a little diary piece,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nsending back information on the distance I'd covered --\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nthe ice conditions, the temperature --\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nand a daily photo.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nRemember, 2001,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nwe had less than two hours radio contact with the outside world.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nLast year, blogging live from an expedition\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nthat's been described as 10 times as dangerous as Everest.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nIt wasn't all high-tech. This is navigating\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nin what's called a whiteout.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nWhen you get lots of mist, low cloud, the wind starts blowing the snow up.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nYou can't see an awful lot. You can just see, there's a yellow\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nribbon tied to one of my ski poles.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nI'd navigate using the direction of the wind.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nSo, kind of a weird combination of high-tech and low-tech.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nI got to the Pole on the 11th of May.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nIt took me 68 days to get there from Russia,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nand there is nothing there.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\n(Laughter).\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nThere isn't even a pole at the Pole. There's nothing there,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\npurely because it's sea ice. It's drifting.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nStick a flag there, leave it there, pretty soon it will drift off, usually towards Canada or Greenland.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nI knew this, but I was expecting something.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nStrange mixture of feelings: it was extremely warm by this stage,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\na lot of open water around, and\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nof course, elated that I'd got there under my own steam,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nbut starting to really realize\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nthat my chances of making it all the way across to Canada,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nwhich was still 400 miles away,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nwere slim at best.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nThe only proof I've got that I was there\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nis a blurry photo of my GPS, the little satellite navigation gadget.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nYou can just see --\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nthere's a nine and a string of zeros here.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nNinety degrees north -- that is slap bang in the North Pole.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nI took a photo of that. Sat down on my sledge. Did a sort of video diary piece.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nTook a few photos. I got my satellite phone out.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nI warmed the battery up in my armpit.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nI dialed three numbers. I dialed my mum.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nI dialed my girlfriend. I dialed the CEO of my sponsor.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nAnd I got three voicemails.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\n(Video): Ninety.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nIt's a special feeling.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nThe entire planet\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nis rotating\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nbeneath my feet.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nThe -- the whole world underneath me.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nI finally got through to my mum. She was at the queue of the supermarket.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nShe started crying. She asked me to call her back.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:17.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nI skied on for a week past the Pole.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nI wanted to get as close to Canada as I could\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nbefore conditions just got too dangerous to continue.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nThis was the last day I had on the ice.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nWhen I spoke to the -- my project management team,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nthey said, \"Look, Ben, conditions are getting too dangerous.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nThere are huge areas of open water just south of your position.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nWe'd like to pick you up.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nBen, could you please look for an airstrip?\"\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nThis was the view outside my tent\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nwhen I had this fateful phone call.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nI'd never tried to build an airstrip before. Tony, the expedition manager, he said,\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\n\"Look Ben, you've got to find 500 meters of\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nflat, thick safe ice.\"\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nThe only bit of ice I could find --\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nit took me 36 hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip --\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nwas exactly 473 meters. I could measure it with my skis.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nI didn't tell Tony that. I didn't tell the pilots that.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nI thought, it'll have to do.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\n(Video): Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nIt just about worked. A pretty dramatic landing --\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nthe plane actually passed over four times,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nand I was a bit worried it wasn't going to land at all.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nThe pilot, I knew, was called Troy. I was expecting someone called Troy\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nthat did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nI was bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed -- a pretty emotional moment.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nSo I thought, I've got to compose myself for Troy.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nI'm supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nThe plane taxied up to where I was standing.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nThe door opened. This guy jumped out. He's about that tall. He said, \"Hi, my name is Troy.\"\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\n(Laughter).\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nThe co-pilot was a lady called Monica.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nShe sat there in a sort of hand-knitted jumper.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nThey were the least macho people I've ever met, but they made my day.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nTroy was smoking a cigarette on the ice;\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nwe took a few photos. He\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nclimbed up the ladder. He said, \"Just -- just get in the back.\"\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nHe threw his cigarette out as he got on the front,\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nand I climbed in the back.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nTaxied up and down the runway a few times,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\njust to flatten it out a bit, and he said, \"Right, I'm going to --\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nI'm going to give it a go.\" And he --\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nI've now learned that this is standard practice, but it had me worried at the time.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nHe put his hand on the throttle.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nYou can see the control for the engines is actually on the roof of the cockpit.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nIt's that little bar there. He put his hand on the throttle.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nMonica very gently put her hand sort of on top of his.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nI thought, \"God, here we go. We're, we're -- this is all or nothing.\"\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nRammed it forwards. Bounced down the runway. Just took off.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nOne of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nbanking. I could see into the cockpit, Troy battling the controls,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nand he just took one hand off, reached back,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nflipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nand it was the \"fasten seat belt\" sign you can see on the wall.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nAnd only from the air did I see the big picture.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nOf course, when you're on the ice, you only ever see one obstacle at a time,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nwhether it's a pressure ridge or there's a bit of water.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nThis is probably why I didn't get into trouble about the length of my airstrip.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nI mean, it really was starting to break up.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nWhy? I'm not an explorer in the traditional sense.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nI'm not skiing along drawing maps;\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\neveryone knows where the North Pole is.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nAt the South Pole there's a big scientific base. There's an airstrip.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nThere's a cafe and there's a tourist shop.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nFor me, this is about exploring human limits,\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nabout exploring the limits of physiology, of psychology\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nand of technology. They're the things that excite me.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nAnd it's also about potential, on a personal level.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nThis, for me, is a chance to explore the limits --\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nreally push the limits of my own potential, see how far they stretch.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nAnd on a wider scale, it amazes me how people go through life\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\njust scratching the surface of their potential,\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\njust doing three or four or five percent\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nof what they're truly capable of. So,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\non a wider scale, I hope that this journey\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nwas a chance to inspire other people\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nto think about what they want to do\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nwith their potential, and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nwe each have on this planet.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nThat's as close as I can come to summing that up.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nThe next question is, how do you answer the call of nature at minus 40?\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nThe answer, of course, to which is a trade secret --\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nand the last question,\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nwhat's next? As quickly as possible,\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nif I have a minute left at the end, I'll go into more detail.\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nWhat's next:\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nAntarctica.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nIt's the coldest, highest,\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nwindiest and driest continent on Earth.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nLate 1911, early 1912,\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nthere was a race to be the first\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nto the South Pole: the heart of the Antarctic continent.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nIf you include the coastal ice shelves, you can see that the Ross Ice Shelf --\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nit's the big one down here -- the Ross Ice Shelf is the size of France.\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nAntarctica, if you include the ice shelves,\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nis twice the size of Australia -- it's a big place.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nAnd there's a race to get to the Pole between Amundsen,\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nthe Norwegian -- Amundsen had dog sleds and huskies --\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nand Scott, the British guy, Captain Scott.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nScott had sort of ponies and some tractors\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nand a few dogs, all of which went wrong,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nand Scott and his team of four people ended up on foot.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nThey got to the Pole late January 1912\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nto find a Norwegian flag already there.\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nThere was a tent, a letter to the Norwegian king.\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nAnd they turned around, headed back to the coast,\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nand all five of them died on the return journey.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nSince then, no one has ever skied --\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nthis was 93 years ago -- since then, no one has ever skied\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nfrom the coast of Antarctica to the Pole and back.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nEvery South Pole expedition you may have heard about\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nis either flown out from the Pole or has used vehicles\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nor dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing --\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nno one has ever made a return journey. So that's the plan.\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nTwo of us are doing it.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nThat's pretty much it.\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nOne final thought before I get to the toilet bit, is --\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nis, I have a -- and I meant to scan this and I've forgotten --\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nbut I have a -- I have a school report. I was 13 years old,\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nand it's framed above my desk at home. It says,\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:40.958\n\"Ben lacks sufficient impetus\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nto achieve anything worthwhile.\"\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:47.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nI think if I've learned anything, it's this: that no one else\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nis the authority on your potential.\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nYou're the only person that decides how far you go and what you're capable of.\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nLadies and gentlemen, that's my story.\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nThank you very much."}, {"title": "My wish: Three actions for Africa", "duration": "1672", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/bono_s_call_to_action_for_africa", "transcript": "Well, as Alexander Graham Bell famously said on his first successful telephone call, \"Hello, is that Domino's Pizza?\" (Laughter) I just really want to thank you very much. As another famous man, Jerry Garcia, said, \"What a strange, long trip.\" And he should have said, \"What a strange, long trip it's about to become.\" At this very moment, you are viewing my upper half. My lower half is appearing at a different conference (Laughter) in a different country. You can, it turns out, be in two places at once. But still, I'm sorry I can't be with you in person. I'll explain at another time.And though I'm a rock star, I just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub. But what really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on MP3 players. The revolution \u2014 this revolution \u2014 is much bigger than that. I hope, I believe. What turns me on about the digital age, what excites me personally, is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing. You see, it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song, you needed a studio and a producer. Now, you need a laptop. If you wanted to make a film, you needed a mass of equipment and a Hollywood budget. Now, you need a camera that fits in your palm, and a couple of bucks for a blank DVD. Imagination has been decoupled from the old constraints. And that really, really excites me. I'm excited when I glimpse that kind of thinking writ large.What I would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints. Political, economic, psychological, whatever. The geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world. From the ease with which you swept away obstacles that no one knew could even be budged. And that's actually what I'd like to talk about today. First, though, I should probably explain why, and how, I got to this place. It's a journey that started 20 years ago. You may remember that song, \"We Are the World,\" or, \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" Band Aid, Live Aid. Another very tall, grizzled rock star, my friend Sir Bob Geldof, issued a challenge to \"feed the world.\" It was a great moment, and it utterly changed my life. That summer, my wife, Ali, and myself went to Ethiopia. We went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on. We lived in Ethiopia for a month, working at an orphanage. The children had a name for me. They called me, \"The girl with the beard.\"(Laughter)Don't ask. Anyway, we found Africa to be a magical place. Big skies, big hearts, big, shining continent. Beautiful, royal people. Anybody who ever gave anything to Africa got a lot more back. Ethiopia didn't just blow my mind; it opened my mind. Anyway, on our last day at this orphanage a man handed me his baby and said, \"Would you take my son with you?\" He knew, in Ireland, that his son would live, and that in Ethiopia, his son would die. It was the middle of that awful famine. Well, I turned him down. And it was a funny kind of sick feeling, but I turned him down. And it's a feeling I can't ever quite forget. And in that moment, I started this journey.In that moment, I became the worst thing of all: I became a rock star with a cause. (Laughter) Except this isn't the cause, is it? Six-and-a-half thousand Africans dying every single day from AIDS \u2014 a preventable, treatable disease \u2014 for lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy. That's not a cause. That's an emergency. 11 million AIDS orphans in Africa, 20 million by the end of the decade. That's not a cause. That's an emergency. Today, every day, 9,000 more Africans will catch HIV because of stigmatization and lack of education. That's not a cause. That's an emergency. So what we're talking about here is human rights. The right to live like a human. The right to live, period. And what we're facing in Africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality.The next thing I'd like to be clear about is what this problem is, and what this problem isn't. Because this is not all about charity. This is about justice. Really. This is not about charity. This is about justice. That's right. And that's too bad, because we're very good at charity. Americans, like Irish people, are good at it. Even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford. We like to give, and we give a lot. Look at the response to the tsunami \u2014 it's inspiring. But justice is a tougher standard than charity. You see, Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice. It makes a farce of our idea of equality. It mocks our pieties. It doubts our concern. It questions our commitment. Because there is no way we can look at what's happening in Africa, and if we're honest, conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else.As you heard in the film, anywhere else, not here. Not here, not in America, not in Europe. In fact, a head of state that you're all familiar with admitted this to me. And it's really true. There is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life would be accepted anywhere else other than Africa. Africa is a continent in flames. And deep down, if we really accepted that Africans were equal to us, we would all do more to put the fire out. We're standing around with watering cans, when what we really need is the fire brigade.You see, it's not as dramatic as the tsunami. It's crazy, really, when you think about it. Does stuff have to look like an action movie these days to exist in the front of our brain? The slow extinguishing of countless lives is just not dramatic enough, it would appear. Catastrophes that we can avert are not as interesting as ones we could avert. Funny, that. Anyway, I believe that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual rigor in this room. Six-and-a-half thousand people dying a day in Africa may be Africa's crisis, but the fact that it's not on the nightly news, that we in Europe, or you in America, are not treating it like an emergency \u2014 I want to argue with you tonight that that's our crisis. I want to argue that though Africa is not the front line in the war against terror, it could be soon. Every week, religious extremists take another African village. They're attempting to bring order to chaos. Well, why aren't we?Poverty breeds despair. We know this. Despair breeds violence. We know this. In turbulent times, isn't it cheaper, and smarter, to make friends out of potential enemies than to defend yourself against them later? \"The war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty.\" And I didn't say that. Colin Powell said that. Now when the military are telling us that this is a war that cannot be won by military might alone, maybe we should listen. There's an opportunity here, and it's real. It's not spin. It's not wishful thinking. The problems facing the developing world afford us in the developed world a chance to re-describe ourselves to the world. We will not only transform other people's lives, but we will also transform the way those other lives see us. And that might be smart in these nervous, dangerous times.Don't you think that on a purely commercial level, that anti-retroviral drugs are great advertisements for Western ingenuity and technology? Doesn't compassion look well on us? And let's cut the crap for a second. In certain quarters of the world, brand EU, brand USA, is not at its shiniest. The neon sign is fizzing and cracking. Someone's put a brick through the window. The regional branch managers are getting nervous. Never before have we in the west been so scrutinized. Our values: do we have any? Our credibility? These things are under attack around the world. Brand USA could use some polishing. And I say that as a fan, you know? As a person who buys the products. But think about it. More anti-retrovirals make sense. But that's just the easy part, or ought to be.But equality for Africa \u2014 that's a big, expensive idea. You see, the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference. What on earth can we all do about this? Well, much more than we think. We can't fix every problem, but the ones we can, I want to argue, we must. And because we can, we must. This is the straight truth, the righteous truth. It is not a theory. The fact is that ours is the first generation that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye, look across the ocean to Africa, and say this, and mean it: we do not have to stand for this. A whole continent written off \u2014 we do not have to stand for this.(Applause)And let me say this without a trace of irony \u2014 before I back it up to a bunch of ex-hippies. Forget the '60s. We can change the world. I can't; you can't, as individuals; but we can change the world. I really believe that, the people in this room. Look at the Gates Foundation. They've done incredible stuff, unbelievable stuff. But working together, we can actually change the world. We can turn the inevitable outcomes, and transform the quality of life for millions of lives who look and feel rather like us, when you're up close. I'm sorry to laugh here, but you do look so different than you did in Haight-Ashbury in the '60s.(Laughter)But I want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for. It is the flowering of the seeds you planted in earlier, headier days. Ideas that you gestated in your youth. This is what excites me. This room was born for this moment, is really what I want to say to you tonight. Most of you started out wanting to change the world, didn't you? Most of you did, the digital world. Well, now, actually because of you, it is possible to change the physical world. It's a fact. Economists confirm it, and they know much more than I do. So why, then, are we not pumping our fists into the air? Probably because when we admit we can do something about it, we've got to do something about it. It is a pain in the arse. This equality business is actually a pain in the arse. But for the first time in history, we have the technology; we have the know-how; we have the cash; we have the life-saving drugs.Do we have the will? I hope this is obvious, but I'm not a hippie. And I'm not really one for the warm, fuzzy feeling. I do not have flowers in my hair. Actually, I come from punk rock. The Clash wore big army boots, not sandals. But I know toughness when I see it. And for all the talk of peace and love on the West Coast, there was muscle to the movement that started out here. You see, idealism detached from action is just a dream. But idealism allied with pragmatism, with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit, is very exciting. It's very real. It's very strong. And it's very present in a crowd like you.Last year at DATA, this organization I helped set up, we launched a campaign to summon this spirit in the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty. We're calling it the ONE Campaign. It's based on our belief that the action of one person can change a lot, but the actions of many coming together as one can change the world. Well, we feel that now is the time to prove we're right. There are moments in history when civilization redefines itself. We believe this is one. We believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides that the wanton loss of life in Africa is just no longer acceptable. This could be the time that we finally get serious about changing the future for most people who live on planet Earth.Momentum has been building. Lurching a little, but it's building. This year is a test for us all, especially the leaders of the G8 nations, who really are on the line here, with all the world in history watching. I have been, of late, disappointed with the Bush Administration. They started out with such promise on Africa. They made some really great promises, and actually have fulfilled a lot of them. But some of them they haven't. They don't feel the push from the ground, is the truth. But my disappointment has much more perspective when I talk to American people, and I hear their worries about the deficit, and the fiscal well being of their country. I understand that. But there's much more push from the ground than you'd think, if we got organized.What I try to communicate, and you can help me if you agree, is that aid for Africa is just great value for money at a time when America really needs it. Putting it in the crassest possible terms, the investment reaps huge returns. Not only in lives saved, but in goodwill, stability and security that we'll gain. So this is what I hope that you will do, if I could be so bold, and not have it deducted from my number of wishes.(Laughter)What I hope is that beyond individual merciful acts, that you will tell the politicians to do right by Africa, by America and by the world. Give them permission, if you like, to spend their political capital and your financial capital, your national purse on saving the lives of millions of people. That's really what I would like you to do. Because we also need your intellectual capital: your ideas, your skills, your ingenuity. And you, at this conference, are in a unique position. Some of the technologies we've been talking about, you invented them, or at least revolutionized the way that they're used. Together you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital, and pushed the boundaries. And we'd like you to give us that energy. Give us that kind of dreaming, that kind of doing.As I say, there're two things on the line here. There's the continent Africa. But there's also our sense of ourselves. People are starting to figure this out. Movements are springing up. Artists, politicians, pop stars, priests, CEOs, NGOs, mothers' unions, student unions. A lot of people are getting together, and working under this umbrella I told you about earlier, the ONE Campaign. I think they just have one idea in their mind, which is, where you live in the world should not determine whether you live in the world.(Applause)History, like God, is watching what we do. When the history books get written, I think our age will be remembered for three things. Really, it's just three things this whole age will be remembered for. The digital revolution, yes. The war against terror, yes. And what we did or did not do to put out the fires in Africa. Some say we can't afford to. I say we can't afford not to. Thank you, thank you very much.(Applause)Okay, my three wishes. The ones that TED has offered to grant. You see, if this is true, and I believe it is, that the digital world you all created has uncoupled the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter, this should be a piece of piss.(Laughter)I should add that this started out as a much longer list of wishes. Most of them impossible, some of them impractical and one or two of them certainly immoral.(Laughter)This business, it gets to be addictive, you know what I mean, when somebody else is picking up the tab. Anyway, here's number one. I wish for you to help build a social movement of more than one million American activists for Africa. That is my first wish. I believe it's possible. A few minutes ago, I talked about all the citizens' campaigns that are springing up. You know, there's lots out there. And with this one campaign as our umbrella, my organization, DATA, and other groups, have been tapping into the energy and the enthusiasm that's out there from Hollywood into the heartland of America. We know there's more than enough energy to power this movement. We just need your help in making it happen.We want all of you here, church America, corporate America, Microsoft America, Apple America, Coke America, Pepsi America, nerd America, noisy America. We can't afford to be cool and sit this one out. I do believe if we build a movement that's one million Americans strong, we're not going to be denied. We will have the ear of Congress. We'll be the first page in Condi Rice's briefing book, and right into the Oval Office. If there's one million Americans \u2014 and I really know this \u2014 who are ready to make phone calls, who are ready to be on email, I am absolutely sure that we can actually change the course of history, literally, for the continent of Africa. Anyway, so I'd like your help in getting that signed up. I know John Gage and Sun Microsystems are already on board for this, but there's lots of you we'd like to talk to.Right, my second wish, number two. I would like one media hit for every person on the planet who is living on less than one dollar a day. That's one billion media hits. Could be on Google, could be on AOL. Steve Case, Larry, Sergey \u2014 they've done a lot already. It could be NBC. It could be ABC. Actually we're talking to ABC today about the Oscars. We have a film, produced by Jon Kamen at Radical Media. But you know, we want, we need some airtime for our ideas. We need to get the math; we need to get the statistics out to the American people. I really believe that old Truman line, that if you give the American people the facts, they'll do the right thing. And, the other thing that's important is that this is not Sally Struthers. This has to be described as an adventure, not a burden.(Video): One by one they step forward, a nurse, a teacher, a homemaker, and lives are saved. The problem is enormous. Every three seconds one person dies. Another three seconds, one more. The situation is so desperate in parts of Africa, Asia, even America, that aid groups, just as they did for the tsunami, are uniting as one, acting as one. We can beat extreme poverty, starvation, AIDS. But we need your help. One more person, letter, voice will mean the difference between life and death for millions of people. Please join us by working together. Americans have an unprecedented opportunity. We can make history. We can start to make poverty history. One, by one, by one. Please visit ONE at this address. We're not asking for your money. We're asking for your voice.Bono: All right. I wish for TED to truly show the power of information, its power to rewrite the rules and transform lives, by connecting every hospital, health clinic and school in one African country. And I would like it to be Ethiopia. I believe we can connect every school in Ethiopia, every health clinic, every hospital \u2014 we can connect to the Internet. That is my wish, my third wish. I think it's possible. I think we have the money and brains in the room to do that. And that would be a mind-blowing wish to come true. I've been to Ethiopia, as I said earlier. It's actually where it all started for me. The idea that the Internet, which changed all of our lives, can transform a country \u2014 and a continent that has hardly made it to analog, let alone digital \u2014 blows my mind. But it didn't start out that way.The first long-distance line from Boston to New York was used in 1885 on the phone. It was just nine years later that Addis Ababa was connected by phone to Harare, which is 500 kilometers away. Since then, not that much has changed. The average waiting time to get a landline in Ethiopia is actually about seven or eight years. But wireless technology wasn't dreamt up then. Anyway, I'm Irish, and as you can see, I know how important talking is. Communication is very important for Ethiopia \u2014 will transform the country. Nurses getting better training, pharmacists being able to order supplies, doctors sharing their expertise in all aspects of medicine. It's a very, very good idea to get them wired. And that is my third and final wish for you at the TED conference. Thank you very much once again.(Applause)", "id": 59, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nWell, as Alexander Graham Bell famously said\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.958\non his first successful telephone call,\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:23.958\n\"Hello, is that Domino's Pizza?\"\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nI just really want to thank you very much.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nAs another famous man, Jerry Garcia, said,\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:35.958\n\"What a strange, long trip.\"\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nAnd he should have said,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.958\n\"What a strange, long trip it's about to become.\"\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nAt this very moment, you are viewing my upper half.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nMy lower half is appearing at a different conference\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nin a different country.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nYou can, it turns out, be in two places at once.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nBut still, I'm sorry I can't be with you in person.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nI'll explain at another time.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nAnd though I'm a rock star,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nI just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nBut what really turns me on about technology\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nis not just the ability to get more songs on MP3 players.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nThe revolution -- this revolution -- is much bigger than that.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nI hope, I believe.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nWhat turns me on about the digital age,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nwhat excites me personally,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nis that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nYou see, it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song,\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nyou needed a studio and a producer.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nNow, you need a laptop.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nIf you wanted to make a film, you needed a mass of equipment\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nand a Hollywood budget.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nNow, you need a camera that fits in your palm,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nand a couple of bucks for a blank DVD.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nImagination has been decoupled from the old constraints.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nAnd that really, really excites me.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nI'm excited when I glimpse that kind of thinking writ large.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nWhat I would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nPolitical, economic, psychological, whatever.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nThe geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nFrom the ease with which you swept away obstacles\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nthat no one knew could even be budged.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nAnd that's actually what I'd like to talk about today.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nFirst, though, I should probably explain why, and how,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nI got to this place.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nIt's a journey that started 20 years ago.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nYou may remember that song, \"We Are the World,\"\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nor, \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\"\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nBand Aid, Live Aid.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nAnother very tall, grizzled rock star, my friend Sir Bob Geldof,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nissued a challenge to \"feed the world.\"\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nIt was a great moment, and it utterly changed my life.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nThat summer, my wife, Ali, and myself went to Ethiopia.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nWe went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nWe lived in Ethiopia for a month, working at an orphanage.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nThe children had a name for me.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nThey called me, \"The girl with the beard.\"\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nDon't ask.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nAnyway, we found Africa to be a magical place.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nBig skies, big hearts, big, shining continent.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nBeautiful, royal people.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nAnybody who ever gave anything to Africa got a lot more back.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nEthiopia didn't just blow my mind; it opened my mind.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nAnyway, on our last day at this orphanage\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:11.958\na man handed me his baby and said,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.958\n\"Would you take my son with you?\"\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nHe knew, in Ireland, that his son would live,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nand that in Ethiopia, his son would die.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nIt was the middle of that awful famine.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nWell, I turned him down.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nAnd it was a funny kind of sick feeling, but I turned him down.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nAnd it's a feeling I can't ever quite forget.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nAnd in that moment, I started this journey.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nIn that moment, I became the worst thing of all:\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nI became a rock star with a cause. (Laughter)\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nExcept this isn't the cause, is it?\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nSix-and-a-half thousand Africans dying every single day from AIDS --\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\na preventable, treatable disease --\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nfor lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nThat's not a cause. That's an emergency.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\n11 million AIDS orphans in Africa,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\n20 million by the end of the decade.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nThat's not a cause. That's an emergency.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nToday, every day, 9,000 more Africans\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nwill catch HIV because of stigmatization and lack of education.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nThat's not a cause. That's an emergency.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nSo what we're talking about here is human rights.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nThe right to live like a human.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nThe right to live, period.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nAnd what we're facing in Africa is\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nan unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nThe next thing I'd like to be clear about is what this problem is,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nand what this problem isn't.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nBecause this is not all about charity.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nThis is about justice. Really.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nThis is not about charity. This is about justice.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nThat's right.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nAnd that's too bad, because we're very good at charity.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nAmericans, like Irish people, are good at it.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nEven the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nWe like to give, and we give a lot.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nLook at the response to the tsunami -- it's inspiring.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nBut justice is a tougher standard than charity.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nYou see, Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nIt makes a farce of our idea of equality.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nIt mocks our pieties. It doubts our concern.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nIt questions our commitment.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nBecause there is no way we can look at what's happening in Africa,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nand if we're honest,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nconclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nAs you heard in the film, anywhere else, not here.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nNot here, not in America, not in Europe.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nIn fact, a head of state that you're all familiar with\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nadmitted this to me. And it's really true.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nThere is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nwould be accepted anywhere else other than Africa.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nAfrica is a continent in flames.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nAnd deep down, if we really accepted that Africans were equal to us,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nwe would all do more to put the fire out.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nWe're standing around with watering cans,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nwhen what we really need is the fire brigade.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nYou see, it's not as dramatic as the tsunami.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nIt's crazy, really, when you think about it.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nDoes stuff have to look like an action movie these days\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nto exist in the front of our brain?\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nThe slow extinguishing of countless lives\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nis just not dramatic enough, it would appear.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nCatastrophes that we can avert\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nare not as interesting as ones we could avert.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nFunny, that.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nAnyway, I believe that that kind of thinking\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:21.958\noffends the intellectual rigor in this room.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nSix-and-a-half thousand people dying a day in Africa may be Africa's crisis,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nbut the fact that it's not on the nightly news,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nthat we in Europe, or you in America,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nare not treating it like an emergency --\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nI want to argue with you tonight that that's our crisis.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nI want to argue that though Africa is not the front line in the war against terror,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nit could be soon.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nEvery week, religious extremists take another African village.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nThey're attempting to bring order to chaos.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nWell, why aren't we?\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nPoverty breeds despair. We know this.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nDespair breeds violence. We know this.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nIn turbulent times, isn't it cheaper, and smarter,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nto make friends out of potential enemies\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nthan to defend yourself against them later?\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:18.958\n\"The war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty.\"\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nAnd I didn't say that. Colin Powell said that.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nNow when the military are telling us that this is a war\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nthat cannot be won by military might alone,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nmaybe we should listen.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nThere's an opportunity here, and it's real.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nIt's not spin. It's not wishful thinking.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nThe problems facing the developing world\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nafford us in the developed world\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:46.958\na chance to re-describe ourselves to the world.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nWe will not only transform other people's lives,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nbut we will also transform the way those other lives see us.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nAnd that might be smart in these nervous, dangerous times.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nDon't you think that on a purely commercial level,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nthat anti-retroviral drugs are great advertisements\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nfor Western ingenuity and technology?\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nDoesn't compassion look well on us?\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nAnd let's cut the crap for a second.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nIn certain quarters of the world, brand EU, brand USA,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nis not at its shiniest.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nThe neon sign is fizzing and cracking.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nSomeone's put a brick through the window.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nThe regional branch managers are getting nervous.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nNever before have we in the west been so scrutinized.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nOur values: do we have any?\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nOur credibility?\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nThese things are under attack around the world.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nBrand USA could use some polishing.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nAnd I say that as a fan, you know?\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nAs a person who buys the products.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nBut think about it.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nMore anti-retrovirals make sense.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nBut that's just the easy part, or ought to be.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nBut equality for Africa --\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nthat's a big, expensive idea.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nYou see, the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nWhat on earth can we all do about this?\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nWell, much more than we think.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nWe can't fix every problem, but the ones we can,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nI want to argue, we must.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nAnd because we can, we must.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nThis is the straight truth, the righteous truth.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nIt is not a theory.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nThe fact is that ours is the first generation\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nthat can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nlook across the ocean to Africa, and say this, and mean it:\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nwe do not have to stand for this.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nA whole continent written off -- we do not have to stand for this.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:10.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nAnd let me say this without a trace of irony --\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nbefore I back it up to a bunch of ex-hippies.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nForget the '60s. We can change the world.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nI can't; you can't, as individuals; but we can change the world.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nI really believe that, the people in this room.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nLook at the Gates Foundation.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nThey've done incredible stuff, unbelievable stuff.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nBut working together, we can actually change the world.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nWe can turn the inevitable outcomes,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nand transform the quality of life for millions of lives\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nwho look and feel rather like us, when you're up close.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nI'm sorry to laugh here, but you do look so different\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nthan you did in Haight-Ashbury in the '60s.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nBut I want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nIt is the flowering of the seeds you planted\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nin earlier, headier days.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nIdeas that you gestated in your youth.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nThis is what excites me.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nThis room was born for this moment,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nis really what I want to say to you tonight.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nMost of you started out wanting to change the world, didn't you?\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nMost of you did, the digital world.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nWell, now, actually because of you,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nit is possible to change the physical world.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nIt's a fact.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nEconomists confirm it, and they know much more than I do.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nSo why, then, are we not pumping our fists into the air?\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nProbably because when we admit we can do something about it,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nwe've got to do something about it.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nIt is a pain in the arse.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nThis equality business is actually a pain in the arse.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nBut for the first time in history, we have the technology;\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nwe have the know-how; we have the cash;\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nwe have the life-saving drugs.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nDo we have the will?\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nI hope this is obvious, but I'm not a hippie.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nAnd I'm not really one for the warm, fuzzy feeling.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nI do not have flowers in my hair.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nActually, I come from punk rock.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nThe Clash wore big army boots, not sandals.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nBut I know toughness when I see it.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nAnd for all the talk of peace and love on the West Coast,\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nthere was muscle to the movement that started out here.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nYou see, idealism detached from action is just a dream.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nBut idealism allied with pragmatism,\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nwith rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit,\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nis very exciting. It's very real. It's very strong.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nAnd it's very present in a crowd like you.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nLast year at DATA, this organization I helped set up,\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nwe launched a campaign to summon this spirit\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nin the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nWe're calling it the ONE Campaign.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nIt's based on our belief that the action of one person\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\ncan change a lot,\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nbut the actions of many coming together as one\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\ncan change the world.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nWell, we feel that now is the time to prove we're right.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nThere are moments in history when civilization redefines itself.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nWe believe this is one.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nWe believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nthat the wanton loss of life in Africa is just no longer acceptable.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nThis could be the time that we finally get serious\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nabout changing the future for most people who live on planet Earth.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nMomentum has been building.\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nLurching a little, but it's building.\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nThis year is a test for us all,\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nespecially the leaders of the G8 nations,\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nwho really are on the line here,\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nwith all the world in history watching.\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nI have been, of late, disappointed with the Bush Administration.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nThey started out with such promise on Africa.\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nThey made some really great promises,\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nand actually have fulfilled a lot of them.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nBut some of them they haven't.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nThey don't feel the push from the ground, is the truth.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nBut my disappointment has much more perspective\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nwhen I talk to American people,\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nand I hear their worries about the deficit,\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nand the fiscal well being of their country.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nI understand that.\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nBut there's much more push from the ground than you'd think,\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nif we got organized.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nWhat I try to communicate, and you can help me if you agree,\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nis that aid for Africa is just great value for money\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nat a time when America really needs it.\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nPutting it in the crassest possible terms,\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nthe investment reaps huge returns.\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nNot only in lives saved, but in goodwill, stability\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nand security that we'll gain.\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nSo this is what I hope that you will do, if I could be so bold,\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nand not have it deducted from my number of wishes.\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:03.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nWhat I hope is that beyond individual merciful acts,\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nthat you will tell the politicians to do right by Africa,\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nby America and by the world.\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nGive them permission, if you like,\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nto spend their political capital and your financial capital,\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nyour national purse on saving the lives of millions of people.\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nThat's really what I would like you to do.\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nBecause we also need your intellectual capital:\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:38.958\nyour ideas, your skills, your ingenuity.\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nAnd you, at this conference, are in a unique position.\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:46.958\nSome of the technologies we've been talking about, you invented them,\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nor at least revolutionized the way that they're used.\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nTogether you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital,\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nand pushed the boundaries.\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:03.958\nAnd we'd like you to give us that energy.\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nGive us that kind of dreaming, that kind of doing.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nAs I say, there're two things on the line here.\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:10.958\nThere's the continent Africa.\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nBut there's also our sense of ourselves.\n\n00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nPeople are starting to figure this out.\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nMovements are springing up.\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nArtists, politicians, pop stars, priests, CEOs,\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nNGOs, mothers' unions, student unions.\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nA lot of people are getting together, and working\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nunder this umbrella I told you about earlier, the ONE Campaign.\n\n00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:40.958\nI think they just have one idea in their mind,\n\n00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:44.958\nwhich is, where you live in the world\n\n00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:49.958\nshould not determine whether you live in the world.\n\n00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:53.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:57.958\nHistory, like God, is watching what we do.\n\n00:19:58.958 --> 00:20:00.958\nWhen the history books get written,\n\n00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:04.958\nI think our age will be remembered for three things.\n\n00:20:04.958 --> 00:20:08.958\nReally, it's just three things this whole age will be remembered for.\n\n00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:11.958\nThe digital revolution, yes.\n\n00:20:11.958 --> 00:20:14.958\nThe war against terror, yes.\n\n00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:20.958\nAnd what we did or did not do to put out the fires in Africa.\n\n00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:28.958\nSome say we can't afford to. I say we can't afford not to.\n\n00:20:29.958 --> 00:20:31.958\nThank you, thank you very much.\n\n00:20:31.958 --> 00:20:38.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:39.958\nOkay, my three wishes.\n\n00:20:41.958 --> 00:20:44.958\nThe ones that TED has offered to grant.\n\n00:20:47.958 --> 00:20:49.958\nYou see, if this is true, and I believe it is,\n\n00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:55.958\nthat the digital world you all created has uncoupled\n\n00:20:55.958 --> 00:21:00.958\nthe creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter,\n\n00:21:01.958 --> 00:21:02.958\nthis should be a piece of piss.\n\n00:21:03.958 --> 00:21:06.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:21:07.958 --> 00:21:10.958\nI should add that this started out as a much longer list of wishes.\n\n00:21:10.958 --> 00:21:12.958\nMost of them impossible, some of them impractical\n\n00:21:12.958 --> 00:21:16.958\nand one or two of them certainly immoral.\n\n00:21:16.958 --> 00:21:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:21:20.958 --> 00:21:24.958\nThis business, it gets to be addictive, you know what I mean,\n\n00:21:24.958 --> 00:21:26.958\nwhen somebody else is picking up the tab.\n\n00:21:27.958 --> 00:21:29.958\nAnyway, here's number one.\n\n00:21:30.958 --> 00:21:37.958\nI wish for you to help build a social movement\n\n00:21:37.958 --> 00:21:44.958\nof more than one million American activists for Africa.\n\n00:21:44.958 --> 00:21:46.958\nThat is my first wish.\n\n00:21:46.958 --> 00:21:48.958\nI believe it's possible.\n\n00:21:48.958 --> 00:21:53.958\nA few minutes ago, I talked about all the citizens' campaigns that are springing up.\n\n00:21:53.958 --> 00:21:55.958\nYou know, there's lots out there.\n\n00:21:55.958 --> 00:21:58.958\nAnd with this one campaign as our umbrella,\n\n00:21:58.958 --> 00:22:01.958\nmy organization, DATA, and other groups,\n\n00:22:01.958 --> 00:22:05.958\nhave been tapping into the energy and the enthusiasm\n\n00:22:05.958 --> 00:22:09.958\nthat's out there from Hollywood into the heartland of America.\n\n00:22:09.958 --> 00:22:13.958\nWe know there's more than enough energy to power this movement.\n\n00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:16.958\nWe just need your help in making it happen.\n\n00:22:17.958 --> 00:22:19.958\nWe want all of you here, church America, corporate America,\n\n00:22:19.958 --> 00:22:22.958\nMicrosoft America, Apple America, Coke America,\n\n00:22:22.958 --> 00:22:25.958\nPepsi America, nerd America, noisy America.\n\n00:22:25.958 --> 00:22:29.958\nWe can't afford to be cool and sit this one out.\n\n00:22:29.958 --> 00:22:34.958\nI do believe if we build a movement that's one million Americans strong,\n\n00:22:34.958 --> 00:22:37.958\nwe're not going to be denied.\n\n00:22:37.958 --> 00:22:39.958\nWe will have the ear of Congress.\n\n00:22:42.958 --> 00:22:45.958\nWe'll be the first page in Condi Rice's briefing book,\n\n00:22:45.958 --> 00:22:48.958\nand right into the Oval Office.\n\n00:22:48.958 --> 00:22:51.958\nIf there's one million Americans -- and I really know this --\n\n00:22:51.958 --> 00:22:53.958\nwho are ready to make phone calls,\n\n00:22:53.958 --> 00:22:55.958\nwho are ready to be on email,\n\n00:22:55.958 --> 00:22:59.958\nI am absolutely sure that we can actually change\n\n00:22:59.958 --> 00:23:05.958\nthe course of history, literally, for the continent of Africa.\n\n00:23:05.958 --> 00:23:08.958\nAnyway, so I'd like your help in getting that signed up.\n\n00:23:09.958 --> 00:23:13.958\nI know John Gage and Sun Microsystems are already on board for this,\n\n00:23:13.958 --> 00:23:16.958\nbut there's lots of you we'd like to talk to.\n\n00:23:16.958 --> 00:23:20.958\nRight, my second wish, number two.\n\n00:23:24.958 --> 00:23:29.958\nI would like one media hit for every person on the planet\n\n00:23:29.958 --> 00:23:33.958\nwho is living on less than one dollar a day.\n\n00:23:34.958 --> 00:23:37.958\nThat's one billion media hits.\n\n00:23:37.958 --> 00:23:40.958\nCould be on Google, could be on AOL.\n\n00:23:40.958 --> 00:23:45.958\nSteve Case, Larry, Sergey -- they've done a lot already.\n\n00:23:46.958 --> 00:23:48.958\nIt could be NBC. It could be ABC.\n\n00:23:48.958 --> 00:23:51.958\nActually we're talking to ABC today about the Oscars.\n\n00:23:51.958 --> 00:23:56.958\nWe have a film, produced by Jon Kamen at Radical Media.\n\n00:23:57.958 --> 00:24:01.958\nBut you know, we want, we need some airtime for our ideas.\n\n00:24:01.958 --> 00:24:05.958\nWe need to get the math; we need to get the statistics out to the American people.\n\n00:24:05.958 --> 00:24:08.958\nI really believe that old Truman line,\n\n00:24:08.958 --> 00:24:11.958\nthat if you give the American people the facts,\n\n00:24:11.958 --> 00:24:13.958\nthey'll do the right thing.\n\n00:24:13.958 --> 00:24:17.958\nAnd, the other thing that's important is that this is not Sally Struthers.\n\n00:24:17.958 --> 00:24:22.958\nThis has to be described as an adventure, not a burden.\n\n00:24:22.958 --> 00:24:24.958\n(Video): One by one they step forward,\n\n00:24:24.958 --> 00:24:26.958\na nurse, a teacher, a homemaker,\n\n00:24:26.958 --> 00:24:28.958\nand lives are saved.\n\n00:24:28.958 --> 00:24:30.958\nThe problem is enormous.\n\n00:24:30.958 --> 00:24:33.958\nEvery three seconds one person dies.\n\n00:24:33.958 --> 00:24:36.958\nAnother three seconds, one more.\n\n00:24:36.958 --> 00:24:39.958\nThe situation is so desperate in parts of Africa,\n\n00:24:39.958 --> 00:24:41.958\nAsia, even America,\n\n00:24:41.958 --> 00:24:44.958\nthat aid groups, just as they did for the tsunami,\n\n00:24:44.958 --> 00:24:48.958\nare uniting as one, acting as one.\n\n00:24:48.958 --> 00:24:52.958\nWe can beat extreme poverty, starvation, AIDS.\n\n00:24:52.958 --> 00:24:54.958\nBut we need your help.\n\n00:24:54.958 --> 00:24:56.958\nOne more person, letter, voice\n\n00:24:56.958 --> 00:24:59.958\nwill mean the difference between life and death\n\n00:24:59.958 --> 00:25:01.958\nfor millions of people.\n\n00:25:02.958 --> 00:25:04.958\nPlease join us by working together.\n\n00:25:04.958 --> 00:25:07.958\nAmericans have an unprecedented opportunity.\n\n00:25:07.958 --> 00:25:09.958\nWe can make history.\n\n00:25:09.958 --> 00:25:11.958\nWe can start to make poverty history.\n\n00:25:12.958 --> 00:25:14.958\nOne, by one, by one.\n\n00:25:14.958 --> 00:25:17.958\nPlease visit ONE at this address.\n\n00:25:17.958 --> 00:25:20.958\nWe're not asking for your money. We're asking for your voice.\n\n00:25:22.958 --> 00:25:30.958\nBono: All right. I wish for TED to truly show the power of information,\n\n00:25:30.958 --> 00:25:35.958\nits power to rewrite the rules and transform lives,\n\n00:25:35.958 --> 00:25:41.958\nby connecting every hospital, health clinic and school\n\n00:25:41.958 --> 00:25:44.958\nin one African country.\n\n00:25:45.958 --> 00:25:48.958\nAnd I would like it to be Ethiopia.\n\n00:25:48.958 --> 00:25:52.958\nI believe we can connect every school in Ethiopia,\n\n00:25:52.958 --> 00:25:55.958\nevery health clinic, every hospital --\n\n00:25:55.958 --> 00:25:58.958\nwe can connect to the Internet.\n\n00:25:58.958 --> 00:26:00.958\nThat is my wish, my third wish.\n\n00:26:00.958 --> 00:26:01.958\nI think it's possible.\n\n00:26:01.958 --> 00:26:04.958\nI think we have the money and brains in the room to do that.\n\n00:26:04.958 --> 00:26:10.958\nAnd that would be a mind-blowing wish to come true.\n\n00:26:10.958 --> 00:26:13.958\nI've been to Ethiopia, as I said earlier.\n\n00:26:13.958 --> 00:26:16.958\nIt's actually where it all started for me.\n\n00:26:20.958 --> 00:26:24.958\nThe idea that the Internet, which changed all of our lives,\n\n00:26:24.958 --> 00:26:28.958\ncan transform a country -- and a continent\n\n00:26:28.958 --> 00:26:34.958\nthat has hardly made it to analog, let alone digital -- blows my mind.\n\n00:26:35.958 --> 00:26:37.958\nBut it didn't start out that way.\n\n00:26:38.958 --> 00:26:41.958\nThe first long-distance line from Boston to New York\n\n00:26:41.958 --> 00:26:46.958\nwas used in 1885 on the phone.\n\n00:26:47.958 --> 00:26:51.958\nIt was just nine years later that Addis Ababa\n\n00:26:51.958 --> 00:26:56.958\nwas connected by phone to Harare, which is 500 kilometers away.\n\n00:26:58.958 --> 00:27:00.958\nSince then, not that much has changed.\n\n00:27:01.958 --> 00:27:05.958\nThe average waiting time to get a landline in Ethiopia\n\n00:27:05.958 --> 00:27:07.958\nis actually about seven or eight years.\n\n00:27:09.958 --> 00:27:14.958\nBut wireless technology wasn't dreamt up then.\n\n00:27:15.958 --> 00:27:17.958\nAnyway, I'm Irish, and as you can see,\n\n00:27:17.958 --> 00:27:20.958\nI know how important talking is.\n\n00:27:21.958 --> 00:27:25.958\nCommunication is very important for Ethiopia -- will transform the country.\n\n00:27:25.958 --> 00:27:27.958\nNurses getting better training,\n\n00:27:27.958 --> 00:27:29.958\npharmacists being able to order supplies,\n\n00:27:29.958 --> 00:27:33.958\ndoctors sharing their expertise in all aspects of medicine.\n\n00:27:34.958 --> 00:27:37.958\nIt's a very, very good idea to get them wired.\n\n00:27:38.958 --> 00:27:42.958\nAnd that is my third and final wish for you at the TED conference.\n\n00:27:42.958 --> 00:27:44.958\nThank you very much once again.\n\n00:27:44.958 --> 00:27:46.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "My wish: Manufactured landscapes and green education", "duration": "2065", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/edward_burtynsky_on_manufactured_landscapes", "transcript": "Walk around for four months with three wishes, and all the ideas will start to percolate up. I think everybody should do it \u2014 think that you've got three wishes. And what would you do? It's actually a great exercise to really drill down to the things that you feel are important, and really reflect on the world around us. And thinking that, can an individual actually do something, or come up with something, that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference? Inspired by nature \u2014 that's the theme here. And I think, quite frankly, that's where I started.I became very interested in the landscape as a Canadian. We have this Great North. And there was a pretty small population, and my father was an avid outdoorsman. So I really had a chance to experience that. And I could never really understand exactly what it was, or how it was informing me. But what I think it was telling me is that we are this transient thing that's happening, and that the nature that you see out there \u2014 the untouched shorelines, the untouched forest that I was able to see \u2014 really bring in a sense of that geological time, that this has gone on for a long time, and we're experiencing it in a different way.And that, to me, was a reference point that I think I needed to have to be able to make the work that I did. And I did go out, and I did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring, along a roadside. This rebirth of grass. And then I went out for years trying to photograph the pristine landscape. But as a fine-art photographer I somehow felt that it wouldn't catch on out there, that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine-art career. And I kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture, or something of that nature, and I couldn't get away from it. So I started to think of, how can I rethink the landscape? I decided to rethink the landscape as the landscape that we've transformed.I had a bit of an epiphany being lost in Pennsylvania, and I took a left turn trying to get back to the highway. And I ended up in a town called Frackville. I got out of the car, and I stood up, and it was a coal-mining town. I did a 360 turnaround, and that became one of the most surreal landscapes I've ever seen. Totally transformed by man. And that got me to go out and look at mines like this, and go out and look at the largest industrial incursions in the landscape that I could find. And that became the baseline of what I was doing. And it also became the theme that I felt that I could hold onto, and not have to re-invent myself \u2014 that this theme was large enough to become a life's work, to become something that I could sink my teeth into and just research and find out where these industries are.And I think one of the things I also wanted to say in my thanks, which I kind of missed, was to thank all the corporations who helped me get in. Because it took negotiation for almost every one of these photographs \u2014 to get into that place to make those photographs, and if it wasn't for those people letting me in at the heads of those corporations, I would have never made this body of work. So in that respect, to me, I'm not against the corporation. I own a corporation. I work with them, and I feel that we all need them and they're important. But I am also for sustainability.So there's this thing that is pulling me in both directions. And I'm not making an indictment towards what's happening here, but it is a slow progression. So I started thinking, well, we live in all these ages of man: the Stone Age, and the Iron Age, and the Copper Age. And these ages of man are still at work today. But we've become totally disconnected from them. There's something that we're not seeing there. And it's a scary thing as well. Because when we start looking at the collective appetite for our lifestyles, and what we're doing to that landscape \u2014 that, to me, is something that is a very sobering moment for me to contemplate.And through my photographs, I'm hoping to be able to engage the audiences of my work, and to come up to it and not immediately be rejected by the image. Not to say, \"Oh my God, what is it?\" but to be challenged by it \u2014 to say, \"Wow, this is beautiful,\" on one level, but on the other level, \"This is scary. I shouldn't be enjoying it.\" Like a forbidden pleasure. And it's that forbidden pleasure that I think is what resonates out there, and it gets people to look at these things, and it gets people to enter it. And it also, in a way, defines kind of what I feel, too \u2014 that I'm drawn to have a good life. I want a house, and I want a car. But there's this consequence out there. And how do I begin to have that attraction, repulsion? It's even in my own conscience I'm having it, and here in my work, I'm trying to build that same toggle.These things that I photographed \u2014 this tire pile here had 45 million tires in it. It was the largest one. It was only about an hour-and-a-half away from me, and it caught fire about four years ago. It's around Westley, California, around Modesto. And I decided to start looking at something that, to me, had \u2014 if the earlier work of looking at the landscape had a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature, in the recycling work that you're seeing here was starting to point to a direction. To me, it was our redemption. That in the recycling work that I was doing, I'm looking for a practice, a human activity that is sustainable. That if we keep putting things, through industrial and urban existence, back into the system \u2014 if we keep doing that \u2014 we can continue on. Of course, listening at the conference, there's many, many things that are coming. Bio-mimicry, and there's many other things that are coming on stream \u2014 nanotechnology that may also prevent us from having to go into that landscape and tear it apart. And we all look forward to those things.But in the meantime, these things are scaling up. These things are continuing to happen. What you're looking at here \u2014 I went to Bangladesh, so I started to move away from North America; I started to look at our world globally. These images of Bangladesh came out of a radio program I was listening to. They were talking about Exxon Valdez, and that there was going to be a glut of oil tankers because of the insurance industries. And that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned, and 2004 was going to be the pinnacle. And I thought, \"My God, wouldn't that be something?\" To see the largest vessels of man being deconstructed by hand, literally, in third-world countries. So originally I was going to go to India. And I was shut out of India because of a Greenpeace situation there, and then I was able to get into Bangladesh, and saw for the first time a third world, a view of it, that I had never actually thought was possible. 130 million people living in an area the size of Wisconsin \u2014 people everywhere \u2014 the pollution was intense, and the working conditions were horrible.Here you're looking at some oil fields in California, some of the biggest oil fields. And again, I started to think that \u2014 there was another epiphany \u2014 that the whole world I was living in was a result of having plentiful oil. And that, to me, was again something that I started building on, and I continued to build on. So this is a series I'm hoping to have ready in about two or three years, under the heading of \"The Oil Party.\" Because I think everything that we're involved in \u2014 our clothing, our cars, our roads, and everything \u2014 are directly a result. I'm going to move to some pictures of China. And for me China \u2014 I started photographing it four years ago, and China truly is a question of sustainability in my mind,not to mention that China, as well, has a great effect on the industries that I grew up around. I came out of a blue-collar town, a GM town, and my father worked at GM, so I was very familiar with that kind of industry and that also informed my work. But you know, to see China and the scale at which it's evolving, is quite something. So what you see here is the Three Gorges Dam, and this is the largest dam by 50 percent ever attempted by man. Most of the engineers around the world left the project because they said, \"It's just too big.\" In fact, when it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago, they were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning. It took fifteen days to fill it. So this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long, one of the largest reservoirs ever created. And what was also one of the bigger projects around that was moving 13 full-size cities up out of the reservoir, and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships.This is a \"before and after.\" So that was before. And this is like 10 weeks later, demolished by hand. I think 11 of the buildings they used dynamite, everything else was by hand. That was 10 weeks later. And this gives you an idea. And it was all the people who lived in those homes, were the ones that were actually taking it apart and working, and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart. And these are some of the images from that. So I spent about three trips to the Three Gorges Dam, looking at that massive transformation of a landscape. And it looks like a bombed-out landscape, but it isn't. What it is, it's a landscape that is an intentional one. This is a need for power, and they're willing to go through this massive transformation, on this scale, to get that power.And again, it's actually a relief for what's going on in China because I think on the table right now, there's 27 nuclear power stations to be built. There hasn't been one built in North America for 20 years because of the \"NIMBY\" problem \u2014 \"Not In My BackYard.\" But in China they're saying, \"No, we're putting in 27 in the next 10 years.\" And coal-burning furnaces are going in there for hydroelectric power literally weekly. So coal itself is probably one of the largest problems. And one of the other things that happened in the Three Gorges \u2014 a lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left was also lost; some of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that. And 1.2 to 2 million people were relocated, depending on whose statistics you're looking at. And this is what they were building.This is Wushan, one of the largest cities that was relocated. This is the town hall for the city. And again, the rebuilding of the city \u2014 to me, it was sad to see that they didn't really grab a lot of, I guess, what we know here, in terms of urban planning. There were no parks; there were no green spaces. Very high-density living on the side of a hill. And here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up, but somehow were not connecting with them.Here is a sign that, translated, says, \"Obey the birth control law. Build our science, civilized and advanced idea of marriage and giving birth.\" So here, if you look at this poster, it has all the trappings of Western culture. You're seeing the tuxedos, the bouquets. But what's really, to me, frightening about the picture and about this billboard is the refinery in the background. So it's like marrying up all the things that we have and it's an adaptation of our way of life, full stop. And again, when you start seeing that kind of embrace, and you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle with a very, very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle with a much higher footprint, it starts to become very sobering.This is a shot in one of the biggest squares in Guangdong \u2014 and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country. And there's about 130 million people in migration trying to get into urban centers at all times, and in the next 10 to 15 years, are expecting another 400 to 500 million people to migrate into the urban centers like Shanghai and the manufacturing centers. The manufacturers are \u2014 the domestics are usually \u2014 you can tell a domestic factory by the fact that they all use the same color uniforms. So this is a pink uniform at this factory. It's a shoe factory. And they have dorms for the workers. So they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms.This is one of the biggest shoe factories, the Yuyuan shoe factory near Shenzhen. It has 90,000 employees making shoes. This is a shift change, one of three. There's two factories of this scale in the same town. This is one with 45,000, so every lunch, there's about 12,000 coming through for lunch. They sit down; they have about 20 minutes. The next round comes in. It's an incredible workforce that's building there. Shanghai \u2014 I'm looking at the urban renewal in Shanghai, and this is a whole area that will be flattened and turned into skyscrapers in the next five years.What's also happening in Shanghai is \u2014 China is changing because this wouldn't have happened five years ago, for instance. This is a holdout. They're called dengzahoos \u2014 they're like pin tacks to the ground. They won't move. They're not negotiating. They're not getting enough, so they're not going to move. And so they're holding off until they get a deal with them. And they've been actually quite successful in getting better deals because most of them are getting a raw deal. They're being put out about two hours \u2014 the communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years, or maybe even thousands of years, are being broken up and spread across in the suburban areas outside of Shanghai. But these are a whole series of guys holding out in this reconstruction of Shanghai. Probably the largest urban-renewal project, I think, ever attempted on the planet.And then the embrace of the things that they're replacing it with \u2014 again, one of my wishes, and I never ended up going there, was to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house. The kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something, and these are called the villas. And also, like right now, they're just moving. The scaffolding is still on, and this is an e-waste area, and if you looked in the foreground on the big print, you'd see that the industry \u2014 their industry \u2014 they're all recycling. So the industry's already growing around these new developments.This is a five-level bridge in Shanghai. Shanghai was a very intriguing city \u2014 it's exploding on a level that I don't think any city has experienced. In fact, even Shenzhen, the economic zone \u2014 one of the first ones \u2014 15 years ago was about 100,000 people, and today it boasts about 10 to 11 million. So that gives you an idea of the kinds of migrations and the speed with which \u2014 this is just the taxis being built by Volkswagen. There's 9,000 of them here, and they're being built for most of the big cities, Beijing and Shanghai, Shenzhen. And this isn't even the domestic car market; this is the taxi market. And what we would see here as a suburban development \u2014 a similar thing, but they're all high-rises. So they'll put 20 or 40 up at a time, and they just go up in the same way as a single-family dwelling would go up here in an area.And the density is quite incredible. And one of the things in this picture that I wanted to point out is that when I saw these kinds of buildings, I was shocked to see that they're not using a central air-conditioning system; every window has an air conditioner in it. And I'm sure there are people here who probably know better than I do about efficiencies, but I can't imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioner is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale. And when you start looking at that, and then you start factoring up into a city the size of Shanghai, it's literally a forest of skyscrapers. It's breathtaking, in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming. And you can see in the foreground of this picture, it's still one of the last areas that was being held up. Right now that's all cleared out \u2014 this was done about eight months ago \u2014 and high-rises are now going up into that central spot. So a skyscraper is built, literally, overnight in Shanghai.Most recently I went in, and I started looking at some of the biggest industries in China. And this is Baosteel, right outside of Shanghai. This is the coal supply for the steel factory \u2014 18 square kilometers. It's an incredibly massive operation, I think 15,000 workers, five cupolas, and the sixth one's coming in here. So they're building very large blast furnaces to try to deal with the demand for steel in China. So this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot. And again, looking at these images, there's this constant, like, haze that you're seeing. This is going to show you, real time, an assembler. It's a circuit breaker. 10 hours a day at this speed. I think one of the issues that we here are facing with China, is that they're using a lot of the latest production technology.In that one, there were 400 people that worked on the floor. And I asked the manager to point out five of your fastest producers, and then I went and looked at each one of them for about 15 or 20 minutes, and picked this one woman. And it was just lightning fast; the way she was working was almost unbelievable. But that is the trick that they've got right now, that they're winning with, is that they're using all the latest technologies and extrusion machines, and bringing all the components into play, but the assembly is where they're actually bringing in \u2014 the country workers are very willing to work. They want to work. There's a massive backlog of people wanting their jobs. That condition's going to be there for the next 10 to 15 years if they realize what they want, which is, you know, 400 to 500 million more people coming into the cities.In this particular case \u2014 this is the assembly line that you saw; this is a shot of it. I had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field. I had to have them freeze for 10 seconds to get this shot. It took me five fake tries because they were just going. To slow them down was literally impossible. They were just wound up doing these things all day long, until the manager had to, with a stern voice, say, \"Okay, everybody freeze.\" It wasn't too bad, but they're driven to produce these things at an incredible rate.This is a textile mill doing synthetic silk, an oil byproduct. And what you're seeing here is, again, one of the most state-of-the-art textile mills. There are 500 of these machines; they're worth about 200,000 dollars each. So you have about 12 people running this, and they're just inspecting it \u2014 and they're just walking the lines. The machines are all running, absolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are. And I started getting in further and further into the factories. And that's a diptych. I do a lot of pairings to try and get the sense of scale in these places. This is a line where they get the threads and they wind the threads together, pre-going into the textile mills.Here's something that's far more labor-intensive, which is the making of shoes. This floor has about 1,500 workers on this floor. The company itself had about 10,000 employees, and they're doing domestic shoes. It was very hard to get into the international companies because I had to get permission from companies like Nike and Adidas, and that's very hard to get. And they don't want to let me in. But the domestic was much easier to do. It just gives you a sense of, again \u2014 and that's where, really, the whole migration of jobs started going over to China and making the shoes. Nike was one of the early ones. It was such a high labor component to it that it made a lot of sense to go after that labor market.This is a high-tech mobile phone: Bird mobile phone, one of the largest mobile makers in China. I think mobile phone companies are popping up, literally, on a weekly basis, and they have an explosive growth in mobile phones. This is a textile where they're doing shirts \u2014 Youngor, the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in China. And this next shot here is one of the lunchrooms. Everything is very efficient. While setting up this shot, people on average would spend eight to 10 minutes having a lunch. This was one of the biggest factories I've ever seen. They make coffeemakers here, the biggest coffeemaker and the biggest iron makers \u2014 they make 20 million of them in the world. There's 21,000 employees. This one factory \u2014 and they had several of them \u2014 is half a kilometer long. These are just recently shot \u2014 I just came back about a month ago, so you're the first ones to be seeing these, these new factory pictures I've taken.So it's taken me almost a year to gain access into these places. The other aspect of what's happening in China is that there's a real need for materials there. So a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here are being recycled and taken to China by ships. That's cubed metal. This is armatures, electrical armatures, where they're getting the copper and the high-end steel from electrical motors out, and recycling them. This is certainly connected to California and Silicon Valley. But this is what happens to most of the computers. Fifty percent of the world's computers end up in China to be recycled.It's referred to as \"e-waste\" there. And it is a bit of a problem. The way they recycle the boards is that they actually use the coal briquettes, which are used all through China, but they heat up the boards, and with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components. They're trying to get all the valued metals out of those components. But the toxic smells \u2014 when you come into a town that's actually doing this kind of burning of the boards, you can smell it a good five or 10 kilometers before you get there. Here's another operation. It's all cottage industries, so it's not big places \u2014 it's all in people's front porches, in their backyards, even in their homes they're burning boards,if there's a concern for somebody coming by \u2014 because it is considered in China to be illegal, doing it, but they can't stop the product from coming in. This portrait \u2014 I'm not usually known for portraits, but I couldn't resist this one, where she's been through Mao, and she's been through the Great Leap Forward, and the Cultural Revolution, and now she's sitting on her porch with this e-waste beside her. It's quite something. This is a road where it's been shored up by computer boards in one of the biggest towns where they're recycling. So that's the photographs that I wanted to show you.(Applause)I want to dedicate my wishes to my two girls. They've been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while I've been thinking. One's Megan, the one of the right, and Katja there. And to me the whole notion \u2014 the things I'm photographing are out of a great concern about the scale of our progress and what we call progress. And as much as there are great things around the corner \u2014 and it's palpable in this room \u2014 of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems, I'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect. And it isn't something that isn't just affecting our world, but it starts to go up \u2014 because I think we can start correcting our footprint and bring it down \u2014 but there's a growing footprint that's happening in Asia, and is growing at a rapid, rapid rate, and so I don't think we can equalize it. So ultimately the strategy, I think, here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution, because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well.So part of my thinking, and part of my wishes, is sitting with these thoughts in mind, and thinking about, \"How is their life going to be when they want to have children, or when they're ready to get married 20 years from now \u2014 or whatever, 15 years from now?\" And to me that has been the core behind most of my thinking \u2014 in my work, and also for this incredible chance to have some wishes. Wish one: world-changing. I want to use my images to persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability. And it is through communications today that I believe that that is not an unreal idea. Oh, and I went in search \u2014 I wanted to put what I had in mind, hitch it onto something. I didn't want a wish just to start from nowhere.One of them I'm starting from almost nothing, but the other one, I wanted to find out what's going on that's working right now. And Worldchanging.com is a fantastic blog, and that blog is now being visited by close to half-a-million people a month. And it just started about 14 months ago. And the beauty of what's going on there is that the tone of the conversation is the tone that I like. What they're doing there is that they're not \u2014 I think the environmental movement has failed in that it's used the stick too much; it's used the apocalyptic tone too much; it hasn't sold the positive aspects of being environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out. Whereas this conversation that is going on in this blog is about positive movements, about how to change our world in a better way, quickly. And it's looking at technology, and it's looking at new energy-saving devices, and it's looking at how to rethink and how to re-strategize the movement towards sustainability.And so for me, one of the things that I thought would be to put some of my work in the service of promoting the Worldchanging.com website. Some of you might know, he's a TEDster \u2014 Stephen Sagmeister and I are working on some layouts. And this is still in preliminary stages; these aren't the finals. But these images, with Worldchanging.com, can be placed into any kind of media. They could be posted through the Web; they could be used as a billboard or a bus shelter, or anything of that nature. So we're looking at this as trying to build out. And what we ended up discussing was that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text, and the text is blasted all over.What was unusual, according to Stephen, is less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image. And so in this case, because it's about a lot of these images and what they represent, and the kinds of questions they bring up, that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say, \"Well, what's Worldchanging.com, with these images, have to do?\" And hopefully inspire people to go to that website. So Worldchanging.com, and building that blog, and it is a blog, and I'm hoping that it isn't \u2014 I don't see it as the kind of blog where we're all going to follow each other to death. This one is one that will spoke out, and will go out, and to start reaching. Because right now there's conversations in India, in China, in South America \u2014 there's entries coming from all around the world. I think there's a chance to have a dialogue, a conversation about sustainability at Worldchanging.com. And anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic.Wish two is more of the bottom-up, ground-up one that I'm trying to work with. And this one is: I wish to launch a groundbreaking competition that motivates kids to invest ideas on, and invent ideas on, sustainability. And one of the things that came out \u2014 Allison, who actually nominated me, said something earlier on in a brainstorming. She said that recycling in Canada had a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six. And you think about it, you know, grade four \u2014 my wife and I, we say age seven is the age of reason, so they're into the age of reason. And they're pre-puberty. So it's this great window where they actually are \u2014 you can influence them. You know what happens at puberty? You know, we know that from earlier presentations.So my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids to start driving home ideas. Let them understand what sustainability is, and that they have a vested interest in it to happen. And one of the ways I thought of doing it is to use my prize, so I would take 30,000 or 40,000 dollars of the winnings, and the rest is going to be to manage this project, but to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands. But the other thing that I thought would be fantastic was to create these \u2014 call them \"prize targets.\" And so one could be for the best sustainable idea for an in-school project, the best one for a household project, or it could be the best community project for sustainability.And I also thought there should be a nice prize for the best artwork for \"In My World.\" And what would happen \u2014 it's a scalable thing. And if we can get people to put in things \u2014 whether it's equipment, like a media lab, or money to make the prize significant enough \u2014 and to open it up to all the schools that are public schools, or schools that are with kids that age, and make it a wide-open competition for them to go after those prizes and to submit them. And the prize has to be a verifiable thing, so it's not about just ideas. The art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them and do them, but the actual things have to be verifiable. In that way, what's happening is that we're motivating a certain age group to start thinking. And they're going to push that up, from the bottom \u2014 up into, I believe, into the households. And parents will be reacting to it, and trying to help them with the projects.And I think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability in a very positive way, and starts to teach them. They know about recycling now, but they don't really, I think, get sustainability in all the things, and the energy footprint, and how that matters. And to teach them, to me, would be a fantastic wish, and it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into. And again, in \"In My World,\" the competition \u2014 we would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it. And I like the words, \"in my world,\" because it gives possession of the world to the person who's doing it. It is my world; it's not someone else's. I want to help it; I want to do something with it. So I think it has a great opportunity to engage the imaginations \u2014 and great ideas, I think, come from kids \u2014 and engage their imagination into a project, and do something for schools. I think all schools could use extra equipment, extra cash \u2014 it's going to be an incentive for them to do that. And these are some of the ideas in terms of where we could possibly put in some promotion for \"In My World.\"And wish three is: Imax film. So I was told I should do one for myself, and I've always wanted to actually get involved with doing something. And the scale of my work, and the kinds of ideas I'm playing with \u2014 when I first saw an Imax film, I almost immediately thought, \"There's a real resonance between what I'm trying to do and the scale of what I try to do as a photographer.\" And I think there's a real possibility to reach new audiences if I had a chance. So I'm looking, really, for a mentor, because I just had my birthday. I'm 50, and I don't have time to go back to school right now \u2014 I'm too busy. So I need somebody who can put me on a quick catch-up course on how to do something like that, and lead me through the maze of how one does something like this. That would be fantastic. So those are my three wishes.(Applause)", "id": 56, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nWalk around for four months with three wishes,\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nand all the ideas will start to percolate up.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nI think everybody should do it -- think that you've got three wishes.\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nAnd what would you do?

And there was a pretty small population,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nand my father was an avid outdoorsman.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nSo I really had a chance to experience that.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nAnd I could never really understand exactly what it was, or how it was informing me.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nBut what I think it was telling me\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nis that we are this transient thing that's happening,\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nand that the nature that you see out there -- the untouched shorelines,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nthe untouched forest that I was able to see --\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nreally bring in a sense of that geological time,\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nthat this has gone on for a long time,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nand we're experiencing it in a different way.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nAnd that, to me, was a reference point that I think I needed to have\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nto be able to make the work that I did.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nAnd I did go out, and I did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nalong a roadside.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nThis rebirth of grass. And then I went out for years\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\ntrying to photograph the pristine landscape.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nBut as a fine-art photographer I somehow felt\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nthat it wouldn't catch on out there,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nthat there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine-art career.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nAnd I kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nor something of that nature, and I couldn't get away from it.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nSo I started to think of, how can I rethink the landscape?\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nI decided to rethink the landscape\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nas the landscape that we've transformed.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nI had a bit of an epiphany being lost in Pennsylvania,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nand I took a left turn trying to get back to the highway.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nAnd I ended up in a town called Frackville.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nI got out of the car, and I stood up,\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nand it was a coal-mining town. I did a 360 turnaround,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nand that became one of the most surreal landscapes I've ever seen.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nTotally transformed by man.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nAnd that got me to go out and look at mines like this,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nand go out and look at the largest industrial incursions\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nin the landscape that I could find.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nAnd that became the baseline of what I was doing.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nAnd it also became the theme that I felt that I could hold onto,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nand not have to re-invent myself --\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nthat this theme was large enough to become a life's work,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nto become something that I could sink my teeth into\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nand just research and find out where these industries are.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nAnd I think one of the things I also wanted to say in my thanks,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nwhich I kind of missed,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nwas to thank all the corporations who helped me get in.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nBecause it took negotiation for almost every one of these photographs --\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nto get into that place to make those photographs,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nand if it wasn't for those people letting me in\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nat the heads of those corporations,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nI would have never made this body of work.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nSo in that respect, to me, I'm not against the corporation.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nI own a corporation. I work with them,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nand I feel that we all need them and they're important.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nBut I am also for sustainability.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nSo there's this thing that is pulling me in both directions.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nAnd I'm not making an indictment towards what's happening here,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nbut it is a slow progression.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nSo I started thinking, well, we live in all these ages of man:\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nthe Stone Age, and the Iron Age, and the Copper Age.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nAnd these ages of man are still at work today.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nBut we've become totally disconnected from them.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nThere's something that we're not seeing there.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nAnd it's a scary thing as well. Because when we start looking\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nat the collective appetite for our lifestyles,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nand what we're doing to that landscape --\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nthat, to me, is something that is a very sobering moment for me to contemplate.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nAnd through my photographs,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nI'm hoping to be able to engage the audiences of my work,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nand to come up to it and not immediately be rejected by the image.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nNot to say, \"Oh my God, what is it?\" but to be challenged by it --\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nto say, \"Wow, this is beautiful,\" on one level,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nbut on the other level, \"This is scary. I shouldn't be enjoying it.\"\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nLike a forbidden pleasure. And it's that forbidden pleasure\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nthat I think is what resonates out there,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nand it gets people to look at these things,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nand it gets people to enter it. And it also, in a way, defines kind of what I feel, too --\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nthat I'm drawn to have a good life.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nI want a house, and I want a car.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nBut there's this consequence out there.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nAnd how do I begin to have that attraction, repulsion?\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nIt's even in my own conscience I'm having it,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nand here in my work, I'm trying to build that same toggle.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nThese things that I photographed -- this tire pile here\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nhad 45 million tires in it. It was the largest one.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nIt was only about an hour-and-a-half away from me, and it caught fire\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nabout four years ago. It's around Westley, California, around Modesto.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nAnd I decided to start looking at something that, to me, had --\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nif the earlier work of looking at the landscape\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nhad a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nin the recycling work that you're seeing here\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nwas starting to point to a direction. To me, it was our redemption.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nThat in the recycling work that I was doing,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nI'm looking for a practice, a human activity that is sustainable.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nThat if we keep putting things, through industrial and urban existence,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nback into the system --\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nif we keep doing that -- we can continue on.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nOf course, listening at the conference,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthere's many, many things that are coming. Bio-mimicry,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nand there's many other things that are coming on stream --\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nnanotechnology that may also prevent us from having\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nto go into that landscape and tear it apart.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nAnd we all look forward to those things.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nBut in the meantime, these things are scaling up.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nThese things are continuing to happen.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nWhat you're looking at here -- I went to Bangladesh,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nso I started to move away from North America;\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nI started to look at our world globally.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nThese images of Bangladesh\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\ncame out of a radio program I was listening to.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nThey were talking about Exxon Valdez,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nand that there was going to be a glut of oil tankers\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nbecause of the insurance industries.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nAnd that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nand 2004 was going to be the pinnacle.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nAnd I thought, \"My God, wouldn't that be something?\"\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nTo see the largest vessels of man being deconstructed by hand,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nliterally, in third-world countries.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nSo originally I was going to go to India.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd I was shut out of India because of a Greenpeace situation there,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nand then I was able to get into Bangladesh,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nand saw for the first time a third world, a view of it,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nthat I had never actually thought was possible.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\n130 million people living in an area the size of Wisconsin --\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\npeople everywhere -- the pollution was intense,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nand the working conditions were horrible.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nHere you're looking at some oil fields in California,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nsome of the biggest oil fields. And again, I started to think that --\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nthere was another epiphany --\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nthat the whole world I was living in was\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\na result of having plentiful oil.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nAnd that, to me, was again something that I started building on,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nand I continued to build on.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nSo this is a series I'm hoping to have ready\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nin about two or three years,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nunder the heading of \"The Oil Party.\"\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nBecause I think everything that we're involved in --\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nour clothing, our cars, our roads, and everything -- are directly a result.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nI'm going to move to some pictures of China.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nAnd for me China -- I started photographing it four years ago,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nand China truly is a question of sustainability in my mind,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nnot to mention that China, as well,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nhas a great effect on the industries that I grew up around.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nI came out of a blue-collar town,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\na GM town, and my father worked at GM,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nso I was very familiar with that kind of industry\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nand that also informed my work. But you know,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nto see China and the scale at which it's evolving, is quite something.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nSo what you see here is the Three Gorges Dam,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nand this is the largest dam by 50 percent ever attempted by man.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nMost of the engineers around the world left the project\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nbecause they said, \"It's just too big.\"\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nIn fact, when it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago,\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nthey were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nIt took fifteen days to fill it.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nSo this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\none of the largest reservoirs ever created.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nAnd what was also one of the bigger projects around that\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nwas moving 13 full-size cities up out of the reservoir,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nand flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nThis is a \"before and after.\" So that was before.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nAnd this is like 10 weeks later, demolished by hand.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nI think 11 of the buildings they used dynamite,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\neverything else was by hand. That was 10 weeks later.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nAnd this gives you an idea.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nAnd it was all the people who lived in those homes,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nwere the ones that were actually taking it apart\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nand working, and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nAnd these are some of the images from that.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nSo I spent about three trips to the Three Gorges Dam,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nlooking at that massive transformation of a landscape.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nAnd it looks like a bombed-out landscape, but it isn't.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nWhat it is, it's a landscape that is an intentional one.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nThis is a need for power, and they're willing to go through this\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nmassive transformation, on this scale, to get that power.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nAnd again, it's actually a relief for what's going on in China\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nbecause I think on the table right now,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nthere's 27 nuclear power stations to be built.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nThere hasn't been one built in North America for 20 years\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nbecause of the \"NIMBY\" problem -- \"Not In My BackYard.\"\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nBut in China they're saying, \"No, we're putting in 27 in the next 10 years.\"\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nAnd coal-burning furnaces are going in there\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nfor hydroelectric power literally weekly.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nSo coal itself is probably one of the largest problems.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nAnd one of the other things that happened in the Three Gorges --\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:44.958\na lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left was also lost;\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nsome of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nAnd 1.2 to 2 million people were relocated,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\ndepending on whose statistics you're looking at.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nAnd this is what they were building.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nThis is Wushan, one of the largest cities that was relocated.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nThis is the town hall for the city.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nAnd again, the rebuilding of the city -- to me, it was sad to see\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nthat they didn't really grab a lot of, I guess,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nwhat we know here, in terms of urban planning.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nThere were no parks; there were no green spaces.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nVery high-density living on the side of a hill.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nAnd here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nbut somehow were not connecting with them.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nHere is a sign that, translated, says, \"Obey the birth control law.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nBuild our science, civilized and advanced idea of marriage and giving birth.\"\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nSo here, if you look at this poster,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nit has all the trappings of Western culture.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nYou're seeing the tuxedos, the bouquets.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nBut what's really, to me, frightening about the picture\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nand about this billboard is the refinery in the background.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nSo it's like marrying up all the things that we have\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nand it's an adaptation of our way of life, full stop.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nAnd again, when you start seeing that kind of embrace,\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nwith a very, very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nwith a much higher footprint, it starts to become very sobering.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nThis is a shot in one of the biggest squares in Guangdong --\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nand this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nAnd there's about 130 million people in migration\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\ntrying to get into urban centers at all times,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nand in the next 10 to 15 years, are expecting\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nanother 400 to 500 million people to migrate\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:41.958\ninto the urban centers like Shanghai and the manufacturing centers.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nThe manufacturers are --\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nthe domestics are usually -- you can tell a domestic factory by the fact\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nthat they all use the same color uniforms.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nSo this is a pink uniform at this factory. It's a shoe factory.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nAnd they have dorms for the workers.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nSo they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nThis is one of the biggest shoe factories, the Yuyuan shoe factory\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nnear Shenzhen. It has 90,000 employees making shoes.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nThis is a shift change, one of three.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nThere's two factories of this scale in the same town.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nThis is one with 45,000, so every lunch,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nthere's about 12,000 coming through for lunch.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nThey sit down; they have about 20 minutes.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nThe next round comes in. It's an incredible workforce\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nthat's building there. Shanghai --\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nI'm looking at the urban renewal in Shanghai,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nand this is a whole area that will be flattened\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nand turned into skyscrapers in the next five years.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nWhat's also happening in Shanghai is --\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nChina is changing because this wouldn't have happened\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nfive years ago, for instance. This is a holdout.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nThey're called dengzahoos -- they're like pin tacks to the ground.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nThey won't move. They're not negotiating.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nThey're not getting enough, so they're not going to move.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nAnd so they're holding off until they get a deal with them.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nAnd they've been actually quite successful in getting better deals\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nbecause most of them are getting a raw deal.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nThey're being put out about two hours --\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nthe communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nor maybe even thousands of years,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nare being broken up and spread across in the suburban areas\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\noutside of Shanghai. But these are a whole series of guys\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nholding out in this reconstruction of Shanghai.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nProbably the largest urban-renewal project, I think,\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\never attempted on the planet.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nAnd then the embrace of the things that they're replacing it with --\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nagain, one of my wishes, and I never ended up going there,\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nwas to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nThe kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nand these are called the villas.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nAnd also, like right now, they're just moving.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nThe scaffolding is still on, and this is an e-waste area,\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nand if you looked in the foreground on the big print,\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nyou'd see that the industry -- their industry -- they're all recycling.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nSo the industry's already growing\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\naround these new developments.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nThis is a five-level bridge in Shanghai.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nShanghai was a very intriguing city -- it's exploding on a level\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nthat I don't think any city has experienced.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nIn fact, even Shenzhen, the economic zone --\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:23.958\none of the first ones -- 15 years ago was about 100,000 people,\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nand today it boasts about 10 to 11 million.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nSo that gives you an idea of the kinds of migrations and the speed with which --\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nthis is just the taxis being built by Volkswagen.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nThere's 9,000 of them here,\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nand they're being built for most of the big cities,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nBeijing and Shanghai, Shenzhen.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nAnd this isn't even the domestic car market; this is the taxi market.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nAnd what we would see here as a suburban development --\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\na similar thing, but they're all high-rises.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nSo they'll put 20 or 40 up at a time,\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nand they just go up in the same way\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nas a single-family dwelling would go up here in an area.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nAnd the density is quite incredible.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nAnd one of the things in this picture that I wanted to point out\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nis that when I saw these kinds of buildings,\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nI was shocked to see\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nthat they're not using a central air-conditioning system;\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nevery window has an air conditioner in it.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nAnd I'm sure there are people here who probably\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nknow better than I do about efficiencies,\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nbut I can't imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioner\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nis a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nAnd when you start looking at that,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nand then you start factoring up into a city the size of Shanghai,\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nit's literally a forest of skyscrapers.\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nIt's breathtaking, in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming.\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nAnd you can see in the foreground of this picture,\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nit's still one of the last areas that was being held up.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nRight now that's all cleared out -- this was done about eight months ago --\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nand high-rises are now going up into that central spot.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nSo a skyscraper is built, literally, overnight in Shanghai.\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nMost recently I went in, and I started looking\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nat some of the biggest industries in China.\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:30.958\nAnd this is Baosteel, right outside of Shanghai.\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nThis is the coal supply for the steel factory -- 18 square kilometers.\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nIt's an incredibly massive operation, I think 15,000 workers,\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nfive cupolas, and the sixth one's coming in here.\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nSo they're building very large blast furnaces\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nto try to deal with the demand for steel in China.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nSo this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot.\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nAnd again, looking at these images, there's this constant, like, haze that you're seeing.\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nThis is going to show you, real time, an assembler. It's a circuit breaker.\n\n00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:28.958\n10 hours a day at this speed.\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:44.958\nI think one of the issues\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nthat we here are facing with China,\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nis that they're using a lot of the latest production technology.\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nIn that one, there were 400 people that worked on the floor.\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nAnd I asked the manager to point out five of your fastest producers,\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nand then I went and looked at each one of them for about 15 or 20 minutes,\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nand picked this one woman.\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nAnd it was just lightning fast;\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nthe way she was working was almost unbelievable.\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nBut that is the trick that they've got right now,\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nthat they're winning with, is that they're using\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:19.958\nall the latest technologies and extrusion machines,\n\n00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:23.958\nand bringing all the components into play,\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nbut the assembly is where they're actually bringing in --\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:31.958\nthe country workers are very willing to work. They want to work.\n\n00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:35.958\nThere's a massive backlog of people wanting their jobs.\n\n00:19:35.958 --> 00:19:38.958\nThat condition's going to be there for the next 10 to 15 years\n\n00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:41.958\nif they realize what they want, which is, you know,\n\n00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:44.958\n400 to 500 million more people coming into the cities.\n\n00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:47.958\nIn this particular case -- this is the assembly line that you saw;\n\n00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:48.958\nthis is a shot of it.\n\n00:19:48.958 --> 00:19:51.958\nI had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field.\n\n00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:56.958\nI had to have them freeze for 10 seconds to get this shot.\n\n00:19:56.958 --> 00:19:59.958\nIt took me five fake tries\n\n00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:03.958\nbecause they were just going. To slow them down was literally impossible.\n\n00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:06.958\nThey were just wound up doing these things all day long,\n\n00:20:06.958 --> 00:20:08.958\nuntil the manager had to, with a stern voice, say,\n\n00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:10.958\n\"Okay, everybody freeze.\"\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:13.958\nIt wasn't too bad,\n\n00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:19.958\nbut they're driven to produce these things at an incredible rate.\n\n00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:26.958\nThis is a textile mill doing synthetic silk, an oil byproduct.\n\n00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:28.958\nAnd what you're seeing here is,\n\n00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:32.958\nagain, one of the most state-of-the-art textile mills.\n\n00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:35.958\nThere are 500 of these machines; they're worth about 200,000 dollars each.\n\n00:20:35.958 --> 00:20:37.958\nSo you have about 12 people running this,\n\n00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:40.958\nand they're just inspecting it -- and they're just walking the lines.\n\n00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:42.958\nThe machines are all running,\n\n00:20:42.958 --> 00:20:45.958\nabsolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are.\n\n00:20:45.958 --> 00:20:50.958\nAnd I started getting in further and further into the factories.\n\n00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:53.958\nAnd that's a diptych. I do a lot of pairings\n\n00:20:53.958 --> 00:20:56.958\nto try and get the sense of scale in these places.\n\n00:20:56.958 --> 00:20:58.958\nThis is a line where they get the threads\n\n00:20:58.958 --> 00:21:00.958\nand they wind the threads together,\n\n00:21:00.958 --> 00:21:04.958\npre-going into the textile mills.\n\n00:21:04.958 --> 00:21:06.958\nHere's something that's far more labor-intensive,\n\n00:21:06.958 --> 00:21:08.958\nwhich is the making of shoes.\n\n00:21:08.958 --> 00:21:13.958\nThis floor has about 1,500 workers on this floor.\n\n00:21:13.958 --> 00:21:17.958\nThe company itself had about 10,000 employees,\n\n00:21:17.958 --> 00:21:20.958\nand they're doing domestic shoes.\n\n00:21:20.958 --> 00:21:23.958\nIt was very hard to get into the international companies\n\n00:21:23.958 --> 00:21:27.958\nbecause I had to get permission from companies like Nike and Adidas,\n\n00:21:27.958 --> 00:21:29.958\nand that's very hard to get.\n\n00:21:29.958 --> 00:21:31.958\nAnd they don't want to let me in.\n\n00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:33.958\nBut the domestic was much easier to do.\n\n00:21:33.958 --> 00:21:36.958\nIt just gives you a sense of, again -- and that's where,\n\n00:21:36.958 --> 00:21:39.958\nreally, the whole migration of jobs started going over to China\n\n00:21:39.958 --> 00:21:42.958\nand making the shoes. Nike was one of the early ones.\n\n00:21:42.958 --> 00:21:47.958\nIt was such a high labor component to it\n\n00:21:47.958 --> 00:21:50.958\nthat it made a lot of sense to go after that labor market.\n\n00:21:50.958 --> 00:21:54.958\nThis is a high-tech mobile phone: Bird mobile phone,\n\n00:21:54.958 --> 00:21:56.958\none of the largest mobile makers in China.\n\n00:21:56.958 --> 00:21:59.958\nI think mobile phone companies\n\n00:21:59.958 --> 00:22:03.958\nare popping up, literally, on a weekly basis,\n\n00:22:03.958 --> 00:22:07.958\nand they have an explosive growth in mobile phones.\n\n00:22:07.958 --> 00:22:11.958\nThis is a textile where they're doing shirts --\n\n00:22:11.958 --> 00:22:14.958\nYoungor, the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in China.\n\n00:22:14.958 --> 00:22:18.958\nAnd this next shot here is one of the lunchrooms.\n\n00:22:18.958 --> 00:22:20.958\nEverything is very efficient.\n\n00:22:20.958 --> 00:22:22.958\nWhile setting up this shot,\n\n00:22:22.958 --> 00:22:28.958\npeople on average would spend eight to 10 minutes having a lunch.\n\n00:22:30.958 --> 00:22:32.958\nThis was one of the biggest factories I've ever seen.\n\n00:22:32.958 --> 00:22:37.958\nThey make coffeemakers here, the biggest coffeemaker\n\n00:22:37.958 --> 00:22:41.958\nand the biggest iron makers --\n\n00:22:41.958 --> 00:22:43.958\nthey make 20 million of them in the world.\n\n00:22:43.958 --> 00:22:48.958\nThere's 21,000 employees. This one factory -- and they had several of them --\n\n00:22:48.958 --> 00:22:50.958\nis half a kilometer long.\n\n00:22:50.958 --> 00:22:53.958\nThese are just recently shot -- I just came back about a month ago,\n\n00:22:53.958 --> 00:22:56.958\nso you're the first ones to be seeing these,\n\n00:22:56.958 --> 00:22:59.958\nthese new factory pictures I've taken.\n\n00:22:59.958 --> 00:23:04.958\nSo it's taken me almost a year to gain access into these places.\n\n00:23:05.958 --> 00:23:08.958\nThe other aspect of what's happening in China\n\n00:23:08.958 --> 00:23:11.958\nis that there's a real need for materials there.\n\n00:23:11.958 --> 00:23:14.958\nSo a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here\n\n00:23:14.958 --> 00:23:17.958\nare being recycled and taken to China by ships.\n\n00:23:17.958 --> 00:23:21.958\nThat's cubed metal. This is armatures, electrical armatures,\n\n00:23:21.958 --> 00:23:23.958\nwhere they're getting the copper and the high-end steel\n\n00:23:23.958 --> 00:23:28.958\nfrom electrical motors out, and recycling them.\n\n00:23:28.958 --> 00:23:31.958\nThis is certainly connected to California and Silicon Valley.\n\n00:23:31.958 --> 00:23:34.958\nBut this is what happens to most of the computers.\n\n00:23:34.958 --> 00:23:38.958\nFifty percent of the world's computers end up in China to be recycled.\n\n00:23:38.958 --> 00:23:40.958\nIt's referred to as \"e-waste\" there.\n\n00:23:40.958 --> 00:23:44.958\nAnd it is a bit of a problem. The way they recycle the boards\n\n00:23:44.958 --> 00:23:47.958\nis that they actually use the coal briquettes,\n\n00:23:47.958 --> 00:23:50.958\nwhich are used all through China, but they heat up the boards,\n\n00:23:50.958 --> 00:23:53.958\nand with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components.\n\n00:23:53.958 --> 00:23:56.958\nThey're trying to get all the valued metals out of those components.\n\n00:23:56.958 --> 00:23:59.958\nBut the toxic smells -- when you come into a town\n\n00:23:59.958 --> 00:24:02.958\nthat's actually doing this kind of burning of the boards,\n\n00:24:02.958 --> 00:24:05.958\nyou can smell it a good five or 10 kilometers before you get there.\n\n00:24:05.958 --> 00:24:08.958\nHere's another operation. It's all cottage industries,\n\n00:24:08.958 --> 00:24:13.958\nso it's not big places -- it's all in people's front porches,\n\n00:24:13.958 --> 00:24:19.958\nin their backyards, even in their homes they're burning boards,\n\n00:24:19.958 --> 00:24:22.958\nif there's a concern for somebody coming by --\n\n00:24:22.958 --> 00:24:25.958\nbecause it is considered in China to be illegal, doing it,\n\n00:24:25.958 --> 00:24:29.958\nbut they can't stop the product from coming in.\n\n00:24:29.958 --> 00:24:32.958\nThis portrait -- I'm not usually known for portraits,\n\n00:24:32.958 --> 00:24:36.958\nbut I couldn't resist this one, where she's been through Mao,\n\n00:24:36.958 --> 00:24:38.958\nand she's been through the Great Leap Forward,\n\n00:24:38.958 --> 00:24:41.958\nand the Cultural Revolution, and now she's sitting on her porch\n\n00:24:41.958 --> 00:24:44.958\nwith this e-waste beside her. It's quite something.\n\n00:24:44.958 --> 00:24:48.958\nThis is a road where it's been shored up by computer boards\n\n00:24:48.958 --> 00:24:50.958\nin one of the biggest towns where they're recycling.\n\n00:24:51.958 --> 00:24:55.958\nSo that's the photographs that I wanted to show you.\n\n00:24:55.958 --> 00:24:57.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:24:57.958 --> 00:24:59.958\nI want to dedicate my wishes to my two girls.\n\n00:24:59.958 --> 00:25:02.958\nThey've been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while I've been thinking.\n\n00:25:02.958 --> 00:25:05.958\nOne's Megan, the one of the right, and Katja there.\n\n00:25:05.958 --> 00:25:07.958\nAnd to me the whole notion --\n\n00:25:07.958 --> 00:25:09.958\nthe things I'm photographing are out of a great concern\n\n00:25:09.958 --> 00:25:14.958\nabout the scale of our progress and what we call progress.\n\n00:25:14.958 --> 00:25:17.958\nAnd as much as there are great things around the corner --\n\n00:25:17.958 --> 00:25:20.958\nand it's palpable in this room --\n\n00:25:20.958 --> 00:25:22.958\nof all of the things that are just about to break\n\n00:25:22.958 --> 00:25:25.958\nthat can solve so many problems,\n\n00:25:25.958 --> 00:25:28.958\nI'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world\n\n00:25:28.958 --> 00:25:31.958\nand will start to have a positive effect.\n\n00:25:31.958 --> 00:25:33.958\nAnd it isn't something that isn't just affecting our world,\n\n00:25:33.958 --> 00:25:36.958\nbut it starts to go up -- because I think we can start correcting\n\n00:25:36.958 --> 00:25:41.958\nour footprint and bring it down -- but there's a growing footprint\n\n00:25:41.958 --> 00:25:45.958\nthat's happening in Asia, and is growing at a rapid, rapid rate,\n\n00:25:45.958 --> 00:25:50.958\nand so I don't think we can equalize it. So ultimately the strategy,\n\n00:25:50.958 --> 00:25:54.958\nI think, here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution,\n\n00:25:54.958 --> 00:25:58.958\nbecause it is going to be connected to our evolution as well.\n\n00:25:58.958 --> 00:26:01.958\nSo part of my thinking, and part of my wishes,\n\n00:26:01.958 --> 00:26:04.958\nis sitting with these thoughts in mind,\n\n00:26:04.958 --> 00:26:06.958\nand thinking about,\n\n00:26:06.958 --> 00:26:09.958\n\"How is their life going to be when they want to have children,\n\n00:26:09.958 --> 00:26:12.958\nor when they're ready to get married 20 years from now -- or whatever,\n\n00:26:12.958 --> 00:26:14.958\n15 years from now?\"\n\n00:26:14.958 --> 00:26:17.958\nAnd to me that has been the core behind most of my thinking --\n\n00:26:17.958 --> 00:26:25.958\nin my work, and also for this incredible chance to have some wishes.\n\n00:26:25.958 --> 00:26:29.958\nWish one: world-changing. I want to use my images\n\n00:26:29.958 --> 00:26:34.958\nto persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability.\n\n00:26:34.958 --> 00:26:37.958\nAnd it is through communications today\n\n00:26:37.958 --> 00:26:41.958\nthat I believe that that is not an unreal idea.\n\n00:26:41.958 --> 00:26:45.958\nOh, and I went in search -- I wanted to put what I had in mind,\n\n00:26:45.958 --> 00:26:49.958\nhitch it onto something. I didn't want a wish just to start from nowhere.\n\n00:26:49.958 --> 00:26:52.958\nOne of them I'm starting from almost nothing, but the other one,\n\n00:26:52.958 --> 00:26:55.958\nI wanted to find out what's going on that's working right now.\n\n00:26:55.958 --> 00:27:03.958\nAnd Worldchanging.com is a fantastic blog, and that blog\n\n00:27:03.958 --> 00:27:08.958\nis now being visited by close to half-a-million people a month.\n\n00:27:08.958 --> 00:27:13.958\nAnd it just started about 14 months ago.\n\n00:27:13.958 --> 00:27:15.958\nAnd the beauty of what's going on there\n\n00:27:15.958 --> 00:27:21.958\nis that the tone of the conversation is the tone that I like.\n\n00:27:21.958 --> 00:27:24.958\nWhat they're doing there is that they're not --\n\n00:27:24.958 --> 00:27:27.958\nI think the environmental movement has failed\n\n00:27:27.958 --> 00:27:29.958\nin that it's used the stick too much;\n\n00:27:29.958 --> 00:27:32.958\nit's used the apocalyptic tone too much;\n\n00:27:32.958 --> 00:27:37.958\nit hasn't sold the positive aspects of\n\n00:27:37.958 --> 00:27:40.958\nbeing environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out.\n\n00:27:40.958 --> 00:27:43.958\nWhereas this conversation that is going on in this blog\n\n00:27:43.958 --> 00:27:46.958\nis about positive movements,\n\n00:27:46.958 --> 00:27:49.958\nabout how to change our world in a better way, quickly.\n\n00:27:49.958 --> 00:27:54.958\nAnd it's looking at technology, and it's looking at new energy-saving devices,\n\n00:27:54.958 --> 00:27:58.958\nand it's looking at how to rethink and how to re-strategize\n\n00:27:58.958 --> 00:28:01.958\nthe movement towards sustainability.\n\n00:28:01.958 --> 00:28:05.958\nAnd so for me, one of the things that I thought\n\n00:28:05.958 --> 00:28:11.958\nwould be to put some of my work in the service of promoting\n\n00:28:11.958 --> 00:28:14.958\nthe Worldchanging.com website.\n\n00:28:14.958 --> 00:28:19.958\nSome of you might know, he's a TEDster -- Stephen Sagmeister and I\n\n00:28:19.958 --> 00:28:23.958\nare working on some layouts. And this is still in preliminary stages;\n\n00:28:23.958 --> 00:28:29.958\nthese aren't the finals. But these images, with Worldchanging.com,\n\n00:28:29.958 --> 00:28:31.958\ncan be placed into any kind of media.\n\n00:28:31.958 --> 00:28:34.958\nThey could be posted through the Web;\n\n00:28:34.958 --> 00:28:41.958\nthey could be used as a billboard or a bus shelter, or anything of that nature.\n\n00:28:41.958 --> 00:28:45.958\nSo we're looking at this as trying to build out.\n\n00:28:45.958 --> 00:28:47.958\nAnd what we ended up discussing\n\n00:28:47.958 --> 00:28:52.958\nwas that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text,\n\n00:28:52.958 --> 00:28:54.958\nand the text is blasted all over.\n\n00:28:54.958 --> 00:28:56.958\nWhat was unusual, according to Stephen,\n\n00:28:56.958 --> 00:29:01.958\nis less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image.\n\n00:29:01.958 --> 00:29:03.958\nAnd so in this case,\n\n00:29:03.958 --> 00:29:06.958\nbecause it's about a lot of these images and what they represent,\n\n00:29:06.958 --> 00:29:08.958\nand the kinds of questions they bring up,\n\n00:29:08.958 --> 00:29:13.958\nthat we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say,\n\n00:29:13.958 --> 00:29:18.958\n\"Well, what's Worldchanging.com, with these images, have to do?\"\n\n00:29:18.958 --> 00:29:22.958\nAnd hopefully inspire people to go to that website.\n\n00:29:22.958 --> 00:29:26.958\nSo Worldchanging.com, and building that blog, and it is a blog,\n\n00:29:26.958 --> 00:29:29.958\nand I'm hoping that it isn't -- I don't see it as the kind of blog\n\n00:29:29.958 --> 00:29:31.958\nwhere we're all going to follow each other to death.\n\n00:29:31.958 --> 00:29:34.958\nThis one is one that will spoke out, and will go out,\n\n00:29:34.958 --> 00:29:37.958\nand to start reaching. Because right now there's conversations\n\n00:29:37.958 --> 00:29:39.958\nin India, in China, in South America --\n\n00:29:39.958 --> 00:29:42.958\nthere's entries coming from all around the world.\n\n00:29:42.958 --> 00:29:45.958\nI think there's a chance to have a dialogue, a conversation\n\n00:29:45.958 --> 00:29:48.958\nabout sustainability at Worldchanging.com.\n\n00:29:48.958 --> 00:29:53.958\nAnd anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic.\n\n00:29:53.958 --> 00:29:56.958\nWish two is more of the bottom-up, ground-up one that I'm trying to work with.\n\n00:29:56.958 --> 00:30:00.958\nAnd this one is: I wish to launch a groundbreaking competition\n\n00:30:00.958 --> 00:30:07.958\nthat motivates kids to invest ideas on, and invent ideas on, sustainability.\n\n00:30:07.958 --> 00:30:09.958\nAnd one of the things that came out --\n\n00:30:09.958 --> 00:30:12.958\nAllison, who actually nominated me, said something earlier on\n\n00:30:12.958 --> 00:30:15.958\nin a brainstorming. She said that recycling in Canada\n\n00:30:15.958 --> 00:30:23.958\nhad a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six.\n\n00:30:23.958 --> 00:30:25.958\nAnd you think about it, you know,\n\n00:30:25.958 --> 00:30:29.958\ngrade four -- my wife and I, we say age seven is the age of reason,\n\n00:30:29.958 --> 00:30:33.958\nso they're into the age of reason. And they're pre-puberty.\n\n00:30:33.958 --> 00:30:35.958\nSo it's this great window where they actually are --\n\n00:30:35.958 --> 00:30:38.958\nyou can influence them. You know what happens at puberty?\n\n00:30:38.958 --> 00:30:41.958\nYou know, we know that from earlier presentations.\n\n00:30:41.958 --> 00:30:48.958\nSo my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids\n\n00:30:48.958 --> 00:30:52.958\nto start driving home ideas. Let them understand what sustainability is,\n\n00:30:52.958 --> 00:30:54.958\nand that they have a vested interest in it to happen.\n\n00:30:54.958 --> 00:30:59.958\nAnd one of the ways I thought of doing it is to use my prize,\n\n00:30:59.958 --> 00:31:03.958\nso I would take 30,000 or 40,000 dollars of the winnings,\n\n00:31:03.958 --> 00:31:05.958\nand the rest is going to be to manage this project,\n\n00:31:05.958 --> 00:31:08.958\nbut to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands.\n\n00:31:08.958 --> 00:31:10.958\nBut the other thing that I thought would be fantastic\n\n00:31:10.958 --> 00:31:14.958\nwas to create these -- call them \"prize targets.\"\n\n00:31:14.958 --> 00:31:18.958\nAnd so one could be for the best sustainable idea\n\n00:31:18.958 --> 00:31:23.958\nfor an in-school project, the best one for a household project,\n\n00:31:23.958 --> 00:31:26.958\nor it could be the best community project for sustainability.\n\n00:31:26.958 --> 00:31:29.958\nAnd I also thought there should be a nice prize\n\n00:31:29.958 --> 00:31:33.958\nfor the best artwork for \"In My World.\" And what would happen --\n\n00:31:33.958 --> 00:31:38.958\nit's a scalable thing. And if we can get people to put in things --\n\n00:31:38.958 --> 00:31:40.958\nwhether it's equipment, like a media lab,\n\n00:31:40.958 --> 00:31:42.958\nor money to make the prize significant enough --\n\n00:31:42.958 --> 00:31:47.958\nand to open it up to all the schools that are public schools,\n\n00:31:47.958 --> 00:31:49.958\nor schools that are with kids that age,\n\n00:31:49.958 --> 00:31:52.958\nand make it a wide-open competition for them\n\n00:31:52.958 --> 00:31:54.958\nto go after those prizes and to submit them.\n\n00:31:54.958 --> 00:31:59.958\nAnd the prize has to be a verifiable thing, so it's not about just ideas.\n\n00:31:59.958 --> 00:32:02.958\nThe art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them\n\n00:32:02.958 --> 00:32:05.958\nand do them, but the actual things have to be verifiable.\n\n00:32:05.958 --> 00:32:07.958\nIn that way, what's happening is that\n\n00:32:07.958 --> 00:32:10.958\nwe're motivating a certain age group to start thinking.\n\n00:32:10.958 --> 00:32:15.958\nAnd they're going to push that up, from the bottom -- up into,\n\n00:32:15.958 --> 00:32:19.958\nI believe, into the households. And parents will be reacting to it,\n\n00:32:19.958 --> 00:32:21.958\nand trying to help them with the projects.\n\n00:32:21.958 --> 00:32:25.958\nAnd I think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability\n\n00:32:25.958 --> 00:32:27.958\nin a very positive way,\n\n00:32:27.958 --> 00:32:30.958\nand starts to teach them. They know about recycling now,\n\n00:32:30.958 --> 00:32:33.958\nbut they don't really, I think, get sustainability in all the things,\n\n00:32:33.958 --> 00:32:36.958\nand the energy footprint, and how that matters.\n\n00:32:36.958 --> 00:32:40.958\nAnd to teach them, to me, would be a fantastic wish,\n\n00:32:40.958 --> 00:32:44.958\nand it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into.\n\n00:32:45.958 --> 00:32:47.958\nAnd again, in \"In My World,\" the competition --\n\n00:32:47.958 --> 00:32:51.958\nwe would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it.\n\n00:32:51.958 --> 00:32:53.958\nAnd I like the words, \"in my world,\"\n\n00:32:53.958 --> 00:32:56.958\nbecause it gives possession of the world to the person who's doing it.\n\n00:32:56.958 --> 00:32:59.958\nIt is my world; it's not someone else's. I want to help it;\n\n00:32:59.958 --> 00:33:04.958\nI want to do something with it. So I think it has a great opportunity\n\n00:33:04.958 --> 00:33:09.958\nto engage the imaginations -- and great ideas, I think, come from kids --\n\n00:33:09.958 --> 00:33:11.958\nand engage their imagination into a project,\n\n00:33:11.958 --> 00:33:13.958\nand do something for schools.\n\n00:33:13.958 --> 00:33:16.958\nI think all schools could use extra equipment, extra cash --\n\n00:33:16.958 --> 00:33:20.958\nit's going to be an incentive for them to do that.\n\n00:33:20.958 --> 00:33:23.958\nAnd these are some of the ideas in terms of where\n\n00:33:23.958 --> 00:33:29.958\nwe could possibly put in some promotion for \"In My World.\"\n\n00:33:29.958 --> 00:33:35.958\nAnd wish three is: Imax film. So I was told I should do one for myself,\n\n00:33:35.958 --> 00:33:39.958\nand I've always wanted to actually get involved with doing something.\n\n00:33:39.958 --> 00:33:42.958\nAnd the scale of my work, and the kinds of ideas I'm playing with --\n\n00:33:42.958 --> 00:33:45.958\nwhen I first saw an Imax film, I almost immediately thought,\n\n00:33:45.958 --> 00:33:47.958\n\"There's a real resonance between what I'm trying to do\n\n00:33:47.958 --> 00:33:50.958\nand the scale of what I try to do as a photographer.\"\n\n00:33:50.958 --> 00:33:54.958\nAnd I think there's a real possibility\n\n00:33:54.958 --> 00:33:56.958\nto reach new audiences if I had a chance.\n\n00:33:56.958 --> 00:34:00.958\nSo I'm looking, really, for a mentor, because I just had my birthday.\n\n00:34:00.958 --> 00:34:03.958\nI'm 50, and I don't have time to go back to school right now --\n\n00:34:03.958 --> 00:34:05.958\nI'm too busy. So I need somebody\n\n00:34:05.958 --> 00:34:10.958\nwho can put me on a quick catch-up course on how to do something like that,\n\n00:34:10.958 --> 00:34:14.958\nand lead me through the maze of how one does something like this.\n\n00:34:14.958 --> 00:34:17.958\nThat would be fantastic. So those are my three wishes.\n\n00:34:17.958 --> 00:34:18.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "My wish: Three unusual medical inventions", "duration": "1609", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_fischell_on_medical_inventing", "transcript": "I'm going to discuss with you three of my inventions that can have an effect on 10 to a 100 million people, which we will hope to see happen.

And I'd like to talk very briefly about three new inventions that will change the lives of many people.At the present time, it takes an average of three hours after the first symptoms of a heart attack are recognized by the patient, before that patient arrives at an emergency room. And people with silent ischemia \u2014 which, translated into English, means they don't have any symptoms \u2014 it takes even longer for them to get to the hospital. The AMI, Acute Myocardial Infarction, which is a doctor's big word so they can charge you more money \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 means a heart attack. Annual incidence: 1.2 million Americans. Mortality: 300,000 people dying each year. About half of them, 600,000, have permanent damage to their heart that will cause them to have very bad problems later on. Thus 900,000 people either have died or have significant damage to their heart muscle. Symptoms are often denied by the patient, particularly us men, because we are very brave. We are very brave, and we don't want to admit that I'm having a hell of a chest pain. Then, approximately 25 percent of all patients never have any symptoms. What are we going to do about them? How can we save their lives? It's particularly true of diabetics and elderly women.Well, what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack? A means to determine if there's a complete blockage of a coronary artery. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a heart attack. The means consist of noting something a little technical, ST segment elevation of the electrogram \u2014 translated into English, that means that if there's an electrical signal in the heart, and one part of the ECG \u2014 which we call the ST segment \u2014 elevates, that is a sure sign of a heart attack. And if we had a computer put into the body of a person who's at risk, we could know, before they even have symptoms, that they're having a heart attack, to save their life. Well, the doctor can program a level of this ST elevation voltage that will trigger an emergency alarm, vibration like your cell phone, but right by your clavicle bone. And when it goes beep, beep, beep, you better do something about it, because if you want to live you have to get to some medical treatment.So we have to try these devices out because the FDA won't just let us use them on people unless we try it out first, and the best model for this happens to be pigs. And what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin, like you see in an emergency room, and I'm going to show you why they don't work very well. And then we put a lead, which is a wire, in the right ventricle inside the heart, which does the electrogram, which is the signal voltage from inside the heart. Well, with the pig, at the baseline, before we blocked the pig's artery to simulate a heart attack, that was the signal. After 43 seconds, even an expert couldn't tell the difference, and after three minutes \u2014 well, if you really studied it, you'd see a difference. But what happened when we looked inside the pig's heart, to the electrogram?There was the baseline \u2014 first of all, a much bigger and more reliable signal. Second of all, I'll bet even you people who are untrained can see the difference, and we see here an ST segment elevation right after this sharp line. Look at the difference there. It doesn't take much \u2014 every layperson could see that difference, and computers can be programmed to easily detect it. Then, look at that after three minutes. We see that the signal that's actually in the heart, we can use it to tell people that they're having a heart attack even before they have symptoms so we can save their life.Then we tried it with my son, Dr. Tim Fischell, we tried it on some human patients who had to have a stent put in. Well, he kept the balloon filled to block the artery, to simulate a blockage, which is what a heart attack is. And it's not hard to see that \u2014 the baseline is the first picture on the upper left. Next to it, at 30 seconds, you see this rise here, then this rise \u2014 that's the ST elevation. And if we had a computer that could detect it, we could tell you you're having a heart attack so early it could save your life and prevent congestive heart failure. And then he did it again. We filled the balloon again a few minutes later and here you see, even after 10 seconds, a great rise in this piece, which we can have computers inside, under your chest like a pacemaker, with a wire into your heart like a pacemaker. And computers don't go to sleep. We have a little battery and on this little battery that computer will run for five years without needing replacement.What does the system look like? Well, on the left is the IMD, which is Implantable Medical Device, and tonight in the tent you can see it \u2014 they've exhibited it. It's about this big, the size of a pacemaker. It's implanted with very conventional techniques. And the EXD is an External Device that you can have on your night table. It'll wake you up and tell you to get your tail to the emergency room when the thing goes off because, if you don't, you're in deep doo-doo. And then, finally, a programmer that will set the level of the stimulation, which is the level which says you are having a heart attack.The FDA says, OK, test this final device after it's built in some animal, which we said is a pig, so we had to get this pig to have a heart attack. And when you go to the farmyard, you can't easily get pigs to have heart attacks, so we said, well, we're experts in stents. Tonight you'll see some of our invented stents. We said, so we'll put in a stent, but we're not going to put in a stent that we'd put in people. We're putting in a copper stent, and this copper stent erodes the artery and causes heart attacks. That's not very nice, but, after all, we had to find out what the answer is. So we took two copper stents and we put it in the artery of this pig, and let me show you the result that's very gratifying as far as people who have heart disease are concerned.So there it was, Thursday morning we stopped the pig's medication and there is his electrogram, the signal from inside the pig's heart coming out by radio telemetry. Then, on Friday at 6:43, he began to get certain signs, which later we had the pig run around \u2014 I'm not going to go into this early stage. But look what happened at 10:06 after we removed this pig's medication that kept him from having a heart attack. Any one of you now is an expert on ST elevation. Can you see it there? Can you see it in the picture after the big rise of the QRS \u2014 you see ST elevation? This pig at 10:06 was having a heart attack. What happens after you have the heart attack, this blockage? Your rhythm becomes irregular, and that's what happened 45 minutes later. Then, ventricular fibrillation, the heart quivers instead of beats \u2014 this is just before death of the pig \u2014 and then the pig died; it went flat-line. But we had a little bit over an hour where we could've saved this pig's life. Well, because of the FDA, we didn't save the pig's life, because we need to do this type of animal research for humans. But when it comes to the sake of a human, we can save their life. We can save the lives of people who are at high risk for a heart attack.What is the response to acute myocardial infarction, a heart attack, today? Well, you feel some chest pain or indigestion. It's not all that bad; you decide not to do anything. Several hours pass and it gets worse, and even the man won't ignore it. Finally, you go to the emergency room. You wait as burns and other critical patients are treated, because 75 percent of the patients who go to an emergency room with chest pains don't have AMI, so you're not taken very seriously. They finally see you. It takes more time to get your electrocardiogram on your skin and diagnose it, and it's hard to do because they don't have the baseline data, which the computer we put in you gets. Finally, if you're lucky, you are treated in three or four hours after the incident, but the heart muscle has died. And that is the typical treatment in the advanced world \u2014 not Africa \u2014 that's the typical treatment in the advanced world today.So we developed the AngelMed Guardian System and we have a device inside this patient, called the Implanted AngelMed Guardian. And when you have a blockage, the alarm goes off and it sends the alarm and the electrogram to an external device, which gets your baseline electrogram from 24 hours ago and the one that caused the alarm, so you can take it to the emergency room and show them, and say, take care of me right away. Then it goes to a network operations center, where they get your data from your patient database that's been put in at some central location, say, in the United States. Then it goes to a diagnostic center, and within one minute of your heart attack, your signal appears on the screen of a computer and the computer analyzes what your problem is. And the person who's there, the medical practitioner, calls you \u2014 this is also a cell phone \u2014 and says, \"Mr. Smith, you're in deep doo-doo; you have a problem. We've called the ambulance. The ambulance is on the way. It'll pick you up, and then we're going to call your doctor, tell him about it. We're going to send him the signal that we have, that says you have a heart attack, and we're going to send the signal to the hospital and we're going to have it analyzed there, and there you're going to be with your doctor and you'll be taken care of so you won't die of a heart attack.\" That's the first invention that I wanted to describe. (Applause)And now I want to talk about something entirely different. At first I didn't think migraine headaches were a big problem because I'd never had a migraine headache, but then I spoke to some people who have three or four every week of their life, and their lives are being totally ruined by it. We have a mission statement for our company doing migraine, which is, \"Prevent or ameliorate migraine headaches by the application of a safe, controlled magnetic pulse applied, as needed, by the patient.\" Now, you're probably very few physicists here. If you're a physicist you'd know there's a certain Faraday's Law, which says if I apply a magnetic pulse on salt water \u2014 that's your brains by the way \u2014 it'll generate electric currents, and the electric current in the brain can erase a migraine headache. That's what we have discovered.So here's a picture of what we're doing. The patients who have a migraine preceded by an aura have a band of excited neurons \u2014 that's shown in red \u2014 that moves at three to five millimeters a minute towards the mid-brain. And when it hits the mid-brain, that's when the headache begins. There's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura, and this visual aura, by the way \u2014 and I'll show you a picture \u2014 but it sort of begins with little dancing lights, gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field. And what we tried was this; here is a device called the Cadwell Model MES10. Weighs about 70 pounds, has a wire about an inch in diameter. And here's one of the patients who has an aura and always has a headache, bad one, after the aura. What do we do?This is what an aura looks like. It's sort of funny dancing lights, shown there on the left and right side. And that's a fully developed visual aura, as we see on top. In the middle, our experimentalist, the neurologist, who said, \"I'm going to move this down a little and I'm going to erase half your aura.\" And, by God, the neurologist did erase it, and that's the middle picture: half of the aura erased by a short magnetic pulse. What does that mean? That means that the magnetic pulse is generating an electric current that's interfering with the erroneous electrical activity in the brain. And finally he says, \"OK, now I'm going to \u2014 \" all of the aura get erased with an appropriately placed magnetic pulse.What is the result? We designed a magnetic depolarizer that looks like this, that you could have \u2014 a lady, in her pocket book \u2014 and when you get an aura you can try it and see how it works. Well, the next thing they have to show is what was on ABC News, Channel 7, last week in New York City, in the 11 o'clock news.Anchor: For anyone who suffers from migraine headaches \u2014 and there are 30 million Americans who do \u2014 tonight: a possible answer. Eyewitness news reporter Stacy Sager tonight, with a small and portable machine that literally zaps your migraines away. Christina Sidebottom: Well, my first reaction was that it was \u2014 looked awfully gun-like, and it was very strange. Stacy Sager: But for Christina Sidebottom, almost anything was worth trying if it could stop a migraine. It may look silly or even frightening as you walk around with it in your purse, but researchers here in Ohio organizing clinical trials for this migraine zapper, say it is scientifically sound \u2014 that, in fact, when the average person gets a migraine, it's caused by something similar to an electrical impulse. The zapper creates a magnetic field to counteract that. Yousef Mohammed: In other words, we're treating electricity with electricity, rather than treating electricity with the chemicals that we're using nowadays. SS: But is it safe to use everyday? Experts say the research has actually been around for more than a decade, and more long-term studies need to be done. Christina now swears by it. CS: It's been the most wonderful thing for my migraine. SS: Researchers are hoping to present their studies to the FDA this summer.Robert Fischell: And that is the invention to treat migraines. (Applause) You see, the problem is, 30 million Americans have migraine headaches, and we need a means to treat it, and I think that we now have it. And this is the first device that we did, and I'm going to talk about my second wish, which has something to do with this. Our conclusions from our studies so far, at three research centers, is there is a marked improvement in pain levels after using it just once. The most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times, and the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches, not only those with aura, get treated and get diminished. And auras can be erased and the migraine, then, does not occur. And that is the migraine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on. (Applause)The third and last invention began with an idea. Epilepsy can best be treated by responsive electrical stimulation. Now, why do we use \u2014 add on, nearly, an epileptic focus? Now, unfortunately, us technical people, unlike Mr. Bono, have to get into all these technical words. Well, \"responsive electrical stimulation\" means that we sense, at a place in your brain which is called an \"epileptic focus,\" which is where the epileptic seizure begins \u2014 we sense there, that it's going to happen, and then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot, which erases the errant signal so that you don't get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache. We use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that's used for the heart. We thought we could adapt it for the brain. The device could be implanted under the scalp to be totally hidden and avoid wire breakage, which occurs if you put it in the chest and you try to move your neck around. Form a company to develop a neuro-pacemaker for epilepsy, as well as other diseases of the brain, because all diseases of the brain are a result of some electrical malfunction in it, that causes many, if not all, of brain disorders.We formed a company called NeuroPace and we started work on responsive neurostimulation, and this is a picture of what the device looked like, that's placed into the cranial bone. This is probably a better picture. Here we have our device in which we put in a frame. There's a cut made in the scalp; it's opened; the neurosurgeon has a template; he marks it around, and uses a dental burr to remove a piece of the cranial bone exactly the size of our device. And tonight, you'll be able to see the device in the tent. And then with four screws, we put in a frame, then we snap in the device and we run with wires \u2014 the one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes, to the epileptic focus, the origin of the epilepsy, where we can sense the electrical signal and have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current to prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure. In the blue wire, we see what's called a deep brain electrode. If that's the source of the epilepsy, we can attack that as well.The comprehensive solution: this is the device; it's about one inches by two inches and, oddly enough, just the thickness of most cranial bones. The advantages of responsive neurostimulation: It can detect and terminate seizures before the clinical symptoms occur, provide stimulation only when needed, can be turned off if seizures disappear; it has minimal side effects \u2014 as a matter of fact, in all our clinical trials to date, we've seen no side effects in the 40 or so patients in whom it's been implanted \u2014 and it's invisible, cosmetically hidden, so, if you have epilepsy and you have the device, no one will know it because you can't tell that it's there. And this shows what an electroencephalogram is, and on the left is the signal of a spontaneous seizure of one of the patients. Then we stimulated, and you see how that heavy black line and then you see the electroencephalogram signal going to normal, which means they did not get the epileptic seizure. That concludes my discussion of epilepsy, which is the third invention that I want to discuss here this afternoon. (Applause)I have three wishes. Well, I can't do much about Africa. I'm a tech; I'm into medical gadgetry, which is mostly high-tech stuff like Mr. Bono talked about. The first wish is to use the epilepsy responsive neurostimulator, called RNS, for Responsive NeuroStimulator \u2014 that's a brilliant acronym \u2014 for the treatment of other brain disorders. Well, if we're going to do it for epilepsy, why the hell not try it for something else? Then you saw what that device looked like, that the woman was using to fix her migraines? I tell you this: that's something which some research engineer like me would concoct, not a real designer of good equipment. (Laughter) We want to have some people, who really know how to do this, perform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design for the portable device for treating migraine headaches. And some of the sponsors of this TED meeting are such organizations. Then we're going to challenge the TED attendees to come up with a way to improve health care in the USA, where we have problems that Africa doesn't have. And by reducing malpractice litigation \u2014 malpractice litigation is not an African problem; it's an American problem. (Applause)So, to get quickly to my first wish \u2014 the brain operates by electrical signals. If the electrical signals create a brain disorder, electro-stimulation can overcome that disorder by acting on the brain's neurons. In other words, if you've screwed up electrical signals, maybe, by putting other electrical signals from a computer in the brain, we can counteract that. A signal in the brain that triggers brain dysfunction might be sensed as a trigger for electro-stimulation like we're doing with epilepsy. But even if there is no signal, electro-stimulation of an appropriate part of the brain can turn off a brain disorder. And consider treating psychotic disorders \u2014 and I want this involved with the TED group \u2014 such as obsessive-compulsive disorder that, presently, is not well treated with drugs, and includes five million Americans. And Mr. Fischer, and his group at NeuroPace, and myself believe that we can have a dramatic effect in improving OCD in America and in the world. That is the first wish. (Applause)The second wish is, at the present time, the clinical trials of transcranial magnetic stimulators \u2014 that's what TMS means, device to treat migraine headaches \u2014 appears to be quite successful. Well, that's the good news. The present portable device is far from optimally designed, both as to human factors as appearance. I think she said it looks like a gun. A lot of people don't like guns. (Laughter) Engage a company having prior successes for human factors engineering and industrial design to optimize the design of the first portable TMS device that will be sold to the patients who have migraine headaches. And that is the second wish. (Applause)And, of the 100,000-dollar prize money, that TED was so generous to give me, I am donating 50,000 dollars to the NeuroPace people to get on with the treatment of OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and I'm making another 50,000 available for a company to optimize the design of the device for migraines. And that's how I'll use my 100,000-dollar prize money. (Applause)Well, the third and final wish is somewhat \u2014 unfortunately, it's much more complicated because it involves lawyers. (Laughter) Well, medical malpractice litigation in the US has escalated the cost of malpractice insurance, so that competent physicians are leaving their practice. Lawyers take cases on contingency with the hope of a big share of a big settlement by a sympathetic jury, because this patient really ended up badly. The high cost of health care in the US is partly due to litigation and insurance costs. I've seen pictures, graphs in today's USA Today showing it skyrocketing out of control, and this is one factor. Well, how can the TED community help with this situation?I have a couple of ideas to begin with. As a starting point for discussion with the TED group, a major part of the problem is the nature of the written extent of informed consent that the patient or spouse must read and sign. For example, I asked the epilepsy people what are they using for informed consent. Would you believe, 12 pages, single space, the patient has to read before they're in our trial to cure their epilepsy? What do you think someone has at the end of reading 12 single-spaced pages? They don't understand what the hell it's about. (Laughter) That's the present system. How about making a video? We have entertainment people here; we have people who know how to do videos, with visual presentation of the anatomy and procedure done with animation. Everybody knows that we can do better with a visual thing that can be interactive with the patient, where they see the video and they're being videoed and they press, do you understand this? No, I don't. Well, then let's go to a simpler explanation. Then there's a simpler one and, oh yes, I understand that. Well, press the button and you're on record, you understand. And that is one of the ideas.Now, also a video is done of the patient or spouse and medical presenter, with the patient agreeing that he understands the procedure to be done, including all the possible failure modes. The patient or spouse agrees not to file a lawsuit if one of the known procedure failures occurs. Now, in America, in fact, you cannot give up your right to trial by jury. However, if a video is there that everything was explained to you, and you have it all in the video file, it'll be much less likely that some hotshot lawyer will take this case on contingency, because it won't be nearly as good a case. If a medical error occurs, the patient or spouse agrees to a settlement for fair compensation by arbitration instead of going to court. That would save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the United States and would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone.These are just some starting points. And, so there, that's the end of all my wishes. I wish I had more wishes but three is what I've got and there they are.

How can we save their lives?\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nIt's particularly true of diabetics and elderly women.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nWell, what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack?\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nA means to determine if there's a complete blockage of a coronary artery.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nThat, ladies and gentlemen, is a heart attack.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nThe means consist of noting something a little technical,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nST segment elevation of the electrogram --\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\ntranslated into English, that means that\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nif there's an electrical signal in the heart, and one part of the ECG --\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nwhich we call the ST segment -- elevates,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nthat is a sure sign of a heart attack.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nAnd if we had a computer put into the body of a person who's at risk,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nwe could know, before they even have symptoms,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nthat they're having a heart attack, to save their life.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nWell, the doctor can program a level of this ST elevation voltage\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nthat will trigger an emergency alarm,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nvibration like your cell phone, but right by your clavicle bone.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nAnd when it goes beep, beep, beep, you better do something about it,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nbecause if you want to live you have to get to some medical treatment.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nSo we have to try these devices out\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nbecause the FDA won't just let us use them on people\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nunless we try it out first,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nand the best model for this happens to be pigs.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nlike you see in an emergency room,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nand I'm going to show you why they don't work very well.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nAnd then we put a lead, which is a wire, in the right ventricle inside the heart,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nwhich does the electrogram, which is the signal voltage from inside the heart.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nWell, with the pig, at the baseline,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nbefore we blocked the pig's artery to simulate a heart attack, that was the signal.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nAfter 43 seconds, even an expert couldn't tell the difference,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nand after three minutes -- well,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nif you really studied it, you'd see a difference.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nBut what happened when we looked inside the pig's heart, to the electrogram?\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nThere was the baseline -- first of all, a much bigger and more reliable signal.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nSecond of all, I'll bet even you people who are untrained can see the difference,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nand we see here an ST segment elevation right after this sharp line.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nLook at the difference there. It doesn't take much --\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nevery layperson could see that difference,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nand computers can be programmed to easily detect it.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nThen, look at that after three minutes.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nWe see that the signal that's actually in the heart,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nwe can use it to tell people that they're having a heart attack\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:38.958\neven before they have symptoms so we can save their life.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nThen we tried it with my son, Dr. Tim Fischell,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nwe tried it on some human patients who had to have a stent put in.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nWell, he kept the balloon filled to block the artery,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nto simulate a blockage, which is what a heart attack is.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nAnd it's not hard to see that -- the baseline\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nis the first picture on the upper left.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nNext to it, at 30 seconds, you see this rise here,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nthen this rise -- that's the ST elevation.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nAnd if we had a computer that could detect it,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nwe could tell you you're having a heart attack so early\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nit could save your life and prevent congestive heart failure.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nAnd then he did it again. We filled the balloon again a few minutes later\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nand here you see, even after 10 seconds, a great rise in this piece,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nwhich we can have computers inside, under your chest like a pacemaker,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nwith a wire into your heart like a pacemaker.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nAnd computers don't go to sleep.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nWe have a little battery and on this little battery\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nthat computer will run for five years without needing replacement.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nWhat does the system look like?\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nWell, on the left is the IMD, which is Implantable Medical Device,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand tonight in the tent you can see it -- they've exhibited it.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nIt's about this big, the size of a pacemaker.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nIt's implanted with very conventional techniques.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nAnd the EXD is an External Device that you can have on your night table.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nIt'll wake you up and tell you to get your tail to the emergency room\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nwhen the thing goes off because, if you don't, you're in deep doo-doo.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nAnd then, finally, a programmer that will set the level of the stimulation,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nwhich is the level which says you are having a heart attack.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nThe FDA says, OK, test this final device after it's built in some animal,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nwhich we said is a pig, so we had to get this pig to have a heart attack.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nAnd when you go to the farmyard, you can't easily get pigs to have heart attacks,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nso we said, well, we're experts in stents.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nTonight you'll see some of our invented stents.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nWe said, so we'll put in a stent,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nbut we're not going to put in a stent that we'd put in people.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nWe're putting in a copper stent,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nand this copper stent erodes the artery and causes heart attacks.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nThat's not very nice, but, after all, we had to find out what the answer is.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nSo we took two copper stents and we put it in the artery of this pig,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nand let me show you the result that's very gratifying\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nas far as people who have heart disease are concerned.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nSo there it was, Thursday morning we stopped the pig's medication\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nand there is his electrogram, the signal from inside the pig's heart\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\ncoming out by radio telemetry.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nThen, on Friday at 6:43, he began to get certain signs,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nwhich later we had the pig run around --\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nI'm not going to go into this early stage.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nBut look what happened at 10:06 after we removed this pig's medication\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nthat kept him from having a heart attack.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nAny one of you now is an expert on ST elevation. Can you see it there?\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nCan you see it in the picture after the big rise of the QRS -- you see ST elevation?\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nThis pig at 10:06 was having a heart attack.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nWhat happens after you have the heart attack, this blockage?\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nYour rhythm becomes irregular, and that's what happened 45 minutes later.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nThen, ventricular fibrillation, the heart quivers instead of beats --\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nthis is just before death of the pig -- and then the pig died; it went flat-line.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nBut we had a little bit over an hour where we could've saved this pig's life.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nWell, because of the FDA, we didn't save the pig's life,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nbecause we need to do this type of animal research for humans.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nBut when it comes to the sake of a human, we can save their life.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nWe can save the lives of people who are at high risk for a heart attack.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nWhat is the response to acute myocardial infarction, a heart attack, today?\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nWell, you feel some chest pain or indigestion.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nIt's not all that bad; you decide not to do anything.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nSeveral hours pass and it gets worse, and even the man won't ignore it.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nFinally, you go to the emergency room.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nYou wait as burns and other critical patients are treated,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nbecause 75 percent of the patients who go to an emergency room with chest pains\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:09.958\ndon't have AMI, so you're not taken very seriously.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nThey finally see you. It takes more time\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nto get your electrocardiogram on your skin and diagnose it,\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nand it's hard to do because they don't have the baseline data,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nwhich the computer we put in you gets.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nFinally, if you're lucky, you are treated in three or four hours after the incident,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nbut the heart muscle has died.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nAnd that is the typical treatment in the advanced world -- not Africa --\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nthat's the typical treatment in the advanced world today.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nSo we developed the AngelMed Guardian System\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nand we have a device inside this patient, called the Implanted AngelMed Guardian.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nAnd when you have a blockage, the alarm goes off\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nand it sends the alarm and the electrogram to an external device,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nwhich gets your baseline electrogram from 24 hours ago\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nand the one that caused the alarm, so you can take it to the emergency room\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nand show them, and say, take care of me right away.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nThen it goes to a network operations center,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nwhere they get your data from your patient database\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nthat's been put in at some central location, say, in the United States.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nThen it goes to a diagnostic center, and within one minute of your heart attack,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nyour signal appears on the screen of a computer\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nand the computer analyzes what your problem is.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nAnd the person who's there, the medical practitioner, calls you --\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nthis is also a cell phone -- and says,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\n\"Mr. Smith, you're in deep doo-doo; you have a problem.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nWe've called the ambulance. The ambulance is on the way.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nIt'll pick you up, and then we're going to call your doctor, tell him about it.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nWe're going to send him the signal that we have, that says you have a heart attack,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nand we're going to send the signal to the hospital\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nand we're going to have it analyzed there,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nand there you're going to be with your doctor\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nand you'll be taken care of so you won't die of a heart attack.\"\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nThat's the first invention that I wanted to describe.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:00.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nAnd now I want to talk about something entirely different.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nAt first I didn't think migraine headaches were a big problem\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nbecause I'd never had a migraine headache,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nbut then I spoke to some people who have three or four every week of their life,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nand their lives are being totally ruined by it.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nWe have a mission statement for our company doing migraine, which is,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\n\"Prevent or ameliorate migraine headaches\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nby the application of a safe, controlled magnetic pulse\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\napplied, as needed, by the patient.\"\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nNow, you're probably very few physicists here.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nIf you're a physicist you'd know there's a certain Faraday's Law,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nwhich says if I apply a magnetic pulse on salt water --\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nthat's your brains by the way --\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nit'll generate electric currents, and the electric current in the brain\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\ncan erase a migraine headache.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nThat's what we have discovered.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nSo here's a picture of what we're doing.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nThe patients who have a migraine preceded by an aura\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nhave a band of excited neurons -- that's shown in red --\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nthat moves at three to five millimeters a minute towards the mid-brain.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nAnd when it hits the mid-brain, that's when the headache begins.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nThere's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura,\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nand this visual aura, by the way -- and I'll show you a picture --\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nbut it sort of begins with little dancing lights,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\ngets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nAnd what we tried was this; here is a device called the Cadwell Model MES10.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nWeighs about 70 pounds, has a wire about an inch in diameter.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nAnd here's one of the patients who has an aura\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nand always has a headache, bad one, after the aura. What do we do?\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nThis is what an aura looks like.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nIt's sort of funny dancing lights, shown there on the left and right side.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nAnd that's a fully developed visual aura, as we see on top.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nIn the middle, our experimentalist, the neurologist, who said,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\n\"I'm going to move this down a little and I'm going to erase half your aura.\"\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nAnd, by God, the neurologist did erase it, and that's the middle picture:\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nhalf of the aura erased by a short magnetic pulse.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nWhat does that mean?\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nThat means that the magnetic pulse is generating an electric current\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nthat's interfering with the erroneous electrical activity in the brain.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd finally he says, \"OK, now I'm going to -- \"\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nall of the aura get erased with an appropriately placed magnetic pulse.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nWhat is the result? We designed a magnetic depolarizer\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nthat looks like this, that you could have -- a lady, in her pocket book --\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nand when you get an aura you can try it and see how it works.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nWell, the next thing they have to show is what was on ABC News,\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nChannel 7, last week in New York City, in the 11 o'clock news.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nAnchor: For anyone who suffers from migraine headaches --\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nand there are 30 million Americans who do -- tonight: a possible answer.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nEyewitness news reporter Stacy Sager tonight, with a small and portable machine\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nthat literally zaps your migraines away.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nChristina Sidebottom: Well, my first reaction was that it was --\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nlooked awfully gun-like, and it was very strange.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nStacy Sager: But for Christina Sidebottom, almost anything was worth trying\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nif it could stop a migraine.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nIt may look silly or even frightening as you walk around with it in your purse,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nbut researchers here in Ohio organizing clinical trials for this migraine zapper,\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nsay it is scientifically sound --\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nthat, in fact, when the average person gets a migraine,\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nit's caused by something similar to an electrical impulse.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nThe zapper creates a magnetic field to counteract that.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nYousef Mohammed: In other words, we're treating electricity with electricity,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nrather than treating electricity with the chemicals that we're using nowadays.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nSS: But is it safe to use everyday?\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nExperts say the research has actually been around for more than a decade,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nand more long-term studies need to be done. Christina now swears by it.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nCS: It's been the most wonderful thing for my migraine.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nSS: Researchers are hoping to present their studies to the FDA this summer.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nRobert Fischell: And that is the invention to treat migraines.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nYou see, the problem is, 30 million Americans have migraine headaches,\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nand we need a means to treat it, and I think that we now have it.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nAnd this is the first device that we did, and I'm going to talk about my second wish,\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nwhich has something to do with this.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nOur conclusions from our studies so far, at three research centers,\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nis there is a marked improvement in pain levels after using it just once.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nThe most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nand the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches,\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nnot only those with aura, get treated and get diminished.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nAnd auras can be erased and the migraine, then, does not occur.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nAnd that is the migraine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nThe third and last invention began with an idea.\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nEpilepsy can best be treated by responsive electrical stimulation.\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nNow, why do we use -- add on, nearly, an epileptic focus?\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nNow, unfortunately, us technical people, unlike Mr. Bono,\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nhave to get into all these technical words.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nWell, \"responsive electrical stimulation\" means\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nthat we sense, at a place in your brain which is called an \"epileptic focus,\"\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nwhich is where the epileptic seizure begins --\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nwe sense there, that it's going to happen,\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nand then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nwhich erases the errant signal\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nso that you don't get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache.\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nWe use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that's used for the heart.\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nWe thought we could adapt it for the brain.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nThe device could be implanted under the scalp\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nto be totally hidden and avoid wire breakage,\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nwhich occurs if you put it in the chest and you try to move your neck around.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nForm a company to develop a neuro-pacemaker for epilepsy,\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nas well as other diseases of the brain, because all diseases of the brain\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nare a result of some electrical malfunction in it,\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:30.958\nthat causes many, if not all, of brain disorders.\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nWe formed a company called NeuroPace\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nand we started work on responsive neurostimulation,\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nand this is a picture of what the device looked like,\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nthat's placed into the cranial bone.\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nThis is probably a better picture.\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nHere we have our device in which we put in a frame.\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nThere's a cut made in the scalp; it's opened; the neurosurgeon has a template;\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nhe marks it around, and uses a dental burr\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nto remove a piece of the cranial bone exactly the size of our device.\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nAnd tonight, you'll be able to see the device in the tent.\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nAnd then with four screws, we put in a frame,\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nthen we snap in the device and we run with wires --\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nthe one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes,\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nto the epileptic focus, the origin of the epilepsy,\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nwhere we can sense the electrical signal\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nand have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nto prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure.\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nIn the blue wire, we see what's called a deep brain electrode.\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nIf that's the source of the epilepsy, we can attack that as well.\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nThe comprehensive solution: this is the device;\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:46.958\nit's about one inches by two inches and, oddly enough,\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:50.958\njust the thickness of most cranial bones.\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nThe advantages of responsive neurostimulation:\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nIt can detect and terminate seizures before the clinical symptoms occur,\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nprovide stimulation only when needed,\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:05.958\ncan be turned off if seizures disappear; it has minimal side effects --\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nas a matter of fact, in all our clinical trials to date,\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:13.958\nwe've seen no side effects in the 40 or so patients in whom it's been implanted --\n\n00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:16.958\nand it's invisible, cosmetically hidden,\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:19.958\nso, if you have epilepsy and you have the device,\n\n00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:22.958\nno one will know it because you can't tell that it's there.\n\n00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nAnd this shows what an electroencephalogram is,\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:30.958\nand on the left is the signal of a spontaneous seizure of one of the patients.\n\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:34.958\nThen we stimulated, and you see how that heavy black line\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:38.958\nand then you see the electroencephalogram signal going to normal,\n\n00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:41.958\nwhich means they did not get the epileptic seizure.\n\n00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:46.958\nThat concludes my discussion of epilepsy,\n\n00:19:46.958 --> 00:19:50.958\nwhich is the third invention that I want to discuss here this afternoon.\n\n00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:54.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:59.958\nI have three wishes. Well, I can't do much about Africa.\n\n00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:02.958\nI'm a tech; I'm into medical gadgetry,\n\n00:20:02.958 --> 00:20:06.958\nwhich is mostly high-tech stuff like Mr. Bono talked about.\n\n00:20:06.958 --> 00:20:11.958\nThe first wish is to use the epilepsy responsive neurostimulator,\n\n00:20:11.958 --> 00:20:16.958\ncalled RNS, for Responsive NeuroStimulator -- that's a brilliant acronym --\n\n00:20:16.958 --> 00:20:18.958\nfor the treatment of other brain disorders.\n\n00:20:18.958 --> 00:20:23.958\nWell, if we're going to do it for epilepsy, why the hell not try it for something else?\n\n00:20:23.958 --> 00:20:26.958\nThen you saw what that device looked like,\n\n00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:28.958\nthat the woman was using to fix her migraines?\n\n00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:33.958\nI tell you this: that's something which some research engineer like me would concoct,\n\n00:20:33.958 --> 00:20:35.958\nnot a real designer of good equipment.\n\n00:20:35.958 --> 00:20:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:40.958\nWe want to have some people, who really know how to do this,\n\n00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:44.958\nperform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design\n\n00:20:44.958 --> 00:20:47.958\nfor the portable device for treating migraine headaches.\n\n00:20:47.958 --> 00:20:52.958\nAnd some of the sponsors of this TED meeting are such organizations.\n\n00:20:52.958 --> 00:20:55.958\nThen we're going to challenge the TED attendees\n\n00:20:55.958 --> 00:20:59.958\nto come up with a way to improve health care in the USA,\n\n00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:02.958\nwhere we have problems that Africa doesn't have.\n\n00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:05.958\nAnd by reducing malpractice litigation --\n\n00:21:05.958 --> 00:21:09.958\nmalpractice litigation is not an African problem; it's an American problem.\n\n00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:12.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:21:12.958 --> 00:21:15.958\nSo, to get quickly to my first wish --\n\n00:21:15.958 --> 00:21:18.958\nthe brain operates by electrical signals.\n\n00:21:18.958 --> 00:21:21.958\nIf the electrical signals create a brain disorder,\n\n00:21:21.958 --> 00:21:25.958\nelectro-stimulation can overcome that disorder by acting on the brain's neurons.\n\n00:21:25.958 --> 00:21:29.958\nIn other words, if you've screwed up electrical signals,\n\n00:21:29.958 --> 00:21:33.958\nmaybe, by putting other electrical signals from a computer in the brain,\n\n00:21:33.958 --> 00:21:36.958\nwe can counteract that.\n\n00:21:36.958 --> 00:21:39.958\nA signal in the brain that triggers brain dysfunction\n\n00:21:39.958 --> 00:21:42.958\nmight be sensed as a trigger for electro-stimulation\n\n00:21:42.958 --> 00:21:44.958\nlike we're doing with epilepsy.\n\n00:21:44.958 --> 00:21:46.958\nBut even if there is no signal,\n\n00:21:46.958 --> 00:21:51.958\nelectro-stimulation of an appropriate part of the brain can turn off a brain disorder.\n\n00:21:51.958 --> 00:21:55.958\nAnd consider treating psychotic disorders --\n\n00:21:55.958 --> 00:21:58.958\nand I want this involved with the TED group --\n\n00:21:58.958 --> 00:22:00.958\nsuch as obsessive-compulsive disorder\n\n00:22:00.958 --> 00:22:06.958\nthat, presently, is not well treated with drugs, and includes five million Americans.\n\n00:22:06.958 --> 00:22:10.958\nAnd Mr. Fischer, and his group at NeuroPace, and myself believe\n\n00:22:10.958 --> 00:22:16.958\nthat we can have a dramatic effect in improving OCD in America and in the world.\n\n00:22:16.958 --> 00:22:19.958\nThat is the first wish.\n\n00:22:19.958 --> 00:22:24.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:22:24.958 --> 00:22:27.958\nThe second wish is, at the present time,\n\n00:22:27.958 --> 00:22:32.958\nthe clinical trials of transcranial magnetic stimulators --\n\n00:22:32.958 --> 00:22:36.958\nthat's what TMS means, device to treat migraine headaches --\n\n00:22:36.958 --> 00:22:38.958\nappears to be quite successful.\n\n00:22:38.958 --> 00:22:40.958\nWell, that's the good news.\n\n00:22:40.958 --> 00:22:42.958\nThe present portable device is far from optimally designed,\n\n00:22:42.958 --> 00:22:45.958\nboth as to human factors as appearance.\n\n00:22:45.958 --> 00:22:49.958\nI think she said it looks like a gun.

How about making a video?\n\n00:25:02.958 --> 00:25:04.958\nWe have entertainment people here;\n\n00:25:04.958 --> 00:25:06.958\nwe have people who know how to do videos,\n\n00:25:06.958 --> 00:25:10.958\nwith visual presentation of the anatomy and procedure done with animation.\n\n00:25:10.958 --> 00:25:15.958\nEverybody knows that we can do better with a visual thing\n\n00:25:15.958 --> 00:25:19.958\nthat can be interactive with the patient, where they see the video\n\n00:25:19.958 --> 00:25:24.958\nand they're being videoed and they press, do you understand this? No, I don't.\n\n00:25:24.958 --> 00:25:26.958\nWell, then let's go to a simpler explanation.\n\n00:25:26.958 --> 00:25:29.958\nThen there's a simpler one and, oh yes, I understand that.\n\n00:25:29.958 --> 00:25:32.958\nWell, press the button and you're on record, you understand.\n\n00:25:32.958 --> 00:25:35.958\nAnd that is one of the ideas.\n\n00:25:35.958 --> 00:25:38.958\nNow, also a video is done of the patient or spouse and medical presenter,\n\n00:25:38.958 --> 00:25:43.958\nwith the patient agreeing that he understands the procedure to be done,\n\n00:25:43.958 --> 00:25:46.958\nincluding all the possible failure modes.\n\n00:25:46.958 --> 00:25:48.958\nThe patient or spouse agrees not to file a lawsuit\n\n00:25:48.958 --> 00:25:51.958\nif one of the known procedure failures occurs.\n\n00:25:51.958 --> 00:25:57.958\nNow, in America, in fact, you cannot give up your right to trial by jury.\n\n00:25:57.958 --> 00:26:01.958\nHowever, if a video is there that everything was explained to you,\n\n00:26:01.958 --> 00:26:03.958\nand you have it all in the video file,\n\n00:26:03.958 --> 00:26:06.958\nit'll be much less likely that some hotshot lawyer\n\n00:26:06.958 --> 00:26:11.958\nwill take this case on contingency, because it won't be nearly as good a case.\n\n00:26:11.958 --> 00:26:16.958\nIf a medical error occurs, the patient or spouse agrees to a settlement\n\n00:26:16.958 --> 00:26:21.958\nfor fair compensation by arbitration instead of going to court.\n\n00:26:21.958 --> 00:26:26.958\nThat would save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the United States\n\n00:26:26.958 --> 00:26:29.958\nand would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone.\n\n00:26:29.958 --> 00:26:32.958\nThese are just some starting points.\n\n00:26:32.958 --> 00:26:36.958\nAnd, so there, that's the end of all my wishes.\n\n00:26:36.958 --> 00:26:40.958\nI wish I had more wishes but three is what I've got and there they are.\n\n00:26:40.958 --> 00:26:43.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How juries are fooled by statistics", "duration": "1280", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_donnelly_shows_how_stats_fool_juries", "transcript": "As other speakers have said, it's a rather daunting experience \u2014 a particularly daunting experience \u2014 to be speaking in front of this audience. But unlike the other speakers, I'm not going to tell you about the mysteries of the universe, or the wonders of evolution, or the really clever, innovative ways people are attacking the major inequalities in our world. Or even the challenges of nation-states in the modern global economy. My brief, as you've just heard, is to tell you about statistics \u2014 and, to be more precise, to tell you some exciting things about statistics. And that's \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 that's rather more challenging than all the speakers before me and all the ones coming after me. (Laughter) One of my senior colleagues told me, when I was a youngster in this profession, rather proudly, that statisticians were people who liked figures but didn't have the personality skills to become accountants. (Laughter) And there's another in-joke among statisticians, and that's, \"How do you tell the introverted statistician from the extroverted statistician?\" To which the answer is, \"The extroverted statistician's the one who looks at the other person's shoes.\" (Laughter) But I want to tell you something useful \u2014 and here it is, so concentrate now. This evening, there's a reception in the University's Museum of Natural History. And it's a wonderful setting, as I hope you'll find, and a great icon to the best of the Victorian tradition. It's very unlikely \u2014 in this special setting, and this collection of people \u2014 but you might just find yourself talking to someone you'd rather wish that you weren't. So here's what you do. When they say to you, \"What do you do?\" \u2014 you say, \"I'm a statistician.\" (Laughter) Well, except they've been pre-warned now, and they'll know you're making it up. And then one of two things will happen. They'll either discover their long-lost cousin in the other corner of the room and run over and talk to them. Or they'll suddenly become parched and/or hungry \u2014 and often both \u2014 and sprint off for a drink and some food. And you'll be left in peace to talk to the person you really want to talk to.It's one of the challenges in our profession to try and explain what we do. We're not top on people's lists for dinner party guests and conversations and so on. And it's something I've never really found a good way of doing. But my wife \u2014 who was then my girlfriend \u2014 managed it much better than I've ever been able to. Many years ago, when we first started going out, she was working for the BBC in Britain, and I was, at that stage, working in America. I was coming back to visit her. She told this to one of her colleagues, who said, \"Well, what does your boyfriend do?\" Sarah thought quite hard about the things I'd explained \u2014 and she concentrated, in those days, on listening. (Laughter) Don't tell her I said that. And she was thinking about the work I did developing mathematical models for understanding evolution and modern genetics. So when her colleague said, \"What does he do?\" She paused and said, \"He models things.\" (Laughter) Well, her colleague suddenly got much more interested than I had any right to expect and went on and said, \"What does he model?\" Well, Sarah thought a little bit more about my work and said, \"Genes.\" (Laughter) \"He models genes.\"That is my first love, and that's what I'll tell you a little bit about. What I want to do more generally is to get you thinking about the place of uncertainty and randomness and chance in our world, and how we react to that, and how well we do or don't think about it. So you've had a pretty easy time up till now \u2014 a few laughs, and all that kind of thing \u2014 in the talks to date. You've got to think, and I'm going to ask you some questions. So here's the scene for the first question I'm going to ask you. Can you imagine tossing a coin successively? And for some reason \u2014 which shall remain rather vague \u2014 we're interested in a particular pattern. Here's one \u2014 a head, followed by a tail, followed by a tail.So suppose we toss a coin repeatedly. Then the pattern, head-tail-tail, that we've suddenly become fixated with happens here. And you can count: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 \u2014 it happens after the 10th toss. So you might think there are more interesting things to do, but humor me for the moment. Imagine this half of the audience each get out coins, and they toss them until they first see the pattern head-tail-tail. The first time they do it, maybe it happens after the 10th toss, as here. The second time, maybe it's after the fourth toss. The next time, after the 15th toss. So you do that lots and lots of times, and you average those numbers. That's what I want this side to think about.The other half of the audience doesn't like head-tail-tail \u2014 they think, for deep cultural reasons, that's boring \u2014 and they're much more interested in a different pattern \u2014 head-tail-head. So, on this side, you get out your coins, and you toss and toss and toss. And you count the number of times until the pattern head-tail-head appears and you average them. OK? So on this side, you've got a number \u2014 you've done it lots of times, so you get it accurately \u2014 which is the average number of tosses until head-tail-tail. On this side, you've got a number \u2014 the average number of tosses until head-tail-head.So here's a deep mathematical fact \u2014 if you've got two numbers, one of three things must be true. Either they're the same, or this one's bigger than this one, or this one's bigger than that one. So what's going on here? So you've all got to think about this, and you've all got to vote \u2014 and we're not moving on. And I don't want to end up in the two-minute silence to give you more time to think about it, until everyone's expressed a view. OK. So what you want to do is compare the average number of tosses until we first see head-tail-head with the average number of tosses until we first see head-tail-tail.Who thinks that A is true \u2014 that, on average, it'll take longer to see head-tail-head than head-tail-tail? Who thinks that B is true \u2014 that on average, they're the same? Who thinks that C is true \u2014 that, on average, it'll take less time to see head-tail-head than head-tail-tail? OK, who hasn't voted yet? Because that's really naughty \u2014 I said you had to. (Laughter) OK. So most people think B is true. And you might be relieved to know even rather distinguished mathematicians think that. It's not. A is true here. It takes longer, on average. In fact, the average number of tosses till head-tail-head is 10 and the average number of tosses until head-tail-tail is eight. How could that be? Anything different about the two patterns? There is. Head-tail-head overlaps itself. If you went head-tail-head-tail-head, you can cunningly get two occurrences of the pattern in only five tosses. You can't do that with head-tail-tail. That turns out to be important.There are two ways of thinking about this. I'll give you one of them. So imagine \u2014 let's suppose we're doing it. On this side \u2014 remember, you're excited about head-tail-tail; you're excited about head-tail-head. We start tossing a coin, and we get a head \u2014 and you start sitting on the edge of your seat because something great and wonderful, or awesome, might be about to happen. The next toss is a tail \u2014 you get really excited. The champagne's on ice just next to you; you've got the glasses chilled to celebrate. You're waiting with bated breath for the final toss. And if it comes down a head, that's great. You're done, and you celebrate. If it's a tail \u2014 well, rather disappointedly, you put the glasses away and put the champagne back. And you keep tossing, to wait for the next head, to get excited.On this side, there's a different experience. It's the same for the first two parts of the sequence. You're a little bit excited with the first head \u2014 you get rather more excited with the next tail. Then you toss the coin. If it's a tail, you crack open the champagne. If it's a head you're disappointed, but you're still a third of the way to your pattern again. And that's an informal way of presenting it \u2014 that's why there's a difference. Another way of thinking about it \u2014 if we tossed a coin eight million times, then we'd expect a million head-tail-heads and a million head-tail-tails \u2014 but the head-tail-heads could occur in clumps. So if you want to put a million things down amongst eight million positions and you can have some of them overlapping, the clumps will be further apart. It's another way of getting the intuition.What's the point I want to make? It's a very, very simple example, an easily stated question in probability, which every \u2014 you're in good company \u2014 everybody gets wrong. This is my little diversion into my real passion, which is genetics. There's a connection between head-tail-heads and head-tail-tails in genetics, and it's the following. When you toss a coin, you get a sequence of heads and tails. When you look at DNA, there's a sequence of not two things \u2014 heads and tails \u2014 but four letters \u2014 As, Gs, Cs and Ts. And there are little chemical scissors, called restriction enzymes which cut DNA whenever they see particular patterns. And they're an enormously useful tool in modern molecular biology. And instead of asking the question, \"How long until I see a head-tail-head?\" \u2014 you can ask, \"How big will the chunks be when I use a restriction enzyme which cuts whenever it sees G-A-A-G, for example? How long will those chunks be?\"That's a rather trivial connection between probability and genetics. There's a much deeper connection, which I don't have time to go into and that is that modern genetics is a really exciting area of science. And we'll hear some talks later in the conference specifically about that. But it turns out that unlocking the secrets in the information generated by modern experimental technologies, a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisticated \u2014 you'll be relieved to know that I do something useful in my day job, rather more sophisticated than the head-tail-head story \u2014 but quite sophisticated computer modelings and mathematical modelings and modern statistical techniques. And I will give you two little snippets \u2014 two examples \u2014 of projects we're involved in in my group in Oxford, both of which I think are rather exciting. You know about the Human Genome Project. That was a project which aimed to read one copy of the human genome. The natural thing to do after you've done that \u2014 and that's what this project, the International HapMap Project, which is a collaboration between labs in five or six different countries. Think of the Human Genome Project as learning what we've got in common, and the HapMap Project is trying to understand where there are differences between different people.Why do we care about that? Well, there are lots of reasons. The most pressing one is that we want to understand how some differences make some people susceptible to one disease \u2014 type-2 diabetes, for example \u2014 and other differences make people more susceptible to heart disease, or stroke, or autism and so on. That's one big project. There's a second big project, recently funded by the Wellcome Trust in this country, involving very large studies \u2014 thousands of individuals, with each of eight different diseases, common diseases like type-1 and type-2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease, bipolar disease and so on \u2014 to try and understand the genetics. To try and understand what it is about genetic differences that causes the diseases. Why do we want to do that? Because we understand very little about most human diseases. We don't know what causes them. And if we can get in at the bottom and understand the genetics, we'll have a window on the way the disease works, and a whole new way about thinking about disease therapies and preventative treatment and so on. So that's, as I said, the little diversion on my main love.Back to some of the more mundane issues of thinking about uncertainty. Here's another quiz for you \u2014 now suppose we've got a test for a disease which isn't infallible, but it's pretty good. It gets it right 99 percent of the time. And I take one of you, or I take someone off the street, and I test them for the disease in question. Let's suppose there's a test for HIV \u2014 the virus that causes AIDS \u2014 and the test says the person has the disease. What's the chance that they do? The test gets it right 99 percent of the time. So a natural answer is 99 percent. Who likes that answer? Come on \u2014 everyone's got to get involved. Don't think you don't trust me anymore. (Laughter) Well, you're right to be a bit skeptical, because that's not the answer. That's what you might think. It's not the answer, and it's not because it's only part of the story. It actually depends on how common or how rare the disease is. So let me try and illustrate that. Here's a little caricature of a million individuals. So let's think about a disease that affects \u2014 it's pretty rare, it affects one person in 10,000. Amongst these million individuals, most of them are healthy and some of them will have the disease. And in fact, if this is the prevalence of the disease, about 100 will have the disease and the rest won't. So now suppose we test them all. What happens? Well, amongst the 100 who do have the disease, the test will get it right 99 percent of the time, and 99 will test positive. Amongst all these other people who don't have the disease, the test will get it right 99 percent of the time. It'll only get it wrong one percent of the time. But there are so many of them that there'll be an enormous number of false positives. Put that another way \u2014 of all of them who test positive \u2014 so here they are, the individuals involved \u2014 less than one in 100 actually have the disease. So even though we think the test is accurate, the important part of the story is there's another bit of information we need.Here's the key intuition. What we have to do, once we know the test is positive, is to weigh up the plausibility, or the likelihood, of two competing explanations. Each of those explanations has a likely bit and an unlikely bit. One explanation is that the person doesn't have the disease \u2014 that's overwhelmingly likely, if you pick someone at random \u2014 but the test gets it wrong, which is unlikely. The other explanation is that the person does have the disease \u2014 that's unlikely \u2014 but the test gets it right, which is likely. And the number we end up with \u2014 that number which is a little bit less than one in 100 \u2014 is to do with how likely one of those explanations is relative to the other. Each of them taken together is unlikely.Here's a more topical example of exactly the same thing. Those of you in Britain will know about what's become rather a celebrated case of a woman called Sally Clark, who had two babies who died suddenly. And initially, it was thought that they died of what's known informally as \"cot death,\" and more formally as \"Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.\" For various reasons, she was later charged with murder. And at the trial, her trial, a very distinguished pediatrician gave evidence that the chance of two cot deaths, innocent deaths, in a family like hers \u2014 which was professional and non-smoking \u2014 was one in 73 million. To cut a long story short, she was convicted at the time. Later, and fairly recently, acquitted on appeal \u2014 in fact, on the second appeal. And just to set it in context, you can imagine how awful it is for someone to have lost one child, and then two, if they're innocent, to be convicted of murdering them. To be put through the stress of the trial, convicted of murdering them \u2014 and to spend time in a women's prison, where all the other prisoners think you killed your children \u2014 is a really awful thing to happen to someone. And it happened in large part here because the expert got the statistics horribly wrong, in two different ways.So where did he get the one in 73 million number? He looked at some research, which said the chance of one cot death in a family like Sally Clark's is about one in 8,500. So he said, \"I'll assume that if you have one cot death in a family, the chance of a second child dying from cot death aren't changed.\" So that's what statisticians would call an assumption of independence. It's like saying, \"If you toss a coin and get a head the first time, that won't affect the chance of getting a head the second time.\" So if you toss a coin twice, the chance of getting a head twice are a half \u2014 that's the chance the first time \u2014 times a half \u2014 the chance a second time. So he said, \"Here, I'll assume that these events are independent. When you multiply 8,500 together twice, you get about 73 million.\" And none of this was stated to the court as an assumption or presented to the jury that way. Unfortunately here \u2014 and, really, regrettably \u2014 first of all, in a situation like this you'd have to verify it empirically. And secondly, it's palpably false. There are lots and lots of things that we don't know about sudden infant deaths. It might well be that there are environmental factors that we're not aware of, and it's pretty likely to be the case that there are genetic factors we're not aware of. So if a family suffers from one cot death, you'd put them in a high-risk group. They've probably got these environmental risk factors and/or genetic risk factors we don't know about. And to argue, then, that the chance of a second death is as if you didn't know that information is really silly. It's worse than silly \u2014 it's really bad science. Nonetheless, that's how it was presented, and at trial nobody even argued it. That's the first problem. The second problem is, what does the number of one in 73 million mean? So after Sally Clark was convicted \u2014 you can imagine, it made rather a splash in the press \u2014 one of the journalists from one of Britain's more reputable newspapers wrote that what the expert had said was, \"The chance that she was innocent was one in 73 million.\" Now, that's a logical error. It's exactly the same logical error as the logical error of thinking that after the disease test, which is 99 percent accurate, the chance of having the disease is 99 percent. In the disease example, we had to bear in mind two things, one of which was the possibility that the test got it right or not. And the other one was the chance, a priori, that the person had the disease or not. It's exactly the same in this context. There are two things involved \u2014 two parts to the explanation. We want to know how likely, or relatively how likely, two different explanations are. One of them is that Sally Clark was innocent \u2014 which is, a priori, overwhelmingly likely \u2014 most mothers don't kill their children. And the second part of the explanation is that she suffered an incredibly unlikely event. Not as unlikely as one in 73 million, but nonetheless rather unlikely. The other explanation is that she was guilty. Now, we probably think a priori that's unlikely. And we certainly should think in the context of a criminal trial that that's unlikely, because of the presumption of innocence. And then if she were trying to kill the children, she succeeded. So the chance that she's innocent isn't one in 73 million. We don't know what it is. It has to do with weighing up the strength of the other evidence against her and the statistical evidence. We know the children died. What matters is how likely or unlikely, relative to each other, the two explanations are. And they're both implausible. There's a situation where errors in statistics had really profound and really unfortunate consequences. In fact, there are two other women who were convicted on the basis of the evidence of this pediatrician, who have subsequently been released on appeal. Many cases were reviewed. And it's particularly topical because he's currently facing a disrepute charge at Britain's General Medical Council.So just to conclude \u2014 what are the take-home messages from this? Well, we know that randomness and uncertainty and chance are very much a part of our everyday life. It's also true \u2014 and, although, you, as a collective, are very special in many ways, you're completely typical in not getting the examples I gave right. It's very well documented that people get things wrong. They make errors of logic in reasoning with uncertainty. We can cope with the subtleties of language brilliantly \u2014 and there are interesting evolutionary questions about how we got here. We are not good at reasoning with uncertainty. That's an issue in our everyday lives. As you've heard from many of the talks, statistics underpins an enormous amount of research in science \u2014 in social science, in medicine and indeed, quite a lot of industry. All of quality control, which has had a major impact on industrial processing, is underpinned by statistics. It's something we're bad at doing. At the very least, we should recognize that, and we tend not to. To go back to the legal context, at the Sally Clark trial all of the lawyers just accepted what the expert said. So if a pediatrician had come out and said to a jury, \"I know how to build bridges. I've built one down the road. Please drive your car home over it,\" they would have said, \"Well, pediatricians don't know how to build bridges. That's what engineers do.\" On the other hand, he came out and effectively said, or implied, \"I know how to reason with uncertainty. I know how to do statistics.\" And everyone said, \"Well, that's fine. He's an expert.\" So we need to understand where our competence is and isn't. Exactly the same kinds of issues arose in the early days of DNA profiling, when scientists, and lawyers and in some cases judges, routinely misrepresented evidence. Usually \u2014 one hopes \u2014 innocently, but misrepresented evidence. Forensic scientists said, \"The chance that this guy's innocent is one in three million.\" Even if you believe the number, just like the 73 million to one, that's not what it meant. And there have been celebrated appeal cases in Britain and elsewhere because of that.And just to finish in the context of the legal system. It's all very well to say, \"Let's do our best to present the evidence.\" But more and more, in cases of DNA profiling \u2014 this is another one \u2014 we expect juries, who are ordinary people \u2014 and it's documented they're very bad at this \u2014 we expect juries to be able to cope with the sorts of reasoning that goes on. In other spheres of life, if people argued \u2014 well, except possibly for politics \u2014 but in other spheres of life, if people argued illogically, we'd say that's not a good thing. We sort of expect it of politicians and don't hope for much more. In the case of uncertainty, we get it wrong all the time \u2014 and at the very least, we should be aware of that, and ideally, we might try and do something about it.

--\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:16.958\na particularly daunting experience -- to be speaking in front of this audience.\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nBut unlike the other speakers, I'm not going to tell you about\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nthe mysteries of the universe, or the wonders of evolution,\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nor the really clever, innovative ways people are attacking\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nthe major inequalities in our world.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nOr even the challenges of nation-states in the modern global economy.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nMy brief, as you've just heard, is to tell you about statistics --\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nand, to be more precise, to tell you some exciting things about statistics.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nAnd that's --\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\n-- that's rather more challenging\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nthan all the speakers before me and all the ones coming after me.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nOne of my senior colleagues told me, when I was a youngster in this profession,\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nrather proudly, that statisticians were people who liked figures\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nbut didn't have the personality skills to become accountants.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nAnd there's another in-joke among statisticians, and that's,\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\n\"How do you tell the introverted statistician from the extroverted statistician?\"\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nTo which the answer is,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:14.958\n\"The extroverted statistician's the one who looks at the other person's shoes.\"\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nBut I want to tell you something useful -- and here it is, so concentrate now.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nThis evening, there's a reception in the University's Museum of Natural History.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nAnd it's a wonderful setting, as I hope you'll find,\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nand a great icon to the best of the Victorian tradition.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nIt's very unlikely -- in this special setting, and this collection of people --\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nbut you might just find yourself talking to someone you'd rather wish that you weren't.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nSo here's what you do.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nWhen they say to you, \"What do you do?\" -- you say, \"I'm a statistician.\"\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nWell, except they've been pre-warned now, and they'll know you're making it up.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nAnd then one of two things will happen.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nThey'll either discover their long-lost cousin in the other corner of the room\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nand run over and talk to them.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nOr they'll suddenly become parched and/or hungry -- and often both --\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nand sprint off for a drink and some food.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nAnd you'll be left in peace to talk to the person you really want to talk to.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nIt's one of the challenges in our profession to try and explain what we do.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nWe're not top on people's lists for dinner party guests and conversations and so on.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nAnd it's something I've never really found a good way of doing.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nBut my wife -- who was then my girlfriend --\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nmanaged it much better than I've ever been able to.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nMany years ago, when we first started going out, she was working for the BBC in Britain,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nand I was, at that stage, working in America.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nI was coming back to visit her.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nShe told this to one of her colleagues, who said, \"Well, what does your boyfriend do?\"\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nSarah thought quite hard about the things I'd explained --\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nand she concentrated, in those days, on listening.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nDon't tell her I said that.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nAnd she was thinking about the work I did developing mathematical models\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nfor understanding evolution and modern genetics.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nSo when her colleague said, \"What does he do?\"\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nShe paused and said, \"He models things.\"\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nWell, her colleague suddenly got much more interested than I had any right to expect\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nand went on and said, \"What does he model?\"\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nWell, Sarah thought a little bit more about my work and said, \"Genes.\"\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\n\"He models genes.\"\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nThat is my first love, and that's what I'll tell you a little bit about.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nWhat I want to do more generally is to get you thinking about\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nthe place of uncertainty and randomness and chance in our world,\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nand how we react to that, and how well we do or don't think about it.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nSo you've had a pretty easy time up till now --\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\na few laughs, and all that kind of thing -- in the talks to date.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nYou've got to think, and I'm going to ask you some questions.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nSo here's the scene for the first question I'm going to ask you.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nCan you imagine tossing a coin successively?\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nAnd for some reason -- which shall remain rather vague --\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nwe're interested in a particular pattern.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nHere's one -- a head, followed by a tail, followed by a tail.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nSo suppose we toss a coin repeatedly.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nThen the pattern, head-tail-tail, that we've suddenly become fixated with happens here.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nAnd you can count: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 --\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nit happens after the 10th toss.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nSo you might think there are more interesting things to do, but humor me for the moment.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nImagine this half of the audience each get out coins, and they toss them\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nuntil they first see the pattern head-tail-tail.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nThe first time they do it, maybe it happens after the 10th toss, as here.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nThe second time, maybe it's after the fourth toss.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nThe next time, after the 15th toss.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nSo you do that lots and lots of times, and you average those numbers.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nThat's what I want this side to think about.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nThe other half of the audience doesn't like head-tail-tail --\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nthey think, for deep cultural reasons, that's boring --\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nand they're much more interested in a different pattern -- head-tail-head.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nSo, on this side, you get out your coins, and you toss and toss and toss.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nAnd you count the number of times until the pattern head-tail-head appears\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nand you average them. OK?\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nSo on this side, you've got a number --\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nyou've done it lots of times, so you get it accurately --\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nwhich is the average number of tosses until head-tail-tail.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nOn this side, you've got a number -- the average number of tosses until head-tail-head.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nSo here's a deep mathematical fact --\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nif you've got two numbers, one of three things must be true.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nEither they're the same, or this one's bigger than this one,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nor this one's bigger than that one.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nSo what's going on here?\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nSo you've all got to think about this, and you've all got to vote --\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nand we're not moving on.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nAnd I don't want to end up in the two-minute silence\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nto give you more time to think about it, until everyone's expressed a view. OK.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nSo what you want to do is compare the average number of tosses until we first see\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nhead-tail-head with the average number of tosses until we first see head-tail-tail.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nWho thinks that A is true --\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nthat, on average, it'll take longer to see head-tail-head than head-tail-tail?\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nWho thinks that B is true -- that on average, they're the same?\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nWho thinks that C is true -- that, on average, it'll take less time\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nto see head-tail-head than head-tail-tail?\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nOK, who hasn't voted yet? Because that's really naughty -- I said you had to.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nOK. So most people think B is true.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nAnd you might be relieved to know even rather distinguished mathematicians think that.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nIt's not. A is true here.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nIt takes longer, on average.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nIn fact, the average number of tosses till head-tail-head is 10\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nand the average number of tosses until head-tail-tail is eight.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nHow could that be?\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nAnything different about the two patterns?\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nThere is. Head-tail-head overlaps itself.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nIf you went head-tail-head-tail-head, you can cunningly get two occurrences\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nof the pattern in only five tosses.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nYou can't do that with head-tail-tail.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nThat turns out to be important.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nThere are two ways of thinking about this.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nI'll give you one of them.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nSo imagine -- let's suppose we're doing it.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nOn this side -- remember, you're excited about head-tail-tail;\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nyou're excited about head-tail-head.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nWe start tossing a coin, and we get a head --\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nand you start sitting on the edge of your seat\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nbecause something great and wonderful, or awesome, might be about to happen.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nThe next toss is a tail -- you get really excited.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nThe champagne's on ice just next to you; you've got the glasses chilled to celebrate.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nYou're waiting with bated breath for the final toss.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nAnd if it comes down a head, that's great.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nYou're done, and you celebrate.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nIf it's a tail -- well, rather disappointedly, you put the glasses away\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nand put the champagne back.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nAnd you keep tossing, to wait for the next head, to get excited.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nOn this side, there's a different experience.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nIt's the same for the first two parts of the sequence.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nYou're a little bit excited with the first head --\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nyou get rather more excited with the next tail.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nThen you toss the coin.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nIf it's a tail, you crack open the champagne.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nIf it's a head you're disappointed,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nbut you're still a third of the way to your pattern again.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nAnd that's an informal way of presenting it -- that's why there's a difference.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nAnother way of thinking about it --\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nif we tossed a coin eight million times,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nthen we'd expect a million head-tail-heads\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nand a million head-tail-tails -- but the head-tail-heads could occur in clumps.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nSo if you want to put a million things down amongst eight million positions\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nand you can have some of them overlapping, the clumps will be further apart.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nIt's another way of getting the intuition.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nWhat's the point I want to make?\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nIt's a very, very simple example, an easily stated question in probability,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nwhich every -- you're in good company -- everybody gets wrong.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nThis is my little diversion into my real passion, which is genetics.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nThere's a connection between head-tail-heads and head-tail-tails in genetics,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nand it's the following.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nWhen you toss a coin, you get a sequence of heads and tails.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nWhen you look at DNA, there's a sequence of not two things -- heads and tails --\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nbut four letters -- As, Gs, Cs and Ts.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nAnd there are little chemical scissors, called restriction enzymes\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nwhich cut DNA whenever they see particular patterns.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nAnd they're an enormously useful tool in modern molecular biology.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nAnd instead of asking the question, \"How long until I see a head-tail-head?\" --\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nyou can ask, \"How big will the chunks be when I use a restriction enzyme\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nwhich cuts whenever it sees G-A-A-G, for example?\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nHow long will those chunks be?\"\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nThat's a rather trivial connection between probability and genetics.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nThere's a much deeper connection, which I don't have time to go into\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nand that is that modern genetics is a really exciting area of science.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nAnd we'll hear some talks later in the conference specifically about that.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nBut it turns out that unlocking the secrets in the information generated by modern\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nexperimental technologies, a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisticated --\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nyou'll be relieved to know that I do something useful in my day job,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nrather more sophisticated than the head-tail-head story --\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nbut quite sophisticated computer modelings and mathematical modelings\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nand modern statistical techniques.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nAnd I will give you two little snippets -- two examples --\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nof projects we're involved in in my group in Oxford,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nboth of which I think are rather exciting.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nYou know about the Human Genome Project.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nThat was a project which aimed to read one copy of the human genome.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nThe natural thing to do after you've done that --\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nand that's what this project, the International HapMap Project,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nwhich is a collaboration between labs in five or six different countries.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nThink of the Human Genome Project as learning what we've got in common,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nand the HapMap Project is trying to understand\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nwhere there are differences between different people.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nWhy do we care about that?\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nWell, there are lots of reasons.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nThe most pressing one is that we want to understand how some differences\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nmake some people susceptible to one disease -- type-2 diabetes, for example --\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nand other differences make people more susceptible to heart disease,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nor stroke, or autism and so on.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nThat's one big project.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nThere's a second big project,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nrecently funded by the Wellcome Trust in this country,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\ninvolving very large studies --\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nthousands of individuals, with each of eight different diseases,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.958\ncommon diseases like type-1 and type-2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease,\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nbipolar disease and so on -- to try and understand the genetics.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nTo try and understand what it is about genetic differences that causes the diseases.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nWhy do we want to do that?\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nBecause we understand very little about most human diseases.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nWe don't know what causes them.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAnd if we can get in at the bottom and understand the genetics,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nwe'll have a window on the way the disease works,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nand a whole new way about thinking about disease therapies\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nand preventative treatment and so on.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nSo that's, as I said, the little diversion on my main love.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nBack to some of the more mundane issues of thinking about uncertainty.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nHere's another quiz for you --\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nnow suppose we've got a test for a disease\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nwhich isn't infallible, but it's pretty good.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nIt gets it right 99 percent of the time.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nAnd I take one of you, or I take someone off the street,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nand I test them for the disease in question.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nLet's suppose there's a test for HIV -- the virus that causes AIDS --\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nand the test says the person has the disease.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nWhat's the chance that they do?\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nThe test gets it right 99 percent of the time.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nSo a natural answer is 99 percent.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nWho likes that answer?\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nCome on -- everyone's got to get involved.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nDon't think you don't trust me anymore.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nWell, you're right to be a bit skeptical, because that's not the answer.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nThat's what you might think.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nIt's not the answer, and it's not because it's only part of the story.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nIt actually depends on how common or how rare the disease is.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nSo let me try and illustrate that.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nHere's a little caricature of a million individuals.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nSo let's think about a disease that affects --\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nit's pretty rare, it affects one person in 10,000.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nAmongst these million individuals, most of them are healthy\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nand some of them will have the disease.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nAnd in fact, if this is the prevalence of the disease,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nabout 100 will have the disease and the rest won't.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nSo now suppose we test them all.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nWhat happens?\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nWell, amongst the 100 who do have the disease,\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nthe test will get it right 99 percent of the time, and 99 will test positive.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAmongst all these other people who don't have the disease,\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nthe test will get it right 99 percent of the time.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nIt'll only get it wrong one percent of the time.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nBut there are so many of them that there'll be an enormous number of false positives.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nPut that another way --\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nof all of them who test positive -- so here they are, the individuals involved --\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nless than one in 100 actually have the disease.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nSo even though we think the test is accurate, the important part of the story is\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nthere's another bit of information we need.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nHere's the key intuition.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nWhat we have to do, once we know the test is positive,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nis to weigh up the plausibility, or the likelihood, of two competing explanations.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nEach of those explanations has a likely bit and an unlikely bit.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nOne explanation is that the person doesn't have the disease --\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nthat's overwhelmingly likely, if you pick someone at random --\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nbut the test gets it wrong, which is unlikely.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nThe other explanation is that the person does have the disease -- that's unlikely --\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nbut the test gets it right, which is likely.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nAnd the number we end up with --\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nthat number which is a little bit less than one in 100 --\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nis to do with how likely one of those explanations is relative to the other.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nEach of them taken together is unlikely.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nHere's a more topical example of exactly the same thing.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nThose of you in Britain will know about what's become rather a celebrated case\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nof a woman called Sally Clark, who had two babies who died suddenly.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nAnd initially, it was thought that they died of what's known informally as \"cot death,\"\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nand more formally as \"Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.\"\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nFor various reasons, she was later charged with murder.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nAnd at the trial, her trial, a very distinguished pediatrician gave evidence\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nthat the chance of two cot deaths, innocent deaths, in a family like hers --\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nwhich was professional and non-smoking -- was one in 73 million.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nTo cut a long story short, she was convicted at the time.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nLater, and fairly recently, acquitted on appeal -- in fact, on the second appeal.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nAnd just to set it in context, you can imagine how awful it is for someone\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nto have lost one child, and then two, if they're innocent,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nto be convicted of murdering them.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nTo be put through the stress of the trial, convicted of murdering them --\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nand to spend time in a women's prison, where all the other prisoners\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nthink you killed your children -- is a really awful thing to happen to someone.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nAnd it happened in large part here because the expert got the statistics\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nhorribly wrong, in two different ways.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nSo where did he get the one in 73 million number?\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nHe looked at some research, which said the chance of one cot death in a family\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nlike Sally Clark's is about one in 8,500.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nSo he said, \"I'll assume that if you have one cot death in a family,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nthe chance of a second child dying from cot death aren't changed.\"\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nSo that's what statisticians would call an assumption of independence.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nIt's like saying, \"If you toss a coin and get a head the first time,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nthat won't affect the chance of getting a head the second time.\"\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nSo if you toss a coin twice, the chance of getting a head twice are a half --\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nthat's the chance the first time -- times a half -- the chance a second time.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nSo he said, \"Here,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nI'll assume that these events are independent.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nWhen you multiply 8,500 together twice,\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nyou get about 73 million.\"\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nAnd none of this was stated to the court as an assumption\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nor presented to the jury that way.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nUnfortunately here -- and, really, regrettably --\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nfirst of all, in a situation like this you'd have to verify it empirically.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nAnd secondly, it's palpably false.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nThere are lots and lots of things that we don't know about sudden infant deaths.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nIt might well be that there are environmental factors that we're not aware of,\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nand it's pretty likely to be the case that there are\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\ngenetic factors we're not aware of.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nSo if a family suffers from one cot death, you'd put them in a high-risk group.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nThey've probably got these environmental risk factors\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nand/or genetic risk factors we don't know about.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nAnd to argue, then, that the chance of a second death is as if you didn't know\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nthat information is really silly.\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nIt's worse than silly -- it's really bad science.\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nNonetheless, that's how it was presented, and at trial nobody even argued it.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nThat's the first problem.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nThe second problem is, what does the number of one in 73 million mean?\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nSo after Sally Clark was convicted --\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nyou can imagine, it made rather a splash in the press --\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:42.958\none of the journalists from one of Britain's more reputable newspapers wrote that\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nwhat the expert had said was,\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:49.958\n\"The chance that she was innocent was one in 73 million.\"\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nNow, that's a logical error.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nIt's exactly the same logical error as the logical error of thinking that\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nafter the disease test, which is 99 percent accurate,\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nthe chance of having the disease is 99 percent.\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nIn the disease example, we had to bear in mind two things,\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:08.958\none of which was the possibility that the test got it right or not.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nAnd the other one was the chance, a priori, that the person had the disease or not.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nIt's exactly the same in this context.\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nThere are two things involved -- two parts to the explanation.\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nWe want to know how likely, or relatively how likely, two different explanations are.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nOne of them is that Sally Clark was innocent --\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nwhich is, a priori, overwhelmingly likely --\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nmost mothers don't kill their children.\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nAnd the second part of the explanation\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nis that she suffered an incredibly unlikely event.\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nNot as unlikely as one in 73 million, but nonetheless rather unlikely.\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nThe other explanation is that she was guilty.\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nNow, we probably think a priori that's unlikely.\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nAnd we certainly should think in the context of a criminal trial\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nthat that's unlikely, because of the presumption of innocence.\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nAnd then if she were trying to kill the children, she succeeded.\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nSo the chance that she's innocent isn't one in 73 million.\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nWe don't know what it is.\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nIt has to do with weighing up the strength of the other evidence against her\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nand the statistical evidence.\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nWe know the children died.\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:12.958\nWhat matters is how likely or unlikely, relative to each other,\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nthe two explanations are.\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nAnd they're both implausible.\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nThere's a situation where errors in statistics had really profound\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nand really unfortunate consequences.\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nIn fact, there are two other women who were convicted on the basis of the\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nevidence of this pediatrician, who have subsequently been released on appeal.\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nMany cases were reviewed.\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nAnd it's particularly topical because he's currently facing a disrepute charge\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nat Britain's General Medical Council.\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nSo just to conclude -- what are the take-home messages from this?\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nWell, we know that randomness and uncertainty and chance\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nare very much a part of our everyday life.\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nIt's also true -- and, although, you, as a collective, are very special in many ways,\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:59.958\nyou're completely typical in not getting the examples I gave right.\n\n00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nIt's very well documented that people get things wrong.\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nThey make errors of logic in reasoning with uncertainty.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nWe can cope with the subtleties of language brilliantly --\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nand there are interesting evolutionary questions about how we got here.\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nWe are not good at reasoning with uncertainty.\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:16.958\nThat's an issue in our everyday lives.\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:19.958\nAs you've heard from many of the talks, statistics underpins an enormous amount\n\n00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:22.958\nof research in science -- in social science, in medicine\n\n00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nand indeed, quite a lot of industry.\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nAll of quality control, which has had a major impact on industrial processing,\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:30.958\nis underpinned by statistics.\n\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nIt's something we're bad at doing.\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:35.958\nAt the very least, we should recognize that, and we tend not to.\n\n00:19:35.958 --> 00:19:39.958\nTo go back to the legal context, at the Sally Clark trial\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:43.958\nall of the lawyers just accepted what the expert said.\n\n00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:45.958\nSo if a pediatrician had come out and said to a jury,\n\n00:19:45.958 --> 00:19:48.958\n\"I know how to build bridges. I've built one down the road.\n\n00:19:48.958 --> 00:19:50.958\nPlease drive your car home over it,\"\n\n00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:52.958\nthey would have said, \"Well, pediatricians don't know how to build bridges.\n\n00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:54.958\nThat's what engineers do.\"\n\n00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:57.958\nOn the other hand, he came out and effectively said, or implied,\n\n00:19:57.958 --> 00:20:00.958\n\"I know how to reason with uncertainty. I know how to do statistics.\"\n\n00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:03.958\nAnd everyone said, \"Well, that's fine. He's an expert.\"\n\n00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:06.958\nSo we need to understand where our competence is and isn't.\n\n00:20:06.958 --> 00:20:10.958\nExactly the same kinds of issues arose in the early days of DNA profiling,\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:14.958\nwhen scientists, and lawyers and in some cases judges,\n\n00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:17.958\nroutinely misrepresented evidence.\n\n00:20:18.958 --> 00:20:21.958\nUsually -- one hopes -- innocently, but misrepresented evidence.\n\n00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:26.958\nForensic scientists said, \"The chance that this guy's innocent is one in three million.\"\n\n00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:28.958\nEven if you believe the number, just like the 73 million to one,\n\n00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:30.958\nthat's not what it meant.\n\n00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:32.958\nAnd there have been celebrated appeal cases\n\n00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:34.958\nin Britain and elsewhere because of that.\n\n00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:37.958\nAnd just to finish in the context of the legal system.\n\n00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:41.958\nIt's all very well to say, \"Let's do our best to present the evidence.\"\n\n00:20:41.958 --> 00:20:44.958\nBut more and more, in cases of DNA profiling -- this is another one --\n\n00:20:44.958 --> 00:20:47.958\nwe expect juries, who are ordinary people --\n\n00:20:47.958 --> 00:20:49.958\nand it's documented they're very bad at this --\n\n00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:53.958\nwe expect juries to be able to cope with the sorts of reasoning that goes on.\n\n00:20:53.958 --> 00:20:58.958\nIn other spheres of life, if people argued -- well, except possibly for politics --\n\n00:20:58.958 --> 00:21:00.958\nbut in other spheres of life, if people argued illogically,\n\n00:21:00.958 --> 00:21:02.958\nwe'd say that's not a good thing.\n\n00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:06.958\nWe sort of expect it of politicians and don't hope for much more.\n\n00:21:06.958 --> 00:21:09.958\nIn the case of uncertainty, we get it wrong all the time --\n\n00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:11.958\nand at the very least, we should be aware of that,\n\n00:21:11.958 --> 00:21:13.958\nand ideally, we might try and do something about it.\n\n00:21:13.958 --> 00:21:14.958\nThanks very much."}, {"title": "Why people believe weird things", "duration": "805", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/michael_shermer_on_believing_strange_things", "transcript": "I'm Michael Shermer, director of the Skeptics Society, publisher of \"Skeptic\" magazine. We investigate claims of the paranormal, pseudo-science, fringe groups and cults, and claims of all kinds between, science and pseudo-science and non-science and junk science, voodoo science, pathological science, bad science, non-science, and plain old non-sense. And unless you've been on Mars recently, you know there's a lot of that out there.Some people call us debunkers, which is kind of a negative term. But let's face it, there's a lot of bunk. We are like the bunko squads of the police departments out there \u2014 well, we're sort of like the Ralph Naders of bad ideas,(Laughter)trying to replace bad ideas with good ideas.I'll show you an example of a bad idea. I brought this with me, this was given to us by NBC Dateline to test. It's produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia. It's called the Quadro 2000 Dowser Rod.(Laughter)This was being sold to high-school administrators for $900 apiece. It's a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it. You could dowse for all sorts of things, but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana in students' lockers.(Laughter)So the way it works is you go down the hallway, and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker, and then you open the locker. So it looks something like this. I'll show you.(Laughter)Well, it has kind of a right-leaning bias. Well, this is science, so we'll do a controlled experiment. It'll go this way for sure.(Laughter)Sir, do you want to empty your pockets, please, sir?(Laughter)So the question was, can it actually find marijuana in students' lockers? And the answer is, if you open enough of them, yes.(Laughter)(Applause)But in science, we have to keep track of the misses, not just the hits. And that's probably the key lesson to my short talk here: This is how psychics work, astrologers, tarot card readers and so on. People remember the hits and forget the misses. In science, we keep the whole database, and look to see if the number of hits somehow stands out from the total number you'd expect by chance.In this case, we tested it.We had two opaque boxes: one with government-approved THC marijuana, and one with nothing. And it got it 50 percent of the time \u2014(Laughter)which is exactly what you'd expect with a coin-flip model. So that's just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do.\"Skeptic\" is the quarterly publication. Each one has a particular theme. This one is on the future of intelligence. Are people getting smarter or dumber? I have an opinion of this myself because of the business I'm in, but in fact, people, it turns out, are getting smarter. Three IQ points per 10 years, going up. Sort of an interesting thing.With science, don't think of skepticism as a thing, or science as a thing. Are science and religion compatible? It's like, are science and plumbing compatible? They're just two different things. Science is not a thing. It's a verb. It's a way of thinking about things. It's a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena.I mean, what's more likely: that extraterrestrial intelligences or multi-dimensional beings travel across vast distances of interstellar space to leave a crop circle in Farmer Bob's field in Puckerbrush, Kansas to promote skeptic.com, our web page? Or is it more likely that a reader of \"Skeptic\" did this with Photoshop? And in all cases we have to ask \u2014(Laughter)What's the more likely explanation? Before we say something is out of this world, we should first make sure that it's not in this world. What's more likely: that Arnold had extraterrestrial help in his run for the governorship, or that the \"World Weekly News\" makes stuff up?(Laughter)The same theme is expressed nicely here in this Sidney Harris cartoon. For those of you in the back, it says here: \"Then a miracle occurs. I think you need to be more explicit here in step two.\" This single slide completely dismantles the intelligent design arguments. There's nothing more to it than that.(Applause)You can say a miracle occurs, it's just that it doesn't explain anything or offer anything. There's nothing to test. It's the end of the conversation for intelligent design creationists.And it's true, scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers \u2014 dark energy or dark matter, something like that \u2014 until we figure out what it is, we'll call it this. It's the beginning of the causal chain for science. For intelligent design creationists, it's the end of the chain. So again, we can ask this: what's more likely? Are UFOs alien spaceships, or perceptual cognitive mistakes, or even fakes?This is a UFO shot from my house in Altadena, California, looking down over Pasadena. And if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap, it's because it is. You don't even need Photoshop or high-tech equipment, you don't need computers. This was shot with a throwaway Kodak Instamatic camera. You just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go. Camera's ready \u2014 that's it.(Laughter)So, although it's possible that most of these things are fake or illusions or so on, and that some of them are real, it's more likely that all of them are fake, like the crop circles.On a more serious note, in all of science we're looking for a balance between data and theory. In the case of Galileo, he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn. First of all, there was no theory of planetary rings. Second of all, his data was grainy and fuzzy, and he couldn't quite make out what he was looking at. So he wrote that he had seen \u2014 \"I have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies.\" And this is what he ended up concluding that he saw. So without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data, you can't have a good theory. It wasn't solved until 1655.This is Christiaan Huygens's book that catalogs all the mistakes people made trying to figure out what was going on with Saturn. It wasn't till Huygens had two things: He had a good theory of planetary rings and how the solar system operated, and he had better telescopic, more fine-grain data in which he could figure out that as the Earth is going around faster \u2014 according to Kepler's Laws \u2014 than Saturn, then we catch up with it. And we see the angles of the rings at different angles, there. And that, in fact, turns out to be true.The problem with having a theory is that it may be loaded with cognitive biases. So one of the problems of explaining why people believe weird things is that we have things, on a simple level, and then I'll go to more serious ones. Like, we have a tendency to see faces.This is the face on Mars. In 1976, where there was a whole movement to get NASA to photograph that area because people thought this was monumental architecture made by Martians. Here's the close-up of it from 2001. If you squint, you can still see the face. And when you're squinting, you're turning that from fine-grain to coarse-grain, so you're reducing the quality of your data. And if I didn't tell you what to look for, you'd still see the face, because we're programmed by evolution to see faces.Faces are important for us socially. And of course, happy faces, faces of all kinds are easy to see. You see the happy face on Mars, there.(Laughter)If astronomers were frogs, perhaps they'd see Kermit the Frog. Do you see him there? Little froggy legs. Or if geologists were elephants?Religious iconography.(Laughter)Discovered by a Tennessee baker in 1996. He charged five bucks a head to come see the nun bun till he got a cease-and-desist from Mother Teresa's lawyer. Here's Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our Lady of Watsonville, just down the street, or is it up the street from here? Tree bark is particularly good because it's nice and grainy, branchy, black-and-white splotchy and you can get the pattern-seeking \u2014 humans are pattern-seeking animals.Here's the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo. Here's when the Virgin Mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich \u2014 which I got to actually hold in a Las Vegas casino \u2014 of course, this being America.(Laughter)This casino paid $28,500 on eBay for the cheese sandwich.(Laughter)But who does it really look like? The Virgin Mary?(Laughter)It has that sort of puckered lips, 1940s-era look.Virgin Mary in Clearwater, Florida. I actually went to see this one. There was a lot of people there. The faithful come in their wheelchairs and crutches, and so on. We went down and investigated. Just to give you a size, that's Dawkins, me and The Amazing Randi, next to this two, two and a half story-sized image. All these candles, thousands of candles people had lit in tribute to this. So we walked around the backside, to see what was going on. It turns out wherever there's a sprinkler head and a palm tree, you get the effect. Here's the Virgin Mary on the backside, which they started to wipe off. I guess you can only have one miracle per building.(Laughter)So is it really a miracle of Mary, or is it a miracle of Marge?(Laughter)And now I'm going to finish up with another example of this, with auditory illusions. There's this film, \"White Noise,\" with Michael Keaton, about the dead talking back to us. By the way, the whole business of talking to the dead is not that big a deal. Anybody can do it, turns out. It's getting the dead to talk back that's the really hard part.(Laughter)In this case, supposedly, these messages are hidden in electronic phenomena. There's a ReverseSpeech.com web page where I downloaded this stuff. This is the most famous one of all of these. Here's the forward version of the very famous song.(Music with lyrics)If there's a bustle in your hedgerow don't be alarmed now. It's just a spring clean for the May Queen. Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run, There's still time to change the road you're on.(Music ends)Couldn't you just listen to that all day?All right, here it is backwards, and see if you can hear the hidden messages that are supposedly in there.(Music with unintelligible lyrics)(Lyrics) Satan!(Unintelligible lyrics continue)What did you get? Audience: Satan!Satan. OK, at least we got \"Satan\". Now, I'll prime the auditory part of your brain to tell you what you're supposed to hear, and then hear it again.(Music with lyrics)(Music ends)(Laughter)(Applause)You can't miss it when I tell you what's there.(Laughter)I'm going to just end with a positive, nice little story. The Skeptics is a nonprofit educational organization. We're always looking for little good things that people do.And in England, there's a pop singer. One of the top popular singers in England today, Katie Melua. And she wrote a beautiful song. It was in the top five in 2005, called, \"Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing.\" It's a love story \u2014 she's sort of the Norah Jones of the UK \u2014 about how she much loves her guy, and compared to nine million bicycles, and so forth. And she has this one passage here.(Music)(Lyrics) We are 12 billion light-years from the edgeThat's a guess,No one can ever say it's true,But I know that I will always be with you.Michael Shermer: Well, that's nice. At least she got it close. In America it'd be, \"We're 6,000 light years from the edge.\"(Laughter)But my friend, Simon Singh, the particle physicist now turned science educator, who wrote the book \"The Big Bang,\" and so on, uses every chance he gets to promote good science. And so he wrote an op-ed piece in \"The Guardian\" about Katie's song, in which he said, well, we know exactly how far from the edge. You know, it's 13.7 billion light years, and it's not a guess. We know within precise error bars how close it is. So we can say, although not absolutely true, it's pretty close to being true.And, to his credit, Katie called him up after this op-ed piece came out, and said, \"I'm so embarrassed. I was in the astronomy club. I should've known better.\" And she re-cut the song. So I will end with the new version.(Music with lyrics)We are 13.7 billion light years from the edge of the observable universe. That's a good estimate with well-defined error bars. And with the available information, I predict that I will always be with you.(Laughter)How cool is that?(Applause)", "id": 22, "subtitle":

could dowse for all sorts of things,\n\n00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.692\nbut this particular one was built\nto dowse for marijuana\n\n00:01:19.716 --> 00:01:20.934\nin students' lockers.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:23.418\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:23.442 --> 00:01:26.987\nSo the way it works\nis you go down the hallway,\n\n00:01:27.011 --> 00:01:30.010\nand you see if it tilts\ntoward a particular locker,\n\n00:01:30.034 --> 00:01:31.478\nand then you open the locker.\n\n00:01:31.502 --> 00:01:33.079\nSo it looks something like this.\n\n00:01:33.103 --> 00:01:34.286\nI'll show you.\n\n00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:36.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:40.349\nWell, it has kind of a right-leaning bias.\n\n00:01:40.373 --> 00:01:43.178\nWell, this is science,\nso we'll do a controlled experiment.\n\n00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:44.784\nIt'll go this way for sure.\n\n00:01:44.808 --> 00:01:48.742\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:51.292\nSir, do you want to empty\nyour pockets, please, sir?\n\n00:01:51.316 --> 00:01:53.154\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:53.178 --> 00:01:56.635\nSo the question was, can it actually\nfind marijuana in students' lockers?\n\n00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.257\nAnd the answer is,\nif you open enough of them, yes.\n\n00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:00.304\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:00.328 --> 00:02:01.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:05.339\nBut in science, we have to keep track\nof the misses, not just the hits.\n\n00:02:05.363 --> 00:02:08.629\nAnd that's probably the key lesson\nto my short talk here:\n\n00:02:08.653 --> 00:02:12.387\nThis is how psychics work, astrologers,\ntarot card readers and so on.\n\n00:02:12.411 --> 00:02:14.630\nPeople remember the hits\nand forget the misses.\n\n00:02:14.654 --> 00:02:16.549\nIn science, we keep the whole database,\n\n00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:19.234\nand look to see if the number\nof hits somehow stands out\n\n00:02:19.258 --> 00:02:21.471\nfrom the total number\nyou'd expect by chance.\n\n00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:22.789\nIn this case, we tested it.\n\n00:02:22.813 --> 00:02:24.305\nWe had two opaque boxes:\n\n00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.963\none with government-approved THC\nmarijuana, and one with nothing.\n\n00:02:27.987 --> 00:02:29.868\nAnd it got it 50 percent of the time --\n\n00:02:29.892 --> 00:02:30.985\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:33.934\nwhich is exactly what you'd expect\nwith a coin-flip model.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:37.949\nSo that's just a fun little example\nhere of the sorts of things we do.\n\n00:02:37.973 --> 00:02:41.441\n\"Skeptic\" is the quarterly publication.\nEach one has a particular theme.\n\n00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:43.539\nThis one is on the future of intelligence.\n\n00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:45.334\nAre people getting smarter or dumber?\n\n00:02:45.358 --> 00:02:48.406\nI have an opinion of this myself\nbecause of the business I'm in,\n\n00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.097\nbut in fact, people, it turns out,\nare getting smarter.\n\n00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:53.934\nThree IQ points per 10 years, going up.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.609\nSort of an interesting thing.\n\n00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:59.180\nWith science, don't think of skepticism\nas a thing, or science as a thing.\n\n00:02:59.204 --> 00:03:00.934\nAre science and religion compatible?\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.189\nIt's like, are science\nand plumbing compatible?\n\n00:03:03.213 --> 00:03:04.847\nThey're just two different things.\n\n00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:06.610\nScience is not a thing. It's a verb.\n\n00:03:06.634 --> 00:03:08.356\nIt's a way of thinking about things.\n\n00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.450\nIt's a way of looking for natural\nexplanations for all phenomena.\n\n00:03:11.474 --> 00:03:12.824\nI mean, what's more likely:\n\n00:03:12.848 --> 00:03:16.411\nthat extraterrestrial intelligences\nor multi-dimensional beings\n\n00:03:16.435 --> 00:03:18.825\ntravel across vast distances\nof interstellar space\n\n00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.029\nto leave a crop circle in Farmer Bob's\nfield in Puckerbrush, Kansas\n\n00:03:22.053 --> 00:03:23.863\nto promote skeptic.com, our web page?\n\n00:03:23.887 --> 00:03:28.365\nOr is it more likely that a reader\nof \"Skeptic\" did this with Photoshop?\n\n00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.039\nAnd in all cases we have to ask --\n\n00:03:30.063 --> 00:03:31.887\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:33.934\nWhat's the more likely explanation?\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.125\nBefore we say something\nis out of this world,\n\n00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:38.813\nwe should first make sure\nthat it's not in this world.\n\n00:03:38.837 --> 00:03:39.988\nWhat's more likely:\n\n00:03:40.012 --> 00:03:43.338\nthat Arnold had extraterrestrial help\nin his run for the governorship,\n\n00:03:43.362 --> 00:03:45.860\nor that the \"World Weekly News\"\nmakes stuff up?\n\n00:03:45.884 --> 00:03:47.273\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:47.297 --> 00:03:51.959\nThe same theme is expressed nicely\nhere in this Sidney Harris cartoon.\n\n00:03:51.983 --> 00:03:55.198\nFor those of you in the back,\nit says here: \"Then a miracle occurs.\n\n00:03:55.222 --> 00:03:57.934\nI think you need to be more\nexplicit here in step two.\"\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:02.454\nThis single slide completely dismantles\nthe intelligent design arguments.\n\n00:04:02.478 --> 00:04:04.326\nThere's nothing more to it than that.\n\n00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.400\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:05.424 --> 00:04:06.812\nYou can say a miracle occurs,\n\n00:04:06.836 --> 00:04:09.802\nit's just that it doesn't explain\nanything or offer anything.\n\n00:04:09.826 --> 00:04:10.976\nThere's nothing to test.\n\n00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.448\nIt's the end of the conversation\nfor intelligent design creationists.\n\n00:04:14.472 --> 00:04:19.358\nAnd it's true, scientists sometimes throw\nterms out as linguistic place fillers --\n\n00:04:19.382 --> 00:04:21.730\ndark energy or dark matter,\nsomething like that --\n\n00:04:21.754 --> 00:04:24.214\nuntil we figure out what it is,\nwe'll call it this.\n\n00:04:24.238 --> 00:04:26.939\nIt's the beginning of the causal\nchain for science.\n\n00:04:26.963 --> 00:04:31.038\nFor intelligent design creationists,\nit's the end of the chain.\n\n00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:33.234\nSo again, we can ask this:\nwhat's more likely?\n\n00:04:33.258 --> 00:04:37.649\nAre UFOs alien spaceships, or perceptual\ncognitive mistakes, or even fakes?\n\n00:04:37.673 --> 00:04:40.934\nThis is a UFO shot from my house\nin Altadena, California,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.934\nlooking down over Pasadena.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.479\nAnd if it looks a lot like a Buick\nhubcap, it's because it is.\n\n00:04:46.503 --> 00:04:49.241\nYou don't even need Photoshop\nor high-tech equipment,\n\n00:04:49.265 --> 00:04:50.463\nyou don't need computers.\n\n00:04:50.487 --> 00:04:53.934\nThis was shot with a throwaway\nKodak Instamatic camera.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:57.054\nYou just have somebody off on the side\nwith a hubcap ready to go.\n\n00:04:57.078 --> 00:04:58.976\nCamera's ready -- that's it.\n\n00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.437\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:03.934\nSo, although it's possible\nthat most of these things are fake\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.672\nor illusions or so on,\nand that some of them are real,\n\n00:05:07.696 --> 00:05:10.829\nit's more likely that all of them\nare fake, like the crop circles.\n\n00:05:10.853 --> 00:05:14.234\nOn a more serious note, in all of science\nwe're looking for a balance\n\n00:05:14.258 --> 00:05:15.934\nbetween data and theory.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:19.934\nIn the case of Galileo,\nhe had two problems\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.319\nwhen he turned his telescope to Saturn.\n\n00:05:22.343 --> 00:05:25.465\nFirst of all, there was no\ntheory of planetary rings.\n\n00:05:25.489 --> 00:05:27.682\nSecond of all, his data\nwas grainy and fuzzy,\n\n00:05:27.706 --> 00:05:30.234\nand he couldn't quite make out\nwhat he was looking at.\n\n00:05:30.258 --> 00:05:31.934\nSo he wrote that he had seen --\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:35.465\n\"I have observed that the furthest\nplanet has three bodies.\"\n\n00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:38.354\nAnd this is what he ended up\nconcluding that he saw.\n\n00:05:38.378 --> 00:05:41.934\nSo without a theory of planetary\nrings and with only grainy data,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.876\nyou can't have a good theory.\n\n00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.519\nIt wasn't solved until 1655.\n\n00:05:45.543 --> 00:05:48.557\nThis is Christiaan Huygens's book\nthat catalogs all the mistakes\n\n00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:51.543\npeople made trying to figure out\nwhat was going on with Saturn.\n\n00:05:51.567 --> 00:05:53.423\nIt wasn't till Huygens had two things:\n\n00:05:53.447 --> 00:05:57.933\nHe had a good theory of planetary rings\nand how the solar system operated,\n\n00:05:57.957 --> 00:06:00.820\nand he had better telescopic,\nmore fine-grain data\n\n00:06:00.844 --> 00:06:04.387\nin which he could figure out that\nas the Earth is going around faster --\n\n00:06:04.411 --> 00:06:07.639\naccording to Kepler's Laws --\nthan Saturn, then we catch up with it.\n\n00:06:07.663 --> 00:06:10.934\nAnd we see the angles of the rings\nat different angles, there.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.178\nAnd that, in fact, turns out to be true.\n\n00:06:13.202 --> 00:06:18.499\nThe problem with having a theory is that\nit may be loaded with cognitive biases.\n\n00:06:18.523 --> 00:06:21.790\nSo one of the problems of explaining\nwhy people believe weird things\n\n00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:23.882\nis that we have things, on a simple level,\n\n00:06:23.906 --> 00:06:25.734\nand then I'll go to more serious ones.\n\n00:06:25.758 --> 00:06:27.634\nLike, we have a tendency to see faces.\n\n00:06:27.658 --> 00:06:29.434\nThis is the face on Mars.\n\n00:06:29.458 --> 00:06:33.970\nIn 1976, where there was a whole movement\nto get NASA to photograph that area\n\n00:06:33.994 --> 00:06:37.910\nbecause people thought this was monumental\narchitecture made by Martians.\n\n00:06:37.934 --> 00:06:40.705\nHere's the close-up of it from 2001.\n\n00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:43.189\nIf you squint, you can still see the face.\n\n00:06:43.213 --> 00:06:44.515\nAnd when you're squinting,\n\n00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:47.562\nyou're turning that from fine-grain\nto coarse-grain,\n\n00:06:47.586 --> 00:06:49.873\nso you're reducing\nthe quality of your data.\n\n00:06:49.897 --> 00:06:53.126\nAnd if I didn't tell you what to look for,\nyou'd still see the face,\n\n00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.579\nbecause we're programmed\nby evolution to see faces.\n\n00:06:55.603 --> 00:06:57.754\nFaces are important for us socially.\n\n00:06:57.778 --> 00:07:01.246\nAnd of course, happy faces,\nfaces of all kinds are easy

We've heard a lot about the promise of technology, and the peril. I've been quite interested in both. If we could convert 0.03 percent of the sunlight that falls on the earth into energy, we could meet all of our projected needs for 2030. We can't do that today because solar panels are heavy, expensive and very inefficient. There are nano-engineered designs, which at least have been analyzed theoretically, that show the potential to be very lightweight, very inexpensive, very efficient, and we'd be able to actually provide all of our energy needs in this renewable way. Nano-engineered fuel cells could provide the energy where it's needed. That's a key trend, which is decentralization, moving from centralized nuclear power plants and liquid natural gas tankers to decentralized resources that are environmentally more friendly, a lot more efficient and capable and safe from disruption.Bono spoke very eloquently, that we have the tools, for the first time, to address age-old problems of disease and poverty. Most regions of the world are moving in that direction. In 1990, in East Asia and the Pacific region, there were 500 million people living in poverty \u2014 that number now is under 200 million. The World Bank projects by 2011, it will be under 20 million, which is a reduction of 95 percent. I did enjoy Bono's comment linking Haight-Ashbury to Silicon Valley. Being from the Massachusetts high-tech community myself, I'd point out that we were hippies also in the 1960s, although we hung around Harvard Square. But we do have the potential to overcome disease and poverty, and I'm going to talk about those issues, if we have the will.Kevin Kelly talked about the acceleration of technology. That's been a strong interest of mine, and a theme that I've developed for some 30 years. I realized that my technologies had to make sense when I finished a project. That invariably, the world was a different place when I would introduce a technology. And, I noticed that most inventions fail, not because the R&D department can't get it to work \u2014 if you look at most business plans, they will actually succeed if given the opportunity to build what they say they're going to build \u2014 and 90 percent of those projects or more will fail, because the timing is wrong \u2014 not all the enabling factors will be in place when they're needed.So I began to be an ardent student of technology trends, and track where technology would be at different points in time, and began to build the mathematical models of that. It's kind of taken on a life of its own. I've got a group of 10 people that work with me to gather data on key measures of technology in many different areas, and we build models. And you'll hear people say, well, we can't predict the future. And if you ask me, will the price of Google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now, that's very hard to say. Will WiMax CDMA G3 be the wireless standard three years from now? That's hard to say. But if you ask me, what will it cost for one MIPS of computing in 2010, or the cost to sequence a base pair of DNA in 2012, or the cost of sending a megabyte of data wirelessly in 2014, it turns out that those are very predictable.There are remarkably smooth exponential curves that govern price performance, capacity, bandwidth. And I'm going to show you a small sample of this, but there's really a theoretical reason why technology develops in an exponential fashion. And a lot of people, when they think about the future, think about it linearly. They think they're going to continue to develop a problem or address a problem using today's tools, at today's pace of progress, and fail to take into consideration this exponential growth.The Genome Project was a controversial project in 1990. We had our best Ph.D. students, our most advanced equipment around the world, we got 1/10,000th of the project done, so how're we going to get this done in 15 years? And 10 years into the project, the skeptics were still going strong \u2014 says, \"You're two-thirds through this project, and you've managed to only sequence a very tiny percentage of the whole genome.\" But it's the nature of exponential growth that once it reaches the knee of the curve, it explodes. Most of the project was done in the last few years of the project. It took us 15 years to sequence HIV \u2014 we sequenced SARS in 31 days. So we are gaining the potential to overcome these problems.I'm going to show you just a few examples of how pervasive this phenomena is. The actual paradigm-shift rate, the rate of adopting new ideas, is doubling every decade, according to our models. These are all logarithmic graphs, so as you go up the levels it represents, generally multiplying by factor of 10 or 100. It took us half a century to adopt the telephone, the first virtual-reality technology. Cell phones were adopted in about eight years. If you put different communication technologies on this logarithmic graph, television, radio, telephone were adopted in decades. Recent technologies \u2014 like the PC, the web, cell phones \u2014 were under a decade. Now this is an interesting chart, and this really gets at the fundamental reason why an evolutionary process \u2014 and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes \u2014 accelerate. They work through interaction \u2014 they create a capability, and then it uses that capability to bring on the next stage.So the first step in biological evolution, the evolution of DNA \u2014 actually it was RNA came first \u2014 took billions of years, but then evolution used that information-processing backbone to bring on the next stage. So the Cambrian Explosion, when all the body plans of the animals were evolved, took only 10 million years. It was 200 times faster. And then evolution used those body plans to evolve higher cognitive functions, and biological evolution kept accelerating. It's an inherent nature of an evolutionary process. So Homo sapiens, the first technology-creating species, the species that combined a cognitive function with an opposable appendage \u2014 and by the way, chimpanzees don't really have a very good opposable thumb \u2014 so we could actually manipulate our environment with a power grip and fine motor coordination, and use our mental models to actually change the world and bring on technology.But anyway, the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years, and then working through interaction, evolution used, essentially, the technology-creating species to bring on the next stage, which were the first steps in technological evolution. And the first step took tens of thousands of years \u2014 stone tools, fire, the wheel \u2014 kept accelerating. We always used then the latest generation of technology to create the next generation. Printing press took a century to be adopted; the first computers were designed pen-on-paper \u2014 now we use computers. And we've had a continual acceleration of this process.Now by the way, if you look at this on a linear graph, it looks like everything has just happened, but some observer says, \"Well, Kurzweil just put points on this graph that fall on that straight line.\" So, I took 15 different lists from key thinkers, like the Encyclopedia Britannica, the Museum of Natural History, Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar on the same \u2014 and these people were not trying to make my point; these were just lists in reference works, and I think that's what they thought the key events were in biological evolution and technological evolution. And again, it forms the same straight line. You have a little bit of thickening in the line because people do have disagreements, what the key points are, there's differences of opinion when agriculture started, or how long the Cambrian Explosion took. But you see a very clear trend. There's a basic, profound acceleration of this evolutionary process. Information technologies double their capacity, price performance, bandwidth, every year. And that's a very profound explosion of exponential growth. A personal experience, when I was at MIT \u2014 computer taking up about the size of this room, less powerful than the computer in your cell phone. But Moore's Law, which is very often identified with this exponential growth, is just one example of many, because it's basically a property of the evolutionary process of technology.I put 49 famous computers on this logarithmic graph \u2014 by the way, a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth \u2014 that's another exponential. It took us three years to double our price performance of computing in 1900, two years in the middle; we're now doubling it every one year. And that's exponential growth through five different paradigms. Moore's Law was just the last part of that, where we were shrinking transistors on an integrated circuit, but we had electro-mechanical calculators, relay-based computers that cracked the German Enigma Code, vacuum tubes in the 1950s predicted the election of Eisenhower, discreet transistors used in the first space flights and then Moore's Law. Every time one paradigm ran out of steam, another paradigm came out of left field to continue the exponential growth. They were shrinking vacuum tubes, making them smaller and smaller. That hit a wall. They couldn't shrink them and keep the vacuum. Whole different paradigm \u2014 transistors came out of the woodwork. In fact, when we see the end of the line for a particular paradigm, it creates research pressure to create the next paradigm. And because we've been predicting the end of Moore's Law for quite a long time \u2014 the first prediction said 2002, until now it says 2022. But by the teen years, the features of transistors will be a few atoms in width, and we won't be able to shrink them any more. That'll be the end of Moore's Law, but it won't be the end of the exponential growth of computing, because chips are flat. We live in a three-dimensional world; we might as well use the third dimension. We will go into the third dimension and there's been tremendous progress, just in the last few years, of getting three-dimensional, self-organizing molecular circuits to work. We'll have those ready well before Moore's Law runs out of steam. Supercomputers \u2014 same thing. Processor performance on Intel chips, the average price of a transistor \u2014 1968, you could buy one transistor for a dollar. You could buy 10 million in 2002.It's pretty remarkable how smooth an exponential process that is. I mean, you'd think this is the result of some tabletop experiment, but this is the result of worldwide chaotic behavior \u2014 countries accusing each other of dumping products, IPOs, bankruptcies, marketing programs. You would think it would be a very erratic process, and you have a very smooth outcome of this chaotic process. Just as we can't predict what one molecule in a gas will do \u2014 it's hopeless to predict a single molecule \u2014 yet we can predict the properties of the whole gas, using thermodynamics, very accurately. It's the same thing here. We can't predict any particular project, but the result of this whole worldwide, chaotic, unpredictable activity of competition and the evolutionary process of technology is very predictable. And we can predict these trends far into the future. Unlike Gertrude Stein's roses, it's not the case that a transistor is a transistor. As we make them smaller and less expensive, the electrons have less distance to travel. They're faster, so you've got exponential growth in the speed of transistors, so the cost of a cycle of one transistor has been coming down with a halving rate of 1.1 years. You add other forms of innovation and processor design, you get a doubling of price performance of computing every one year.And that's basically deflation \u2014 50 percent deflation. And it's not just computers. I mean, it's true of DNA sequencing; it's true of brain scanning; it's true of the World Wide Web. I mean, anything that we can quantify, we have hundreds of different measurements of different, information-related measurements \u2014 capacity, adoption rates \u2014 and they basically double every 12, 13, 15 months, depending on what you're looking at. In terms of price performance, that's a 40 to 50 percent deflation rate. And economists have actually started worrying about that. We had deflation during the Depression, but that was collapse of the money supply, collapse of consumer confidence, a completely different phenomena. This is due to greater productivity, but the economist says, \"But there's no way you're going to be able to keep up with that. If you have 50 percent deflation, people may increase their volume 30, 40 percent, but they won't keep up with it.\" But what we're actually seeing is that we actually more than keep up with it. We've had 28 percent per year compounded growth in dollars in information technology over the last 50 years. I mean, people didn't build iPods for 10,000 dollars 10 years ago. As the price performance makes new applications feasible, new applications come to the market. And this is a very widespread phenomena. Magnetic data storage \u2014 that's not Moore's Law, it's shrinking magnetic spots, different engineers, different companies, same exponential process.A key revolution is that we're understanding our own biology in these information terms. We're understanding the software programs that make our body run. These were evolved in very different times \u2014 we'd like to actually change those programs. One little software program, called the fat insulin receptor gene, basically says, \"Hold onto every calorie, because the next hunting season may not work out so well.\" That was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago. We'd like to actually turn that program off. They tried that in animals, and these mice ate ravenously and remained slim and got the health benefits of being slim. They didn't get diabetes; they didn't get heart disease; they lived 20 percent longer; they got the health benefits of caloric restriction without the restriction. Four or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this, felt that would be interesting drug for the human market, and that's just one of the 30,000 genes that affect our biochemistry.We were evolved in an era where it wasn't in the interests of people at the age of most people at this conference, like myself, to live much longer, because we were using up the precious resources which were better deployed towards the children and those caring for them. So, life \u2014 long lifespans \u2014 like, that is to say, much more than 30 \u2014 weren't selected for, but we are learning to actually manipulate and change these software programs through the biotechnology revolution. For example, we can inhibit genes now with RNA interference. There are exciting new forms of gene therapy that overcome the problem of placing the genetic material in the right place on the chromosome. There's actually a \u2014 for the first time now, something going to human trials, that actually cures pulmonary hypertension \u2014 a fatal disease \u2014 using gene therapy. So we'll have not just designer babies, but designer baby boomers. And this technology is also accelerating. It cost 10 dollars per base pair in 1990, then a penny in 2000. It's now under a 10th of a cent. The amount of genetic data \u2014 basically this shows that smooth exponential growth doubled every year, enabling the genome project to be completed.Another major revolution: the communications revolution. The price performance, bandwidth, capacity of communications measured many different ways; wired, wireless is growing exponentially. The Internet has been doubling in power and continues to, measured many different ways. This is based on the number of hosts.Miniaturization \u2014 we're shrinking the size of technology at an exponential rate, both wired and wireless. These are some designs from Eric Drexler's book \u2014 which we're now showing are feasible with super-computing simulations, where actually there are scientists building molecule-scale robots. One has one that actually walks with a surprisingly human-like gait, that's built out of molecules. There are little machines doing things in experimental bases. The most exciting opportunity is actually to go inside the human body and perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions. And this is less futuristic than it may sound. These things have already been done in animals.There's one nano-engineered device that cures type 1 diabetes. It's blood cell-sized. They put tens of thousands of these in the blood cell \u2014 they tried this in rats \u2014 it lets insulin out in a controlled fashion, and actually cures type 1 diabetes. What you're watching is a design of a robotic red blood cell, and it does bring up the issue that our biology is actually very sub-optimal, even though it's remarkable in its intricacy. Once we understand its principles of operation, and the pace with which we are reverse-engineering biology is accelerating, we can actually design these things to be thousands of times more capable. An analysis of this respirocyte, designed by Rob Freitas, indicates if you replace 10 percent of your red blood cells with these robotic versions, you could do an Olympic sprint for 15 minutes without taking a breath. You could sit at the bottom of your pool for four hours \u2014 so, \"Honey, I'm in the pool,\" will take on a whole new meaning. It will be interesting to see what we do in our Olympic trials. Presumably we'll ban them, but then we'll have the specter of teenagers in their high schools gyms routinely out-performing the Olympic athletes. Freitas has a design for a robotic white blood cell. These are 2020-circa scenarios, but they're not as futuristic as it may sound. There are four major conferences on building blood cell-sized devices; there are many experiments in animals. There's actually one going into human trial, so this is feasible technology.If we come back to our exponential growth of computing, 1,000 dollars of computing is now somewhere between an insect and a mouse brain. It will intersect human intelligence in terms of capacity in the 2020s, but that'll be the hardware side of the equation. Where will we get the software? Well, it turns out we can see inside the human brain, and in fact not surprisingly, the spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year. And with the new generation of scanning tools, for the first time we can actually see individual inter-neural fibers and see them processing and signaling in real time \u2014 but then the question is, OK, we can get this data now, but can we understand it? Doug Hofstadter wonders, well, maybe our intelligence just isn't great enough to understand our intelligence, and if we were smarter, well, then our brains would be that much more complicated, and we'd never catch up to it. It turns out that we can understand it.This is a block diagram of a model and simulation of the human auditory cortex that actually works quite well \u2014 in applying psychoacoustic tests, gets very similar results to human auditory perception. There's another simulation of the cerebellum \u2014 that's more than half the neurons in the brain \u2014 again, works very similarly to human skill formation. This is at an early stage, but you can show with the exponential growth of the amount of information about the brain and the exponential improvement in the resolution of brain scanning, we will succeed in reverse-engineering the human brain by the 2020s. We've already had very good models and simulation of about 15 regions out of the several hundred.All of this is driving exponentially growing economic progress. We've had productivity go from 30 dollars to 150 dollars per hour of labor in the last 50 years. E-commerce has been growing exponentially. It's now a trillion dollars. You might wonder, well, wasn't there a boom and a bust? That was strictly a capital-markets phenomena. Wall Street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology, which it was, but then six months later, when it hadn't revolutionized all business models, they figured, well, that was wrong, and then we had this bust.All right, this is a technology that we put together using some of the technologies we're involved in. This will be a routine feature in a cell phone. It would be able to translate from one language to another.So let me just end with a couple of scenarios. By 2010 computers will disappear. They'll be so small, they'll be embedded in our clothing, in our environment. Images will be written directly to our retina, providing full-immersion virtual reality, augmented real reality. We'll be interacting with virtual personalities.But if we go to 2029, we really have the full maturity of these trends, and you have to appreciate how many turns of the screw in terms of generations of technology, which are getting faster and faster, we'll have at that point. I mean, we will have two-to-the-25th-power greater price performance, capacity and bandwidth of these technologies, which is pretty phenomenal. It'll be millions of times more powerful than it is today. We'll have completed the reverse-engineering of the human brain, 1,000 dollars of computing will be far more powerful than the human brain in terms of basic raw capacity. Computers will combine the subtle pan-recognition powers of human intelligence with ways in which machines are already superior, in terms of doing analytic thinking, remembering billions of facts accurately. Machines can share their knowledge very quickly. But it's not just an alien invasion of intelligent machines. We are going to merge with our technology.These nano-bots I mentioned will first be used for medical and health applications: cleaning up the environment, providing powerful fuel cells and widely distributed decentralized solar panels and so on in the environment. But they'll also go inside our brain, interact with our biological neurons. We've demonstrated the key principles of being able to do this. So, for example, full-immersion virtual reality from within the nervous system, the nano-bots shut down the signals coming from your real senses, replace them with the signals that your brain would be receiving if you were in the virtual environment, and then it'll feel like you're in that virtual environment. You can go there with other people, have any kind of experience with anyone involving all of the senses. \"Experience beamers,\" I call them, will put their whole flow of sensory experiences in the neurological correlates of their emotions out on the Internet. You can plug in and experience what it's like to be someone else. But most importantly, it'll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology, which in some sense we're doing already. We routinely do intellectual feats that would be impossible without our technology. Human life expectancy is expanding. It was 37 in 1800, and with this sort of biotechnology, nano-technology revolutions, this will move up very rapidly in the years ahead.My main message is that progress in technology is exponential, not linear. Many \u2014 even scientists \u2014 assume a linear model, so they'll say, \"Oh, it'll be hundreds of years before we have self-replicating nano-technology assembly or artificial intelligence.\" If you really look at the power of exponential growth, you'll see that these things are pretty soon at hand. And information technology is increasingly encompassing all of our lives, from our music to our manufacturing to our biology to our energy to materials.We'll be able to manufacture almost anything we need in the 2020s, from information, in very inexpensive raw materials, using nano-technology. These are very powerful technologies. They both empower our promise and our peril. So we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 38, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 -->

and very inefficient.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nThere are nano-engineered designs,\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nwhich at least have been analyzed theoretically,\n\n00:00:40.958 -->

tools, for the first time,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nto address age-old problems of disease and poverty.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nMost regions of the world are moving in that direction.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nIn 1990, in East Asia and the Pacific region,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nthere were 500 million people living in poverty --\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nthat number now is under 200 million.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nThe World Bank projects by 2011, it will be under 20 million,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nwhich is a reduction of 95 percent.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nI did enjoy Bono's comment\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nlinking Haight-Ashbury to Silicon Valley.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nBeing from the Massachusetts high-tech community myself,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nI'd point out that we were hippies also in the 1960s,\n\n00:01:55.958 -->

talk about those issues, if we have the will.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nKevin Kelly talked about the acceleration of technology.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nThat's been a strong interest of mine,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nand a theme that I've developed for some 30 years.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nI realized that my technologies had to make sense when I finished a project.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nThat invariably, the world was a different place\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nwhen I would introduce a technology.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nAnd, I noticed that most inventions fail,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nnot because the R&amp;D department can't get it to work --\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nif you look at most business plans, they will actually succeed\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nif given the opportunity to build what they say they're going to build --\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nand 90 percent of those projects or more will fail, because the timing is wrong --\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nnot all the enabling factors will be in place when they're needed.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nSo I began to be an ardent student of technology trends,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nand track where technology would be at different points in time,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nand began to build the mathematical models of that.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nIt's kind of taken on a life of its own.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nI've got a group of 10 people that work with me to gather data\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:03.958\non key measures of technology in many different areas, and we build models.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nAnd you'll hear people say, well, we can't predict the future.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nAnd if you ask me,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nwill the price of Google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nthat's very hard to say.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nWill WiMax CDMA G3\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nbe the wireless standard three years from now? That's hard to say.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nBut if you ask me, what will it cost\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nfor one MIPS of computing in 2010,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nor the cost to sequence a base pair of DNA in 2012,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nor the cost of sending a megabyte of data wirelessly in 2014,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nit turns out that those are very predictable.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nThere are remarkably smooth exponential curves\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nthat govern price performance, capacity, bandwidth.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nAnd I'm going to show you a small sample of this,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nbut there's really a theoretical reason\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nwhy technology develops in an exponential fashion.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nAnd a lot of people, when they think about the future, think about it linearly.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nThey think they're going to continue\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nto develop a problem\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nor address a problem using today's tools,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nat today's pace of progress,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nand fail to take into consideration this exponential growth.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nThe Genome Project was a controversial project in 1990.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nWe had our best Ph.D. students,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nour most advanced equipment around the world,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nwe got 1/10,000th of the project done,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nso how're we going to get this done in 15 years?\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nAnd 10 years into the project,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nthe skeptics were still going strong -- says, \"You're two-thirds through this project,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nand you've managed to only sequence\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\na very tiny percentage of the whole genome.\"\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nBut it's the nature of exponential growth\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nthat once it reaches the knee of the curve, it explodes.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nMost of the project was done in the last\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nfew years of the project.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nIt took us 15 years to sequence HIV --\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nwe sequenced SARS in 31 days.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nSo we are gaining the potential to overcome these problems.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nI'm going to show you just a few examples\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nof how pervasive this phenomena is.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nThe actual paradigm-shift rate, the rate of adopting new ideas,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nis doubling every decade, according to our models.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nThese are all logarithmic graphs,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nso as you go up the levels it represents, generally multiplying by factor of 10 or 100.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nIt took us half a century to adopt the telephone,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nthe first virtual-reality technology.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nCell phones were adopted in about eight years.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nIf you put different communication technologies\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\non this logarithmic graph,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\ntelevision, radio, telephone\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nwere adopted in decades.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nRecent technologies -- like the PC, the web, cell phones --\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nwere under a decade.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nNow this is an interesting chart,\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nand this really gets at the fundamental reason why\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nan evolutionary process -- and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes --\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\naccelerate.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nThey work through interaction -- they create a capability,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nand then it uses that capability to bring on the next stage.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nSo the first step in biological evolution,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nthe evolution of DNA -- actually it was RNA came first --\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\ntook billions of years,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nbut then evolution used that information-processing backbone\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nto bring on the next stage.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nSo the Cambrian Explosion, when all the body plans of the animals were evolved,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:55.958\ntook only 10 million years. It was 200 times faster.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nAnd then evolution used those body plans\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nto evolve higher cognitive functions,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nand biological evolution kept accelerating.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nIt's an inherent nature of an evolutionary process.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nSo Homo sapiens, the first technology-creating species,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthe species that combined a cognitive function\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nwith an opposable appendage --\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nand by the way, chimpanzees don't really have a very good opposable thumb --\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nso we could actually manipulate our environment with a power grip\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nand fine motor coordination,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nand use our mental models to actually change the world\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nand bring on technology.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nBut anyway, the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nand then working through interaction,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nevolution used, essentially,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nthe technology-creating species to bring on the next stage,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nwhich were the first steps in technological evolution.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nAnd the first step took tens of thousands of years --\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nstone tools, fire, the wheel -- kept accelerating.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nWe always used then the latest generation of technology\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nto create the next generation.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nPrinting press took a century to be adopted;\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nthe first computers were designed pen-on-paper -- now we use computers.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nAnd we've had a continual acceleration of this process.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nNow by the way, if you look at this on a linear graph, it looks like everything has just happened,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nbut some observer says, \"Well, Kurzweil just put points on this graph\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nthat fall on that straight line.\"\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nSo, I took 15 different lists from key thinkers,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nlike the Encyclopedia Britannica, the Museum of Natural History, Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\non the same -- and these people were not trying to make my point;\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nthese were just lists in reference works,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nand I think that's what they thought the key events were\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nin biological evolution and technological evolution.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nAnd again, it forms the same straight line. You have a little bit of thickening in the line\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nbecause people do have disagreements, what the key points are,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nthere's differences of opinion when agriculture started,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nor how long the Cambrian Explosion took.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nBut you see a very clear trend.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nThere's a basic, profound acceleration of this evolutionary process.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nInformation technologies double their capacity, price performance, bandwidth,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nevery year.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nAnd that's a very profound explosion of exponential growth.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nA personal experience, when I was at MIT --\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\ncomputer taking up about the size of this room,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nless powerful than the computer in your cell phone.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nBut Moore's Law, which is very often identified with this exponential growth,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nis just one example of many, because it's basically\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:13.958\na property of the evolutionary process of technology.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nI put 49 famous computers on this logarithmic graph --\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nby the way, a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth --\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nthat's another exponential.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nIt took us three years to double our price performance of computing in 1900,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\ntwo years in the middle; we're now doubling it every one year.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nAnd that's exponential growth through five different paradigms.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nMoore's Law was just the last part of that,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nwhere we were shrinking transistors on an integrated circuit,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nbut we had electro-mechanical calculators,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nrelay-based computers that cracked the German Enigma Code,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nvacuum tubes in the 1950s predicted the election of Eisenhower,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\ndiscreet transistors used in the first space flights\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nand then Moore's Law.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nEvery time one paradigm ran out of steam,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nanother paradigm came out of left field to continue the exponential growth.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nThey were shrinking vacuum tubes, making them smaller and smaller.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nThat hit a wall. They couldn't shrink them and keep the vacuum.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nWhole different paradigm -- transistors came out of the woodwork.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nIn fact, when we see the end of the line for a particular paradigm,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nit creates research pressure to create the next paradigm.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nAnd because we've been predicting the end of Moore's Law\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nfor quite a long time -- the first prediction said 2002, until now it says 2022.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nBut by the teen years,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nthe features of transistors will be a few atoms in width,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nand we won't be able to shrink them any more.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nThat'll be the end of Moore's Law, but it won't be the end of\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nthe exponential growth of computing, because chips are flat.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nWe live in a three-dimensional world; we might as well use the third dimension.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nWe will go into the third dimension\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nand there's been tremendous progress, just in the last few years,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nof getting three-dimensional, self-organizing molecular circuits to work.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nWe'll have those ready well before Moore's Law runs out of steam.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nSupercomputers -- same thing.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nProcessor performance on Intel chips,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nthe average price of a transistor --\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\n1968, you could buy one transistor for a dollar.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nYou could buy 10 million in 2002.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nIt's pretty remarkable how smooth\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nan exponential process that is.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nI mean, you'd think this is the result of some tabletop experiment,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nbut this is the result of worldwide chaotic behavior --\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\ncountries accusing each other of dumping products,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nIPOs, bankruptcies, marketing programs.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nYou would think it would be a very erratic process,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nand you have a very smooth\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\noutcome of this chaotic process.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nJust as we can't predict\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nwhat one molecule in a gas will do --\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nit's hopeless to predict a single molecule --\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nyet we can predict the properties of the whole gas,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nusing thermodynamics, very accurately.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nIt's the same thing here.

I mean, anything that we can quantify,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nwe have hundreds of different measurements\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nof different, information-related measurements --\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\ncapacity, adoption rates --\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nand they basically double every 12, 13, 15 months,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\ndepending on what you're looking at.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nIn terms of price performance, that's a 40 to 50 percent deflation rate.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nAnd economists have actually started worrying about that. \n\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nWe had deflation during the Depression,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nbut that was collapse of the money supply,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\ncollapse of consumer confidence, a completely different phenomena.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nThis is due to greater productivity,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nbut the economist says, \"But there's no way you're going to be able to keep up with that.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nIf you have 50 percent deflation, people may increase their volume\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\n30, 40 percent, but they won't keep up with it.\"\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nBut what we're actually seeing is that\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nwe actually more than keep up with it.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nWe've had 28 percent per year compounded growth in dollars\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nin information technology over the last 50 years.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nI mean, people didn't build iPods for 10,000 dollars 10 years ago.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nAs the price performance makes new applications feasible,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nnew applications come to the market.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nAnd this is a very widespread phenomena.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nMagnetic data storage --\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nthat's not Moore's Law, it's shrinking magnetic spots,\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:43.958\ndifferent engineers, different companies, same exponential process.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nA key revolution is that we're understanding our own biology\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nin these information terms.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nWe're understanding the software programs\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nthat make our body run.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nThese were evolved in very different times --\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nwe'd like to actually change those programs.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nOne little software program, called the fat insulin receptor gene,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nbasically says, \"Hold onto every calorie,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nbecause the next hunting season may not work out so well.\"\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nThat was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nWe'd like to actually turn that program off.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nThey tried that in animals, and these mice ate ravenously\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nand remained slim and got the health benefits of being slim.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nThey didn't get diabetes; they didn't get heart disease;\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nthey lived 20 percent longer; they got the health benefits of caloric restriction\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nwithout the restriction.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nFour or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nfelt that would be\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\ninteresting drug for the human market,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nand that's just one of the 30,000 genes\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nthat affect our biochemistry.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nWe were evolved in an era where it wasn't in the interests of people\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nat the age of most people at this conference, like myself,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nto live much longer, because we were using up the precious resources\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nwhich were better deployed towards the children\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nand those caring for them.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nSo, life -- long lifespans --\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nlike, that is to say, much more than 30 --\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nweren't selected for,\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nbut we are learning to actually manipulate\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nand change these software programs\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nthrough the biotechnology revolution.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nFor example, we can inhibit genes now with RNA interference.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nThere are exciting new forms of gene therapy\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nthat overcome the problem of placing the genetic material\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nin the right place on the chromosome.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nThere's actually a -- for the first time now,\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nsomething going to human trials, that actually cures pulmonary hypertension --\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\na fatal disease -- using gene therapy.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nSo we'll have not just designer babies, but designer baby boomers.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nAnd this technology is also accelerating.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nIt cost 10 dollars per base pair in 1990,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nthen a penny in 2000.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nIt's now under a 10th of a cent.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nThe amount of genetic data --\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nbasically this shows that smooth exponential growth\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\ndoubled every year,\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nenabling the genome project to be completed.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nAnother major revolution: the communications revolution.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nThe price performance, bandwidth, capacity of communications measured many different ways;\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nwired, wireless is growing exponentially.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nThe Internet has been doubling in power and continues to,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nmeasured many different ways.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nThis is based on the number of hosts.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nMiniaturization -- we're shrinking the size of technology\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nat an exponential rate,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nboth wired and wireless.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nThese are some designs from Eric Drexler's book --\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nwhich we're now showing are feasible\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nwith super-computing simulations,\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nwhere actually there are scientists building\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nmolecule-scale robots.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nOne has one that actually walks with a surprisingly human-like gait,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nthat's built out of molecules.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nThere are little machines doing things in experimental bases.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nThe most exciting opportunity\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nis actually to go inside the human body\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nand perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nAnd this is less futuristic than it may sound.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nThese things have already been done in animals.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nThere's one nano-engineered device that cures type 1 diabetes. It's blood cell-sized.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nThey put tens of thousands of these\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nin the blood cell -- they tried this in rats --\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nit lets insulin out in a controlled fashion,\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nand actually cures type 1 diabetes.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nWhat you're watching is a design\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nof a robotic red blood cell,\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nand it does bring up the issue that our biology\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nis actually very sub-optimal,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\neven though it's remarkable in its intricacy.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nOnce we understand its principles of operation,\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nand the pace with which we are reverse-engineering biology is accelerating,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nwe can actually design these things to be\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nthousands of times more capable.\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nAn analysis of this respirocyte, designed by Rob Freitas,\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nindicates if you replace 10 percent of your red blood cells with these robotic versions,\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nyou could do an Olympic sprint for 15 minutes without taking a breath.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nYou could sit at the bottom of your pool for four hours --\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nso, \"Honey, I'm in the pool,\" will take on a whole new meaning.\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nIt will be interesting to see what we do in our Olympic trials.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nPresumably we'll ban them,\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nbut then we'll have the specter of teenagers in their high schools gyms\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nroutinely out-performing the Olympic athletes.\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nFreitas has a design for a robotic white blood cell.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nThese are 2020-circa scenarios,\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nbut they're not as futuristic as it may sound.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nThere are four major conferences on building blood cell-sized devices;\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nthere are many experiments in animals.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nThere's actually one going into human trial,\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nso this is feasible technology.\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nIf we come back to our exponential growth of computing,\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:14.958\n1,000 dollars of computing is now somewhere between an insect and a mouse brain.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nIt will intersect human intelligence\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nin terms of capacity in the 2020s,\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nbut that'll be the hardware side of the equation.\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nWhere will we get the software?\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nWell, it turns out we can see inside the human brain,\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nand in fact not surprisingly,\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nthe spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year.\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nAnd with the new generation of scanning tools,\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nfor the first time we can actually see\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nindividual inter-neural fibers\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nand see them processing and signaling in real time --\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nbut then the question is, OK, we can get this data now,\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nbut can we understand it?\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:48.958\nDoug Hofstadter wonders, well, maybe our intelligence\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:51.958\njust isn't great enough to understand our intelligence,\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nand if we were smarter, well, then our brains would be that much more complicated,\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nand we'd never catch up to it.\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nIt turns out that we can understand it.\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nThis is a block diagram of\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:07.958\na model and simulation of the human auditory cortex\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nthat actually works quite well --\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nin applying psychoacoustic tests, gets very similar results to human auditory perception.\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nThere's another simulation of the cerebellum --\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nthat's more than half the neurons in the brain --\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nagain, works very similarly to human skill formation.\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:25.958\nThis is at an early stage, but you can show\n\n00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nwith the exponential growth of the amount of information about the brain\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nand the exponential improvement\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nin the resolution of brain scanning,\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nwe will succeed in reverse-engineering the human brain\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nby the 2020s.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nWe've already had very good models and simulation of about 15 regions\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nout of the several hundred.\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nAll of this is driving\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nexponentially growing economic progress.\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nWe've had productivity go from 30 dollars to 150 dollars per hour\n\n00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nof labor in the last 50 years.\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nE-commerce has been growing exponentially. It's now a trillion dollars.\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:18:59.958\nYou might wonder, well, wasn't there a boom and a bust?\n\n00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nThat was strictly a capital-markets phenomena.\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nWall Street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology, which it was,\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nbut then six months later, when it hadn't revolutionized all business models,\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:10.958\nthey figured, well, that was wrong,\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:12.958\nand then we had this bust.\n\n00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:15.958\nAll right, this is a technology\n\n00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nthat we put together using some of the technologies we're involved in.\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:22.958\nThis will be a routine feature in a cell phone.\n\n00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nIt would be able to translate from one language to another.\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:36.958\nSo let me just end with a couple of scenarios.\n\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:39.958\nBy 2010 computers will disappear.\n\n00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:43.958\nThey'll be so small, they'll be embedded in our clothing, in our environment.\n\n00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:45.958\nImages will be written directly to our retina,\n\n00:19:45.958 --> 00:19:47.958\nproviding full-immersion virtual reality,\n\n00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:50.958\naugmented real reality. We'll be interacting with virtual personalities.\n\n00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:55.958\nBut if we go to 2029, we really have the full maturity of these trends,\n\n00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:58.958\nand you have to appreciate how many turns of the screw\n\n00:19:58.958 --> 00:20:02.958\nin terms of generations of technology, which are getting faster and faster, we'll have at that point.\n\n00:20:02.958 --> 00:20:04.958\nI mean, we will have two-to-the-25th-power\n\n00:20:04.958 --> 00:20:07.958\ngreater price performance, capacity and bandwidth\n\n00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:09.958\nof these technologies, which is pretty phenomenal.\n\n00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:11.958\nIt'll be millions of times more powerful than it is today.\n\n00:20:11.958 --> 00:20:13.958\nWe'll have completed the reverse-engineering of the human brain,\n\n00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:17.958\n1,000 dollars of computing will be far more powerful\n\n00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:21.958\nthan the human brain in terms of basic raw capacity.\n\n00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:23.958\nComputers will combine\n\n00:20:23.958 --> 00:20:25.958\nthe subtle pan-recognition powers\n\n00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:28.958\nof human intelligence with ways in which machines are already superior,\n\n00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:30.958\nin terms of doing analytic thinking,\n\n00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:32.958\nremembering billions of facts accurately.\n\n00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:34.958\nMachines can share their knowledge very quickly.\n\n00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:39.958\nBut it's not just an alien invasion of intelligent machines.\n\n00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:41.958\nWe are going to merge with our technology.\n\n00:20:41.958 --> 00:20:43.958\nThese nano-bots I mentioned\n\n00:20:43.958 --> 00:20:47.958\nwill first be used for medical and health applications:\n\n00:20:47.958 --> 00:20:50.958\ncleaning up the environment, providing powerful fuel cells\n\n00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:55.958\nand widely distributed decentralized solar panels and so on in the environment.\n\n00:20:55.958 --> 00:20:57.958\nBut they'll also go inside our brain,\n\n00:20:57.958 --> 00:20:59.958\ninteract with our biological neurons.\n\n00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:02.958\nWe've demonstrated the key principles of being able to do this.\n\n00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:04.958\nSo, for example,\n\n00:21:04.958 --> 00:21:06.958\nfull-immersion virtual reality from within the nervous system,\n\n00:21:06.958 --> 00:21:09.958\nthe nano-bots shut down the signals coming from your real senses,\n\n00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:12.958\nreplace them with the signals that your brain would be receiving\n\n00:21:12.958 --> 00:21:14.958\nif you were in the virtual environment,\n\n00:21:14.958 --> 00:21:16.958\nand then it'll feel like you're in that virtual environment.\n\n00:21:16.958 --> 00:21:18.958\nYou can go there with other people, have any kind of experience\n\n00:21:18.958 --> 00:21:20.958\nwith anyone involving all of the senses.\n\n00:21:21.958 --> 00:21:24.958\n\"Experience beamers,\" I call them, will put their whole flow of sensory experiences\n\n00:21:24.958 --> 00:21:27.958\nin the neurological correlates of their emotions out on the Internet.\n\n00:21:27.958 --> 00:21:30.958\nYou can plug in and experience what it's like to be someone else.\n\n00:21:30.958 --> 00:21:32.958\nBut most importantly,\n\n00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.958\nit'll be a tremendous expansion\n\n00:21:34.958 --> 00:21:38.958\nof human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology,\n\n00:21:38.958 --> 00:21:40.958\nwhich in some sense we're doing already.\n\n00:21:40.958 --> 00:21:42.958\nWe routinely do intellectual feats\n\n00:21:42.958 --> 00:21:44.958\nthat would be impossible without our technology.\n\n00:21:44.958 --> 00:21:47.958\nHuman life expectancy is expanding. It was 37 in 1800,\n\n00:21:47.958 --> 00:21:52.958\nand with this sort of biotechnology, nano-technology revolutions,\n\n00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:54.958\nthis will move up very rapidly\n\n00:21:54.958 --> 00:21:56.958\nin the years ahead.\n\n00:21:56.958 --> 00:22:00.958\nMy main message is that progress in technology\n\n00:22:00.958 --> 00:22:03.958\nis exponential, not linear.\n\n00:22:03.958 --> 00:22:07.958\nMany -- even scientists -- assume a linear model,\n\n00:22:07.958 --> 00:22:09.958\nso they'll say, \"Oh, it'll be hundreds of years\n\n00:22:09.958 --> 00:22:12.958\nbefore we have self-replicating nano-technology assembly\n\n00:22:12.958 --> 00:22:14.958\nor artificial intelligence.\"\n\n00:22:14.958 --> 00:22:17.958\nIf you really look at the power of exponential growth,\n\n00:22:17.958 --> 00:22:20.958\nyou'll see that these things are pretty soon at hand.\n\n00:22:20.958 --> 00:22:23.958\nAnd information technology is increasingly encompassing\n\n00:22:23.958 --> 00:22:27.958\nall of our lives, from our music to our manufacturing\n\n00:22:27.958 --> 00:22:31.958\nto our biology to our energy to materials.\n\n00:22:31.958 --> 00:22:34.958\nWe'll be able to manufacture almost anything we need in the 2020s,\n\n00:22:34.958 --> 00:22:36.958\nfrom information, in very inexpensive raw materials,\n\n00:22:36.958 --> 00:22:39.958\nusing nano-technology.\n\n00:22:39.958 --> 00:22:41.958\nThese are very powerful technologies.\n\n00:22:41.958 --> 00:22:45.958\nThey both empower our promise and our peril.\n\n00:22:45.958 --> 00:22:48.958\nSo we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems.\n\n00:22:48.958 --> 00:22:49.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:22:49.958 --> 00:22:50.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How technology evolves", "duration": "1200", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/kevin_kelly_on_how_technology_evolves", "transcript": "I don't know about you, but I haven't quite figured out exactly what technology means in my life. I've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about. Should I be pro-technology? Should I embrace it full arms? Should I be wary? Like you, I'm very tempted by the latest thing. But at the other hand, a couple of years ago I gave up all of my possessions, sold all my technology \u2014 except for a bicycle \u2014 and rode across 3,000 miles on the U.S. back roads under the power of my one body, fuelled mostly by Twinkies and junk food.(Laughter)And I've since then tried to keep technology at arm's length in many ways, so it doesn't master my life. At the same time, I run a website on cool tools, where I issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology. So I'm still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is as it relates to humanity, as it relates to nature, as it relates to the spiritual. And I'm not even sure we know what technology is. And one definition of technology is that which is first recorded. This is the first example of the modern use of technology that I can find. It was the suggested syllabus for dealing with the Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in 1829.Before that, obviously, technology didn't exist. But obviously it did. I like one of the definitions that Alan Kay has for technology. He says technology is anything that was invented after you were born.(Laughter)So it sums up a lot of what we're talking about. Danny Hillis actually has an update on that \u2014 he says technology is anything that doesn't quite work yet.(Laughter)Which also, I think, gets into a little bit of our current idea. But I was interested in another definition of technology. Something, again, that went back to something more fundamental. Something that was deeper. And as I struggled to understand that, I came up with a way of framing the question that seemed to work for me in my investigations. And I'm, this morning, going to talk about this for the first time. So this is a very rough attempt to think out loud.The question that I came up with was this question: what does technology want? And by that, I don't mean, does it want chocolate or vanilla? By what it wants, I mean, what are its inherent trends and biases? What are its tendencies over time? One way to think about this is thinking about biological organisms, which we've heard a lot about. And the trick that Richard Dawkins does, which is to say, to look at them as simply as genes, as vehicles for genes. So he's saying, what do genes want? The selfish gene. And I'm applying a similar trick to say, what if we looked at the universe in our culture through the eyes of technology? What does technology want? Obviously, this in an incomplete question, just as looking at an organism as only a gene is an incomplete way of looking at it. But it's still very, very productive. So I'm attempting to say, if we take technology's view of the world, what does it want? And I think once we ask that question we have to go back, actually, to life. Because obviously, if we keep extending the origins of technology far back, I think we come back to life at some point.So that's where I want to begin my little exploration, is in life. And like you heard from the previous speakers, we don't really know what life there is on Earth right now. We have really no idea. Craig Venter's tremendous and brilliant attempt to DNA sequence things in the ocean is great. Brian Farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on Earth. And one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe and randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects, just to see what's on life. And if we did that with our little Martian probe, which we have not done on Earth, we would begin to see some incredible species.This is not on another planet. These are things that are hidden away on our planet. This is an ant that stores its colleagues' honey in its abdomen. Each one of these organisms that we've described \u2014 that you've seen from Jamie and others, these magnificent things \u2014 what they're doing, each one of them, is they're hacking the rules of life. I can't think of a single general principle of biology that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism. Every single thing that we can think of \u2014 and if you heard Olivia's talk about the sexual habits, you'll realize that there isn't anything we can say that's true for all life, because every single one of them is hacking something about it. This is a solar-powered sea slug. It's a nudibranch that has incorporated chloroplast inside it to drive its energy. This is another version of that. This is a sea dragon, and the one on the bottom, the blue one, is a juvenile that has not yet swallowed the acid, has not yet taken in the brown-green algae pond scum into its body to give it energy.These are hacks, and if we looked at the general shape of the approaches to hacking life there are, current consensus, six kingdoms. Six different broad approaches: the plants, the animals, the fungi, the protests \u2014 the little things \u2014 the bacteria and the Archaea bacteria. The Archaeas. Those are the general approaches to life. That's one way to look at life on Earth today.But a more interesting way, the current way to take the long view, is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective. And here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution go over the linear time, we have it coming out from the center. So in the center is the most primitive, and this is a genealogical chart of all life on earth. This is all the same six kingdoms. You see 4,000 representative species, and you can see where we are. But what I like about this is it shows that every living organism on Earth today is equally evolved. Those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans. They've been around just as long and gone through just the same kind of trial and error to get here. But we see that each one of these is actually hacking, and has a different way of finding out how to do life.And if we take the long-term trends of life, if we begin to say, what does evolution want? There's several things that we see. One of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth have we ever been where we don't find life. We find life at the bottom of every long-term, long-distance drilling core into the center of rock that we bring up \u2014 and there's bacteria in the pores of that rock. And wherever life is, it never retreats. It's ubiquitous and it wants to be more. More and more of the inert matter of the globe is being touched and animated by life.The second thing is is we see diversity. We also see specialization. We see the movement from a general-purpose cell to the more specific and specialized. And we see a drift towards complexity that's very intuitive. And actually, we have current data that does show that there is an actual drift towards complexity over time. And the last thing, I bring back this nudibranch. One of the things we see about life is that it moves from the inner to increasing sociability. And by that it means that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life. Like those chloroplast cells \u2014 they're completely surrounded by other life. They never touch the inner matter. There is more and more co-evolution. And so the general, long-term trends of evolution are roughly these five: ubiquity, diversity, specialization, complexity and socialization. Now, I took that and said, OK, what are the long-term trends in technology?And again, my question is, what does technology want? And so, remarkably, I discovered that there's also a drift toward specialization. That we see there's a general hammer, and hammers become more and more specific over time. There's obviously diversity. Huge numbers of things. This is all the contents of a Japanese home. I actually had my daughter \u2014 gave her a tally counter, and I gave her an assignment last summer to go around and count the number of species of technology in our household. And it came up with 6,000 different species of products. I did some research and found out that the King of England, Henry VIII, had only about 7,000 items in his household. And he was the King of England, and that was the entire wealth of England at the time. So we're seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things.This is a scene from Star Wars where the 3PO comes out and he sees machines making machines. How depraved! Well, this is actually what we're headed towards: world machines. And the technology is only being thrown out by other technologies. Most machines will only ever be in contact with other technology and not non-technology, or even life.And thirdly, the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex is at this point a cliche. And I'm happy to say, I was partly responsible for that cliche that machines are becoming biological, but that's pretty evident. So the major trends in technology evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution. The same drives that we see towards ubiquity, towards diversity, towards socialization, towards complexity. That is maybe not a big surprise because if we map out, say, the evolution of armor, you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree. I suggest that, in fact, technology is the seventh kingdom of life. That its operations and how it works is so similar that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom. And so it would be sort of approximately up there, coming out of the animal kingdom. And if we were to do that, we would find out \u2014 we could actually approach technology in this way.This is Niles Eldredge. He was the co-developer with Stephen Jay Gould of the theory of punctuated equilibrium. But as a sideline, he happens to collect cornets. He has one of the world's largest collections \u2014 about 500 of them. And he has decided to treat them as if they were trilobites, or snails, and to do a morphological analysis, and try to derive their genealogical history over time. This is his chart, which is not quite published yet. But the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom, those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet that was no longer made. That does not happen in biology. When something is extinct, you can't have it as your parent. But that does happen in technology. And it turns out that that's so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree, and you can actually use it to determine that this is a technological system versus a biological system.In fact, this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important that I began to think about what happens with old technology. And it turns out that, in fact, technologies don't die. So I suggested this to an historian of science, and he said, \"Well, what about, you know, come on, what about steam cars? They're not around anymore.\" Well actually, they are. In fact, they're so around that you can buy new parts for a Stanley steam automobile. And this is a website of a guy who's selling brand new parts for the Stanley automobile. And the thing that I liked is sort of this one-click, add-to-your-cart button \u2014(Laughter) \u2014for buying steam valves. I mean, it was just \u2014 it was really there. And so, I began to think about, well, maybe that's just a random sample. Maybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way.So I took the great big 1895 Montgomery Ward's catalog and I randomly went through it. And I took a page \u2014 not quite a random page \u2014 I took a page that was actually more difficult than others because lots of the pages are filled with things that are still being made. But I took this page and I said, how many of these things are still being made? And not antiques. I want to know how many of these things are still in production. And the answer is: all of them. All of them are still being produced. So you've got corn shellers. I don't know who needs a corn sheller. Be it corn shellers \u2014 you've got ploughs; you've got fan mills; all these things \u2014 and these are not, again, antiques. These are \u2014 you can order these. You can go to the web and you can buy them now, brand-new made. So in a certain sense, technologies don't die. In fact, you can buy, for 50 bucks, a stone-age knife made exactly the same way that they were made 10,000 years ago. It's short, bone handle, 50 bucks. And in fact, what's important is that this information actually never died out. It's not just that it was resurrected. It's continued all along. And in Papua New Guinea, they were making stone axes until two decades ago, just as a course of practical matters.Even when we try to get rid of a technology, it's actually very hard. So we've all heard about the Amish giving up cars. We've heard about the Japanese giving up guns. We've heard about this and that. But I actually went back and took what I could find, the examples in history where there have been prohibitions against technology, and then I tried to find out when they came back in, because they always came back in. And it turns out that the time, the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited, is decreasing over time. And that basically, you can delay technology, but you can't kill it. So this makes sense, because in a certain sense what culture is, is the accumulation of ideas. That's what it's for. It's so that ideas don't die out. And when we take that, we take this idea of what culture is doing and add it to what the long-term trajectory \u2014 again, in life's evolution \u2014 we find that each case \u2014 each of the major transitions in life \u2014 what they're really about is accelerating and changing the way in which evolution happens. They're actually changing the way in which ideas are generated.So all these steps in evolution are increasing, basically, the evolution of evolvability. So what's happening over time in life is that the ways in which you generate these new ideas, these new hacks, are increasing. And the real tricks are ways in which you kind of explore the way of exploring. And then what we see in the singularity, that prophesized by Kurzweil and others \u2014 his idea that technology is accelerating evolution. It's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas. So if you have life hacking \u2014 life means hacking, the game of survival \u2014 then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game. And what technology is really about is better ways to evolve. That is what we call an \"infinite game.\" That's the definition of \"infinite game.\" A finite game is play to win, and an infinite game is played to keep playing. And I believe that technology is actually a cosmic force.The origins of technology was not in 1829, but was actually at the beginning of the Big Bang, and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe were compressed. The entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot, and it was so tight in there, there was no room for any difference at all. That's the definition. There was no temperature. There was no difference whatsoever. And at the Big Bang, what it expanded was the potential for difference. So as it expands and as things expand what we have is the potential for differences, diversity, options, choices, opportunities, possibilities and freedoms. Those are all basically the same thing. And those are the things that technology brings us. That's what technology is bringing us: choices, possibilities, freedoms. That's what it's about. It's this expansion of room to make differences. And so a hammer, when we grab a hammer, that's what we're grabbing. And that's why we continue to grab technology \u2014 because we want those things. Those things are good. Differences, freedom, choices, possibilities. And each time we make a new opportunity place, we're allowing a platform to make new ones.And I think it's really important. Because if you can imagine Mozart before the technology of the piano was invented \u2014 what a loss to society there would be. Imagine Van Gogh being born before the technologies of cheap oil paints. Imagine Hitchcock before the technologies of film. Somewhere, today, there are millions of young children being born whose technology of self-expression has not yet been invented. We have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true difference. We want a trillion zillion species of one individuals. That's what technology really wants.I'm going to skip through some of the objections because I don't have answers to why there's deforestation. I don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be bad technologies. I don't have an answer to how this impacts on our dignity, other than to suggest that maybe the seventh kingdom, because it's so close to what life is about, maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life. Maybe in some ways the fact that what we're trying to do with technology is find a good home for it. It's a terrible thing to spray DDT on cotton fields, but it's a really good thing to use to eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village.Our humanity is actually defined by technology. All the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology. This is the infinite game. That's what we're talking about. You see, technology is a way to evolve the evolution. It's a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more. And it's actually a way of playing the game, of playing all the games. That's what technology wants. And so when I think about what technology wants, I think that it has to do with the fact that every person here \u2014 and I really believe this \u2014 every person here has an assignment. And your assignment is to spend your life discovering what your assignment is. That recursive nature is the infinite game. And if you play that well, you'll have other people involved, so even that game extends and continues even when you're gone. That is the infinite game. And what technology is is the medium in which we play that infinite game. And so I think that we should embrace technology because it is an essential part of our journey in finding out who we are.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 19, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nI don't know about you, but I haven't quite figured out\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nexactly what technology means in my life.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nI've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nShould I be pro-technology? Should I embrace it full arms?\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nShould I be wary? Like you, I'm very tempted by the latest thing.\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nBut at the other hand, a couple of years ago\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nI gave up all of my possessions,\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nsold all my technology -- except for a bicycle --\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nand rode across 3,000 miles on the U.S. back roads under the power of my one body,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nfuelled mostly by Twinkies and junk food.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nAnd I've since then tried to keep technology\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nat arm's length in many ways, so it doesn't master my life.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nAt the same time, I run a website on cool tools,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nwhere I issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nSo I'm still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nas it relates to humanity, as it relates to nature,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nas it relates to the spiritual.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nAnd I'm not even sure we know what technology is.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nAnd one definition of technology is that which is first recorded.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nThis is the first example of the modern use of technology that I can find.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nIt was the suggested syllabus for dealing with\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nthe Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in 1829.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nBefore that, obviously, technology didn't exist. But obviously it did.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nI like one of the definitions that Alan Kay has for technology.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nHe says technology is anything that was invented after you were born.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nSo it sums up a lot of what we're talking about.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nDanny Hillis actually has an update on that --\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nhe says technology is anything that doesn't quite work yet.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:07.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nWhich also, I think, gets into a little bit of our current idea.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nBut I was interested in another definition of technology.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nSomething, again, that went back to something more fundamental.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nSomething that was deeper. And as I struggled to understand that,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nI came up with a way of framing the question\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nthat seemed to work for me in my investigations.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nAnd I'm, this morning, going to talk about this for the first time.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nSo this is a very rough attempt to think out loud.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nThe question that I came up with was this question:\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nwhat does technology want? And by that, I don't mean,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:50.958\ndoes it want chocolate or vanilla? By what it wants, I mean,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nwhat are its inherent trends and biases?\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nWhat are its tendencies over time? One way to think about this is\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nthinking about biological organisms, which we've heard a lot about.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nAnd the trick that Richard Dawkins does, which is to say,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nto look at them as simply as genes, as vehicles for genes.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nSo he's saying, what do genes want? The selfish gene.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nAnd I'm applying a similar trick to say,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nwhat if we looked at the universe in our culture\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nthrough the eyes of technology? What does technology want?\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nObviously, this in an incomplete question,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\njust as looking at an organism as only a gene\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nis an incomplete way of looking at it.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nBut it's still very, very productive. So I'm attempting to say,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nif we take technology's view of the world, what does it want?\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nAnd I think once we ask that question\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nwe have to go back, actually, to life. Because obviously,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nif we keep extending the origins of technology far back,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nI think we come back to life at some point.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nSo that's where I want to begin my little exploration, is in life.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nAnd like you heard from the previous speakers,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nwe don't really know what life there is on Earth right now.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nWe have really no idea.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nCraig Venter's tremendous and brilliant attempt\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nto DNA sequence things in the ocean is great.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nBrian Farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nand actually discover all the species on Earth.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nAnd one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nand randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\njust to see what's on life. And if we did that\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nwith our little Martian probe, which we have not done on Earth,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nwe would begin to see some incredible species.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nThis is not on another planet. These are things\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nthat are hidden away on our planet.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nThis is an ant that stores its colleagues' honey in its abdomen.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nEach one of these organisms that we've described -- that you've seen\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nfrom Jamie and others, these magnificent things --\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nwhat they're doing, each one of them,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nis they're hacking the rules of life.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nI can't think of a single general principle of biology\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nthat does not have an exception somewhere by some organism.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nEvery single thing that we can think of --\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nand if you heard Olivia's talk about the sexual habits,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nyou'll realize that there isn't anything we can say that's true for all life,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nbecause every single one of them is hacking something about it.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nThis is a solar-powered sea slug. It's a nudibranch\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nthat has incorporated chloroplast inside it to drive its energy.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nThis is another version of that. This is a sea dragon,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nand the one on the bottom, the blue one, is a juvenile that has not yet\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nswallowed the acid, has not yet taken in\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nthe brown-green algae pond scum into its body to give it energy.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nThese are hacks, and if we looked at the general shape\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nof the approaches to hacking life there are, current consensus,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nsix kingdoms. Six different broad approaches: the plants,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nthe animals, the fungi, the protests -- the little things -- the bacteria\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nand the Archaea bacteria. The Archaeas.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nThose are the general approaches to life. That's one way to look at life on Earth today.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nBut a more interesting way,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nthe current way to take the long view,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nis to look at it in an evolutionary perspective.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nAnd here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\ngo over the linear time, we have it coming out from the center.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nSo in the center is the most primitive, and this is a genealogical chart\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nof all life on earth. This is all the same six kingdoms.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nYou see 4,000 representative species, and you can see where we are.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nBut what I like about this is it shows that\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nevery living organism on Earth today is equally evolved.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nThose fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nThey've been around just as long and gone through\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:49.958\njust the same kind of trial and error to get here.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nBut we see that each one of these is actually hacking,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nand has a different way of finding out how to do life.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nAnd if we take the long-term trends of life, if we begin to say,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nwhat does evolution want? There's several things that we see.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nOne of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nhave we ever been where we don't find life.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nWe find life at the bottom of every long-term,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nlong-distance drilling core into the center of rock\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nthat we bring up -- and there's bacteria in the pores of that rock.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAnd wherever life is, it never retreats. It's ubiquitous and it wants to be more.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nMore and more of the inert matter of the globe\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nis being touched and animated by life.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nThe second thing is is we see diversity. We also see specialization.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nWe see the movement from a general-purpose cell\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nto the more specific and specialized.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nAnd we see a drift towards complexity that's very intuitive.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nAnd actually, we have current data that does show\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nthat there is an actual drift towards complexity over time.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nAnd the last thing, I bring back this nudibranch.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nOne of the things we see about life is that it moves\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nfrom the inner to increasing sociability. And by that it means\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nthat there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nLike those chloroplast cells --\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nthey're completely surrounded by other life.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nThey never touch the inner matter. There is more and more co-evolution.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nAnd so the general, long-term trends of evolution\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nare roughly these five: ubiquity, diversity, specialization,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:29.958\ncomplexity and socialization. Now, I took that and said,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nOK, what are the long-term trends in technology?\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nAnd again, my question is, what does technology want?\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nAnd so, remarkably, I discovered\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nthat there's also a drift toward specialization.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nThat we see there's a general hammer,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nand hammers become more and more specific over time.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nThere's obviously diversity. Huge numbers of things.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nThis is all the contents of a Japanese home.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nI actually had my daughter -- gave her a tally counter,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nand I gave her an assignment last summer to go around\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nand count the number of species of technology in our household.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nAnd it came up with 6,000 different species of products.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nI did some research and found out that the King of England, Henry VIII,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nhad only about 7,000 items in his household.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nAnd he was the King of England,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nand that was the entire wealth of England at the time.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nSo we're seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nThis is a scene from Star Wars where the 3PO comes out\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nand he sees machines making machines. How depraved!\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nWell, this is actually what we're headed towards: world machines.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nAnd the technology is only being thrown out by other technologies.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nMost machines will only ever be in contact with other technology\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nand not non-technology, or even life.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nAnd thirdly, the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nis at this point a cliche. And I'm happy to say,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nI was partly responsible for that cliche\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nthat machines are becoming biological, but that's pretty evident.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nSo the major trends in technology evolution actually\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nare the same as in biological evolution. The same drives that we see\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\ntowards ubiquity, towards diversity, towards socialization,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:13.958\ntowards complexity. That is maybe not a big surprise\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nbecause if we map out, say, the evolution of armor,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nyou can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nI suggest that, in fact, technology is the seventh kingdom of life.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nThat its operations and how it works is so similar\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nthat we can think of it as the seventh kingdom.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nAnd so it would be sort of approximately up there,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:44.958\ncoming out of the animal kingdom. And if we were to do that,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nwe would find out -- we could actually approach technology in this way.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nThis is Niles Eldredge. He was the co-developer with Stephen Jay Gould\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nof the theory of punctuated equilibrium.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nBut as a sideline, he happens to collect cornets.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nHe has one of the world's largest collections -- about 500 of them.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nAnd he has decided to treat them as if they were trilobites, or snails,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nand to do a morphological analysis,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nand try to derive their genealogical history over time.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nThis is his chart, which is not quite published yet.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nBut the most interesting aspect about this\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nis that if you look at those red lines at the bottom,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nthose indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nthat was no longer made. That does not happen in biology.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nWhen something is extinct, you can't have it as your parent.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nBut that does happen in technology. And it turns out\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nthat that's so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nand you can actually use it to determine\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nthat this is a technological system versus a biological system.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nIn fact, this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nthat I began to think about what happens with old technology.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nAnd it turns out that, in fact, technologies don't die.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nSo I suggested this to an historian of science, and he said,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:06.958\n\"Well, what about, you know, come on, what about steam cars?\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nThey're not around anymore.\" Well actually, they are.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nIn fact, they're so around that you can buy new parts for a Stanley steam automobile.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nAnd this is a website of a guy who's selling brand new parts\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nfor the Stanley automobile. And the thing that I liked\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nis sort of this one-click, add-to-your-cart button --\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:28.958\n(Laughter) --\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nfor buying steam valves. I mean, it was just -- it was really there.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nAnd so, I began to think about, well, maybe that's just a random sample.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nMaybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nSo I took the great big 1895 Montgomery Ward's catalog\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nand I randomly went through it. And I took a page -- not quite a random page --\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nI took a page that was actually more difficult than others\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nbecause lots of the pages are filled with things\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nthat are still being made. But I took this page\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nand I said, how many of these things are still being made?\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nAnd not antiques. I want to know how many of these things are still in production.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nAnd the answer is: all of them.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nAll of them are still being produced. So you've got corn shellers.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nI don't know who needs a corn sheller.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nBe it corn shellers -- you've got ploughs; you've got fan mills;\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nall these things -- and these are not, again, antiques. These are --\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nyou can order these. You can go to the web and you can buy them now,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nbrand-new made. So in a certain sense, technologies don't die.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nIn fact, you can buy, for 50 bucks, a stone-age knife\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nmade exactly the same way that they were made 10,000 years ago.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nIt's short, bone handle, 50 bucks. And in fact,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nwhat's important is that this information actually never died out.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nIt's not just that it was resurrected. It's continued all along.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nAnd in Papua New Guinea, they were making stone axes\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nuntil two decades ago, just as a course of practical matters.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nEven when we try to get rid of a technology, it's actually very hard.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nSo we've all heard about the Amish giving up cars.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nWe've heard about the Japanese giving up guns.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nWe've heard about this and that. But I actually went back and\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.958\ntook what I could find, the examples in history\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nwhere there have been prohibitions against technology,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nand then I tried to find out when they came back in,\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nbecause they always came back in. And it turns out that the time,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nthe duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nis decreasing over time. And that basically, you can delay technology,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nbut you can't kill it. So this makes sense, because in a certain sense\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nwhat culture is, is the accumulation of ideas.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nThat's what it's for. It's so that ideas don't die out.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nAnd when we take that, we take this idea of what culture is doing\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nand add it to what the long-term trajectory -- again, in life's evolution --\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nwe find that each case -- each of the major transitions in life --\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nwhat they're really about is accelerating and changing\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nthe way in which evolution happens.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nThey're actually changing the way in which ideas are generated.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nSo all these steps in evolution are increasing, basically,\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nthe evolution of evolvability.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nSo what's happening over time in life is\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nthat the ways in which you generate these new ideas, these new hacks,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nare increasing. And the real tricks are ways\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nin which you kind of explore the way of exploring.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nAnd then what we see in the singularity,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nthat prophesized by Kurzweil and others --\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nhis idea that technology is accelerating evolution.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nIt's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nSo if you have life hacking --\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nlife means hacking, the game of survival --\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nthen evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nAnd what technology is really about is better ways to evolve.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nThat is what we call an \"infinite game.\"\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nThat's the definition of \"infinite game.\" A finite game is play to win,\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nand an infinite game is played to keep playing.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nAnd I believe that technology is actually a cosmic force.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nThe origins of technology was not in 1829,\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nbut was actually at the beginning of the Big Bang,\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nand at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nwere compressed. The entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot,\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nand it was so tight in there, there was no room for any difference at all.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nThat's the definition. There was no temperature.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nThere was no difference whatsoever. And at the Big Bang,\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nwhat it expanded was the potential for difference.\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nSo as it expands and as things expand what we have\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nis the potential for differences, diversity, options, choices,\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nopportunities, possibilities and freedoms.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nThose are all basically the same thing.\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nAnd those are the things that technology brings us.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nThat's what technology is bringing us: choices, possibilities, freedoms.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nThat's what it's about. It's this expansion of room to make differences.\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nAnd so a hammer, when we grab a hammer, that's what we're grabbing.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nAnd that's why we continue to grab technology --\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nbecause we want those things. Those things are good.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nDifferences, freedom, choices, possibilities.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nAnd each time we make a new opportunity place,\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nwe're allowing a platform to make new ones.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nAnd I think it's really important. Because if you can imagine\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nMozart before the technology of the piano was invented --\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nwhat a loss to society there would be.\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nImagine Van Gogh being born\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nbefore the technologies of cheap oil paints.\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nImagine Hitchcock before the technologies of film.\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nSomewhere, today, there are millions of young children being born\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nwhose technology of self-expression has not yet been invented.\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nWe have a moral obligation to invent technology\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nso that every person on the globe has the potential\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nto realize their true difference.\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nWe want a trillion zillion species of one individuals.\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nThat's what technology really wants.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nI'm going to skip through some of the objections\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nbecause I don't have answers to why there's deforestation.\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nI don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nbad technologies. I don't have an answer to\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nhow this impacts on our dignity, other than to suggest that\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nmaybe the seventh kingdom, because it's so close to what life is about,\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nmaybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life.\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nMaybe in some ways\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nthe fact that what we're trying to do with technology is find a good home for it.\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nIt's a terrible thing to spray DDT on cotton fields,\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:31.958\nbut it's a really good thing to use\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nto eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village.\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:38.958\nOur humanity is actually defined by technology.\n\n00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nAll the things that we think that we really like about humanity\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:46.958\nis being driven by technology. This is the infinite game.\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:48.958\nThat's what we're talking about.\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:52.958\nYou see, technology is a way to evolve the evolution.\n\n00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nIt's a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more.\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:03.958\nAnd it's actually a way of playing the game, of playing all the games.\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nThat's what technology wants.\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nAnd so when I think about what technology wants,\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:13.958\nI think that it has to do with the fact that every person here -- and I really believe this --\n\n00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nevery person here has an assignment. And your assignment is\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nto spend your life discovering what your assignment is.\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nThat recursive nature is the infinite game.\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:27.958\nAnd if you play that well, you'll have other people involved,\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:31.958\nso even that game extends and continues even when you're gone.\n\n00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:34.958\nThat is the infinite game. And what technology is\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:37.958\nis the medium in which we play that infinite game.\n\n00:19:37.958 --> 00:19:40.958\nAnd so I think that we should embrace technology\n\n00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:43.958\nbecause it is an essential part of our journey\n\n00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:45.958\nin finding out who we are.\n\n00:19:45.958 --> 00:19:47.958\nThank you.\n\n00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:48.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Fight injustice with raw video", "duration": "848", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_gabriel_fights_injustice_with_video", "transcript": "I love trees, and I'm very lucky, because we live near a wonderful arboretum, and Sundays, usually, I'd go there with my wife and now, with my four-year-old, and we'd climb in the trees, we'd play hide and seek. The second school I was at had big trees too, had a fantastic tulip tree, I think it was the biggest in the country, and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation around it, around the playing fields.One day I was grabbed by some of my classmates, and taken in the bushes \u2014 I was stripped; I was attacked; I was abused; and this came out of the blue. Now, the reason I say that, because, afterwards, I was thinking \u2014 well, I went back into the school \u2014 I felt dirty; I felt betrayed; I felt ashamed, but mainly \u2014 mainly, I felt powerless. And 30 years later I was sitting in an airplane, next to a lady called Veronica, who came from Chile, and we were on a human rights tour, and she was starting to tell me what it was like to be tortured, and, from my very privileged position, this was the only reference point that I had. And it was an amazing learning experience because, for me, human rights have been something in which I had, you know, a part-time interest, but, mainly, it was something that happened to other people over there.But I got a phone call from Bono in 1985 and, as you know, he's a great singer, but he's a magnificent hustler, and \u2014(Laughter) \u2014a very hard guy to say no to, and he was saying, you know, just after I'd done the Biko song, we're going to do a tour for Amnesty, you have to be on it, and really that was the first time that I'd been out and started meeting people who'd watched their family being shot in front of them, who'd had a partner thrown out of an airplane into an ocean, and suddenly this world of human rights arrived in my world, and I couldn't really walk away in quite the same way as before.So I got involved with this tour, which was for Amnesty, and then in '88 I took over Bono's job trying to learn how to hustle. I didn't do it as well, but we managed to get Youssou N'Dour, Sting, Tracy Chapman, and Bruce Springsteen to go 'round the world for Amnesty, and it was an amazing experience. And, once again, I got an extraordinary education, and it was the first time, really, that I'd met a lot of these people in the different countries, and these human rights stories became very physical, and, again, I couldn't really walk away quite so comfortably.But the thing that really amazed me, that I had no idea, was that you could suffer in this way and then have your whole experience, your story, denied, buried and forgotten. And it seemed that whenever there was a camera around, or a video or film camera, it was a great deal harder to do \u2014 for those in power to bury the story. And Reebok set up a foundation after these Human Rights Now tours and there was a decision then \u2014 well, we made a proposal, for a couple of years, about trying to set up a division that was going to give cameras to human rights activists. It didn't really get anywhere, and then the Rodney King incident happened, and people thought, OK, if you have a camera in the right place at the right time, or, perhaps, the wrong time, depending who you are, then you can actually start doing something, and campaigning, and being heard, and telling people about what's going on.So, WITNESS was started in '92 and it's since given cameras out in over 60 countries. And we campaign with activist groups and help them tell their story and, in fact, I will show you in a moment one of the most recent campaigns, and I'm afraid it's a story from Uganda, and, although we had a wonderful story from Uganda yesterday, this one isn't quite so good. In the north of Uganda, there are something like 1.5 million internally displaced people, people who are not refugees in another country, but because of the civil war, which has been going on for about 20 years, they have nowhere to live. And 20,000 kids have been taken away to become child soldiers, and the International Criminal Court is going after five of the leaders of the \u2014 now, what's it called? I forget the name of the of the army \u2014 it's Lord's Resistance Army, I believe \u2014 but the government, also, doesn't have a clean sheet, so if we could run the first video.(Music) Woman: Life in the camp is never simple. Even today life is difficult. We stay because of the fear that what pushed us into the camp ... still exists back home. Text: \"Between Two Fires: Torture and Displacement in Northern Uganda\" Man: When we were at home, it was Kony's [rebel] soldiers disturbing us. At first, we were safe in the camp. But later the government soldiers began mistreating us a lot.(Chanting) Jennifer: A soldier walked onto the road, asking where we'd been. Evelyn and I hid behind my mother. Evelyn: He ordered us to sit down, so we sat down. The other soldier also came. Jennifer: The man came and started undressing me. The other one carried Evelyn aside. The one who was defiling me then left me and went to rape Evelyn. And the one who was raping Evelyn came and defiled me also. Man: The soldiers with clubs this long beat us to get a confession. They kept telling us, \"Tell the truth!\" as they beat us. Woman: They insisted that I was lying. At that moment, they fired and shot off my fingers. I fell. They ran to join the others ... leaving me for dead.(Music) Text: Uganda ratified the Convention Against Torture in 1986. Torture is defined as any act by which severe pain of suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted by a person acting in an official capacity to obtain information or a confession, to punish, coerce or intimidate.Peter Gabriel: So torture is not something that always happens on other soil. In my country, it was \u2014 we had been looking at pictures of British soldiers beating up young Iraqis; we've got Abu Ghraib; we've got Guantanamo Bay. I had a driver on my way to Newark Airport, and he told me a story that, in the middle of the night, 4 a.m., he'd been taken out of his home in Queens \u2014 taken to a place in the Midwest, that he was interrogated and tortured and returned to the street four weeks later, because he had the same \u2014 he was Middle Eastern, and he had the same name as one of the 9/11 pilots, and that may or may not be true \u2014 I didn't think he was a liar, though.And, I think, if we look around the world, as well as the polar ice caps melting, human rights, which have been fought for, for many hundreds of years in some cases, are, also, eroding very fast, and that is something that we need to take a look at and, maybe, start campaigning for. I mean, here, too, one of our partners was at Van Jones and the Books Not Bars project \u2014 they have managed, with their footage in California to change the youth correction systems employed, and it's much \u2014 much \u2014 I think, more humane methods are being looked at, how you should lock up young kids, and that's questionable to start off. And as the story of Mr. Morales, just down the road, excuse me, Mr. Gabriel, would you mind if we delayed your execution a little bit? No, not at all, no problem, take your time. But this, surely, whoever that man is, whatever he's done, this is cruel and unusual punishment.Anyway, WITNESS has been trying to arm the brave people who often put their lives at risk around the world, with cameras, and I'd like to show you just a little more of that. Thank you.(Thunder) Text: You can say a story is fabricated.(Music) Text: You can say a jury is corrupt. You can say a person is lying. You can say you don't trust newspapers. But you can't say what you just saw never happened. Help WITNESS give cameras to the world. Shoot a video; expose injustice; reveal the truth; show us what's wrong with the world; and maybe we can help make it right. WITNESS. All the video you have just seen was recorded by human rights groups working with WITNESS.(Applause)PG: WITNESS was born of technological innovation \u2014 in a sense the small, portable, DV cam was really what allowed it to come into being. And we've also been trying to get computers out to the world, so that groups can communicate much more effectively, campaign much more effectively, but now we have the wonderful possibility, which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it, because that is cheap; it's ubiquitous; and it's moving fast all around the world \u2014 and it's very exciting for us.And so, the dream is that we could have a world in which anyone who has anything bad happen to them of this sort has a chance of getting their story uploaded, being seen, being watched, that they really know that they can be heard, that there would be a giant website, maybe, a little like Google Earth, and you could fly over and find out the realities of what's going, for the world's inhabitants. In a way what this technology is allowing is, really, that a lot of the problems of the world can have a human face, that we can actually see who's dying of AIDS or who's being beaten up, for the first time, and we can hear their stories in a way that the blogger culture \u2014 if we can move that into these sort of fields, I think we can really transform the world in all sorts of ways. There could be a new movement growing up, rising from the ground, reaching for the light, and growing strong, just like a tree.

00:00:17.958\nbecause we live near a wonderful arboretum,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nand Sundays, usually, I'd go there with my wife\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nand now, with my four-year-old,\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nand we'd climb in the trees, we'd play hide and seek.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nThe second school I was at had big trees too,\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nhad a fantastic tulip tree, I think it was the biggest in the country,\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nand it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\naround it, around the playing fields.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nOne day I was grabbed by some of my classmates,\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nand taken in the bushes -- I was stripped; I was attacked;\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nI was abused; and this came out of the blue.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nNow, the reason I say that, because, afterwards, I was thinking --\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nwell, I went back into the school -- I felt dirty; I felt betrayed;\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nI felt ashamed, but mainly -- mainly, I felt powerless.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nAnd 30 years later I was sitting in an airplane,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nnext to a lady called Veronica, who came from Chile,\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nand we were on a human rights tour,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nand she was starting to tell me what it was like to be tortured,\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nand, from my very privileged position,\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nthis was the only reference point that I had.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nAnd it was an amazing learning experience\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nbecause, for me, human rights have been something in which I had,\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nyou know, a part-time interest, but, mainly,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nit was something that happened to other people over there.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nBut I got a phone call from Bono in 1985 and, as you know,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nhe's a great singer, but he's a magnificent hustler, and --\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\n(Laughter) --\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\na very hard guy to say no to, and he was saying,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nyou know, just after I'd done the Biko song,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nwe're going to do a tour for Amnesty,\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nyou have to be on it, and really that was the first time\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nthat I'd been out and started meeting people\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nwho'd watched their family being shot in front of them,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nwho'd had a partner thrown out of an airplane into an ocean,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nand suddenly this world of human rights arrived in my world,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nand I couldn't really walk away in quite the same way as before.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nSo I got involved with this tour, which was for Amnesty,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nand then in '88 I took over Bono's job trying to learn how to hustle.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nI didn't do it as well, but we managed to get Youssou N'Dour, Sting,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nTracy Chapman, and Bruce Springsteen to go 'round the world for Amnesty,\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nand it was an amazing experience.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nAnd, once again, I got an extraordinary education,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nand it was the first time, really,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nthat I'd met a lot of these people in the different countries,\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nand these human rights stories became very physical,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nand, again, I couldn't really walk away quite so comfortably.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nBut the thing that really amazed me, that I had no idea,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nwas that you could suffer in this way\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nand then have your whole experience, your story, denied,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nburied and forgotten.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nAnd it seemed that whenever there was a camera around,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nor a video or film camera,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nit was a great deal harder to do -- for those in power to bury the story.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nAnd Reebok set up a foundation after these Human Rights Now tours\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nand there was a decision then --\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nwell, we made a proposal, for a couple of years,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nabout trying to set up a

00:03:59.958\nand then the Rodney King incident happened, and people thought,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nOK, if you have a camera in the right place at the right time,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nor, perhaps, the wrong time, depending who you are,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nthen you can actually start doing something,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nand campaigning, and being heard,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nand telling people about what's going on.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nSo, WITNESS was started in '92\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nand it's since given cameras out in over 60 countries.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd we campaign with activist groups\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nand help them tell their story and, in fact,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nI will show you in a moment one of the most recent campaigns,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nand I'm afraid it's a story from Uganda,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nand, although we had a wonderful story from Uganda yesterday,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nthis one isn't quite so good.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nIn the north of

And it all started one day on a plane, on my way to TED, seven years ago. And in the seat next to me was a high school student, a teenager, and she came from a really poor family. And she wanted to make something of her life, and she asked me a simple little question. She said, \"What leads to success?\" And I felt really badly, because I couldn't give her a good answer.So I get off the plane, and I come to TED. And I think, jeez, I'm in the middle of a room of successful people! So why don't I ask them what helped them succeed, and pass it on to kids? So here we are, seven years, 500 interviews later, and I'm going to tell you what really leads to success and makes TEDsters tick.And the first thing is passion. Freeman Thomas says, \"I'm driven by my passion.\" TEDsters do it for love; they don't do it for money.Carol Coletta says, \"I would pay someone to do what I do.\" And the interesting thing is: if you do it for love, the money comes anyway.Work! Rupert Murdoch said to me, \"It's all hard work. Nothing comes easily. But I have a lot of fun.\" Did he say fun? Rupert? Yes!(Laughter)TEDsters do have fun working. And they work hard. I figured, they're not workaholics. They're workafrolics.(Laughter)Good!(Applause)Alex Garden says, \"To be successful, put your nose down in something and get damn good at it.\" There's no magic; it's practice, practice, practice.And it's focus. Norman Jewison said to me, \"I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing.\"And push! David Gallo says, \"Push yourself. Physically, mentally, you've got to push, push, push.\" You've got to push through shyness and self-doubt.Goldie Hawn says, \"I always had self-doubts. I wasn't good enough; I wasn't smart enough. I didn't think I'd make it.\"Now it's not always easy to push yourself, and that's why they invented mothers.(Laughter)(Applause) Frank Gehry said to me, \"My mother pushed me.\"(Laughter)Serve! Sherwin Nuland says, \"It was a privilege to serve as a doctor.\"A lot of kids want to be millionaires. The first thing I say is: \"OK, well you can't serve yourself; you've got to serve others something of value. Because that's the way people really get rich.\"Ideas! TEDster Bill Gates says, \"I had an idea: founding the first micro-computer software company.\" I'd say it was a pretty good idea. And there's no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas \u2014 it's just doing some very simple things. And I give lots of evidence.Persist! Joe Kraus says, \"Persistence is the number one reason for our success.\" You've got to persist through failure. You've got to persist through crap!

And in one generation, for example, Asia's gone from having one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one of the highest. And in Africa, cardiovascular disease equals the HIV and AIDS deaths in most countries. So there's a critical window of opportunity we have to make an important difference that can affect the lives of literally millions of people, and practice preventive medicine on a global scale.Heart and blood vessel diseases still kill more people \u2014 not only in this country, but also worldwide \u2014 than everything else combined, and yet it's completely preventable for almost everybody. It's not only preventable; it's actually reversible. And for the last almost 29 years, we've been able to show that by simply changing diet and lifestyle, using these very high-tech, expensive, state-of-the-art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost interventions can be like \u2014 quantitative arteriography, before and after a year, and cardiac PET scans.We showed a few months ago \u2014 we published the first study showing you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by making changes in diet and lifestyle, and 70 percent regression in the tumor growth, or inhibition of the tumor growth, compared to only nine percent in the control group. And in the MRI and MR spectroscopy here, the prostate tumor activity is shown in red \u2014 you can see it diminishing after a year.Now there is an epidemic of obesity: two-thirds of adults and 15 percent of kids. What's really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased 70 percent in the past 10 years, and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do. That's pitiful, and it's preventable. Now these are not election returns, these are the people \u2014 the number of the people who are obese by state, beginning in '85, '86, '87 \u2014 these are from the CDC website \u2014 '88, '89, '90, '91 \u2014 you get a new category \u2014 '92, '93, '94, '95, '96, '97, '98, '99, 2000, 2001 \u2014 it gets worse. We're kind of devolving. (Laughter)Now what can we do about this? Well, you know, the diet that we've found that can reverse heart disease and cancer is an Asian diet. But the people in Asia are starting to eat like we are, which is why they're starting to get sick like we are. So I've been working with a lot of the big food companies. They can make it fun and sexy and hip and crunchy and convenient to eat healthier foods, like \u2014 I chair the advisory boards to McDonald's, and PepsiCo, and ConAgra, and Safeway, and soon Del Monte, and they're finding that it's good business. The salads that you see at McDonald's came from the work \u2014 they're going to have an Asian salad. At Pepsi, two-thirds of their revenue growth came from their better foods.And so if we can do that, then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating AIDS and HIV and malaria and for preventing avian flu.

So, that's Kibera, the largest squatter community in Nairobi. This is the squatter community in Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Bombay, India, what's called Mumbai these days. This is Hosinia, the largest and most urbanized favela in Rio de Janeiro. And this is Sultanbelyi, which is one of the largest squatter communities in Istanbul. They are what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow, the new urban world.Now, why do I say that? To tell you about that I have to talk about this fellow here, his name is Julius. And I met Julius the last week that I was living in Kibera. So, I had been there almost three months, and I was touring around the city going to different squatter areas and Julius was tagging along, and he was bug eyed and at certain points we were walking around, he grabbed my hand for support, which is something most Kenyans would never consider doing. They're very polite and they don't get so forward so quickly. And I found out later that it was Julius' first day in Nairobi, and he's one of many.So, close to 200,000 people a day migrate from the rural to the urban areas. That's, and I'm going to be fair to the statisticians who talked this morning, not almost 1.5 million people a week, but almost 1.4 million people a week but I'm a journalist, and we exaggerate, so almost 1.5 million people a week, close to 70 million people a year. And if you do the math, that's 130 people every minute. So, that'll be \u2014 in the 18 minutes that I'm given to talk here, between two and three thousand people will have journeyed to the cities. And here are the statistics. Today \u2014 a billion squatters, one in six people on the planet. 2030 \u2014 two billion squatters, one in four people on the planet. And the estimate is that in 2050, there'll be three billion squatters, better than one in three people on earth. So, these are the cities of the future, and we have to engage them.And I was thinking this morning of the good life, and before I show you the rest of my presentation, I'm going to violate TED rules here, and I'm going to read you something from my book as quickly as I can. Because I think it says something about reversing our perception of what we think the good life is.So \u2014 \"The hut was made of corrugated metal, set on a concrete pad. It was a 10 by 10 cell. Armstrong O'Brian, Jr. shared it with three other men. Armstrong and his friends had no water \u2014 they bought it from a nearby tap owner \u2014 no toilet \u2014 the families in this compound shared a single pit-latrine \u2014 and no sewers or sanitation. They did have electricity, but it was illegal service tapped from someone else's wires, and could only power one feeble bulb. This was Southland, a small shanty community on the western side of Nairobi, Kenya. But it could've been anywhere in the city, because more than half the city of Nairobi lives like this. 1.5 million people stuffed into mud or metal huts with no services, no toilets, no rights.\"Armstrong explained the brutal reality of their situation: they paid 1,500 shillings in rent, about 20 bucks a month, a relatively high price for a Kenyan shantytown, and they could not afford to be late with the money. 'In case you owe one month, the landlord will come with his henchmen and bundle you out. He will confiscate your things,' Armstrong said. 'Not one month, one day,' his roommate Hilary Kibagendi Onsomu, who was cooking ugali, the spongy white cornmeal concoction that is the staple food in the country, cut into the conversation. They called their landlord a Wabenzi, meaning that he is a person who has enough money to drive a Mercedes-Benz. Hilary served the ugali with a fry of meat and tomatoes; the sun slammed down on the thin steel roof; and we perspired as we ate.\"After we finished, Armstrong straightened his tie, put on a wool sports jacket, and we headed out into the glare. Outside a mound of garbage formed the border between Southland and the adjacent legal neighborhood of Langata. It was perhaps eight feet tall, 40 feet long, and 10 feet wide. And it was set in a wider watery ooze. As we passed, two boys were climbing the mount Kenya of trash. They couldn't have been more than five or six years old. They were barefoot, and with each step their toes sank into the muck sending hundreds of flies scattering from the rancid pile. I thought they might be playing King of the Hill, but I was wrong. Once atop the pile, one of the boys lowered his shorts, squatted, and defecated. The flies buzzed hungrily around his legs. When 20 families \u2014 100 people or so \u2014 share a single latrine, a boy pooping on a garbage pile is perhaps no big thing. But it stood in jarring contrast to something Armstrong had said as we were eating \u2014 that he treasured the quality of life in his neighborhood.\"For Armstrong, Southland wasn't constrained by its material conditions. Instead, the human spirit radiated out from the metal walls and garbage heaps to offer something no legal neighborhood could: freedom. 'This place is very addictive,' he had said. 'It's a simple life, but nobody is restricting you. Nobody is controlling what you do. Once you have stayed here, you cannot go back.' He meant back beyond that mountain of trash, back in the legal city, of legal buildings, with legal leases and legal rights. 'Once you have stayed here,' he said, 'you can stay for the rest of your life.'\"So, he has hope, and this is where these communities start.This is perhaps the most primitive shanty that you can find in Kibera, little more than a stick-and-mud hut next to a garbage heap. This is getting ready for the monsoon in Bombay, India. This is home improvement: putting plastic tarps on your roof.This is in Rio de Janeiro, and it's getting a bit better, right? We're seeing scavenged terra cotta tile and little pieces of signs, and plaster over the brick, some color, and this is Sulay Montakaya's house in Sultanbelyi, and it's getting even better. He's got a fence; he scavenged a door; he's got new tile on the roof.And then you get Rocinha and you can see that it's getting even better. The buildings here are multi-story. They develop \u2014 you can see on the far right one where it seems to just stack on top of each other, room, after room, after room. And what people do is they develop their home on one or two stories, and they sell their loggia or roof rights, and someone else builds on top of their building, and then that person sells the roof rights, and someone else builds on top of their building. All of these buildings are made out of reinforced concrete and brick.And then you get Sultanbelyi, in Turkey, where it's even built to a higher level of design. The crud in the front is mattress stuffing, and you see that all over Turkey. People dry out or air out their mattress stuffing on their roofs. But the green building, on behind, you can see that the top floor is not occupied, so people are building with the possibility of expansion. And it's built to a pretty high standard of design.And then you finally get squatter homes like this, which is built on the suburban model. Hey, that's a single family home in the squatter community. That's also in Istanbul, Turkey. They're quite vital places, these communities.This is the main drag of Rocinha, the Estrada da Gavea, and there's a bus route that runs through it, lots of people out on the street. These communities in these cities are actually more vital than the illegal communities. They have more things going on in them.This is a typical pathway in Rocinha called a \"beco\" \u2014 these are how you get around the community. It's on very steep ground. They're built on the hills, inland from the beaches in Rio, and you can see that the houses are just cantilevered over the natural obstructions. So, that's just a rock in the hillside. And these becos are normally very crowded, and people hump furniture up them, or refrigerators up them, all sorts of things. Beer is all carried in on your shoulders. Beer is a very important thing in Brazil.This is commerce in Kenya, right along the train tracks, so close to the train tracks that the merchants sometimes have to pull the merchandise out of the way. This is a marketplace, also in Kenya, Toi Market, lots of dealers, in almost everything you want to buy. Those green things in the foreground are mangoes.This is a shopping street in Kibera, and you can see that there's a soda dealer, a health clinic, two beauty salons, a bar, two grocery stores, and a church, and more. It's a typical downtown street; it just happens to be self-built. This here, on the right-hand side, is what's called a \u2014 if you look at the fine print under the awning \u2014 it's a hotel. And what hotel means, in Kenya and India, is an eating-place. So, that's a restaurant.People steal electrical power \u2014 this is Rio. People tap in and they have thieves who are called \"grillos\" or \"crickets,\" and they steal the electrical power and wire the neighborhood. People burn trash to get rid of the garbage, and they dig their own sewer channels. Talk about more plastic bags than plankton. And sometimes they have natural trash-disposal. And when they have more money they cement their streets, and they put in sewers and good water pipes, and stuff like that. This is water going to Rio. People run their water pipes all over the place, and that little hut right there has a pump in it, and that's what people do: they steal electricity; they install a pump and they tap into the water main, and pump water up to their houses.So, the question is how do you go from the mud-hut village, to the more developed city, to the even highly developed Sultanbelyi? I say there are two things. One is people need a guarantee they won't be evicted. That does not necessarily mean property rights, and I would disagree with Hernando de Soto on that question, because property rights create a lot of complications. They're most often sold to people, and people then wind up in debt and have to pay back the debt, and sometimes have to sell their property in order to pay back the debt. There's a whole variety of other reasons why property rights sometimes don't work in these cases, but they do need security of tenure. And they need access to politics, and that can mean two things. That can mean community organizing from below, but it can also mean possibilities from above. And I say that because the system in Turkey is notable.Turkey has two great laws that protect squatters. One is that \u2014 it's called \"gecekondu\" in Turkish, which means \"built overnight,\" and if you build your house overnight in Turkey, you can't be evicted without due process of law, if they don't catch you during the night. And the second aspect is that once you have 2,000 people in the community, you can petition the government to be recognized as a legal sub-municipality. And when you're a legal sub-municipality, you suddenly have politics. You're allowed to have an elected government, collect taxes, provide municipal services, and that's exactly what they do.So, these are the civic leaders of the future. The woman in the center is Geeta Jiwa. She lives in one of those tents on the highway median in Mumbai. That's Sureka Gundi; she also lives with her family on the tent along the same highway median. They're very outspoken. They're very active. They can be community leaders. This woman is Nine, which means \"grandma\" in Turkish. And there were three old ladies who lived in \u2014 that's her self-built house behind her \u2014 and they've lived there for 30 or 40 years, and they are the backbone of the community there.This is Richard Muthama Peter, and he is an itinerant street photographer in Kibera. He makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood, and the people in the neighborhood, and is a great resource in the community.And finally my choice to run for mayor of Rio is Cezinio, the fruit merchant with his two kids here, and a more honest and giving and caring man I don't know.The future of these communities is in the people and in our ability to work with those people. So, I think the message I take, from what I read from the book, from what Armstrong said, and from all these people, is that these are neighborhoods. The issue is not urban poverty. The issue is not the larger, over-arching thing. The issue is for us to recognize that these are neighborhoods \u2014 this is a legitimate form of urban development \u2014 and that cities have to engage these residents, because they are building the cities of the future.Thank you very much.", "id": 36, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:12.958\nLet me show you some

Nairobi.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nThis is the squatter community in Sanjay Gandhi National Park\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nin Bombay, India, what's called Mumbai these days.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nThis is Hosinia, the largest and most urbanized favela\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nin Rio de Janeiro.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nAnd this is Sultanbelyi,\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nwhich is one of the largest squatter communities in Istanbul.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nThey are what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nthe new urban world.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nNow, why do I say that?\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nTo tell you about that I have to talk about this fellow here,\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nhis name is Julius.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nAnd I met Julius the last week that I was living in Kibera.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nSo, I had been there almost three months,\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nand I was touring around the city going to different squatter areas\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nand Julius was tagging along, and he was bug eyed\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nand at certain points we were walking around,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nhe grabbed my hand for support,\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nwhich is something most Kenyans would never consider doing.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nThey're very polite and they don't get so forward so quickly.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nAnd I found out later that it was Julius' first day in Nairobi,\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nand he's one of many.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nSo, close to 200,000 people a day\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nmigrate from the rural to the urban areas.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nThat's, and I'm going to be fair to the statisticians\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nwho talked this morning, not almost 1.5 million people a week,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nbut almost 1.4 million people a week but I'm a journalist,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nand we exaggerate, so almost 1.5 million people a week,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nclose to 70 million people a year.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nAnd if you do the math, that's 130 people every minute.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nSo, that'll be -- in the 18 minutes that I'm given to talk here,\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nbetween two and three thousand people will have journeyed to the cities.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nAnd here are the statistics.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nToday -- a billion squatters,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\none in six people on the planet.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\n2030 -- two billion squatters,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\none in four people on the planet.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nAnd the estimate is that in 2050, there'll be three billion squatters,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nbetter than one in three people on earth.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nSo, these are the cities of the future, and we have to engage them.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nAnd I was thinking this morning of the good life,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nand before I show you the rest of my presentation,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nI'm going to violate TED rules here,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nand I'm going to read you something from my book as quickly as I can.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nBecause I think it says something about reversing our perception\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nof what we think the good life is.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nSo -- \"The hut was made of corrugated metal, set on a concrete pad.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nIt was a 10 by 10 cell.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nArmstrong O'Brian, Jr. shared it with three other men.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nArmstrong and his friends had no water --\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nthey bought it from a nearby tap owner --\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nno toilet -- the families in this compound shared a single pit-latrine --\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nand no sewers or sanitation.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nThey did have electricity,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nbut it was illegal service tapped from someone else's wires,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nand could only power one feeble bulb.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nThis was Southland, a small shanty community\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\non the western side of Nairobi, Kenya.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nBut it could've been anywhere in the city,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nbecause more than half the city of Nairobi lives like this.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.958\n1.5 million people stuffed into mud or metal huts\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nwith no services, no toilets, no rights.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:04.958\n\"Armstrong explained the brutal reality of their situation:\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nthey paid 1,500 shillings in rent, about 20 bucks a month,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\na relatively high price for a Kenyan shantytown,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nand they could not afford to be late with the money.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\n'In case you owe one month, the landlord will come with his henchmen\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nand bundle you out. He will confiscate your things,' Armstrong said.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:24.958\n'Not one month, one day,' his roommate Hilary Kibagendi Onsomu,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nwho was cooking ugali, the spongy white cornmeal concoction\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nthat is the staple food in the country, cut into the conversation.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nThey called their landlord a Wabenzi, meaning that he is a person\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nwho has enough money to drive a Mercedes-Benz.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nHilary served the ugali with a fry of meat and tomatoes;\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nthe sun slammed down on the thin steel roof;\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nand we perspired as we ate.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\n\"After we finished, Armstrong straightened his tie,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nput on a wool sports jacket, and we headed out into the glare.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nOutside a mound of garbage formed the border\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nbetween Southland and the adjacent legal neighborhood of Langata.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nIt was perhaps eight feet tall, 40 feet long, and 10 feet wide.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nAnd it was set in a wider watery ooze.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nAs we passed, two boys were climbing the mount Kenya of trash.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nThey couldn't have been more than five or six years old.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nThey were barefoot, and with each step their toes sank into the muck\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nsending hundreds of flies scattering from the rancid pile.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nI thought they might be playing King of the Hill, but I was wrong.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nOnce atop the pile, one of the boys lowered his shorts,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nsquatted, and defecated.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nThe flies buzzed hungrily around his legs.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nWhen 20 families -- 100 people or so -- share a single latrine,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:47.958\na boy pooping on a garbage pile is perhaps no big thing.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nBut it stood in jarring contrast\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nto something Armstrong had said as we were eating --\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nthat he treasured the quality of life in his neighborhood.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:06:00.958\n\"For Armstrong, Southland wasn't constrained by its material conditions.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nInstead, the human spirit radiated out\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nfrom the metal walls and garbage heaps to offer something\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nno legal neighborhood could: freedom.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\n'This place is very addictive,' he had said.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\n'It's a simple life, but nobody is restricting you.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nNobody is controlling what you do.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nOnce you have stayed here, you cannot go back.'\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nHe meant back beyond that mountain of trash,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nback in the legal city, of legal buildings,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nwith legal leases and legal rights.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\n'Once you have stayed here,' he said,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\n'you can stay for the rest of your life.'\"\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nSo, he has hope, and this is where these communities start.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nThis is perhaps the most primitive shanty that you can find in Kibera,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nlittle more than a stick-and-mud hut next to a garbage heap.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nThis is getting ready for the monsoon in Bombay, India.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nThis is home improvement:\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nputting plastic tarps on your roof.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nThis is in Rio de Janeiro, and it's getting a bit better, right?\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nWe're seeing scavenged terra cotta tile and little pieces of signs,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nand plaster over the brick, some color,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nand this is Sulay Montakaya's house in Sultanbelyi, and it's getting even better.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nHe's got a fence; he scavenged a door;\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nhe's got new tile on the roof.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nAnd then you get Rocinha\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nand you can see that it's getting even better.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nThe buildings here are multi-story.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nThey develop -- you can see on the far right\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\none where it seems to just stack on top of each other,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nroom, after room, after room.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nAnd what people do is they develop their home on one or two stories,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nand they sell their loggia or roof rights,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nand someone else builds on top of their building,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nand then that person sells the roof rights,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nand someone else builds on top of their building.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAll of these buildings are made out of reinforced concrete and brick.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd then you get Sultanbelyi, in Turkey, where it's even built\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nto a higher level of design.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nThe crud in the front is mattress stuffing,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nand you see that all over Turkey.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nPeople dry out or air out their mattress stuffing on their roofs.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nBut the green building, on behind,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nyou can see that the top floor is not occupied,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nso people are building with the possibility of expansion.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nAnd it's built to a pretty high standard of design.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nAnd then you finally get squatter homes like this,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nwhich is built on the suburban model.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nHey, that's a single family home in the squatter community.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nThat's also in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nThey're quite vital places, these communities.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nThis is the main drag of Rocinha, the Estrada da Gavea,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nand there's a bus route that runs through it,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nlots of people out on the street.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nThese communities in these cities are actually more vital\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nthan the illegal communities.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nThey have more things going on in them.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nThis is a typical pathway in Rocinha called a \"beco\" --\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nthese are how you get around the community.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nIt's on very steep ground.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nThey're built on the hills, inland from the beaches in Rio,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nand you can see that the houses are just cantilevered over the natural obstructions.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nSo, that's just a rock in the hillside.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nAnd these becos are normally very crowded,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nand people hump furniture up them, or refrigerators up them,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nall sorts of things.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nBeer is all carried in on your shoulders.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nBeer is a very important thing in Brazil.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nThis is commerce in Kenya, right along the train tracks,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nso close to the train tracks that the merchants\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nsometimes have to pull the merchandise out of the way.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nThis is a marketplace, also in Kenya, Toi Market,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nlots of dealers, in almost everything you want to buy.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nThose green things in the foreground are mangoes.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nThis is a shopping street in Kibera,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nand you can see that there's a soda dealer, a health clinic,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:49.958\ntwo beauty salons, a bar, two grocery stores, and a church, and more.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nIt's a typical downtown street; it just happens to be self-built.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nThis here, on the right-hand side,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nis what's called a -- if you look at the fine print under the awning --\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nit's a hotel.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nAnd what hotel means, in Kenya and India, is an eating-place.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nSo, that's a restaurant.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nPeople steal electrical power -- this is Rio.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nPeople tap in and they have thieves who are called \"grillos\" or \"crickets,\"\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nand they steal the electrical power\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nand wire the neighborhood.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nPeople burn trash to get rid of the garbage,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nand they dig their own sewer channels.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nTalk about more plastic bags than plankton.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nAnd sometimes they have natural trash-disposal.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nAnd when they have more money they cement their streets,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nand they put in sewers and good water pipes, and stuff like that.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nThis is water going to Rio. People run their water pipes all over the place,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nand that little hut right there has a pump in it, and that's what people do:\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nthey steal electricity; they install a pump\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nand they tap into the water main, and pump water up to their houses.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nSo, the question is how do you go from the mud-hut village,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nto the more developed city, to the even highly developed Sultanbelyi?\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nI say there are two things.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nOne is people need a guarantee they won't be evicted.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nThat does not necessarily mean property rights,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nand I would disagree with Hernando de Soto on that question,\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nbecause property rights create a lot of complications.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nThey're most often sold to people, and people then wind up in debt\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nand have to pay back the debt,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nand sometimes have to sell their property\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nin order to pay back the debt.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nThere's a whole variety of other reasons why property rights\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nsometimes don't work in these cases,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nbut they do need security of tenure.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nAnd they need access to politics, and that can mean two things.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nThat can mean community organizing from below,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nbut it can also mean possibilities from above.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nAnd I say that because the system in Turkey is notable.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nTurkey has two great laws that protect squatters.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nOne is that -- it's called \"gecekondu\" in Turkish,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nwhich means \"built overnight,\" and if you build your house overnight\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nin Turkey, you can't be evicted without due process of law,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nif they don't catch you during the night.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nAnd the second aspect is that once you have 2,000 people\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nin the community, you can petition the government\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nto be recognized as a legal sub-municipality.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nAnd when you're a legal sub-municipality, you suddenly have politics.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nYou're allowed to have an elected government, collect taxes,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nprovide municipal services, and that's exactly what they do.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nSo, these are the civic leaders of the future.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nThe woman in the center is Geeta Jiwa.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nShe lives in one of those tents on the highway median in Mumbai.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nThat's Sureka Gundi; she also lives with her family\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\non the tent along the same highway median.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nThey're very outspoken. They're very active.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nThey can be community leaders.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nThis woman is Nine, which means \"grandma\" in Turkish.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nAnd there were three old ladies who lived in --\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nthat's her self-built house behind her -- and they've lived there for 30 or 40 years,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nand they are the backbone of the community there.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nThis is Richard Muthama Peter,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nand he is an itinerant street photographer in Kibera.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nHe makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nand the people in the neighborhood,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nand is a great resource in the community.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nAnd finally my choice to run for mayor of Rio is Cezinio,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nthe fruit merchant with his two kids here,\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nand a more honest and giving and caring man I don't know.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nThe future of these communities is in the people\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nand in our ability to work with those people.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nSo, I think the message I take, from what I read from the book,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nfrom what Armstrong said, and from all these people,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nis that these are neighborhoods.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nThe issue is not urban poverty.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nThe issue is not the larger, over-arching thing.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nThe issue is for us to recognize that these are neighborhoods --\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nthis is a legitimate form of urban development --\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nand that cities have to engage these residents,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nbecause they are building the cities of the future.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nThank you very much."}, {"title": "Global priorities bigger than climate change", "duration": "1001", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/bjorn_lomborg_sets_global_priorities", "transcript": "What I'd like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world. I'm not going to talk about \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\" \u2014 probably that's also a good choice. (Laughter)But I am going talk about: what are the big problems in the world? And I must say, before I go on, I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because I'm actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that. So get out your pen and paper. Bottom line is, there is a lot of problems out there in the world. I'm just going to list some of them. There are 800 million people starving. There's a billion people without clean drinking water. Two billion people without sanitation. There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS. The lists go on and on. There's two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change \u2014 so on. There are many, many problems out there.In an ideal world, we would solve them all, but we don't. We don't actually solve all problems. And if we do not, the question I think we need to ask ourselves \u2014 and that's why it's on the economy session \u2014 is to say, if we don't do all things, we really have to start asking ourselves, which ones should we solve first? And that's the question I'd like to ask you. If we had say, 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world, where should we spend it? We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world, and I will just briefly read them: climate change, communicable diseases, conflicts, education, financial instability, governance and corruption, malnutrition and hunger, population migration, sanitation and water, and subsidies and trade barriers. We believe that these in many ways encompass the biggest problems in the world. The obvious question would be to ask, what do you think are the biggest things? Where should we start on solving these problems? But that's a wrong problem to ask. That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January.But of course, there's a problem in asking people to focus on problems. Because we can't solve problems. Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die. But we don't have a technology to solve that, right? So the point is not to prioritize problems, but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems. And that would be \u2014 of course that gets a little more complicated. To climate change that would be like Kyoto. To communicable diseases, it might be health clinics or mosquito nets. To conflicts, it would be U.N.'s peacekeeping forces, and so on. The point that I would like to ask you to try to do, is just in 30 seconds \u2014 and I know this is in a sense an impossible task \u2014 write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities. And also \u2014 and that's, of course, where economics gets evil \u2014 to put down what are the things we should not do, first. What should be at the bottom of the list? Please, just take 30 seconds, perhaps talk to your neighbor, and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world's biggest issues.The amazing part of this process \u2014 and of course, I mean, I would love to \u2014 I only have 18 minutes, I've already given you quite a substantial amount of my time, right? I'd love to go into, and get you to think about this process, and that's actually what we did. And I also strongly encourage you, and I'm sure we'll also have these discussions afterwards, to think about, how do we actually prioritize? Of course, you have to ask yourself, why on Earth was such a list never done before? And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable. Nobody wants to do this. Of course, every organization would love to be on the top of such a list. But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list. And since there are many more not-number-one spots on the list than there is number ones, it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list. We've had the U.N. for almost 60 years, yet we've never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world, and said, which of them should we do first? So it doesn't mean that we are not prioritizing \u2014 any decision is a prioritization, so of course we are still prioritizing, if only implicitly \u2014 and that's unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization, and went in and talked about it.So what I'm proposing is really to say that we have, for a very long time, had a situation when we've had a menu of choices. There are many, many things we can do out there, but we've not had the prices, nor the sizes. We have not had an idea. Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card, but you have no idea what the price is. You know, you have a pizza; you've no idea what the price is. It could be at one dollar; it could be 1,000 dollars. It could be a family-size pizza; it could be a very individual-size pizza, right? We'd like to know these things.And that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do \u2014 to try to put prices on these issues. And so basically, this has been the Copenhagen Consensus' process. We got 30 of the world's best economists, three in each area. So we have three of world's top economists write about climate change. What can we do? What will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that? Likewise in communicable diseases. Three of the world's top experts saying, what can we do? What would be the price? What should we do about it, and what will be the outcome? And so on.Then we had some of the world's top economists, eight of the world's top economists, including three Nobel Laureates, meet in Copenhagen in May 2004. We called them the \"dream team.\" The Cambridge University prefects decided to call them the Real Madrid of economics. That works very well in Europe, but it doesn't really work over here. And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list. And then you ask, why economists? And of course, I'm very happy you asked that question \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 because that's a very good question. The point is, of course, if you want to know about malaria, you ask a malaria expert. If you want to know about climate, you ask a climatologist. But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first, you can't ask either of them, because that's not what they do. That is what economists do. They prioritize. They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying, which one should we do first, and which one should we do afterwards?So this is the list, and this is the one I'd like to share with you. Of course, you can also see it on the website, and we'll also talk about it more, I'm sure, as the day goes on. They basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects \u2014 basically, projects where if you invest a dollar, you get less than a dollar back. Then there's fair projects, good projects and very good projects. And of course, it's the very good projects we should start doing. I'm going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects.These were the bad projects. As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change. This offends a lot of people, and that's probably one of the things where people will say I shouldn't come back, either. And I'd like to talk about that, because that's really curious. Why is it it came up? And I'll actually also try to get back to this because it's probably one of the things that we'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down.The reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto \u2014 or doing something more than Kyoto \u2014 is a bad deal is simply because it's very inefficient. It's not saying that global warming is not happening. It's not saying that it's not a big problem. But it's saying that what we can do about it is very little, at a very high cost. What they basically show us, the average of all macroeconomic models, is that Kyoto, if everyone agreed, would cost about 150 billion dollars a year. That's a substantial amount of money. That's two to three times the global development aid that we give the Third World every year. Yet it would do very little good. All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100. So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106. Which is a little good, but not very much good. So the idea here really is to say, well, we've spent a lot of money doing a little good.And just to give you a sense of reference, the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount, for about 75 billion dollars a year, we could solve all major basic problems in the world. We could give clean drinking water, sanitation, basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet. So we have to ask ourselves, do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good? Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good? And that is really why it becomes a bad project. It's not to say that if we had all the money in the world, we wouldn't want to do it. But it's to say, when we don't, it's just simply not our first priority.The fair projects \u2014 notice I'm not going to comment on all these \u2014 but communicable diseases, scale of basic health services \u2014 just made it, simply because, yes, scale of basic health services is a great thing. It would do a lot of good, but it's also very, very costly. Again, what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation. If you look at the good projects, a lot of sanitation and water projects came in. Again, sanitation and water is incredibly important, but it also costs a lot of infrastructure. So I'd like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world.The fourth best problem is malaria \u2014 dealing with malaria. The incidence of malaria is about a couple of [million] people get infected every year. It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP every year for affected nations. If we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years, we could bring that incidence down to half. We could avoid about 500,000 people dying, but perhaps more importantly, we could avoid about a [million] people getting infected every year. We would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with \u2014 of course, in the long run, also to deal with global warming.This third best one was free trade. Basically, the model showed that if we could get free trade, and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe, we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year, half of which would accrue to the Third World. Again, the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty, very radically fast, in about two to five years. That would be the third best thing we could do.The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition. Not just malnutrition in general, but there's a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition, namely, the lack of micronutrients. Basically, about half of the world's population is lacking in iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin A. If we invest about 12 billion dollars, we could make a severe inroad into that problem. That would be the second best investment that we could do.And the very best project would be to focus on HIV/AIDS. Basically, if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years, we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV/AIDS. Again, what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV/AIDS. One is treatment; the other one is prevention. And again, in an ideal world, we would do both. But in a world where we don't do either, or don't do it very well, we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first. And treatment is much, much more expensive than prevention. So basically, what this focuses on is saying, we can do a lot more by investing in prevention. Basically for the amount of money that we spend, we can do X amount of good in treatment, and 10 times as much good in prevention. So again, what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment, at first rate.What this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities. I'd like to have you look at your priority list and say, did you get it right? Or did you get close to what we came up with here? Well, of course, one of the things is climate change again. I find a lot of people find it very, very unlikely that we should do that.We should also do climate change, if for no other reason, simply because it's such a big problem. But of course, we don't do all problems. There are many problems out there in the world. And what I want to make sure of is, if we actually focus on problems, that we focus on the right ones. The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good. And I think, actually \u2014 Thomas Schelling, one of the participants in the dream team, he put it very, very well. One of things that people forget, is that in 100 years, when we're talking about most of the climate change impacts will be, people will be much, much richer. Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N. estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100 will be about as rich as we are today. Much more likely, they will be two to four times richer than we are. And of course, we'll be even richer than that.But the point is to say, when we talk about saving people, or helping people in Bangladesh in 2100, we're not talking about a poor Bangladeshi. We're actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy. And so the real point, of course, is to say, do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little, 100 years from now, a fairly rich Dutch guy? Or do we want to help real poor people, right now, in Bangladesh, who really need the help, and whom we can help very, very cheaply? Or as Schelling put it, imagine if you were a rich \u2014 as you will be \u2014 a rich Chinese, a rich Bolivian, a rich Congolese, in 2100, thinking back on 2005, and saying, \"How odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change, and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather, whom they could have helped so much more, and who needed the help so much more?\"So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight. Even if it doesn't accord to the typical way we see this problem. Of course, that's mainly because climate change has good pictures. We have, you know, \"The Day After Tomorrow\" \u2014 it looks great, right? It's a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it, right, but don't expect Emmerich to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie digging latrines in Tanzania or something. (Laughter) It just doesn't make for as much of a movie. So in many ways, I think of the Copenhagen Consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems. To make sure that we realize it's not about making us feel good. It's not about making things that have the most media attention, but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good.The other objections, I think, that are important to say, is that I'm somehow \u2014 or we are somehow \u2014 positing a false choice. Of course, we should do all things, in an ideal world \u2014 I would certainly agree. I think we should do all things, but we don't. In 1970, the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did, right now, than in 1970, on the developing world. Since then our aid has halved. So it doesn't look like we're actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems.Likewise, people are also saying, but what about the Iraq war? You know, we spend 100 billion dollars \u2014 why don't we spend that on doing good in the world? I'm all for that. If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that, that's fine. But the point, of course, is still to say, if you get another 100 billion dollars, we still want to spend that in the best possible way, don't we? So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities. I should just mention briefly, is this really the right list that we got out? You know, when you ask the world's best economists, you inevitably end up asking old, white American men. And they're not necessarily, you know, great ways of looking at the entire world.So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem. The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university, and they spoke English. The majority of them were, first, from developing countries. They had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion, and they certainly did, to come up with their own lists. And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar \u2014 with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom. We've done this many other times. There's been many other seminars and university students, and different things. They all come out with very much the same list. And that gives me great hope, really, in saying that I do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities, and saying, what is the important thing in the world? Of course, in an ideal world, again we'd love to do everything. But if we don't do it, then we can start thinking about where should we start?I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process. We did it in 2004, and we hope to assemble many more people, getting much better information for 2008, 2012. Map out the right path for the world \u2014 but also to start thinking about political triage. To start thinking about saying, \"Let's do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost, not the things that we don't know how to do, but let's do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good, at very low cost, right now.\"At the end of the day, you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these, but we have to be honest and frank about saying, if there's some things we do, there are other things we don't do. If we worry too much about some things, we end by not worrying about other things. So I hope this will help us make better priorities, and think about how we better work for the world.

which of them should we do first?\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nSo it doesn't mean that we are not prioritizing --\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nany decision is a prioritization, so of course we are still prioritizing,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nif only implicitly -- and that's unlikely to be as good\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nas if we actually did the prioritization,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nand went in and talked about it.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nSo what I'm proposing is really to say that we have,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nfor a very long time, had a situation when we've had a menu of choices.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nThere are many, many things we can do out there,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nbut we've not had the prices, nor the sizes.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nWe have not had an idea.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nImagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nbut you have no idea what the price is.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nYou know, you have a pizza; you've no idea what the price is.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nIt could be at one dollar; it could be 1,000 dollars.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nIt could be a family-size pizza;\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nit could be a very individual-size pizza, right?\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nWe'd like to know these things.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nAnd that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do --\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nto try to put prices on these issues.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nAnd so basically, this has been the Copenhagen Consensus' process.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nWe got 30 of the world's best economists, three in each area.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nSo we have three of world's top economists write about climate change.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nWhat can we do? What will be the cost\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nand what will be the benefit of that?\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nLikewise in communicable diseases.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nThree of the world's top experts saying, what can we do?\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nWhat would be the price?\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nWhat should we do about it, and what will be the outcome?\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nAnd so on.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nThen we had some of the world's top economists,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:04.958\neight of the world's top economists, including three Nobel Laureates,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nmeet in Copenhagen in May 2004.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nWe called them the \"dream team.\"\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nThe Cambridge University prefects decided to call them\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nthe Real Madrid of economics.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nThat works very well in Europe, but it doesn't really work over here.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nAnd what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nAnd then you ask, why economists?\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nAnd of course, I'm very happy you asked that question -- (Laughter) --\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nbecause that's a very good question.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nThe point is, of course, if you want to know about malaria,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nyou ask a malaria expert.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nIf you want to know about climate, you ask a climatologist.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nBut if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nyou can't ask either of them, because that's not what they do.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nThat is what economists do.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nThey prioritize.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nThey make that in some ways disgusting task of saying, which one should we do first,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nand which one should we do afterwards?\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nSo this is the list, and this is the one I'd like to share with you.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nOf course, you can also see it on the website,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nand we'll also talk about it more, I'm sure, as the day goes on.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nThey basically came up with a list where they said\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nthere were bad projects -- basically, projects\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nwhere if you invest a dollar, you get less than a dollar back.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nThen there's fair projects, good projects and very good projects.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nAnd of course, it's the very good projects we should start doing.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nI'm going to go from backwards\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nso that we end up with the best projects.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nThese were the bad projects.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nAs you might see the bottom of the list was climate change.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nThis offends a lot of people, and that's probably one of the things\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nwhere people will say I shouldn't come back, either.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nAnd I'd like to talk about that, because that's really curious.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nWhy is it it came up?\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nAnd I'll actually also try to get back to this\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nbecause it's probably one of the things\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nthat we'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nThe reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto --\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nor doing something more than Kyoto -- is a bad deal\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nis simply because it's very inefficient.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nIt's not saying that global warming is not happening.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nIt's not saying that it's not a big problem.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nBut it's saying that what we can do about it\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nis very little, at a very high cost.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nWhat they basically show us, the average of all macroeconomic models,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nis that Kyoto, if everyone agreed, would cost about 150 billion dollars a year.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nThat's a substantial amount of money.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nThat's two to three times the global development aid\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nthat we give the Third World every year.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nYet it would do very little good.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nAll models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nSo the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nWhich is a little good, but not very much good.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nSo the idea here really is to say, well, we've spent a lot of money doing a little good.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nAnd just to give you a sense of reference,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nthe U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nfor about 75 billion dollars a year,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nwe could solve all major basic problems in the world.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nWe could give clean drinking water, sanitation, basic healthcare\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nand education to every single human being on the planet.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nSo we have to ask ourselves, do we want to spend twice the amount\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:45.958\non doing very little good?\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nOr half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good?\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nAnd that is really why it becomes a bad project.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nIt's not to say that if we had all the money in the world, we wouldn't want to do it.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nBut it's to say, when we don't, it's just simply not our first priority.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nThe fair projects -- notice I'm not going to comment on all these --\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nbut communicable diseases, scale of basic health services -- just made it,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nsimply because, yes, scale of basic health services is a great thing.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nIt would do a lot of good, but it's also very, very costly.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nAgain, what it tells us is suddenly\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nwe start thinking about both sides of the equation.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nIf you look at the good projects, a lot of sanitation and water projects came in.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nAgain, sanitation and water is incredibly important,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nbut it also costs a lot of infrastructure.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nSo I'd like to show you the top four priorities\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nwhich should be at least the first ones that we deal with\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nwhen we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nThe fourth best problem is malaria -- dealing with malaria.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nThe incidence of malaria is about a couple of [million] people get infected every year.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nIt might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nevery year for affected nations.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nIf we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nwe could bring that incidence down to half.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nWe could avoid about 500,000 people dying,\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nbut perhaps more importantly, we could avoid about a [million] people\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:08:59.958\ngetting infected every year.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nWe would significantly increase their ability\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nto deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with --\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nof course, in the long run, also to deal with global warming.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nThis third best one was free trade.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nBasically, the model showed that if we could get free trade,\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nand especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nwe could basically enliven the global economy\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nto an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nhalf of which would accrue to the Third World.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nAgain, the point is to say that we could actually pull\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\ntwo to three hundred million people out of poverty,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nvery radically fast, in about two to five years.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nThat would be the third best thing we could do.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nThe second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nNot just malnutrition in general, but there's a very cheap way\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nof dealing with malnutrition, namely, the lack of micronutrients.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nBasically, about half of the world's population is lacking in\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\niron, zinc, iodine and vitamin A.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nIf we invest about 12 billion dollars,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nwe could make a severe inroad into that problem.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nThat would be the second best investment that we could do.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nAnd the very best project would be to focus on HIV/AIDS.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nBasically, if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nwe could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV/AIDS.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nAgain, what this does and what it focuses on is saying\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nthere are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV/AIDS.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nOne is treatment; the other one is prevention.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nAnd again, in an ideal world, we would do both.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nBut in a world where we don't do either, or don't do it very well,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nwe have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nAnd treatment is much, much more expensive than prevention.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nSo basically, what this focuses on is saying, we can do a lot more\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nby investing in prevention.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nBasically for the amount of money that we spend,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nwe can do X amount of good in treatment,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nand 10 times as much good in prevention.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nSo again, what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment,\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nat first rate.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nWhat this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nI'd like to have you look at your priority list and say,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\ndid you get it right?\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nOr did you get close to what we came up with here?\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nWell, of course, one of the things is climate change again.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nI find a lot of people find it very, very unlikely that we should do that.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nWe should also do climate change,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nif for no other reason, simply because it's such a big problem.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nBut of course, we don't do all problems.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nThere are many problems out there in the world.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nAnd what I want to make sure of is, if we actually focus on problems,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nthat we focus on the right ones.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nThe ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nAnd I think, actually -- Thomas Schelling,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:40.958\none of the participants in the dream team, he put it very, very well.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nOne of things that people forget, is that in 100 years,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nwhen we're talking about most of the climate change impacts will be,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\npeople will be much, much richer.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nEven the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nestimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nwill be about as rich as we are today.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nMuch more likely, they will be two to four times richer than we are.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nAnd of course, we'll be even richer than that.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nBut the point is to say, when we talk about saving people,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nor helping people in Bangladesh in 2100,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nwe're not talking about a poor Bangladeshi.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nWe're actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nAnd so the real point, of course, is to say,\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:20.958\ndo we want to spend a lot of money helping a little,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\n100 years from now, a fairly rich Dutch guy?\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nOr do we want to help real poor people, right now, in Bangladesh,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nwho really need the help, and whom we can help very, very cheaply?\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nOr as Schelling put it, imagine if you were a rich -- as you will be --\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:40.958\na rich Chinese, a rich Bolivian, a rich Congolese, in 2100,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nthinking back on 2005, and saying, \"How odd that they cared so much\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nabout helping me a little bit through climate change,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nand cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nand my great grandfather, whom they could have helped so much more,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nand who needed the help so much more?\"\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nSo I think that really does tell us why it is\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nwe need to get our priorities straight.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nEven if it doesn't accord to the typical way we see this problem.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nOf course, that's mainly because climate change has good pictures.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nWe have, you know, \"The Day After Tomorrow\" -- it looks great, right?\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nIt's a good film in the sense that\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nI certainly want to see it, right, but don't expect Emmerich\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nto cast Brad Pitt in his next movie\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\ndigging latrines in Tanzania or something. (Laughter)\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nIt just doesn't make for as much of a movie.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nSo in many ways, I think of the Copenhagen Consensus\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nand the whole discussion of priorities\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nas a defense for boring problems.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nTo make sure that we realize it's not about making us feel good.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nIt's not about making things that have the most media attention,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nbut it's about making places where we can actually do the most good.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nThe other objections, I think, that are important to say,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nis that I'm somehow -- or we are somehow -- positing a false choice.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nOf course, we should do all things,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nin an ideal world -- I would certainly agree.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nI think we should do all things, but we don't.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nIn 1970, the developed world decided we were going to spend\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:11.958\ntwice as much as we did, right now, than in 1970, on the developing world.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nSince then our aid has halved.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nSo it doesn't look like we're actually on the path\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nof suddenly solving all big problems.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nLikewise, people are also saying, but what about the Iraq war?\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nYou know, we spend 100 billion dollars --\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nwhy don't we spend that on doing good in the world?\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nI'm all for that.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nIf any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that, that's fine.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nBut the point, of course, is still to say,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nif you get another 100 billion dollars,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nwe still want to spend that in the best possible way, don't we?\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nSo the real issue here is to get ourselves back\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nand think about what are the right priorities.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nI should just mention briefly, is this really the right list that we got out?\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nYou know, when you ask the world's best economists,\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nyou inevitably end up asking old, white American men.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nAnd they're not necessarily, you know,\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:55.958\ngreat ways of looking at the entire world.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nSo we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nto come and solve the same problem.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nThe only two requirements were that they were studying at the university,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nand they spoke English.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nThe majority of them were, first, from developing countries.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nThey had all the same material but they could go vastly\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\noutside the scope of discussion, and they certainly did,\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nto come up with their own lists.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nAnd the surprising thing was that the list was very similar --\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nwith malnutrition and diseases at the top\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nand climate change at the bottom.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nWe've done this many other times.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nThere's been many other seminars and university students, and different things.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nThey all come out with very much the same list.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nAnd that gives me great hope, really, in saying that I do believe\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nthat there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities,\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nand saying, what is the important thing in the world?\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nOf course, in an ideal world, again we'd love to do everything.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nBut if we don't do it, then we can start thinking about where should we start?\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nI see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nWe did it in 2004,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nand we hope to assemble many more people,\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:56.958\ngetting much better information for 2008, 2012.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nMap out the right path for the world --\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nbut also to start thinking about political triage.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nTo start thinking about saying, \"Let's do\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nnot the things where we can do very little at a very high cost,\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nnot the things that we don't know how to do,\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nbut let's do the great things where we can do an enormous\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:15.958\namount of good, at very low cost, right now.\"\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nAt the end of the day, you can disagree\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nwith the discussion of how we actually prioritize these,\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nbut we have to be honest and frank about saying,\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nif there's some things we do, there are other things we don't do.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nIf we worry too much about some things,\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nwe end by not worrying about other things.\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nSo I hope this will help us make better priorities,\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nand think about how we better work for the world.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nThank you."}, {"title": "Dreams from endangered cultures", "duration": "1321", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/wade_davis_on_endangered_cultures", "transcript": "You know, one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways, who still feel their past in the wind, touch it in stones polished by rain, taste it in the bitter leaves of plants. Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way, or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning, or that in the Himalaya, the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma, is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology, and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense, but is just one model of reality, the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made, albeit successfully, many generations ago.And of course, we all share the same adaptive imperatives. We're all born. We all bring our children into the world. We go through initiation rites. We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death, so it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing, we all dance, we all have art.But what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song, the rhythm of the dance in every culture. And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo, or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti, or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya, the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes, or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara \u2014 this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago \u2014 or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma, Everest, the goddess mother of the world.All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being, other ways of thinking, other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth. And this is an idea, if you think about it, can only fill you with hope. Now, together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet, and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere. And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere, and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams, myths, ideas, inspirations, intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness. The ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy. It's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species.And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded, so too is the ethnosphere \u2014 and, if anything, at a far greater rate. No biologists, for example, would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true, and yet that \u2014 the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity \u2014 scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity. And the great indicator of that, of course, is language loss.When each of you in this room were born, there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet. Now, a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules. A language is a flash of the human spirit. It's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world. Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind, a watershed, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.And of those 6,000 languages, as we sit here today in Monterey, fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children. They're no longer being taught to babies, which means, effectively, unless something changes, they're already dead. What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence, to be the last of your people to speak your language, to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children? And yet, that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks, because every two weeks, some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue.And I know there's some of you who say, \"Well, wouldn't it be better, wouldn't the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language?\" And I say, \"Great, let's make that language Yoruba. Let's make it Cantonese. Let's make it Kogi.\" And you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language.And so, what I'd like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere, a brief journey through the ethnosphere, to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost. Now, there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say \"different ways of being,\" I really do mean different ways of being.Take, for example, this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon, the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes. Now, this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend. They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called \"linguistic exogamy:\" you must marry someone who speaks a different language. And this is all rooted in the mythological past, yet the curious thing is in these long houses, where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage, you never hear anyone practicing a language. They simply listen and then begin to speak.Or, one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with, the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador, an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958. In 1957, five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake. They dropped from the air 8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures, forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives. They picked up these photographs from the forest floor, tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure, found nothing, and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil, so they speared the five missionaries to death. But the Waorani didn't just spear outsiders. They speared each other. 54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other. We traced genealogies back eight generations, and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it, they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old, so we speared him anyway. (Laughter) But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing. Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind.In the early '80s, I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti, infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier's strength and Tonton Macoutes, and securing the poison used to make zombies. In order to make sense out of sensation, of course, I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun. And Voodoo is not a black magic cult. On the contrary, it's a complex metaphysical worldview. It's interesting. If I asked you to name the great religions of the world, what would you say? Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, whatever.There's always one continent left out, the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs. Well, of course, they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era. But, what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it's this living relationship between the living and the dead. So, the living give birth to the spirits. The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water, responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living, so that for that brief shining moment, the acolyte becomes the god. That's why the Voodooists like to say that \"You white people go to church and speak about God. We dance in the temple and become God.\" And because you are possessed, you are taken by the spirit \u2014 how can you be harmed? So you see these astonishing demonstrations: Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity, a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation.Now, of all the peoples that I've ever been with, the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia. Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia, in the wake of the conquest, these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain. In a bloodstained continent, these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish. To this day, they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary. The young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four, sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years: two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother's womb; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother. And for this entire time, they are inculturated into the values of their society, values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic \u2014 or we might say the ecological \u2014 balance. And at the end of this amazing initiation, one day they're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18, they see a sunrise. And in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape, suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory. And the priest steps back and says, \"You see? It's really as I've told you. It is that beautiful. It is yours to protect.\" They call themselves the \"elder brothers\" and they say we, who are the younger brothers, are the ones responsible for destroying the world.Now, this level of intuition becomes very important. Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape, we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the \"noble savage,\" which is an idea racist in its simplicity, or alternatively, we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are. Well, indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia. There's not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asmat or in the chilling winds of Tibet, but they have, nevertheless, through time and ritual, forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it, but on a far subtler intuition: the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness.Now, what does that mean? It means that a young kid from the Andes who's raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined. Whether it's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant. What's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world. I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut. That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw and the Crooked Beak of Heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world, spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation.Now, if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities, you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant here. It's a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April. This is ayahuasca, which many of you have heard about, the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman's repertoire. What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation, but the elaboration of it. It's made really of two different sources: on the one hand, this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines, harmine, harmaline, mildly hallucinogenic \u2014 to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness \u2014 but it's mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psychotria viridis. This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines, very close to brain serotonin, dimethyltryptamine, 5-methoxydimethyltryptamine. If you've ever seen the Yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses, that substance they make from a different set of species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine. To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity. (Laughter) It doesn't create the distortion of reality; it creates the dissolution of reality.In fact, I used to argue with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes \u2014 who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s \u2014 I used to argue that you couldn't classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects there's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination. (Laughter)But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they're denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase. They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO. Now, the fascinating things are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine. So you ask yourself a question. How, in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants, do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way, created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts?Well, we use that great euphemism, \"trial and error,\" which is exposed to be meaningless. But you ask the Indians, and they say, \"The plants talk to us.\"Well, what does that mean? This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 varieties of ayahuasca, all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest, all of which are referable to our eye as one species. And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say, \"I thought you knew something about plants. I mean, don't you know anything?\" And I said, \"No.\" Well, it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties in the night of a full moon, and it sings to you in a different key. Now, that's not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard, but it's a lot more interesting than counting stamens. (Laughter)Now \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 the problem \u2014 the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world, meaning our world, moves on. Well, the truth is the 20th century, 300 years from now, is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations, but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet. Now, the problem isn't change. All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life.And the problem is not technology itself. The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and buggy. It's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere. It is power, the crude face of domination. Wherever you look around the world, you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to: whether it's the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan \u2014 a nomadic people from Southeast Asia, from Sarawak \u2014 a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago, and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers, where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away to the South China Sea, where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest \u2014 or, in the case of the Yanomami, it's the disease entities that have come in, in the wake of the discovery of gold.Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research recently, you'll see it's a crude face of political domination. You know, genocide, the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned, but ethnocide, the destruction of people's way of life, is not only not condemned, it's universally, in many quarters, celebrated as part of a development strategy. And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level. I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague, and it was only when I got to Lhasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about: 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes, 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the Cultural Revolution. This young man's father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama. That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion. His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal. His mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy. He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn't bear to be without him. The sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp. One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of Mao, and for that transgression, she was given seven years of hard labor. The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear, but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold.And in the end, then, it really comes down to a choice: do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity? Margaret Mead, the great anthropologist, said, before she died, that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought, but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities.And it's humbling to remember that our species has, perhaps, been around for [150,000] years. The Neolithic Revolution \u2014 which gave us agriculture, at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood; we created hierarchy specialization surplus \u2014 is only 10,000 years ago. The modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old. Now, that shallow history doesn't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia. When these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human, they respond with 10,000 different voices.And it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are: a fully conscious species, fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish. And there are great moments of optimism.This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people, and this man, Olayuk, told me a marvelous story of his grandfather. The Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people, and during the 1950s, to establish our sovereignty, we forced them into settlements. This old man's grandfather refused to go. The family, fearful for his life, took away all of his weapons, all of his tools. Now, you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold; they took advantage of it. The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide. So, this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing. He simply slipped outside, pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand. And as the feces began to freeze, he shaped it into the form of a blade. He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid, he butchered a dog with it. He skinned the dog and improvised a harness, took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled, harnessed up an adjacent dog, and disappeared over the ice floes, shit knife in belt. Talk about getting by with nothing. (Laughter)And this, in many ways \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world. The Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together. It's our new homeland. It's called Nunavut. It's an independent territory. They control all mineral resources. An amazing example of how a nation-state can seek restitution with its people.And finally, in the end, I think it's pretty obvious at least to all of all us who've traveled in these remote reaches of the planet, to realize that they're not remote at all. They're homelands of somebody. They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time. And for all of us, the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our own children, become part of the naked geography of hope.So, what we're trying to do at the National Geographic, finally, is, we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything. We think that polemics \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 we think that polemics are not persuasive, but we think that storytelling can change the world, and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world. We get 35 million hits on our website every month. 156 nations carry our television channel. Our magazines are read by millions. And what we're doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we're going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen, and hopefully, therefore, embrace gradually, one by one, the central revelation of anthropology: that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way, that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural, pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being.Thank you very much.

We all bring our children into the world.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nWe go through initiation rites.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nWe have to deal with the inexorable separation of

00:02:01.958\ncan only fill you with hope.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nNow, together the myriad cultures of the world\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nmake up a web of spiritual life and cultural life\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nthat envelops the planet,\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nand is as important to the well-being of the planet\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nas indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nAnd you might think of this cultural web of life\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nas being an ethnosphere,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nand you might define the ethnosphere\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nas being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams, myths,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nideas, inspirations, intuitions brought into being\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nby the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nThe ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nIt's the symbol of all that we are\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nand all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nAnd just as the biosphere has been severely eroded,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nso too is the ethnosphere\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\n-- and, if anything, at a far greater rate.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nNo biologists, for example, would dare suggest\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nthat 50 percent of all species or more have been or are\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\non the brink of extinction because it simply is not true,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nand yet that -- the most apocalyptic scenario\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nin the realm of biological diversity --\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nscarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nin the realm of cultural diversity.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nAnd the great indicator of that, of course, is language loss.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nWhen each of you in this room were born,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nthere were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nNow, a language is not just a body of vocabulary\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nor a set of grammatical rules.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nA language is a flash of the human spirit.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nIt's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:25.958\ncomes into the material world.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nEvery language is an old-growth forest of the mind,\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:32.958\na watershed, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd of those 6,000 languages, as we sit here today in Monterey,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nfully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nThey're no longer being taught to babies,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nwhich means, effectively, unless something changes,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nthey're already dead.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nWhat could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nto be the last of your people to speak your language,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nto have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nor anticipate the promise of the children?\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nAnd yet, that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nsomewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nbecause every two weeks, some elder dies\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nand carries with him into the grave the last syllables\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nof an ancient tongue.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nAnd I know there's some of you who say, \"Well, wouldn't it be better,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nwouldn't the world be a better place\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nif we all just spoke one language?\" And I say, \"Great,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nlet's make that language

(Laughter)\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nBut at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nof the forest that was astonishing.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nTheir hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nand tell you what species left it behind.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nIn the early '80s, I had a really astonishing assignment\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nwhen I was asked by my professor at Harvard\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nif I was interested in going down to Haiti,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\ninfiltrating the secret societies\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nwhich were the foundation of Duvalier's strength\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nand Tonton Macoutes,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nand securing the poison used to make zombies.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nIn order to make sense out of sensation, of course,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nI had to understand something about this remarkable faith\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nof Vodoun. And Voodoo is not a black magic cult.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nOn the contrary, it's a complex metaphysical worldview.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nIt's interesting.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nIf I asked you to name the great religions of the world,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nwhat would you say?\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nChristianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, whatever.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nThere's always one continent left out,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nthe assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nhad no religious beliefs. Well, of course, they did\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nand Voodoo is simply the distillation\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nof these very profound religious ideas\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nthat came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nBut, what makes Voodoo so interesting\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nis that it's this living relationship\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nbetween the living and the dead.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nSo, the living give birth to the spirits.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nThe spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nresponding to the rhythm of the dance\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nto momentarily displace the soul of the living,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nso that for that brief shining moment, the acolyte becomes the god.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nThat's why the Voodooists like to say\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nthat \"You white people go to church and speak about God.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nWe dance in the temple and become God.\"\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nAnd because you are possessed, you are taken by the spirit --\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nhow can you be harmed?\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nSo you see these astonishing demonstrations:\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nVoodoo acolytes in a state of trance\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nhandling burning embers with impunity,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\na rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nto affect the body that bears it\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nwhen catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nNow, of all the peoples that I've ever been with,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nthe most extraordinary are the Kogi\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nof the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nDescendants of the ancient Tairona civilization\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nwhich once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nin the wake of the conquest,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nthese people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nthat soars above the Caribbean coastal plain.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nIn a bloodstained continent,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nthese people alone were never conquered by the Spanish.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nTo this day, they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nbut the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nThe young acolytes are taken away from their families\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nat the age of three and four,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nsequestered in a shadowy world of darkness\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nin stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years:\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:48.958\ntwo nine-year periods\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\ndeliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nthey spend in their natural mother's womb;\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nnow they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nAnd for this entire time,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nthey are inculturated into the values of their society,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nvalues that maintain the proposition that their prayers\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nand their prayers alone maintain the cosmic --\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nor we might say the ecological -- balance.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nAnd at the end of this amazing initiation,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\none day they're suddenly taken out\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nand for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nthey see a sunrise.

(Laughter)\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nIt doesn't create the distortion of reality;\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nit creates the dissolution of reality.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nIn fact, I used to argue with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes --\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nwho is a man who sparked the psychedelic era\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nwith his discovery of the magic mushrooms\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nin Mexico in the 1930s --\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nI used to argue that you couldn't classify these tryptamines\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nas hallucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nthere's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination. (Laughter)\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nBut the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nbecause they're denatured by an enzyme\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nfound naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nThey can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nwith some other chemical that denatures the MAO.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nNow, the fascinating things\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nare that the beta-carbolines found within that liana\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nare MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nto potentiate the tryptamine. So you ask yourself a question.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nHow, in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:27.958\ndo these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nthat when combined in this way,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\ncreated a kind of biochemical version\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nof the whole being greater than the sum of the parts?\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nWell, we use that great euphemism, \"trial and error,\"\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nwhich is exposed to be meaningless.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nBut you ask the Indians, and they say, \"The plants talk to us.\"\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nWell, what does that mean?\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nThis tribe, the Cofan, has 17 varieties of ayahuasca,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nall of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nall of which are referable to our eye as one species.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nAnd then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nand they say, \"I thought you knew something about plants.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nI mean, don't you know anything?\" And I said, \"No.\"\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nWell, it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nin the night of a full moon, and it sings to you in a different key.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nNow, that's not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nbut it's a lot more interesting than counting stamens. (Laughter)\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nNow --\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\n(Applause) --\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nthe problem -- the problem is that even those of us\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nsympathetic with the plight of indigenous people\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nview them as quaint and colorful\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nbut somehow reduced to the margins of history\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nas the real world, meaning our world, moves on.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nWell, the truth is the 20th century, 300 years from now,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nis not going to be remembered for its wars\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nor its technological innovations,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nbut rather as the era in which we stood by\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nand either actively endorsed or passively accepted\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nthe massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\non the planet. Now, the problem isn't change.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nAll cultures through all time\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nhave constantly been engaged in a dance\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nwith new possibilities of life.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nAnd the problem is not technology itself.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nThe Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nwhen they gave up the bow and arrow\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nany more than an American stopped being an American\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nwhen he gave up the horse and buggy.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nIt's not change or technology\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nthat threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere. It is power,\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nthe crude face of domination.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nWherever you look around the world,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nyou discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away;\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nthese are dynamic living peoples\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nbeing driven out of existence by identifiable forces\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nthat are beyond their capacity to adapt to:\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nwhether it's the egregious deforestation\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nin the homeland of the Penan --\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\na nomadic people from Southeast Asia, from Sarawak --\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:31.958\na people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago,\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nand now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\non the banks of the rivers,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nwhere you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nthat seems to be carrying half of Borneo away\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nto the South China Sea,\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nwhere the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest --\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nor, in the case of the Yanomami,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nit's the disease entities that have come in,\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nin the wake of the discovery of gold.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nOr if we go into the mountains of Tibet,\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nwhere I'm doing a lot of research recently,\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nyou'll see it's a crude face of political domination.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nYou know, genocide, the physical extinction of a people\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nis universally condemned, but ethnocide,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nthe destruction of people's way of life, is not only not condemned,\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nit's universally, in many quarters, celebrated\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nas part of a development strategy.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nAnd you cannot understand the pain of Tibet\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nuntil you move through it at the ground level.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nI once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:27.958\noverland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nwith a young colleague, and it was only when I got to Lhasa\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nthat I understood the face behind the statistics\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nyou hear about:\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:39.958\n6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes,\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.958\n1.2 million people killed by the cadres\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nduring the Cultural Revolution.\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nThis young man's father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nThat meant he was instantly killed\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nat the time of the Chinese invasion.\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nHis uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nthat took the people to Nepal.\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nHis mother was incarcerated\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nfor the crime of being wealthy.\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nHe was smuggled into the jail at the age of two\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nto hide beneath her skirt tails\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nbecause she couldn't bear to be without him.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nThe sister who had done that brave deed\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nwas put into an education camp.\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nOne day she inadvertently stepped on an armband\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nof Mao, and for that transgression,\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nshe was given seven years of hard labor.\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nThe pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear,\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nbut the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nAnd in the end, then, it really comes down to a choice:\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:30.958\ndo we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nor do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity?\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nMargaret Mead, the great anthropologist, said, before she died,\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nthat her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nthis blandly amorphous generic world view\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nnot only would we see the entire range of the human imagination\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nreduced to a more narrow modality of thought,\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nbut that we would wake from a dream one day\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nhaving forgotten there were even other possibilities.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nAnd it's humbling to remember that our species has, perhaps,\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nbeen around for [150,000] years.\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nThe Neolithic Revolution -- which gave us agriculture,\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nat which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed;\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nthe poetry of the shaman was displaced\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nby the prose of the priesthood;\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nwe created hierarchy specialization surplus --\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nis only 10,000 years ago.\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:15.958\nThe modern industrial world as we know it\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nis barely 300 years old.\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nNow, that shallow history doesn't suggest to me\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nthat we have all the answers for all of the challenges\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nthat will confront us in the ensuing millennia.\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nWhen these myriad cultures of the world\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nare asked the meaning of being human,\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:31.958\nthey respond with 10,000 different voices.\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nAnd it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nof being what we are: a fully conscious species,\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nfully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nfind a way to flourish. And there are great moments of optimism.\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:52.958\nThis is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island\n\n00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nwhen I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people,\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nand this man, Olayuk, told me a marvelous story of his grandfather.\n\n00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nThe Canadian government has not always been kind\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:03.958\nto the Inuit people, and during the 1950s,\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nto establish our sovereignty, we forced them into settlements.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:10.958\nThis old man's grandfather refused to go.\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nThe family, fearful for his life, took away all of his weapons,\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:15.958\nall of his tools.\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nNow, you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold;\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:19.958\nthey took advantage of it.\n\n00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:22.958\nThe runners of their sleds were originally made of fish\n\n00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:23.958\nwrapped in caribou hide.\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nSo, this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:30.958\nor the blizzard that was blowing.\n\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:33.958\nHe simply slipped outside, pulled down his sealskin trousers\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:37.958\nand defecated into his hand. And as the feces began to freeze,\n\n00:19:37.958 --> 00:19:40.958\nhe shaped it into the form of a blade.\n\n00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:42.958\nHe put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:45.958\nand as it finally froze solid, he butchered a dog with it.\n\n00:19:45.958 --> 00:19:48.958\nHe skinned the dog and improvised a harness,\n\n00:19:48.958 --> 00:19:51.958\ntook the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled,\n\n00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:53.958\nharnessed up an adjacent dog,\n\n00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:57.958\nand disappeared over the ice floes, shit knife in belt.\n\n00:19:57.958 --> 00:20:01.958\nTalk about getting by with nothing. (Laughter)\n\n00:20:01.958 --> 00:20:02.958\nAnd this, in many ways --\n\n00:20:02.958 --> 00:20:04.958\n(Applause) --\n\n00:20:04.958 --> 00:20:06.958\nis a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people\n\n00:20:06.958 --> 00:20:09.958\nand of all indigenous people around the world.\n\n00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:11.958\nThe Canadian government in April of 1999\n\n00:20:11.958 --> 00:20:14.958\ngave back to total control of the Inuit\n\n00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:17.958\nan area of land larger than California and Texas put together.\n\n00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:19.958\nIt's our new homeland. It's called Nunavut.\n\n00:20:20.958 --> 00:20:23.958\nIt's an independent territory. They control all mineral resources.\n\n00:20:23.958 --> 00:20:25.958\nAn amazing example of how a nation-state\n\n00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:29.958\ncan seek restitution with its people.\n\n00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:33.958\nAnd finally, in the end, I think it's pretty obvious\n\n00:20:33.958 --> 00:20:34.958\nat least to all of all us who've traveled\n\n00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:36.958\nin these remote reaches of the planet,\n\n00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:39.958\nto realize that they're not remote at all.\n\n00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:41.958\nThey're homelands of somebody.\n\n00:20:41.958 --> 00:20:43.958\nThey represent branches of the human imagination\n\n00:20:43.958 --> 00:20:47.958\nthat go back to the dawn of time. And for all of us,\n\n00:20:47.958 --> 00:20:50.958\nthe dreams of these children, like the dreams of our own children,\n\n00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:53.958\nbecome part of the naked geography of hope.\n\n00:20:53.958 --> 00:20:57.958\nSo, what we're trying to do at the National Geographic, finally,\n\n00:20:57.958 --> 00:21:01.958\nis, we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything.\n\n00:21:01.958 --> 00:21:02.958\nWe think that polemics --\n\n00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:04.958\n(Applause) --\n\n00:21:04.958 --> 00:21:06.958\nwe think that polemics are not persuasive,\n\n00:21:06.958 --> 00:21:09.958\nbut we think that storytelling can change the world,\n\n00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:12.958\nand so we are probably the best storytelling institution\n\n00:21:12.958 --> 00:21:15.958\nin the world. We get 35 million hits on our website every month.\n\n00:21:15.958 --> 00:21:18.958\n156 nations carry our television channel.\n\n00:21:19.958 --> 00:21:21.958\nOur magazines are read by millions.\n\n00:21:21.958 --> 00:21:24.958\nAnd what we're doing is a series of journeys\n\n00:21:24.958 --> 00:21:26.958\nto the ethnosphere where we're going to take our audience\n\n00:21:26.958 --> 00:21:28.958\nto places of such cultural wonder\n\n00:21:29.958 --> 00:21:31.958\nthat they cannot help but come away dazzled\n\n00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:33.958\nby what they have seen, and hopefully, therefore,\n\n00:21:33.958 --> 00:21:36.958\nembrace gradually, one by one,\n\n00:21:36.958 --> 00:21:38.958\nthe central revelation of anthropology:\n\n00:21:38.958 --> 00:21:42.958\nthat this world deserves to exist in a diverse way,\n\n00:21:42.958 --> 00:21:43.958\nthat we can find a way to live\n\n00:21:43.958 --> 00:21:46.958\nin a truly multicultural, pluralistic world\n\n00:21:46.958 --> 00:21:48.958\nwhere all of the wisdom of all peoples\n\n00:21:48.958 --> 00:21:51.958\ncan contribute to our collective well-being.\n\n00:21:51.958 --> 00:21:52.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:54.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Photos of endangered cultures", "duration": "1115", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/phil_borges_on_endangered_cultures", "transcript": "A fact came out of MIT, couple of years ago. Ken Hale, who's a linguist, said that of the 6,000 languages spoken on Earth right now, 3,000 aren't spoken by the children. So that in one generation, we're going to halve our cultural diversity. He went on to say that every two weeks, an elder goes to the grave carrying the last spoken word of that culture. So an entire philosophy, a body of knowledge about the natural world that had been empirically gleaned over centuries, goes away. And this happens every two weeks.So for the last 20 years, since my dental experience, I have been traveling the world and coming back with stories about some of these people. What I'd like to do right now is share some of those stories with you. This is Tamdin. She is a 69-year-old nun. She was thrown in prison in Tibet for two years for putting up a little tiny placard protesting the occupation of her country. And when I met her, she had just taken a walk over the Himalayas from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, into Nepal, across to India \u2014 30 days \u2014 to meet her leader, the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama lives in Dharamsala, India. So I took this picture three days after she arrived, and she had this beat-up pair of tennis shoes on, with her toes sticking out. And she crossed in March, and there's a lot of snow at 18,500 feet in March.This is Paldin. Paldin is a 62-year-old monk. And he spent 33 years in prison. His whole monastery was thrown into prison at the time of the uprising, when the Dalai Lama had to leave Tibet. And he was beaten, starved, tortured \u2014 lost all his teeth while in prison. And when I met him, he was a kind gentle old man. And it really impressed me \u2014 I met him two weeks after he got out of prison \u2014 that he went through that experience, and ended up with the demeanor that he had.So I was in Dharamsala meeting these people, and I'd spent about five weeks there, and I was hearing these similar stories of these refugees that had poured out of Tibet into Dharamsala. And it just so happened, on the fifth week, there was a public teaching by the Dalai Lama. And I was watching this crowd of monks and nuns, many of which I had just interviewed, and heard their stories, and I watched their faces, and they gave us a little FM radio, and we could listen to the translation of his teachings. And what he said was: treat your enemies as if they were precious jewels, because it's your enemies that build your tolerance and patience on the road to your enlightenment. That hit me so hard, telling these people that had been through this experience.So, two months later, I went into Tibet, and I started interviewing the people there, taking my photographs. That's what I do. I interview and do portraits. And this is a little girl. I took her portrait up on top of the Jokhang Temple. And I'd snuck in \u2014 because it's totally illegal to have a picture of the Dalai Lama in Tibet \u2014 it's the quickest way you can get arrested. So I snuck in a bunch of little wallet-sized pictures of the Dalai Lama, and I would hand them out. And when I gave them to the people, they'd either hold them to their heart, or they'd hold them up to their head and just stay there. And this is \u2014 well, at the time \u2014 I did this 10 years ago \u2014 that was 36 years after the Dalai Lama had left.So I was going in, interviewing these people and doing their portraits. This is Jigme and her sister, Sonam. And they live up on the Chang Tang, the Tibetan Plateau, way in the western part of the country. This is at 17,000 feet. And they had just come down from the high pastures, at 18,000 feet. Same thing: gave her a picture, she held it up to her forehead. And I usually hand out Polaroids when I do these, because I'm setting up lights, and checking my lights, and when I showed her her Polaroid, she screamed and ran into her tent.This is Tenzin Gyatso; he was found to be the Buddha of Compassion at the age of two, out in a peasant's house, way out in the middle of nowhere. At the age of four, he was installed as the 14th Dalai Lama. As a teenager, he faced the invasion of his country, and had to deal with it \u2014 he was the leader of the country. Eight years later, when they discovered there was a plot to kill him, they dressed him up like a beggar and snuck him out of the country on horseback, and took the same trip that Tamdin did. And he's never been back to his country since. And if you think about this man, 46 years later, still sticking to this non-violent response to a severe political and human rights issue. And the young people, young Tibetans, are starting to say, listen, this doesn't work. You know, violence as a political tool is all the rage right now. And he still is holding this line. So this is our icon to non-violence in our world \u2014 one of our living icons.This is another leader of his people. This is Moi. This is in the Ecuadorian Amazon. And Moi is 35 years old. And this area of the Ecuadorian Amazon \u2014 oil was discovered in 1972. And in this period of time \u2014 since that time \u2014 as much oil, or twice as much oil as was spilled in the Exxon Valdez accident, was spilled in this little area of the Amazon, and the tribes in this area have constantly had to move. And Moi belongs to the Huaorani tribe, and they're known as very fierce, they're known as \"auca.\" And they've managed to keep out the seismologists and the oil workers with spears and blowguns. And we spent \u2014 I was with a team \u2014 two weeks with these guys out in the jungle watching them hunt. This was on a monkey hunt, hunting with curare-tipped darts. And the knowledge that these people have about the natural environment is incredible. They could hear things, smell things, see things I couldn't see. And I couldn't even see the monkeys that they were getting with these darts.This is Yadira, and Yadira is five years old. She's in a tribe that's neighboring the Huaorani. And her tribe has had to move three times in the last 10 years because of the oil spills. And we never hear about that. And the latest infraction against these people is, as part of Plan Colombia, we're spraying Paraquat or Round Up, whatever it is \u2014 we're defoliating thousands of acres of the Ecuadorian Amazon in our war on drugs. And these people are the people who take the brunt of it.This is Mengatoue. He's the shaman of the Huaorani, and he said to us, you know, I'm an older man now; I'm getting tired, you know; I'm tired of spearing these oil workers. I wish they would just go away. And I was \u2014 I usually travel alone when I do my work, but I did this \u2014 I hosted a program for Discovery, and when I went down with the team, I was quite concerned about going in with a whole bunch of people, especially into the Huaorani, deep into the Huaorani tribe. And as it turned out, these guys really taught me a thing or two about blending in with the locals. (Laughter)One of the things I did just before 9/11 \u2014 August of 2001 \u2014 I took my son, Dax, who was 16 at the time, and I took him to Pakistan. Because at first I wanted \u2014 you know, I've taken him on a couple of trips, but I wanted him to see people that live on a dollar a day or less. I wanted him to get an experience in the Islamic world and I also wanted him to \u2014 I was going there to work with a group, do a story on a group called the Kalash, that are a group of animists, 3,000 animists, that live \u2014 very small area \u2014 surrounded by Islam \u2014 there's 3,000 of these Kalash left; they're incredible people. So it was a great experience for him. He stayed up all night with them, drumming and dancing. And he brought a soccer ball, and we had soccer every night in this little village.And then we went up and met their shaman. By the way, Mengatoue was the shaman of his tribe as well. And this is John Doolikahn, who's the shaman of the Kalash. And he's up in the mountains, right on the border with Afghanistan. In fact, on that other side is the area, Tora Bora, the area where Osama bin Laden's supposed to be. This is the tribal area. And we watched and stayed with John Doolikahn. And the shaman \u2014 I did a whole series on shamanism, which is an interesting phenomenon. But around the world, they go into trance in different ways, and in Pakistan, the way they do it is they burn juniper leaves and they sacrifice an animal, pour the blood of the animal on the leaves and then inhale the smoke. And they're all praying to the mountain gods as they go into trance.You know, getting kids used to different realities, I think, is so important. What Dan Dennett said the other day \u2014 having a curriculum where they study different religions, just to make a mental flexibility, give them a mental flexibility in different belief systems \u2014 I think this is so necessary in our world today as you see these clash of beliefs taking place. And all the security issues they cause us. So, one thing we did five years ago: we started a program that links kids in indigenous communities with kids in the United States. So we first hooked up a spot in the Navajo Nation with a classroom in Seattle. We now have 15 sites. We have one in Kathmandu, Nepal; Dharamsala, India; Takaungu, Kenya \u2014 Takaungu is one-third Christian, one-third Muslim and one-third animist, the community is \u2014 Ollantaytambo, Peru, and Arctic Village, Alaska.This is Daniel; he's one of our students in Arctic Village, Alaska. He lives in this log cabin \u2014 no running water, no heat other than \u2014 no windows and high-speed Internet connection. And this is \u2014 I see this rolling out all over \u2014 this is our site in Ollantaytambo, Peru, four years ago, where they first saw their first computers; now they have computers in their classrooms. And the way we've done this \u2014 we teach digital storytelling to these kids. And we have them tell stories about issues in their community in their community that they care about. And this is in Peru, where the kids told the story about a river that they cleaned up. And the way we do it is, we do it in workshops, and we bring people who want to learn digital workflow and storytelling, and have them work with the kids. And just this last year we've taken a group of teenagers in, and this has worked the best. So our dream is to bring teenagers together, so they'll have a community service experience as well as a cross-cultural experience, as they teach kids in these areas and help them build their communication infrastructure.This is teaching Photoshop in the Tibetan children's village in Dharamsala. We have the website, where the kids all get their homepage. This is all their movies. We've got about 60 movies that these kids have made, and they're quite incredible. The one I want to show you \u2014 after we get them to make the movies, we have a night where we show the movies to the community. And this is in Takaungu \u2014 we've got a generator and a digital projector, and we're projecting it up against a barn, and showing one of the movies that they made. And if you get a chance, you can go to our website, and you'll see the incredible work these kids do.The other thing: I wanted to give indigenous people a voice. That was one of the big motivating factors. But the other motivating factor is the insular nature of our country. National Geographic just did a Roper Study of 18 to 26 year olds in our country and in nine other industrialized countries. It was a two million dollar study. United States came in second to last in geographic knowledge. 70 percent of the kids couldn't find Afghanistan or Iraq on a map; 60 percent couldn't find India; 30 percent couldn't find the Pacific Ocean. And this is a study that was just done a couple of years ago.So what I'd like to show you now, in the couple of minutes I have left, is a film that a student made in Guatemala. We just had a workshop in Guatemala. A week before we got to the workshop, a massive landslide, caused by Hurricane Stan, last October, came in and buried 600 people alive in their village. And this kid lived in the village \u2014 he wasn't there at the time \u2014 and this is the little movie he put together about that. And he hadn't seen a computer before we did this movie. We taught him Photoshop and \u2014 yeah, we can play it.This is an old Mayan funeral chant that he got from his grandfather.Thank you very much.

The odd one out is an astronomer, and I am one of that strange breed. (Laughter) My talk will be in two parts. I'll talk first as an astronomer, and then as a worried member of the human race. But let's start off by remembering that Darwin showed how we're the outcome of four billion years of evolution. And what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology is to go back before Darwin's simple beginning, to set our Earth in a cosmic context.And let me just run through a few slides. This was the impact that happened last week on a comet. If they'd sent a nuke, it would have been rather more spectacular than what actually happened last Monday. So that's another project for NASA. That's Mars from the European Mars Express, and at New Year. This artist's impression turned into reality when a parachute landed on Titan, Saturn's giant moon. It landed on the surface. This is pictures taken on the way down. That looks like a coastline. It is indeed, but the ocean is liquid methane \u2014 the temperature minus 170 degrees centigrade. If we go beyond our solar system, we've learned that the stars aren't twinkly points of light. Each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it. And we can see places where stars are forming, like the Eagle Nebula. We see stars dying. In six billion years, the sun will look like that. And some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion, leaving remnants like that.On a still bigger scale, we see entire galaxies of stars. We see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled. And to the cosmologist, these galaxies are just the atoms, as it were, of the large-scale universe. This picture shows a patch of sky so small that it would take about 100 patches like it to cover the full moon in the sky. Through a small telescope, this would look quite blank, but you see here hundreds of little, faint smudges. Each is a galaxy, fully like ours or Andromeda, which looks so small and faint because its light has taken 10 billion light-years to get to us. The stars in those galaxies probably don't have planets around them. There's scant chance of life there \u2014 that's because there's been no time for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron, the building blocks of planets and of life. We believe that all of this emerged from a Big Bang \u2014 a hot, dense state. So how did that amorphous Big Bang turn into our complex cosmos?I'm going to show you a movie simulation 16 powers of 10 faster than real time, which shows a patch of the universe where the expansions have subtracted out. But you see, as time goes on in gigayears at the bottom, you will see structures evolve as gravity feeds on small, dense irregularities, and structures develop. And we'll end up after 13 billion years with something looking rather like our own universe. And we compare simulated universes like that \u2014 I'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk \u2014 with what we actually see in the sky. Well, we can trace things back to the earlier stages of the Big Bang, but we still don't know what banged and why it banged.That's a challenge for 21st-century science. If my research group had a logo, it would be this picture here: an ouroboros, where you see the micro-world on the left \u2014 the world of the quantum \u2014 and on the right the large-scale universe of planets, stars and galaxies. We know our universes are united though \u2014 links between left and right. The everyday world is determined by atoms, how they stick together to make molecules. Stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together. And, as we've learned in the last few years, galaxies are held together by the gravitational pull of so-called dark matter: particles in huge swarms, far smaller even than atomic nuclei. But we'd like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top. The micro-world of the quantum is understood. On the right hand side, gravity holds sway. Einstein explained that. But the unfinished business for 21st-century science is to link together cosmos and micro-world with a unified theory \u2014 symbolized, as it were, gastronomically at the top of that picture. (Laughter) And until we have that synthesis, we won't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe because when our universe was itself the size of an atom, quantum effects could shake everything.And so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small, which we don't yet have. One idea, incidentally \u2014 and I had this hazard sign to say I'm going to speculate from now on \u2014 is that our Big Bang was not the only one. One idea is that our three-dimensional universe may be embedded in a high-dimensional space, just as you can imagine on these sheets of paper. You can imagine ants on one of them thinking it's a two-dimensional universe, not being aware of another population of ants on the other. So there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours, but we're not aware of it because that millimeter is measured in some fourth spatial dimension, and we're imprisoned in our three. And so we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality than what we've normally called our universe \u2014 the aftermath of our Big Bang. And here's another picture. Bottom right depicts our universe, which on the horizon is not beyond that, but even that is just one bubble, as it were, in some vaster reality. Many people suspect that just as we've gone from believing in one solar system to zillions of solar systems, one galaxy to many galaxies, we have to go to many Big Bangs from one Big Bang, perhaps these many Big Bangs displaying an immense variety of properties.Well, let's go back to this picture. There's one challenge symbolized at the top, but there's another challenge to science symbolized at the bottom. You want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small, but we want to understand the very complex. And the most complex things are ourselves, midway between atoms and stars. We depend on stars to make the atoms we're made of. We depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure. We clearly have to be large, compared to atoms, to have layer upon layer of complex structure. We clearly have to be small, compared to stars and planets \u2014 otherwise we'd be crushed by gravity. And in fact, we are midway. It would take as many human bodies to make up the sun as there are atoms in each of us. The geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms, within a factor of two of the mass of each person here. Well, most of you anyway. The science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all, greater than that of the very small on the left and the very large on the right. And it's this science, which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world, but also transforming our world faster than ever. And more than that, it's engendering new kinds of change.And I now move on to the second part of my talk, and the book \"Our Final Century\" was mentioned. If I was not a self-effacing Brit, I would mention the book myself, and I would add that it's available in paperback.(Laughter)And in America it was called \"Our Final Hour\" because Americans like instant gratification.(Laughter)But my theme is that in this century, not only has science changed the world faster than ever, but in new and different ways. Targeted drugs, genetic modification, artificial intelligence, perhaps even implants into our brains, may change human beings themselves. And human beings, their physique and character, has not changed for thousands of years. It may change this century. It's new in our history. And the human impact on the global environment \u2014 greenhouse warming, mass extinctions and so forth \u2014 is unprecedented, too. And so, this makes this coming century a challenge. Bio- and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign in that they offer marvelous prospects, while, nonetheless, reducing pressure on energy and resources. But they will have a dark side. In our interconnected world, novel technology could empower just one fanatic, or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses, to trigger some kind on disaster. Indeed, catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure \u2014 error rather than terror. And even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable when the downside could be of global consequence.In fact, some years ago, Bill Joy wrote an article expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over, etc. I don't go along with all that, but it's interesting that he had a simple solution. It was what he called \"fine-grained relinquishment.\" He wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science and keep the good bits. Now, that's absurdly naive for two reasons. First, any scientific discovery has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones. And also, when a scientist makes a discovery, he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be. And so what this means is that we have to accept the risks if we are going to enjoy the benefits of science. We have to accept that there will be hazards. And I think we have to go back to what happened in the post-War era, post-World War II, when the nuclear scientists who'd been involved in making the atomic bomb, in many cases were concerned that they should do all they could to alert the world to the dangers.And they were inspired not by the young Einstein, who did the great work in relativity, but by the old Einstein, the icon of poster and t-shirt, who failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws. He was premature. But he was a moral compass \u2014 an inspiration to scientists who were concerned with arms control. And perhaps the greatest living person is someone I'm privileged to know, Joe Rothblatt. Equally untidy office there, as you can see. He's 96 years old, and he founded the Pugwash movement. He persuaded Einstein, as his last act, to sign the famous memorandum of Bertrand Russell. And he sets an example of the concerned scientist. And I think to harness science optimally, to choose which doors to open and which to leave closed, we need latter-day counterparts of people like Joseph Rothblatt.We need not just campaigning physicists, but we need biologists, computer experts and environmentalists as well. And I think academics and independent entrepreneurs have a special obligation because they have more freedom than those in government service, or company employees subject to commercial pressure. I wrote my book, \"Our Final Century,\" as a scientist, just a general scientist. But there's one respect, I think, in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective, and that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future. The stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture \u2014 outside the American Bible Belt, anyway \u2014 (Laughter) but most people, even those who are familiar with evolution, aren't mindful that even more time lies ahead.The sun has been shining for four and a half billion years, but it'll be another six billion years before its fuel runs out. On that schematic picture, a sort of time-lapse picture, we're halfway. And it'll be another six billion before that happens, and any remaining life on Earth is vaporized. There's an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there, experiencing the sun's demise, but any life and intelligence that exists then will be as different from us as we are from bacteria. The unfolding of intelligence and complexity still has immensely far to go, here on Earth and probably far beyond. So we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity in our Earth and beyond. If you represent the Earth's lifetime by a single year, say from January when it was made to December, the 21st-century would be a quarter of a second in June \u2014 a tiny fraction of the year. But even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective, our century is very, very special, the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet.As I should have shown this earlier, it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun; it will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria. When Einstein died in 1955, one striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon by Herblock in the Washington Post. The plaque reads, \"Albert Einstein lived here.\" And I'd like to end with a vignette, as it were, inspired by this image. We've been familiar for 40 years with this image: the fragile beauty of land, ocean and clouds, contrasted with the sterile moonscape on which the astronauts left their footprints. But let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar, not just for 40 years, but for the entire 4.5 billion-year history of our Earth. What would they have seen? Over nearly all that immense time, Earth's appearance would have changed very gradually. The only abrupt worldwide change would have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super-eruptions. Apart from those brief traumas, nothing happens suddenly.The continental landmasses drifted around. Ice cover waxed and waned. Successions of new species emerged, evolved and became extinct. But in just a tiny sliver of the Earth's history, the last one-millionth part, a few thousand years, the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before. This signaled the start of agriculture. Change has accelerated as human populations rose. Then other things happened even more abruptly. Within just 50 years \u2014 that's one hundredth of one millionth of the Earth's age \u2014 the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise, and ominously fast.The planet became an intense emitter of radio waves \u2014 the total output from all TV and cell phones and radar transmissions. And something else happened. Metallic objects \u2014 albeit very small ones, a few tons at most \u2014 escaped into orbit around the Earth. Some journeyed to the moons and planets. A race of advanced extraterrestrials watching our solar system from afar could confidently predict Earth's final doom in another six billion years. But could they have predicted this unprecedented spike less than halfway through the Earth's life? These human-induced alterations occupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime and seemingly occurring with runaway speed? If they continued their vigil, what might these hypothetical aliens witness in the next hundred years? Will some spasm foreclose Earth's future? Or will the biosphere stabilize? Or will some of the metallic objects launched from the Earth spawn new oases, a post-human life elsewhere?The science done by the young Einstein will continue as long as our civilization, but for civilization to survive, we'll need the wisdom of the old Einstein \u2014 humane, global and farseeing. And whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century will resonate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the Earth, far beyond the Earth as depicted here.

We see stars dying.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nIn six billion years, the sun will look like that.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nAnd some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nleaving remnants like that.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nOn a still bigger scale, we see entire galaxies of stars.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nWe see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nAnd to the cosmologist,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nthese galaxies are just the atoms, as it were, of the large-scale universe.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nThis picture shows a patch of sky\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nso small that it would take about 100 patches like it\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nto cover the full moon in the sky.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nThrough a small telescope, this would look quite blank,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nbut you see here hundreds of little, faint smudges.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nEach is a galaxy, fully like ours or Andromeda,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nwhich looks so small and faint because its light\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nhas taken 10 billion light-years to get to us.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nThe stars in those galaxies probably don't have planets around them.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThere's scant chance of life there -- that's because there's been no time\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nfor the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nthe building blocks of planets and of life.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nWe believe that all of this emerged from a Big Bang --\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:11.958\na hot, dense state.

And here's another picture.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nBottom right depicts our universe,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nwhich on the horizon is not beyond that,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nbut even that is just one bubble, as it were, in some vaster reality.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nMany people suspect that just as we've gone from believing\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nin one solar system to zillions of solar systems,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\none galaxy to many galaxies,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nwe have to go to many Big Bangs from one Big Bang,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nperhaps these many Big Bangs displaying\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nan immense variety of properties.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nWell, let's go back to this picture.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nThere's one challenge symbolized at the top,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nbut there's another challenge to science symbolized at the bottom.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nYou want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nbut we want to understand the very complex.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nAnd the most complex things are ourselves,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nmidway between atoms and stars.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nWe depend on stars to make the atoms we're made of.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nWe depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nWe clearly have to be large, compared to atoms,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nto have layer upon layer of complex structure.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nWe clearly have to be small, compared to stars and planets --\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:21.958\notherwise we'd be crushed by gravity. And in fact, we are midway.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nIt would take as many human bodies to make up the sun\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nas there are atoms in each of us.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nThe geometric mean of the mass of a proton\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nand the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nwithin a factor of two of the mass of each person here.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nWell, most of you anyway.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nThe science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\ngreater than that of the very small on the left\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nand the very large on the right.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd it's this science,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nwhich is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nbut also transforming our world faster than ever.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nAnd more than that, it's engendering new kinds of change.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nAnd I now move on to the second part of my talk,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nand the book \"Our Final Century\" was mentioned.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nIf I was not a self-effacing Brit, I would mention the book myself,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nand I would add that it's available in paperback.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nAnd in America it was called \"Our Final Hour\"\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nbecause Americans like instant gratification.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nBut my theme is that in this century,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nnot only has science changed the world faster than ever,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nbut in new and different ways.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nTargeted drugs, genetic modification, artificial intelligence,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nperhaps even implants into our brains,\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nmay change human beings themselves. And human beings,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.958\ntheir physique and character, has not changed for thousands of years.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nIt may change this century.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nIt's new in our history.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nAnd the human impact on the global environment -- greenhouse warming,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nmass extinctions and so forth -- is unprecedented, too.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nAnd so, this makes this coming century a challenge.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nBio- and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nin that they offer marvelous prospects,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nwhile, nonetheless, reducing pressure on energy and resources.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nBut they will have a dark side.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nIn our interconnected world, novel technology could empower\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\njust one fanatic,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nor some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nto trigger some kind on disaster.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nIndeed, catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure --\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nerror rather than terror.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nAnd even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nwhen the downside could be of global consequence.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nIn fact, some years ago, Bill Joy wrote an article\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nexpressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over, etc.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nI don't go along with all that,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nbut it's interesting that he had a simple solution.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nIt was what he called \"fine-grained relinquishment.\"\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nHe wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nand keep the good bits. Now, that's absurdly naive for two reasons.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nFirst, any scientific discovery has benign consequences\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nas well as dangerous ones.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nAnd also, when a scientist makes a discovery,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nhe or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nAnd so what this means is that we have to accept the risks\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nif we are going to enjoy the benefits of science.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nWe have to accept that there will be hazards.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nAnd I think we have to go back to what happened in the post-War era,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\npost-World War II, when the nuclear scientists\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nwho'd been involved in making the atomic bomb,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nin many cases were concerned that they should do all they could\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nto alert the world to the dangers.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nAnd they were inspired not by the young Einstein,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nwho did the great work in relativity, but by the old Einstein,\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nthe icon of poster and t-shirt,\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nwho failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nHe was premature. But he was a moral compass --\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nan inspiration to scientists who were concerned with arms control.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nAnd perhaps the greatest living person\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nis someone I'm privileged to know, Joe Rothblatt.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nEqually untidy office there, as you can see.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nHe's 96 years old, and he founded the Pugwash movement.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nHe persuaded Einstein, as his last act,\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nto sign the famous memorandum of Bertrand Russell.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nAnd he sets an example of the concerned scientist.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nAnd I think to harness science optimally,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nto choose which doors to open and which to leave closed,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nwe need latter-day counterparts of people like Joseph Rothblatt.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nWe need not just campaigning physicists,\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nbut we need biologists, computer experts\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nand environmentalists as well.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nAnd I think academics and independent entrepreneurs\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nhave a special obligation because they have more freedom\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nthan those in government service,\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nor company employees subject to commercial pressure.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nI wrote my book, \"Our Final Century,\" as a scientist,\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\njust a general scientist. But there's one respect, I think,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nin which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nand that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nThe stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nare now part of common culture --\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\noutside the American Bible Belt, anyway --\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nbut most people, even those who are familiar with evolution,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\naren't mindful that even more time lies ahead.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nThe sun has been shining for four and a half billion years,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nbut it'll be another six billion years before its fuel runs out.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nOn that schematic picture, a sort of time-lapse picture, we're halfway.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nAnd it'll be another six billion before that happens,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nand any remaining life on Earth is vaporized.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nThere's an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nexperiencing the sun's demise,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nbut any life and intelligence that exists then\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nwill be as different from us as we are from bacteria.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nThe unfolding of intelligence and complexity\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nstill has immensely far to go, here on Earth and probably far beyond.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nSo we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nin our Earth and beyond.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nIf you represent the Earth's lifetime by a single year,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nsay from January when it was made to December,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nthe 21st-century would be a quarter of a second in June --\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\na tiny fraction of the year.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nBut even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nour century is very, very special,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nthe first when humans can change themselves and their home planet.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nAs I should have shown this earlier,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nit will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun;\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nit will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nWhen Einstein died in 1955,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\none striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nby Herblock in the Washington Post.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nThe plaque reads, \"Albert Einstein lived here.\"\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nAnd I'd like to end with a vignette, as it were, inspired by this image.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nWe've been familiar for 40 years with this image:\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nthe fragile beauty of land, ocean and clouds,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\ncontrasted with the sterile moonscape\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\non which the astronauts left their footprints.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nBut let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nin the cosmos from afar, not just for 40 years,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nbut for the entire 4.5 billion-year history of our Earth.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nWhat would they have seen?\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nOver nearly all that immense time,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nEarth's appearance would have changed very gradually.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nThe only abrupt worldwide change\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nwould have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super-eruptions.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nApart from those brief traumas, nothing happens suddenly.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nThe continental landmasses drifted around.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nIce cover waxed and waned.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nSuccessions of new species emerged, evolved and became extinct.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nBut in just a tiny sliver of the Earth's history,\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nthe last one-millionth part, a few thousand years,\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nthe patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nThis signaled the start of agriculture.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nChange has accelerated as human populations rose.\n\n00:15:31.958 -->

transmissions.

Now, when the TED people first approached me about giving this upbeat talk \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 that was before the cartoon of Muhammad had triggered global rioting. It was before the avian flu had reached Europe. It was before Hamas had won the Palestinian election, eliciting various counter-measures by Israel. And to be honest, if I had known when I was asked to give this upbeat talk that even as I was giving the upbeat talk, the apocalypse would be unfolding \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 I might have said, \"Is it okay if I talk about something else?\" But I didn't, OK. So we're here. I'll do what I can. I'll do what I can.I've got to warn you: the sense in which my worldview is upbeat has always been kind of subtle, sometimes even elusive. (Laughter) The sense in which I can be uplifting and inspiring \u2014 I mean, there's always been a kind of a certain grim dimension to the way I try to uplift, so if grim inspiration \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 if grim inspiration is not a contradiction in terms, that is, I'm afraid, the most you can hope for. OK, today \u2014 that's if I succeed. I'll see what I can do. OK?Now, in one sense, the claim that history has a direction is not that controversial. If you're just talking about social structure, OK, clearly that's gotten more complex a little over the last 10,000 years \u2014 has reached higher and higher levels. And in fact, that's actually sustaining a long-standing trend that predates human beings, OK, that biological evolution was doing for us. Because what happened in the beginning, this stuff encases itself in a cell, then cells start hanging out together in societies. Eventually they get so close, they form multicellular organisms, then you get complex multicellular organisms; they form societies.But then at some point, one of these multicellular organisms does something completely amazing with this stuff, which is it launches a whole second kind of evolution: cultural evolution. And amazingly, that evolution sustains the trajectory that biological evolution had established toward greater complexity. By cultural evolution we mean the evolution of ideas. A lot of you have heard the term \"memes.\" The evolution of technology, I pay a lot of attention to, so, you know, one of the first things you got was a little hand axe. Generations go by, somebody says, hey, why don't we put it on a stick? (Laughter) Just absolutely delights the little ones. Next best thing to a video game.This may not seem to impress, but technological evolution is progressive, so another 10, 20,000 years, and armaments technology takes you here. (Laughter) Impressive. And the rate of technological evolution speeds up, so a mere quarter of a century after this, you get this, OK. (Laughter) And this. (Laughter) I'm sorry \u2014 it was a cheap laugh, but I wanted to find a way to transition back to this idea of the unfolding apocalypse, and I thought that might do it. (Applause)So, what threatens to happen with this unfolding apocalypse is the collapse of global social organization. Now, first let me remind you how much work it took to get us where we are, to be on the brink of true global social organization. Originally, you had the most complex societies, the hunter-gatherer village. Stonehenge is the remnant of a chiefdom, which is what you get with the invention of agriculture: multi-village polity with centralized rule. With the invention of writing, you start getting cities. This is blurry. I kind of like that because it makes it look like a one-celled organism and reminds you how many levels organic organization has already moved through to get to this point. And then you get to, you know, you get empires.I want to stress, you know, social organization can transcend political bounds. This is the Silk Road connecting the Chinese Empire and the Roman Empire. So you had social complexity spanning the whole continent, even if no polity did similarly. Today, you've got nation states. Point is: there's obviously collaboration and organization going on beyond national bounds. This is actually just a picture of the earth at night, and I'm just putting it up because I think it's pretty. Does kind of convey the sense that this is an integrated system.Now, I explained this growth of complexity by reference to something called \"non-zero sumness.\" Assuming that a few of you did not do the assigned reading, very quickly, the key idea is the distinction between zero-sum games, in which correlations are inverse: always a winner and a loser. Non-zero-sum games in which correlations can be positive, OK. So like in tennis, usually it's win-lose; it always adds up to zero-zero-sum. But if you're playing doubles, the person on your side of the net, they're in the same boat as you, so you're playing a non-zero-sum game with them. It's either for the better or for the worse, OK. A lot of forms of non-zero-sum behavior in the realm of economics and so on in everyday life often leads to cooperation.The argument I make is basically that, well, non-zero-sum games have always been part of life. You have them in hunter-gatherer societies, but then through technological evolution, new forms of technology arise that facilitate or encourage the playing of non-zero-sum games, involving more people over larger territory. Social structure adapts to accommodate this possibility and to harness this productive potential, so you get cities, you know, and you get all the non-zero-sum games you don't think about that are being played across the world. Like, have you ever thought when you buy a car, how many people on how many different continents contributed to the manufacture of that car? Those are people in effect you're playing a non-zero-sum game with. I mean, there are certainly plenty of them around.Now, this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way, because when you think of non-zero, you think win-win, you know, that's good. Well, there are a few reasons that actually it's not intrinsically upbeat. First of all, it can accommodate; it doesn't deny the existence of inequality exploitation war. But there's a more fundamental reason that it's not intrinsically upbeat, because a non-zero-sum game, all it tells you for sure is that the fortunes will be correlated for better or worse. It doesn't necessarily predict a win-win outcome.So, in a way, the question is: on what grounds am I upbeat at all about history? And the answer is, first of all, on balance I would say people have played their games to more win-win outcomes than lose-lose outcomes. On balance, I think history is a net positive in the non-zero-sum game department. And a testament to this is the thing that most amazes me, most impresses me, and most uplifts me, which is that there is a moral dimension to history; there is a moral arrow. We have seen moral progress over time.2,500 years ago, members of one Greek city-state considered members of another Greek city-state subhuman and treated them that way. And then this moral revolution arrived, and they decided that actually, no, Greeks are human beings. It's just the Persians who aren't fully human and don't deserve to be treated very nicely.But this was progress \u2014 you know, give them credit. And now today, we've seen more progress. I think \u2014 I hope \u2014 most people here would say that all people everywhere are human beings, deserve to be treated decently, unless they do something horrendous, regardless of race or religion. And you have to read your ancient history to realize what a revolution that has been, OK. This was not a prevalent view, few thousand years ago, and I attribute it to this non-zero-sum dynamic. I think that's the reason there is as much tolerance toward nationalities, ethnicities, religions as there is today. If you asked me, you know, why am I not in favor of bombing Japan, well, I'm only half-joking when I say they built my car. We have this non-zero-sum relationship, and I think that does lead to a kind of a tolerance to the extent that you realize that someone else's welfare is positively correlated with yours \u2014 you're more likely to cut them a break.I kind of think this is a kind of a business-class morality. Unfortunately, I don't fly trans-Atlantic business class often enough to know, or any other kind of business class really, but I assume that in business class, you don't hear many expressions of, you know, bigotry about racial groups or ethnic groups, because the people who are flying trans-Atlantic business class are doing business with all these people; they're making money off all these people. And I really do think that, in that sense at least, capitalism has been a constructive force, and more fundamentally, it's a non-zero-sumness that has been a constructive force in expanding people's realm of moral awareness. I think the non-zero-sum dynamic, which is not only economic by any means \u2014 it's not always commerce \u2014 but it has driven us to the verge of a moral truth, which is the fundamental equality of everyone. It has done that. As it has moved global, moved us toward a global level of social organization, it has driven us toward moral truth. I think that's wonderful.Now, back to the unfolding apocalypse. And you may wonder, OK, that's all fine, sounds great \u2014 moral direction in history \u2014 but what about this so-called clash of civilizations? Well, first of all, I would emphasize that it fits into the non-zero-sum framework, OK. If you look at the relationship between the so-called Muslim world and Western world \u2014 two terms I don't like, but can't really avoid; in such a short span of time, they're efficient if nothing else \u2014 it is non-zero-sum. And by that I mean, if people in the Muslim world get more hateful, more resentful, less happy with their place in the world, it'll be bad for the West. If they get more happy, it'll be good for the West. So that is a non-zero-sum dynamic.And I would say the non-zero-sum dynamic is only going to grow more intense over time because of technological trends, but more intense in a kind of negative way. It's the downside correlation of their fortunes that will become more and more possible. And one reason is because of something I call the \"growing lethality of hatred.\" More and more, it's possible for grassroots hatred abroad to manifest itself in the form of organized violence on American soil. And that's pretty new, and I think it's probably going to get a lot worse \u2014 this capacity \u2014 because of trends in information technology, in technologies that can be used for purposes of munitions like biotechnology and nanotechnology. We may be hearing more about that today.And there's something I worry about especially, which is that this dynamic will lead to a kind of a feedback cycle that puts us on a slippery slope. What I have in mind is: terrorism happens here; we overreact to it. That, you know, we're not sufficiently surgical in our retaliation leads to more hatred abroad, more terrorism. We overreact because being human, we feel like retaliating, and it gets worse and worse and worse. You could call this the positive feedback of negative vibes, but I think in something so spooky, we really shouldn't have the word positive there at all, even in a technical sense. So let's call it the death spiral of negativity. (Laughter) I assure you if it happens, at the end, both the West and the Muslim world will have suffered.So, what do we do? Well, first of all, we can do a lot more with arms control, the international regulation of dangerous technologies. I have a whole global governance sermon that I will spare you right now, because I don't think that's going to be enough anyway, although it's essential. I think we're going to have to have a major round of moral progress in the world. I think you're just going to have to see less hatred among groups, less bigotry, and, you know, racial groups, religious groups, whatever. I've got to admit I feel silly saying that. It sounds so kind of Pollyannaish. I feel like Rodney King, you know, saying, why can't we all just get along? But hey, I don't really see any alternative, given the way I read the situation. There's going to have to be moral progress. There's going to have to be a lessening of the amount of hatred in the world, given how dangerous it's becoming. In my defense, I'd say, as naive as this may sound, it's ultimately grounded in cynicism.That is to say \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 thank you, thank you. That is to say, remember: my whole view of morality is that it boils down to self-interest. It's when people's fortunes are correlated. It's when your welfare conduces to mine, that I decide, oh yeah, I'm all in favor of your welfare. That's what's responsible for this growth of this moral progress so far, and I'm saying we once again have a correlation of fortunes, and if people respond to it intelligently, we will see the development of tolerance and so on \u2014 the norms that we need, you know. We will see the further evolution of this kind of business-class morality.So, these two things, you know, if they get people's attention and drive home the positive correlation and people do what's in their self-interests, which is further the moral evolution, then they could actually have a constructive effect. And that's why I lump growing lethality of hatred and death spiral of negativity under the general rubric, reasons to be cheerful. (Laughter) Doing the best I can, OK. (Laughter) I never called myself Mr. Uplift. I'm just doing what I can here. (Laughter)Now, launching a moral revolution has got to be hard, right? I mean, what do you do? And I think the answer is a lot of different people are going to have to do a lot of different things. We all start where we are. Speaking as an American who has children whose security 10, 20, 30 years down the road I worry about \u2014 what I personally want to start out doing is figuring out why so many people around the world hate us, OK. I think that's a worthy research project myself. I also like it because it's an intrinsically kind of morally redeeming exercise. Because to understand why somebody in a very different culture does something \u2014 somebody you're kind of viewing as alien, who's doing things you consider strange in a culture you consider strange \u2014 to really understand why they do the things they do is a morally redeeming accomplishment, because you've got to relate their experience to yours. To really understand it, you've got to say, \"Oh, I get it. So when they feel resentful, it's kind of like the way I feel resentful when this happens, and for somewhat the same reasons.\" That's true understanding. And I think that is an expansion of your moral compass when you manage to do that.It's especially hard to do when people hate you, OK, because you don't really, in a sense, want to completely understand why people hate you. I mean, you want to hear the reason, but you don't want to be able to relate to it. You don't want it to make sense, right? (Laughter) You don't want to say, \"Well, yeah, I can kind of understand how a human being in those circumstances would hate the country I live in.\" That's not a pleasant thing, but I think it's something that we're going to have to get used to andwork on. Now, I want to stress that to understand, you know \u2014 there are people who don't like this whole business of understanding the grassroots, the root causes of things; they don't want to know why people hate us. I want to understand it. The reason you're trying to understand why they hate us, is to get them to quit hating us. The idea when you go through this moral exercise of really coming to appreciate their humanity and better understand them, is part of an effort to get them to appreciate your humanity in the long run. I think it's the first step toward that. That's the long-term goal.There are people who worry about this, and in fact, I, myself, apparently, was denounced on national TV a couple of nights ago because of an op-ed I'd written. It was kind of along these lines, and the allegation was that I have, quote, \"affection for terrorists.\" Now, the good news is that the person who said it was Ann Coulter. (Laughter) (Applause) I mean, if you've got to have an enemy, do make it Ann Coulter. (Laughter) But it's not a crazy concern, OK, because understanding behavior can lead to a kind of empathy, and it can make it a little harder to deliver tough love, and so on. But I think we're a lot closer to erring on the side of not comprehending the situation clearly enough, than in comprehending it so clearly that we just can't, you know, get the army out to kill terrorists.So I'm not really worried about it. So \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 I mean, we're going to have to work on a lot of fronts, but if we succeed \u2014 if we succeed \u2014 then once again, non-zero-sumness and the recognition of non-zero-sum dynamics will have forced us to a higher moral level. And a kind of saving higher moral level, something that kind of literally saves the world. If you look at the word \"salvation\" in the Bible \u2014 the Christian usage that we're familiar with \u2014 saving souls, that people go to heaven \u2014 that's actually a latecomer. The original meaning of the word \"salvation\" in the Bible is about saving the social system. \"Yahweh is our Savior\" means \"He has saved the nation of Israel,\" which at the time, was a pretty high-level social organization.Now, social organization has reached the global level, and I guess, if there's good news I can say I'm bringing you, it's just that all the salvation of the world requires is the intelligent pursuit of self-interests in a disciplined and careful way. It's going to be hard. I say we give it a shot anyway because we've just come too far to screw it up now. Thanks.

OK?\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nNow, in one sense,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nthe claim that history has a direction is not that controversial.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nIf you're just talking about social structure,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nOK, clearly that's gotten more complex\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\na little over the last 10,000 years -- has reached higher and higher levels.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nAnd in fact, that's actually sustaining\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:55.958\na long-standing trend that predates human beings, OK,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nthat biological evolution was doing for us.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nBecause what happened in the beginning, this stuff encases itself in a cell,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nthen cells start hanging out together in societies.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nEventually they get so close, they form multicellular organisms,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nthen you get complex multicellular organisms; they form societies.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nBut then at some point, one of these multicellular organisms\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\ndoes something completely amazing with this stuff, which is\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nit launches a whole second kind of evolution: cultural evolution.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nAnd amazingly, that evolution sustains the trajectory\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nthat biological evolution had established toward greater complexity.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nBy cultural evolution we mean the evolution of ideas.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nA lot of you have heard the term \"memes.\" The evolution of technology,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nI pay a lot of attention to, so, you know,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:45.958\none of the first things you got was a little hand axe.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nGenerations go by, somebody says, hey, why don't we put it on a stick?\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nJust absolutely delights the little ones.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nNext best thing to a video game.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nThis may not seem to impress,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nbut technological evolution is progressive, so another 10, 20,000 years,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nand armaments technology takes you here.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:07.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nImpressive. And the rate of technological evolution speeds up,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nso a mere quarter of a century after this, you get this, OK.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nAnd this.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nI'm sorry -- it was a cheap laugh, but I wanted to find a way\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nto transition back to this idea of the unfolding apocalypse,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nand I thought that might do it.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:35.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nSo, what threatens to happen with this unfolding apocalypse\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nis the collapse of global social organization.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nNow, first let me remind you how much work it took to get us where we are,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nto be on the brink of true global social organization.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nOriginally, you had the most complex societies, the hunter-gatherer village.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nStonehenge is the remnant of a chiefdom,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nwhich is what you get with the invention of agriculture: multi-village polity\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nwith centralized rule.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nWith the invention of writing, you start getting cities. This is blurry. I kind of like that\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nbecause it makes it look like a one-celled organism and reminds you\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nhow many levels organic organization has already moved through\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nto get to this point. And then you get to, you know, you get empires.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nI want to stress, you know, social organization can transcend political bounds.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nThis is the Silk Road connecting the Chinese Empire and the Roman Empire.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nSo you had social complexity spanning the whole continent,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:38.958\neven if no polity did similarly. Today, you've got nation states.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nPoint is: there's obviously collaboration and organization going on\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nbeyond national bounds.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nThis is actually just a picture of the earth at night,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nand I'm just putting it up because I think it's pretty.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nDoes kind of convey the sense that this is an integrated system.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nNow, I explained this growth of complexity by reference to something\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:03.958\ncalled \"non-zero sumness.\"\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nAssuming that a few of you did not do the assigned reading, very quickly,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nthe key idea is the distinction between zero-sum games, in which correlations\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nare inverse: always a winner and a loser.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nNon-zero-sum games in which correlations can be positive, OK.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nSo like in tennis, usually it's win-lose;\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nit always adds up to zero-zero-sum. But if you're playing doubles,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nthe person on your side of the net, they're in the same boat as you,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nso you're playing a non-zero-sum game with them.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nIt's either for the better or for the worse, OK.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nA lot of forms of non-zero-sum behavior in the realm of economics and so on\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nin everyday life often leads to cooperation.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nThe argument I make is basically that, well,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nnon-zero-sum games have always been part of life.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nYou have them in hunter-gatherer societies,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nbut then through technological evolution, new forms of technology arise\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nthat facilitate or encourage the playing of non-zero-sum games,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\ninvolving more people over larger territory.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nSocial structure adapts to accommodate this possibility and\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nto harness this productive potential, so you get cities, you know,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nand you get all the non-zero-sum games you don't think about\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nthat are being played across the world.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nLike, have you ever thought when you buy a car,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nhow many people on how many different continents contributed\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nto the manufacture of that car? Those are people in effect\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nyou're playing a non-zero-sum game with.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nI mean, there are certainly plenty of them around.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nNow, this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nbecause when you think of non-zero, you think win-win, you know,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nthat's good. Well, there are a few reasons\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nthat actually it's not intrinsically upbeat.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nFirst of all, it can accommodate; it doesn't deny the existence\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nof inequality exploitation war.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nBut there's a more fundamental reason\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nthat it's not intrinsically upbeat, because a non-zero-sum game,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nall it tells you for sure is that the fortunes will be correlated for better or worse.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nIt doesn't necessarily predict a win-win outcome.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nSo, in a way, the question is: on what grounds\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nam I upbeat at all about history? And the answer is,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nfirst of all, on balance I would say people have played their games\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nto more win-win outcomes than lose-lose outcomes. On balance,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nI think history is a net positive in the non-zero-sum game department.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nAnd a testament to this is the thing that most amazes me,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nmost impresses me, and most uplifts me,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nwhich is that there is a moral dimension to history;\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nthere is a moral arrow. We have seen moral progress over time.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.958\n2,500 years ago, members of one Greek city-state\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nconsidered members of another Greek city-state subhuman\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nand treated them that way. And then this moral revolution arrived,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nand they decided that actually, no, Greeks are human beings.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nIt's just the Persians who aren't fully human\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nand don't deserve to be treated very nicely.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nBut this was progress -- you know, give them credit. And now today,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nwe've seen more progress. I think -- I hope -- most people here would say\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nthat all people everywhere are human beings,\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\ndeserve to be treated decently,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nunless they do something horrendous, regardless of race or religion.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nAnd you have to read your ancient history to realize what a revolution that has been,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nOK. This was not a prevalent view,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nfew thousand years ago, and I attribute it to this non-zero-sum dynamic.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nI think that's the reason there is as much tolerance toward nationalities,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nethnicities, religions as there is today. If you asked me,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nyou know, why am I not in favor of bombing Japan,\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nwell, I'm only half-joking when I say they built my car.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nWe have this non-zero-sum relationship,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nand I think that does lead to a kind of a tolerance to the extent that you realize\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nthat someone else's welfare is positively correlated with yours --\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nyou're more likely to cut them a break.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nI kind of think this is a kind of a business-class morality.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nUnfortunately, I don't fly trans-Atlantic business class often enough\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nto know, or any other kind of business class really,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nbut I assume that in business class, you don't hear many expressions of, you know,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nbigotry about racial groups or ethnic groups,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nbecause the people who are flying trans-Atlantic business class\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nare doing business with all these people; they're making money\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:24.958\noff all these people. And I really do think that, in that sense at least,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\ncapitalism has been a constructive force,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nand more fundamentally, it's a non-zero-sumness\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nthat has been a constructive force in expanding people's realm\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nof moral awareness. I think the non-zero-sum dynamic,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nwhich is not only economic by any means -- it's not always commerce --\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nbut it has driven us to the verge of a moral truth,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nwhich is the fundamental equality of everyone. It has done that.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nAs it has moved global, moved us toward a global level of social organization,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nit has driven us toward moral truth.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nI think that's wonderful.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nNow, back to the unfolding apocalypse.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nAnd you may wonder, OK, that's all fine,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nsounds great -- moral direction in history --\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nbut what about this so-called clash of civilizations? Well, first of all,\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nI would emphasize that it fits into the non-zero-sum framework,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nOK. If you look at the relationship\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nbetween the so-called Muslim world and Western world --\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\ntwo terms I don't like, but can't really avoid;\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nin such a short span of time, they're efficient if nothing else --\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nit is non-zero-sum. And by that I mean,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nif people in the Muslim world get more hateful, more resentful,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nless happy with their place in the world,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nit'll be bad for the West. If they get more happy, it'll be good for the West.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nSo that is a non-zero-sum dynamic.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nAnd I would say the non-zero-sum dynamic is only going to grow more intense over time\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nbecause of technological trends, but more intense in a kind of negative way.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nIt's the downside correlation of their fortunes that will become more and more possible.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nAnd one reason is because of something I call the \"growing lethality of hatred.\"\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nMore and more, it's possible for grassroots hatred abroad\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nto manifest itself in the form of organized violence on American soil.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nAnd that's pretty new, and I think it's probably going to get a lot worse\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\n-- this capacity -- because of\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:27.958\ntrends in information technology, in technologies that can be used\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nfor purposes of munitions like biotechnology and nanotechnology.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nWe may be hearing more about that today.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nAnd there's something I worry about especially, which is that\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nthis dynamic will lead to a kind of a feedback cycle that puts us on a slippery slope.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nWhat I have in mind is: terrorism happens here; we overreact to it.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nThat, you know, we're not sufficiently surgical in our retaliation\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nleads to more hatred abroad, more terrorism.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nWe overreact because being human, we feel like retaliating,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nand it gets worse and worse and worse.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nYou could call this the positive feedback of negative vibes,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nbut I think in something so spooky,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nwe really shouldn't have the word positive there at all, even in a technical sense.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nSo let's call it the death spiral of negativity.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nI assure you if it happens, at the end, both the West\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nand the Muslim world will have suffered.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nSo, what do we do? Well, first of all, we can do a lot more with arms control,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nthe international regulation of dangerous technologies.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nI have a whole global governance sermon\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nthat I will spare you right now,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nbecause I don't think that's going to be enough anyway, although it's essential.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nI think we're going to have to have a major round\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nof moral progress in the world.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nI think you're just going to have to see less hatred among groups,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nless bigotry, and, you know, racial groups, religious groups, whatever.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nI've got to admit I feel silly saying that.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nIt sounds so kind of Pollyannaish. I feel like Rodney King, you know,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nsaying, why can't we all just get along?\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nBut hey, I don't really see any alternative, given the way I read the situation.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nThere's going to have to be moral progress.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nThere's going to have to be a lessening of the amount of hatred in the world,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:12.958\ngiven how dangerous it's becoming.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nIn my defense, I'd say, as naive as this may sound,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nit's ultimately grounded in cynicism.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nThat is to say --\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:25.958\n-- thank you, thank you. That is to say, remember: my whole view\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nof morality is that it boils down to self-interest.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nIt's when people's fortunes are correlated.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nIt's when your welfare conduces to mine, that I decide, oh yeah,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nI'm all in favor of your welfare. That's what's responsible\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nfor this growth of this moral progress so far,\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nand I'm saying we once again have a correlation of fortunes,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nand if people respond to it intelligently, we will see\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nthe development of tolerance and so on --\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nthe norms that we need, you know.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nWe will see the further evolution of this kind of business-class morality.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nSo, these two things, you know, if they get people's attention\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nand drive home the positive correlation and people do what's in their self-interests,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nwhich is further the moral evolution,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nthen they could actually have a constructive effect.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nAnd that's why I lump growing lethality of hatred\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nand death spiral of negativity under the general rubric,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nreasons to be cheerful.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nDoing the best I can, OK.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:26.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nI never called myself Mr. Uplift.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nI'm just doing what I can here.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:32.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nNow, launching a moral revolution has got to be hard, right?\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nI mean, what do you do?\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nAnd I think the answer is a lot of different people\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nare going to have to do a lot of different things.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nWe all start where we are.

(Laughter)\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nYou don't want to say, \"Well, yeah, I can kind of understand\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nhow a human being in those circumstances\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nwould hate the country I live in.\" That's not a pleasant thing,\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nbut I think it's something that we're going to have to get used to and\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nwork on. Now, I want to stress that to understand, you know --\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nthere are people who don't like this whole business of understanding\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nthe grassroots, the root causes of things; they don't want to know\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nwhy people hate us. I want to understand it.\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nThe reason you're trying to understand why they hate us,\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nis to get them to quit hating us. The idea\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nwhen you go through this moral exercise of really coming to appreciate\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:43.958\ntheir humanity and better understand them, is part of an effort\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nto get them to appreciate your humanity in the long run.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nI think it's the first step toward that. That's the long-term goal.\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nThere are people who worry about this, and in fact,\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nI, myself, apparently, was denounced on national TV\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:03.958\na couple of nights ago because of an op-ed I'd written.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nIt was kind of along these lines, and the allegation was\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nthat I have, quote, \"affection for terrorists.\"\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nNow, the good news is that the person who said it was Ann Coulter.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nI mean, if you've got to have an enemy, do make it Ann Coulter.\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:19.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nBut it's not a crazy concern, OK, because understanding behavior\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:25.958\ncan lead to a kind of empathy,\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nand it can make it a little harder to deliver tough love, and so on.\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nBut I think we're a lot closer to erring on the side of not comprehending\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nthe situation clearly enough, than in comprehending it so clearly\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nthat we just can't, you know, get the army out to kill terrorists.\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nSo I'm not really worried about it.

No, what I want to do is take you back to 1854 in London for the next few minutes, and tell the story \u2014 in brief \u2014 of this outbreak, which in many ways, I think, helped create the world that we live in today, and particularly the kind of city that we live in today. This period in 1854, in the middle part of the 19th century, in London's history, is incredibly interesting for a number of reasons. But I think the most important one is that London was this city of 2.5 million people, and it was the largest city on the face of the planet at that point. But it was also the largest city that had ever been built.And so the Victorians were trying to live through and simultaneously invent a whole new scale of living: this scale of living that we, you know, now call \"metropolitan living.\" And it was in many ways, at this point in the mid-1850s, a complete disaster. They were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis with an Elizabethan public infrastructure. So people, for instance, just to gross you out for a second, had cesspools of human waste in their basement. Like, a foot to two feet deep. And they would just kind of throw the buckets down there and hope that it would somehow go away, and of course it never really would go away. And all of this stuff, basically, had accumulated to the point where the city was incredibly offensive to just walk around in.It was an amazingly smelly city. Not just because of the cesspools, but also the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people. Not just the horses, but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk, that they would hoist up there and keep them in the attic until literally their milk ran out and they died, and then they would drag them off to the bone boilers down the street. So, you would just walk around London at this point and just be overwhelmed with this stench. And what ended up happening is that an entire emerging public health system became convinced that it was the smell that was killing everybody, that was creating these diseases that would wipe through the city every three or four years. And cholera was really the great killer of this period.It arrived in London in 1832, and every four or five years another epidemic would take 10,000, 20,000 people in London and throughout the U.K. And so the authorities became convinced that this smell was this problem. We had to get rid of the smell. And so, in fact, they concocted a couple of early, you know, founding public-health interventions in the system of the city, one of which was called the \"Nuisances Act,\" which they got everybody as far as they could to empty out their cesspools and just pour all that waste into the river. Because if we get it out of the streets, it'll smell much better, and \u2014 oh right, we drink from the river. So what ended up happening, actually, is they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera because, as we now know, cholera is actually in the water. It's a waterborne disease, not something that's in the air. It's not something you smell or inhale; it's something you ingest.And so one of the founding moments of public health in the 19th century effectively poisoned the water supply of London much more effectively than any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dreamed of doing. So this was the state of London in 1854, and in the middle of all this carnage and offensive conditions, and in the midst of all this scientific confusion about what was actually killing people, it was a very talented classic 19th century multi-disciplinarian named John Snow, who was a local doctor in Soho in London, who had been arguing for about four or five years that cholera was, in fact, a waterborne disease, and had basically convinced nobody of this. The public health authorities had largely ignored what he had to say. And he'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies, but nothing had really stuck. And part of \u2014 what's so interesting about this story to me is that in some ways, it's a great case study in how cultural change happens, how a good idea eventually comes to win out over much worse ideas. And Snow labored for a long time with this great insight that everybody ignored.And then on one day, August 28th of 1854, a young child, a five-month-old girl whose first name we don't know, we know her only as Baby Lewis, somehow contracted cholera, came down with cholera at 40 Broad Street. You can't really see it in this map, but this is the map that becomes the central focus in the second half of my book. It's in the middle of Soho, in this working class neighborhood, this little girl becomes sick and it turns out that the cesspool, that they still continue to have, despite the Nuisances Act, bordered on an extremely popular water pump, local watering hole that was well known for the best water in all of Soho, that all the residents from Soho and the surrounding neighborhoods would go to.And so this little girl inadvertently ended up contaminating the water in this popular pump, and one of the most terrifying outbreaks in the history of England erupted about two or three days later. Literally, 10 percent of the neighborhood died in seven days, and much more would have died if people hadn't fled after the initial outbreak kicked in. So it was this incredibly terrifying event. You had these scenes of entire families dying over the course of 48 hours of cholera, alone in their one-room apartments, in their little flats. Just an extraordinary, terrifying scene. Snow lived near there, heard about the outbreak, and in this amazing act of courage went directly into the belly of the beast because he thought an outbreak that concentrated could actually potentially end up convincing people that, in fact, the real menace of cholera was in the water supply and not in the air. He suspected an outbreak that concentrated would probably involve a single point source. One single thing that everybody was going to because it didn't have the traditional slower path of infections that you might expect.And so he went right in there and started interviewing people. He eventually enlisted the help of this amazing other figure, who's kind of the other protagonist of the book \u2014 this guy, Henry Whitehead, who was a local minister, who was not at all a man of science, but was incredibly socially connected; he knew everybody in the neighborhood. And he managed to track down, Whitehead did, many of the cases of people who had drunk water from the pump, or who hadn't drunk water from the pump. And eventually Snow made a map of the outbreak. He found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick. People who hadn't drunk from the pump were not getting sick. And he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods, people who hadn't, you know, percentages of people who hadn't, but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could see. Something that would take in a sense a higher-level view of all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood.And so he created this map, which basically ended up representing all the deaths in the neighborhoods as black bars at each address. And you can see in this map, the pump right at the center of it and you can see that one of the residences down the way had about 15 people dead. And the map is actually a little bit bigger. As you get further and further away from the pump, the deaths begin to grow less and less frequent. And so you can see this something poisonous emanating out of this pump that you could see in a glance. And so, with the help of this map, and with the help of more evangelizing that he did over the next few years and that Whitehead did, eventually, actually, the authorities slowly started to come around. It took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story, but by 1866, when the next big cholera outbreak came to London, the authorities had been convinced \u2014 in part because of this story, in part because of this map \u2014 that in fact the water was the problem.And they had already started building the sewers in London, and they immediately went to this outbreak and they told everybody to start boiling their water. And that was the last time that London has seen a cholera outbreak since. So, part of this story, I think \u2014 well, it's a terrifying story, it's a very dark story and it's a story that continues on in many of the developing cities of the world. It's also a story really that is fundamentally optimistic, which is to say that it's possible to solve these problems if we listen to reason, if we listen to the kind of wisdom of these kinds of maps, if we listen to people like Snow and Whitehead, if we listen to the locals who understand what's going on in these kinds of situations. And what it ended up doing is making the idea of large-scale metropolitan living a sustainable one.When people were looking at 10 percent of their neighborhoods dying in the space of seven days, there was a widespread consensus that this couldn't go on, that people weren't meant to live in cities of 2.5 million people. But because of what Snow did, because of this map, because of the whole series of reforms that happened in the wake of this map, we now take for granted that cities have 10 million people, cities like this one are in fact sustainable things. We don't worry that New York City is going to collapse in on itself quite the way that, you know, Rome did, and be 10 percent of its size in 100 years or 200 years. And so that in a way is the ultimate legacy of this map. It's a map of deaths that ended up creating a whole new way of life, the life that we're enjoying here today.

Like, a foot to two feet deep.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nAnd they would just kind of throw the buckets down there\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nand hope that it would somehow go away,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nand of course it never really would go away.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nAnd all of this stuff, basically, had accumulated to the point\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nwhere the city was incredibly offensive to just walk around in.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nIt was an amazingly smelly city. Not just because of the cesspools,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nbut also the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nNot just the horses, but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk,\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nthat they would hoist up there and keep them in the attic\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nuntil literally their milk ran out and they died,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nand then they would drag them off to the bone boilers down the street.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nSo, you would just walk around London at this point\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nand just be overwhelmed with this stench.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nAnd what ended up happening is that an entire emerging public health system\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nbecame convinced that it was the smell that was killing everybody,\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nthat was creating these diseases\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nthat would wipe through the city every three or four years.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nAnd cholera was really the great killer of this period.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nIt arrived in London in 1832, and every four or five years\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nanother epidemic would take 10,000, 20,000 people in London\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nand throughout the U.K.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nAnd so the authorities became convinced that this smell was this problem.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nWe had to get rid of the smell.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nAnd so, in fact, they concocted a couple of early, you know,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nfounding public-health interventions in the system of the city,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\none of which was called the \"Nuisances Act,\"\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nwhich they got everybody as far as they could\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nto empty out their cesspools and just pour all that waste into the river.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nBecause if we get it out of the streets, it'll smell much better,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nand -- oh right, we drink from the river.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nSo what ended up happening, actually,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nis they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nbecause, as we now know, cholera is actually in the water.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nIt's a waterborne disease, not something that's in the air.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nIt's not something you smell or inhale; it's something you ingest.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nAnd so one of the founding moments of public health in the 19th century\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:44.958\neffectively poisoned the water supply of London much more effectively\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nthan any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dreamed of doing.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nSo this was the state of London in 1854,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nand in the middle of all this carnage and offensive conditions,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nand in the midst of all this scientific confusion\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nabout what was actually killing people,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nit was a very talented classic 19th century multi-disciplinarian named John Snow,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nwho was a local doctor in Soho in London,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nwho had been arguing for about four or five years\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nthat cholera was, in fact, a waterborne disease,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nand had basically convinced nobody of this.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nThe public health authorities had largely ignored what he had to say.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nAnd he'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nbut nothing had really stuck.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nAnd part of -- what's so interesting about this story to me\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nis that in some ways, it's a great case study in how cultural change happens,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nhow a good idea eventually comes to win out over much worse ideas.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nAnd Snow labored for a long time with this great insight that everybody ignored.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nAnd then on one day, August 28th of 1854,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.958\na young child, a five-month-old girl whose first name we don't know,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nwe know her only as Baby Lewis, somehow contracted cholera,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\ncame down with cholera at 40 Broad Street.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nYou can't really see it in this map, but this is the map\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nthat becomes the central focus in the second half of my book.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nIt's in the middle of Soho, in this working class neighborhood,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nthis little girl becomes sick and it turns out that the cesspool,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nthat they still continue to have, despite the Nuisances Act,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nbordered on an extremely popular water pump,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nlocal watering hole that was well known for the best water in all of Soho,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nthat all the residents from Soho and the surrounding neighborhoods would go to.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nAnd so this little girl inadvertently ended up\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\ncontaminating the water in this popular pump,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nand one of the most terrifying outbreaks in the history of England\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nerupted about two or three days later.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nLiterally, 10 percent of the neighborhood died in seven days,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nand much more would have died if people hadn't fled\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nafter the initial outbreak kicked in.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nSo it was this incredibly terrifying event.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nYou had these scenes of entire families dying\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nover the course of 48 hours of cholera,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nalone in their one-room apartments, in their little flats.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nJust an extraordinary, terrifying scene.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nSnow lived near there, heard about the outbreak,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nand in this amazing act of courage went directly into the belly of the beast\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nbecause he thought an outbreak that

and not in the air.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nHe suspected an outbreak that concentrated\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nwould probably involve a single point source.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nOne single thing that everybody was going to\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nbecause it didn't have the traditional slower path\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nof infections that you might expect.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nAnd so he went right in there and started interviewing people.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nHe eventually enlisted the help of this amazing other figure,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nwho's kind of the other protagonist of the book --\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nthis guy, Henry Whitehead, who was a local minister,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nwho was not at all a man of science, but was incredibly socially connected;\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nhe knew everybody in the neighborhood.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nAnd he managed to track down, Whitehead did,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nmany of the cases of people who had drunk water from the pump,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nor who hadn't drunk water from the pump.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nAnd eventually Snow made a map of the outbreak.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nHe found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nPeople who hadn't drunk from the pump were not getting sick.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nAnd he thought about representing that\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nas a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\npeople who hadn't, you know, percentages of people who hadn't,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nbut eventually he hit upon the idea\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nthat what he needed was something that you could see.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nSomething that would take in a sense a higher-level view\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nof all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nAnd so he created this map,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nwhich basically ended up representing all the deaths in the neighborhoods\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nas black bars at each address.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd you can see in this map, the pump right at the center of it\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nand you can see that one of the residences down the way\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nhad about 15 people dead.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nAnd the map is actually a little bit bigger.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nAs you get further and further away from the pump,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nthe deaths begin to grow less and less frequent.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd so you can see this something poisonous\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nemanating out of this pump that you could see in a glance.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nAnd so, with the help of this map,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nand with the help of more evangelizing\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nthat he did over the next few years\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nand that Whitehead did, eventually, actually,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nthe authorities slowly started to come around.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nIt took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nbut by 1866, when the next big cholera outbreak came to London,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nthe authorities had been convinced -- in part because of this story,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nin part because of this map -- that in fact the water was the problem.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nAnd they had already started building the sewers in London,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nand they immediately went to this outbreak\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nand they told everybody to start boiling their water.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nAnd that was the last time that London has seen a cholera outbreak since.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nSo, part of this story, I think -- well, it's a terrifying story,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nit's a very dark story and it's a story\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nthat continues on in many of the developing cities of the world.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nIt's also a story really that is fundamentally optimistic,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nwhich is to say that it's possible to solve these problems\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nif we listen to reason, if we listen to the kind of wisdom of these kinds of maps,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nif we listen to people like Snow and Whitehead,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nif we listen to the locals who understand\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nwhat's going on in these kinds of situations.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nAnd what it ended up doing is making the idea\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nof large-scale metropolitan living a sustainable one.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nWhen people were looking at 10 percent of their neighborhoods dying\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nin the space of seven days,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nthere was a widespread consensus that this couldn't go on,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nthat people weren't meant to live in cities of 2.5 million people.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nBut because of what Snow did, because of this map,\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nbecause of the whole series of reforms\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nthat happened in the wake of this map,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nwe now take for granted that cities have 10 million people,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\ncities like this one are in fact sustainable things.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nWe don't worry that New York City is going to collapse in on itself\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nquite the way that, you know, Rome did,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nand be 10 percent of its size in 100 years or 200 years.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nAnd so that in a way is the ultimate legacy of this map.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nIt's a map of deaths that ended up creating a whole new way of life,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nthe life that we're enjoying here today.

Because traditional economic theory would say, well, the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big R&D lab where they were thinking up new projects, and it came out of there. It didn't come from there. Another answer might be, well, it came from a sort of lone genius working in his garage, who, working away on different kinds of bikes, comes up with a bike out of thin air.It didn't come from there. The mountain bike came from users, came from young users, particularly a group in Northern California, who were frustrated with traditional racing bikes, which were those sort of bikes that Eddy Merckx rode, or your big brother, and they're very glamorous. But also frustrated with the bikes that your dad rode, which sort of had big handlebars like that, and they were too heavy. So, they got the frames from these big bikes, put them together with the gears from the racing bikes, got the brakes from motorcycles, and sort of mixed and matched various ingredients. And for the first, I don't know, three to five years of their life, mountain bikes were known as \"clunkers.\" And they were just made in a community of bikers, mainly in Northern California.And then one of these companies that was importing parts for the clunkers decided to set up in business, start selling them to other people, and gradually another company emerged out of that, Marin, and it probably was, I don't know, 10, maybe even 15, years, before the big bike companies realized there was a market. Thirty years later, mountain bike sales and mountain bike equipment account for 65 percent of bike sales in America. That's 58 billion dollars.This is a category entirely created by consumers that would not have been created by the mainstream bike market because they couldn't see the need, the opportunity; they didn't have the incentive to innovate. The one thing I think I disagree with about Yochai's presentation is when he said the Internet causes this distributive capacity for innovation to come alive. It's when the Internet combines with these kinds of passionate pro-am consumers \u2014 who are knowledgeable; they've got the incentive to innovate; they've got the tools; they want to \u2014 that you get this kind of explosion of creative collaboration. And out of that, you get the need for the kind of things that Jimmy was talking about, which is our new kinds of organization, or a better way to put it: how do we organize ourselves without organizations? That's now possible; you don't need an organization to be organized, to achieve large and complex tasks, like innovating new software programs.So this is a huge challenge to the way we think creativity comes about. The traditional view, still enshrined in much of the way that we think about creativity \u2014 in organizations, in government \u2014 is that creativity is about special people: wear baseball caps the wrong way round, come to conferences like this, in special places, elite universities, R&D labs in the forests, water, maybe special rooms in companies painted funny colors, you know, bean bags, maybe the odd table-football table. Special people, special places, think up special ideas, then you have a pipeline that takes the ideas down to the waiting consumers, who are passive. They can say \"yes\" or \"no\" to the invention. That's the idea of creativity. What's the policy recommendation out of that if you're in government, or you're running a large company? More special people, more special places. Build creative clusters in cities; create more R&D parks, so on and so forth. Expand the pipeline down to the consumers.Well this view, I think, is increasingly wrong. I think it's always been wrong, because I think always creativity has been highly collaborative, and it's probably been largely interactive. But it's increasingly wrong, and one of the reasons it's wrong is that the ideas are flowing back up the pipeline. The ideas are coming back from the consumers, and they're often ahead of the producers. Why is that? Well, one issue is that radical innovation, when you've got ideas that affect a large number of technologies or people, have a great deal of uncertainty attached to them. The payoffs to innovation are greatest where the uncertainty is highest. And when you get a radical innovation, it's often very uncertain how it can be applied.The whole history of telephony is a story of dealing with that uncertainty. The very first landline telephones, the inventors thought that they would be used for people to listen in to live performances from West End theaters. When the mobile telephone companies invented SMS, they had no idea what it was for; it was only when that technology got into the hands of teenage users that they invented the use.So the more radical the innovation, the more the uncertainty, the more you need innovation in use to work out what a technology is for. All of our patents, our entire approach to patents and invention, is based on the idea that the inventor knows what the invention is for; we can say what it's for. More and more, the inventors of things will not be able to say that in advance. It will be worked out in use, in collaboration with users. We like to think that invention is a sort of moment of creation: there is a moment of birth when someone comes up with an idea. The truth is that most creativity is cumulative and collaborative; like Wikipedia, it develops over a long period of time.The second reason why users are more and more important is that they are the source of big, disruptive innovations. If you want to find the big new ideas, it's often difficult to find them in mainstream markets, in big organizations. And just look inside large organizations and you'll see why that is so. So, you're in a big corporation. You're obviously keen to go up the corporate ladder. Do you go into your board and say, \"Look, I've got a fantastic idea for an embryonic product in a marginal market, with consumers we've never dealt with before, and I'm not sure it's going to have a big payoff, but it could be really, really big in the future?\" No, what you do, is you go in and you say, \"I've got a fantastic idea for an incremental innovation to an existing product we sell through existing channels to existing users, and I can guarantee you get this much return out of it over the next three years.\"Big corporations have an in-built tendency to reinforce past success. They've got so much sunk in it that it's very difficult for them to spot emerging new markets. Emerging new markets, then, are the breeding grounds for passionate users. Best example: who in the music industry, 30 years ago, would have said, \"Yes, let's invent a musical form which is all about dispossessed black men in ghettos expressing their frustration with the world through a form of music that many people find initially quite difficult to listen to. That sounds like a winner; we'll go with it.\" (Laughter). So what happens? Rap music is created by the users. They do it on their own tapes, with their own recording equipment; they distribute it themselves. 30 years later, rap music is the dominant musical form of popular culture \u2014 would never have come from the big companies. Had to start \u2014 this is the third point \u2014 with these pro-ams.This is the phrase that I've used in some stuff which I've done with a think tank in London called Demos, where we've been looking at these people who are amateurs \u2014 i.e., they do it for the love of it \u2014 but they want to do it to very high standards. And across a whole range of fields \u2014 from software, astronomy, natural sciences, vast areas of leisure and culture like kite-surfing, so on and so forth \u2014 you find people who want to do things because they love it, but they want to do these things to very high standards. They work at their leisure, if you like. They take their leisure very seriously: they acquire skills; they invest time; they use technology that's getting cheaper \u2014 it's not just the Internet: cameras, design technology, leisure technology, surfboards, so on and so forth. Largely through globalization, a lot of this equipment has got a lot cheaper. More knowledgeable consumers, more educated, more able to connect with one another, more able to do things together. Consumption, in that sense, is an expression of their productive potential. Why, we found, people were interested in this, is that at work they don't feel very expressed. They don't feel as if they're doing something that really matters to them, so they pick up these kinds of activities. This has huge organizational implications for very large areas of life.Take astronomy as an example, which Yochai has already mentioned. Twenty years ago, 30 years ago, only big professional astronomers with very big telescopes could see far into space. And there's a big telescope in Northern England called Jodrell Bank, and when I was a kid, it was amazing, because the moon shots would take off, and this thing would move on rails. And it was huge \u2014 it was absolutely enormous. Now, six amateur astronomers, working with the Internet, with Dobsonian digital telescopes \u2014 which are pretty much open source \u2014 with some light sensors developed over the last 10 years, the Internet \u2014 they can do what Jodrell Bank could only do 30 years ago. So here in astronomy, you have this vast explosion of new productive resources. The users can be producers.What does this mean, then, for our organizational landscape? Well, just imagine a world, for the moment, divided into two camps. Over here, you've got the old, traditional corporate model: special people, special places; patent it, push it down the pipeline to largely waiting, passive consumers. Over here, let's imagine we've got Wikipedia, Linux, and beyond \u2014 open source. This is open; this is closed. This is new; this is traditional. Well, the first thing you can say, I think with certainty, is what Yochai has said already \u2014 is there is a great big struggle between those two organizational forms. These people over there will do everything they can to stop these kinds of organizations succeeding, because they're threatened by them. And so the debates about copyright, digital rights, so on and so forth \u2014 these are all about trying to stifle, in my view, these kinds of organizations. What we're seeing is a complete corruption of the idea of patents and copyright. Meant to be a way to incentivize invention, meant to be a way to orchestrate the dissemination of knowledge, they are increasingly being used by large companies to create thickets of patents to prevent innovation taking place.Let me just give you two examples. The first is: imagine yourself going to a venture capitalist and saying, \"I've got a fantastic idea. I've invented this brilliant new program that is much, much better than Microsoft Outlook.\" Which venture capitalist in their right mind is going to give you any money to set up a venture competing with Microsoft, with Microsoft Outlook? No one. That is why the competition with Microsoft is bound to come \u2014 will only come \u2014 from an open-source kind of project.So, there is a huge competitive argument about sustaining the capacity for open-source and consumer-driven innovation, because it's one of the greatest competitive levers against monopoly. There'll be huge professional arguments as well. Because the professionals, over here in these closed organizations \u2014 they might be academics; they might be programmers; they might be doctors; they might be journalists \u2014 my former profession \u2014 say, \"No, no \u2014 you can't trust these people over here.\"When I started in journalism \u2014 Financial Times, 20 years ago \u2014 it was very, very exciting to see someone reading the newspaper. And you'd kind of look over their shoulder on the Tube to see if they were reading your article. Usually they were reading the share prices, and the bit of the paper with your article on was on the floor, or something like that, and you know, \"For heaven's sake, what are they doing! They're not reading my brilliant article!\" And we allowed users, readers, two places where they could contribute to the paper: the letters page, where they could write a letter in, and we would condescend to them, cut it in half, and print it three days later. Or the op-ed page, where if they knew the editor \u2014 had been to school with him, slept with his wife \u2014 they could write an article for the op-ed page. Those were the two places.Shock, horror: now, the readers want to be writers and publishers. That's not their role; they're supposed to read what we write. But they don't want to be journalists. The journalists think that the bloggers want to be journalists; they don't want to be journalists; they just want to have a voice. They want to, as Jimmy said, they want to have a dialogue, a conversation. They want to be part of that flow of information. What's happening there is that the whole domain of creativity is expanding. So, there's going to be a tremendous struggle. But, also, there's going to be tremendous movement from the open to the closed.What you'll see, I think, is two things that are critical, and these, I think, are two challenges for the open movement. The first is: can we really survive on volunteers? If this is so critical, do we not need it funded, organized, supported in much more structured ways? I think the idea of creating the Red Cross for information and knowledge is a fantastic idea, but can we really organize that, just on volunteers? What kind of changes do we need in public policy and funding to make that possible? What's the role of the BBC, for instance, in that world? What should be the role of public policy? And finally, what I think you will see is the intelligent, closed organizations moving increasingly in the open direction. So it's not going to be a contest between two camps, but, in between them, you'll find all sorts of interesting places that people will occupy. New organizational models coming about, mixing closed and open in tricky ways. It won't be so clear-cut; it won't be Microsoft versus Linux \u2014 there'll be all sorts of things in between. And those organizational models, it turns out, are incredibly powerful, and the people who can understand them will be very, very successful.Let me just give you one final example of what that means. I was in Shanghai, in an office block built on what was a rice paddy five years ago \u2014 one of the 2,500 skyscrapers they've built in Shanghai in the last 10 years. And I was having dinner with this guy called Timothy Chan. Timothy Chan set up an Internet business in 2000. Didn't go into the Internet, kept his money, decided to go into computer games. He runs a company called Shanda, which is the largest computer games company in China. Nine thousand servers all over China, has 250 million subscribers. At any one time, there are four million people playing one of his games. How many people does he employ to service that population? 500 people. Well, how can he service 250 million people from 500 employees? Because basically, he doesn't service them. He gives them a platform; he gives them some rules; he gives them the tools and then he kind of orchestrates the conversation; he orchestrates the action. But actually, a lot of the content is created by the users themselves. And it creates a kind of stickiness between the community and the company which is really, really powerful.The best measure of that: so you go into one of his games, you create a character that you develop in the course of the game. If, for some reason, your credit card bounces, or there's some other problem, you lose your character. You've got two options. One option: you can create a new character, right from scratch, but with none of the history of your player. That costs about 100 dollars. Or you can get on a plane, fly to Shanghai, queue up outside Shanda's offices \u2014 cost probably 600, 700 dollars \u2014 and reclaim your character, get your history back. Every morning, there are 600 people queuing outside their offices to reclaim these characters. (Laughter) So this is about companies built on communities, that provide communities with tools, resources, platforms in which they can share. He's not open source, but it's very, very powerful.So here is one of the challenges, I think, for people like me, who do a lot of work with government. If you're a games company, and you've got a million players in your game, you only need one percent of them to be co-developers, contributing ideas, and you've got a development workforce of 10,000 people. Imagine you could take all the children in education in Britain, and one percent of them were co-developers of education. What would that do to the resources available to the education system? Or if you got one percent of the patients in the NHS to, in some sense, be co-producers of health.The reason why \u2014 despite all the efforts to cut it down, to constrain it, to hold it back \u2014 why these open models will still start emerging with tremendous force, is that they multiply our productive resources. And one of the reasons they do that is that they turn users into producers, consumers into designers.Thank you very much.", "id": 63, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nWhat I'm going to do, in the spirit of collaborative creativity,\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nis simply repeat many of the points\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nthat the three people before me have already made,\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nbut do them --\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nthis is called \"creative collaboration;\"\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nit's actually called \"borrowing\" --\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nbut do it through a particular perspective,\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nand that is to ask about the role of users and consumers\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nin this emerging world of\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\ncollaborative creativity\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nthat Jimmy and others have talked about.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nLet me just ask you, to start with,\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nthis simple question:\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nwho invented the mountain bike?\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nBecause traditional economic theory would say,\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nwell, the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nthat had a big R&amp;D lab\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nwhere they were thinking up new projects,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nand it came out of there.

00:02:47.958\nwith these kinds of passionate pro-am consumers --\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nwho are knowledgeable; they've got the incentive to innovate;\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nthey've got the tools; they want to --\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nthat you get this kind of explosion\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nof creative collaboration.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nAnd out of that, you get the need for the kind of things\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nthat Jimmy was talking about, which is our new kinds of organization,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nor a better way to put it:\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nhow do we organize ourselves without organizations?\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nThat's now possible; you don't need an organization to be organized,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nto achieve large and complex tasks,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nlike innovating new software programs.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nSo this is a huge challenge\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nto the way we think creativity comes about.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nThe traditional view, still enshrined\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nin much of the way that we think about creativity\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\n-- in organizations, in government --\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nis that creativity is about special people:\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nwear baseball caps the wrong way round,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\ncome to conferences like this, in special places,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nelite universities, R&amp;D labs in the forests, water,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nmaybe special rooms in companies painted funny colors,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nyou know, bean bags, maybe the odd table-football table.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nSpecial people, special places, think up special ideas,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nthen you have a pipeline that takes the ideas\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\ndown to the waiting consumers, who are passive.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nThey can say \"yes\" or \"no\" to the invention.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nThat's the idea of creativity.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nWhat's the policy recommendation out of that\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nif you're in government, or you're running a large company?\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nMore special people, more special places.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nBuild creative clusters in cities;\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\ncreate more R&amp;D parks, so on and so forth.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nExpand the pipeline down to the consumers.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nWell this view, I think, is increasingly wrong.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nI think it's always been wrong,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nbecause I think always creativity has been highly collaborative,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nand it's probably been largely interactive.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nBut it's increasingly wrong, and one of the reasons it's wrong\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nis that the ideas are flowing back up the pipeline.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nThe ideas are coming back from the consumers,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nand they're often ahead of the producers.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nWhy is that?\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nWell, one issue\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nis that radical innovation,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nwhen you've got ideas that\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:56.958\naffect a large number of technologies or people,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nhave a great deal of uncertainty attached to them.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nThe payoffs to innovation are greatest\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nwhere the uncertainty is highest.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nAnd when you get a radical innovation,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nit's often very uncertain how it can be applied.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nThe whole history of telephony\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nis a story of dealing with that uncertainty.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nThe very first landline telephones,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nthe inventors thought\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nthat they would be used for people to listen in\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nto live performances\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nfrom West End theaters.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nWhen the mobile telephone companies invented SMS,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nthey had no idea what it was for;\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nit was only when that technology got into the hands\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nof teenage users\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nthat they invented the use.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nSo the more radical the innovation,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nthe more the uncertainty,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nthe more you need innovation in use\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nto work out what a technology is for.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nAll of our patents, our entire approach\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nto patents and invention, is based on the idea\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nthat the inventor knows what the invention is for;\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nwe can say what it's for.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nMore and more, the inventors of things\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nwill not be able to say that in advance.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nIt will be worked out in use,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nin collaboration with users.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nWe like to think that invention is\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\na sort of moment of creation:\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nthere is a moment of birth when someone comes up with an idea.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nThe truth is that most creativity\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nis cumulative and collaborative;\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nlike Wikipedia, it develops over a long period of time.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nThe second reason why users are more and more important\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nis that they are the source of big, disruptive innovations.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nIf you want to find the big new ideas,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nit's often difficult to find them in mainstream markets,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nin big organizations.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nAnd just look inside large organizations\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nand you'll see why that is so.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nSo, you're in a big corporation.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nYou're obviously keen to go up the corporate ladder.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nDo you go into your board and say,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\n\"Look, I've got a fantastic idea\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nfor an embryonic product\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nin a marginal market,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nwith consumers we've never dealt with before,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nand I'm not sure it's going to have a big payoff, but it could be really, really big in the future?\"\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nNo, what you do, is you go in and you say,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\n\"I've got a fantastic idea for an incremental innovation\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nto an existing product we sell through existing channels\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nto existing users, and I can guarantee\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nyou get this much return out of it over the next three years.\"\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nBig corporations have an in-built tendency\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nto reinforce past success.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nThey've got so much sunk in it\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nthat it's very difficult for them to spot\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nemerging new markets. Emerging new markets, then,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nare the breeding grounds for passionate users.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nBest example:\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nwho in the music industry,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\n30 years ago, would have said,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\n\"Yes, let's invent a musical form\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nwhich is all about dispossessed black men\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nin ghettos expressing their frustration\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nwith the world through a form of music\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nthat many people find initially quite difficult to listen to.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nThat sounds like a winner; we'll go with it.\"\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:58.958\n(Laughter).\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nSo what happens?

No one.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nThat is why the competition with Microsoft is bound to come --\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nwill only come --\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nfrom an open-source kind of project.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nSo, there is a huge competitive argument\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nabout sustaining the capacity\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nfor open-source and consumer-driven innovation,\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nbecause it's one of the greatest\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\ncompetitive levers against monopoly.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nThere'll be huge professional arguments as well.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nBecause the professionals, over here\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nin these closed organizations --\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nthey might be academics; they might be programmers;\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nthey might be doctors; they might be journalists --\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nmy former profession --\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nsay, \"No, no -- you can't trust these people over here.\"\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nWhen I started in journalism --\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nFinancial Times, 20 years ago --\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nit was very, very exciting\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nto see someone reading the newspaper.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nAnd you'd kind of look over their shoulder on the Tube\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nto see if they were reading your article.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nUsually they were reading the share prices,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nand the bit of the paper with your article on\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nwas on the floor, or something like that,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nand you know, \"For heaven's sake, what are they doing!\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nThey're not reading my brilliant article!\"\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nAnd we allowed users, readers,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\ntwo places where they could contribute to the paper:\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nthe letters page, where they could write a letter in,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nand we would condescend to them, cut it in half,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nand print it three days later.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nOr the op-ed page, where if they knew the editor --\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nhad been to school with him, slept with his wife --\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nthey could write an article for the op-ed page.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nThose were the two places.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nShock, horror: now, the readers want to be writers and publishers.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nThat's not their role; they're supposed to read what we write.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nBut they don't want to be journalists. The journalists think\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nthat the bloggers want to be journalists;\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nthey don't want to be journalists; they just want to have a voice.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nThey want to, as Jimmy said, they want to have a dialogue, a conversation.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nThey want to be part of that flow of information.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nWhat's happening there is that the whole domain\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nof creativity is expanding.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nSo, there's going to be a tremendous struggle.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nBut, also, there's going to be tremendous movement\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nfrom the open to the closed.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nWhat you'll see, I think, is two things that are critical,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nand these, I think, are two challenges\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nfor the open movement.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nThe first is:\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\ncan we really survive on volunteers?\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nIf this is so critical,\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\ndo we not need it funded, organized, supported\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nin much more structured ways?\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nI think the idea of creating the Red Cross\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nfor information and knowledge is a fantastic idea,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nbut can we really organize that, just on volunteers?\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nWhat kind of changes do we need in public policy\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nand funding to make that possible?\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nWhat's the role of the BBC,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nfor instance, in that world?\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nWhat should be the role of public policy?\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nAnd finally, what I think you will see\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nis the intelligent, closed organizations\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nmoving increasingly in the open direction.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nSo it's not going to be a contest between two camps,\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nbut, in between them, you'll find all sorts of interesting places\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nthat people will occupy.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nNew organizational models coming about,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nmixing closed and open in tricky ways.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nIt won't be so clear-cut; it won't be Microsoft versus Linux --\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nthere'll be all sorts of things in between.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nAnd those organizational models, it turns out,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nare incredibly powerful,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nand the people who can understand them\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nwill be very, very successful.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nLet me just give you one final example\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nof what that means.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nI was in Shanghai,\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nin an office block\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nbuilt on what was a rice paddy five years ago --\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\none of the 2,500 skyscrapers\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nthey've built in Shanghai in the last 10 years.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nAnd I was having dinner with this guy called Timothy Chan.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nTimothy Chan set up an Internet business\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nin 2000.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nDidn't go into the Internet, kept his money,\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\ndecided to go into computer games.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nHe runs a company called Shanda,\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nwhich is the largest computer games company in China.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nNine thousand servers all over China,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nhas 250 million subscribers.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nAt any one time, there are four million people playing one of his games.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nHow many people does he employ\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nto service that population?\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\n500 people.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nWell, how can he service\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:25.958\n250 million people from 500 employees?\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nBecause basically, he doesn't service them.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nHe gives them a platform;\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nhe gives them some rules; he gives them the tools\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nand then he kind of orchestrates the conversation;\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nhe orchestrates the action.\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nBut actually, a lot of the content\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nis created by the users themselves.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nAnd it creates a kind of stickiness\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nbetween the community and the company\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nwhich is really, really powerful.\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nThe best measure of that: so you go into one of his games,\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nyou create a character\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nthat you develop in the course of the game.\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nIf, for some reason, your credit card bounces,\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nor there's some other problem,\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nyou lose your character.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nYou've got two options.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nOne option: you can create a new character,\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nright from scratch, but with none of the history of your player.\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nThat costs about 100 dollars.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nOr you can get on a plane, fly to Shanghai,\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nqueue up outside Shanda's offices --\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:22.958\ncost probably 600, 700 dollars --\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nand reclaim your character, get your history back.\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nEvery morning, there are 600 people queuing\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.958\noutside their offices\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nto reclaim these characters. (Laughter)\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nSo this is about companies built on communities,\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nthat provide communities with tools,\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nresources, platforms in which they can share.\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nHe's not open source,\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nbut it's very, very powerful.\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nSo here is one of the challenges, I think,\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:48.958\nfor people like me, who\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:51.958\ndo a lot of work with government.\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nIf you're a games company,\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nand you've got a million players in your game,\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nyou only need one percent of them\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nto be co-developers, contributing ideas,\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nand you've got a development workforce\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nof 10,000 people.\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nImagine you could take all the children\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nin education in Britain, and one percent of them\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:15.958\nwere co-developers of education.\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nWhat would that do to the resources available\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nto the education system?\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nOr if you got one percent of the patients in the NHS\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:25.958\nto, in some sense, be co-producers of health.\n\n00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nThe reason why --\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:30.958\ndespite all the efforts to cut it down,\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nto constrain it, to hold it back --\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nwhy these open models will still start emerging\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nwith tremendous force,\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nis that they multiply our productive resources.\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nAnd one of the reasons they do that\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nis that they turn users into producers,\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nconsumers into designers.\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nThank you very much."}, {"title": "Four American characters", "duration": "1385", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/anna_deavere_smith_s_american_character", "transcript": "So my grandfather told me when I was a little girl, \"If you say a word often enough, it becomes you.\" And having grown up in a segregated city, Baltimore, Maryland, I sort of use that idea to go around America with a tape recorder \u2014 thank God for technology \u2014 to interview people, thinking that if I walked in their words \u2014 which is also why I don't wear shoes when I perform \u2014 if I walked in their words, that I could sort of absorb America. I was also inspired by Walt Whitman, who wanted to absorb America and have it absorb him.So these four characters are going to be from that work that I've been doing for many years now, and well over, I don't know, a couple of thousand people I've interviewed. Anybody out here old enough to know Studs Terkel, that old radio man? So I thought he would be the perfect person to go to to ask about a defining moment in American history. You know, he was \"born in 1912, the year the Titanic sank, greatest ship every built. Hits the tip of an iceberg, and bam, it went down. It went down and I came up. Wow, some century.\" (Laughter)So this is his answer about a defining moment in American history. \"Defining moment in American history, I don't think there's one; you can't say Hiroshima, that's a big one \u2014 I can't think of any one moment I would say is a defining moment. The gradual slippage \u2014 'slippage' is the word used by the people in Watergate, moral slippage \u2014 it's a gradual kind of thing, combination of things. You see, we also have the technology. I say, less and less the human touch.\"Oh, let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit. The Atlanta airport is a modern airport, and they should leave the gate there. These trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination. And these trains are smooth, and they're quiet and they're efficient. And there's a voice on the train, you know the voice was a human voice. You see in the old days we had robots, robots imitated humans. Now we have humans imitating robots. So we got this voice on this train: Concourse One: Omaha, Lincoln. Concourse Two: Dallas, Fort Worth. Same voice. Just as a train is about to go, a young couple rush in and they're just about to close the pneumatic doors. And that voice, without losing a beat, says, 'Because of late entry, we're delayed 30 seconds.' Just then, everybody's looking at this couple with hateful eyes and the couple's going like this, you know, shrinking. Well, I'd happened to have had a couple of drinks before boarding \u2014 I do that to steel my nerves \u2014 and so I imitate a train call, holding my hand on my \u2014 'George Orwell, your time has come,' you see. Well, some of you are laughing. Everybody laughs when I say that, but not on this train. Silence. And so suddenly they're looking at me. So here I am with the couple, the three of us shrinking at the foot of Calvary about to be up, you know.\"Just then I see a baby, a little baby in the lap of a mother. I know it's Hispanic because she's speaking Spanish to her companion. So I'm going to talk to the baby. So I say to the baby, holding my hand over my mouth because my breath must be 100 proof, I say to the baby, 'Sir or Madam, what is your considered opinion of the human species?' And the baby looks, you know, the way babies look at you clearly, starts laughing, starts busting out with this crazy little laugh. I say, 'Thank God for a human reaction, we haven't lost yet.'\"But you see, the human touch, you see, it's disappearing. You know, you see, you've got to question the official truth. You know the thing that was so great about Mark Twain \u2014 you know we honor Mark Twain, but we don't read him. We read 'Huck Finn,' of course, we read 'Huck Finn' of course. I mean, Huck, of course, was tremendous. Remember that great scene on the raft, remember what Huck did? You see, here's Huck; he's an illiterate kid; he's had no schooling, but there's something in him. And the official truth, the truth was, the law was, that a black man was a property, was a thing, you see.And Huck gets on the raft with a property named Jim, a slave, see. And he hears that Jim is going to go and take his wife and kids and steal them from the woman who owns them, and Huck says, 'Ooh, oh my God, ooh, ooh \u2014 that woman, that woman never did anybody any harm. Ooh, he's going to steal; he's going to steal; he's going to do a terrible thing.' Just then, two slavers caught up, guys chasing slaves, looking for Jim. 'Anybody up on that raft with you?' Huck says, 'Yeah.' 'Is he black or white?' 'White.' And they go off. And Huck said, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I lied, I lied, ooh, I did a terrible thing, did a terrible thing \u2014 why do I feel so good?'\"But it's the goodness of Huck, that stuff that Huck's been made of, you see, all been buried; it's all been buried. So the human touch, you see, it's disappearing. So you ask about a defining moment \u2014 ain't no defining moment in American history for me. It's an accretion of moments that add up to where we are now, where trivia becomes news. And more and more, less and less awareness of the pain of the other. Huh. You know, I don't know if you could use this or not, but I was quoting Wright Morris, a writer from Nebraska, who says, 'We're more and more into communications and less and less into communication.' Okay, kids, I got to scram, got to go see my cardiologist.\" And that's Studs Terkel. (Applause)So, talk about risk taking. I'm going to do somebody that nobody likes. You know, most actors want to do characters that are likeable \u2014 well, not always, but the notion, especially at a conference like this, I like to inspire people. But since this was called \"risk taking,\" I'm doing somebody who I never do, because she's so unlikeable that one person actually came backstage and told me to take her out of the show she was in. And I'm doing her because I think we think of risk, at a conference like this, as a good thing.But there are certain other connotations to the word \"risk,\" and the same thing about the word \"nature.\" What is nature? Maxine Greene, who's a wonderful philosopher who's as old as Studs, and was the head of a philosophy \u2014 great, big philosophy kind of an organization \u2014 I went to her and asked her what are the two things that she doesn't know, that she still wants to know. And she said, \"Well, personally, I still feel like I have to curtsey when I see the president of my university. And I still feel as though I've got to get coffee for my male colleagues, even though I've outlived most of them.\" And she said, \"And then intellectually, I don't know enough about the negative imagination. And September 11th certainly taught us that that's a whole area we don't investigate.\"So this piece is about a negative imagination. It raises questions about what nature is, what Mother Nature is, and about what a risk can be. And I got this in the Maryland Correctional Institute for Women. Everything I do is word for word off a tape. And I title things because I think people speak in organic poems, and this is called \"A Mirror to Her Mouth.\" And this is an inmate named Paulette Jenkins.\"I began to learn how to cover it up, because I didn't want nobody to know that this was happening in my home. I want everybody to think we were a normal family. I mean we had all the materialistic things, but that didn't make my children pain any less; that didn't make their fears subside. I ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes and busted lips and bruises. I didn't had no more excuses. And he beat me too. But that didn't change the fact that it was a nightmare for my family; it was a nightmare. And I failed them dramatically, because I allowed it to go on and on and on.\"But the night that Myesha got killed \u2014 and the intensity just grew and grew and grew, until one night we came home from getting drugs, and he got angry with Myesha, and he started beating her, and he put her in a bathtub. Oh, he would use a belt. He had a belt because he had this warped perverted thing that Myesha was having sex with her little brother and they was fondling each other \u2014 that would be his reason. I'm just talking about the particular night that she died. And so he put her in the bathtub, and I was in the bedroom with the baby.\"And four months before this happened, four months before Myesha died, I thought I could really fix this man. So I had a baby by him \u2014 insane \u2014 thinking that if I gave him his own kid, he would leave mine alone. And it didn't work, didn't work. And I ended up with three children, Houston, Myesha and Dominic, who was four months old when I came to jail.\"And I was in the bedroom. Like I said, he had her in the bathroom and he \u2014 he \u2014 every time he hit her, she would fall. And she would hit her head on the tub. It happened continuously, repeatedly. I could hear it, but I dared not to move. I didn't move. I didn't even go and see what was happening. I just sat there and listened. And then he put her in the hallway. He told her, just set there. And so she set there for about four or five hours. And then he told her, get up. And when she got up, she says she couldn't see. Her face was bruised. She had a black eye. All around her head was just swollen; her head was about two sizes of its own size. I told him, 'Let her go to sleep.' He let her go to sleep.\"The next morning she was dead. He went in to check on her for school, and he got very excited. He says, 'She won't breathe.' I knew immediately that she was dead. I didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead, so I went in and I put a mirror to her mouth \u2014 there was no thing, nothing, coming out of her mouth. He said, he said, he said, 'We can't, we can't let nobody find out about this.' He say, 'You've got to help me.' I agree. I agree.\"I mean, I've been keeping a secret for years and years and years, so it just seemed like second hand to me, just to keep on keeping it a secret. So we went to the mall and we told a police that we had, like, lost her, that she was missing. We told a security guard that she was missing, though she wasn't missing. And we told the security guard what we had put on her and we went home and we dressed her in exactly the same thing that we had told the security guard that we had put on her.\"And then we got the baby and my other child, and we drove out to, like, I-95. I was so petrified and so numb, all I could look was in the rear-view mirror. And he just laid her right on the shoulder of the highway. My own child, I let that happen to.\" So that's an investigation of the negative imagination. (Applause)When I started this project called \"On the Road: A Search For an American Character\" with my tape recorder, I thought that I was going to go around America and find it in all its aspects \u2014 bull riders, cowboys, pig farmers, drum majorettes \u2014 but I sort of got tripped on race relations, because my first big show was a show about a race riot. And so I went to both \u2014 two race riots, one of which was the Los Angeles riot. And this next piece is from that. Because this is what I would say I've learned the most about race relations, from this piece. It's a kind of an aria, I would say, and in many tapes that I have.Everybody knows that the Los Angeles riots happened because four cops beat up a black man named Rodney King. It was captured on videotape \u2014 technology \u2014 and it was played all over the world. Everybody thought the four cops would go to jail. They did not, so there were riots. And what a lot of people forget, is there was a second trial, ordered by George Bush, Sr. And that trial came back with two cops going to jail and two cops declared innocent. I was at that trial. And I mean, the people just danced in the streets because they were afraid there was going to be another riot. Explosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way.So there was a community that didn't \u2014 the Korean-Americans, whose stores had been burned to the ground. And so this woman, Mrs. Young-Soon Han, I suppose will have taught me the most that I have learned about race. And she asks also a question that Studs talks about: this notion of the \"official truth,\" to question the \"official truth.\" So what she's questioning here, she's taking a chance and questioning what justice is in society. And this is called, \"Swallowing the Bitterness.\"\"I used to believe America was the best. I watched in Korea many luxurious Hollywood lifestyle movie. I never saw any poor man, any black. Until 1992, I used to believe America was the best \u2014 I still do; I don't deny that because I am a victim. But at the end of '92, when we were in such turmoil, and having all the financial problems, and all the mental problems, I began to really realize that Koreans are completely left out of this society and we are nothing. Why? Why do we have to be left out? We didn't qualify for medical treatment, no food stamp, no GR,no welfare, anything. Many African-Americans who never work got minimum amount of money to survive. We didn't get any because we have a car and a house. And we are high taxpayer. Where do I find justice? \"OK. OK? OK. OK. Many African-Americans probably think that they won by the trial. I was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict, and all the day they were having a party, they celebrated, all of South Central, all the churches. And they say, 'Well, finally justice has been done in this society.' Well, what about victims' rights? They got their rights by destroying innocent Korean merchants. They have a lot of respect, as I do, for Dr. Martin King. He is the only model for black community; I don't care Jesse Jackson. He is the model of non-violence, non-violence \u2014 and they would all like to be in his spirit.\"But what about 1992? They destroyed innocent people. And I wonder if that is really justice for them, to get their rights in that way. I was swallowing the bitterness, sitting here alone and watching them. They became so hilarious, but I was happy for them. I was glad for them. At least they got something back, OK. Let's just forget about Korean victims and other victims who were destroyed by them. They fought for their rights for over two centuries, and maybe because they sacrifice other minorities, Hispanic, Asian, we would suffer more in the mainstream. That's why I understand; that's why I have a mixed feeling about the verdict.\"But I wish that, I wish that, I wish that I could be part of the enjoyment. I wish that I could live together with black people. But after the riot, it's too much difference. The fire is still there. How do you say it? [Unclear]. Igniting, igniting, igniting fire. Igniting fire. It's still there; it can burst out anytime.\" Mrs. Young-Soon Han. (Applause)The other reason that I don't wear shoes is just in case I really feel like I have to cuddle up and get into the feet of somebody, walking really in somebody else's shoes. And I told you that in \u2014 you know, I didn't give you the year, but in '79 I thought that I was going to go around and find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that, and I got sidetracked on race relations.Finally, I did find a bull rider, two years ago. And I've been going to the rodeos with him, and we've bonded. And he's the lead in an op-ed I did about the Republican Convention. He's a Republican \u2014 I won't say anything about my party affiliation, but anyway \u2014 so this is my dear, dear Brent Williams, and this is on toughness, in case anybody needs to know about being tough for the work that you do. I think there's a real lesson in this. And this is called \"Toughness.\"\"Well, I'm an optimist. I mean basically I'm an optimist. I mean, you know, I mean, it's like my wife, Jolene, her family's always saying, you know, you ever think he's just a born loser? It seems like he has so much bad luck, you know. But then when that bull stepped on my kidney, you know, I didn't lose my kidney \u2014 I could have lost my kidney, I kept my kidney, so I don't think I'm a born loser. I think that's good luck. (Laughter)\"And, I mean, funny things like this happen. I was in a doctor's office last CAT scan, and there was a Reader's Digest, October 2002. It was like, 'seven ways to get lucky.' And it says if you want to get lucky, you know, you've got to be around positive people. I mean, like even when I told my wife that you want to come out here and talk to me, she's like, 'She's just talking; she's just being nice to you. She's not going to do that.'\"And then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here and interview me and she went and looked you up on the Internet. She said, 'Look who she is. You're not even going to be able to answer her questions.' (Laughter) And she was saying you're going to make me look like an idiot because I've never been to college, and I wouldn't be talking professional or anything. I said, 'Well look, the woman talked to me for four hours. You know, if I wasn't talking \u2014 you know, like, you know, she wanted me to talk, I don't think she would even come out here.'\"Confidence? Well, I think I ride more out of determination than confidence. I mean, confidence is like, you know, you've been on that bull before; you know you can ride him. I mean, confidence is kind of like being cocky, but in a good way. But determination, you know, it's like just, you know, 'Fuck the form, get the horn.' (Laughter) That's Tuff Hedeman, in the movie '8 Seconds.' I mean, like, Pat O'Mealey always said when I was a boy, he say, 'You know, you got more try than any kid I ever seen.' And try and determination is the same thing. Determination is, like, you're going to hang on that bull, even if you're riding upside down. Determination's like, you're going to ride till your head hits the back of the dirt.\"Freedom? It would have to be the rodeo.\"Beauty? I don't think I know what beauty is. Well, you know, I guess that'd have to be the rodeo too. I mean, look how we are, the roughy family, palling around and shaking hands and wrestling around me. It's like, you know, racking up our credit cards on entry fees and gas. We ride together, we, you know, we, we eat together and we sleep together. I mean, I can't even imagine what it's going to be like the last day I rodeo. I mean, I'll be alright. I mean, I have my ranch and everything, but I actually don't even want to think the day that comes. I mean, I guess it just be like \u2014 I guess it be like the day my brother died.\"Toughness? Well, we was in West Jordan, Utah, and this bull shoved my face right through the metal shoots in a \u2014 you know, busted my face all up and had to go to the hospital. And they had to sew me up and straighten my nose out. And I had to go and ride in the rodeo that night, so I didn't want them to put me under anesthesia, or whatever you call it. And so they sewed my face up. And then they had to straighten out my nose, and they took these rods and shoved them up my nose and went up through my brains and felt like it was coming out the top of my head, and everybody said that it should have killed me, but it didn't, because I guess I have a high tolerance for pain. (Laughter) But the good thing was, once they shoved those rods up there and straightened my nose out, I could breathe, and I hadn't been able to breathe since I broke my nose in the high school rodeo.\"Thank you.

Same voice.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nJust as a train is about to go, a young couple rush in\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nand they're just about to close the pneumatic doors.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nAnd that voice, without losing a beat, says,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\n'Because of late entry, we're delayed 30 seconds.'\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nJust then, everybody's looking at this couple with hateful eyes\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nand the couple's going like this, you know, shrinking.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nWell, I'd happened to have had a couple of drinks before boarding --\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nI do that to steel my nerves -- and so\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nI imitate a train call, holding my hand on my --\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:55.958\n'George Orwell, your time has come,' you see.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nWell, some of you are laughing. Everybody laughs\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nwhen I say that, but not on this train. Silence.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nAnd so suddenly they're looking at me.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nSo here I am with the couple, the three of us\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nshrinking at the foot of Calvary about to be up, you know.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:16.958\n\"Just then I see a baby, a little baby in the lap of a mother.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nI know it's Hispanic because she's speaking Spanish to her companion.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nSo I'm going to talk to the baby. So I say to the baby,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nholding my hand over my mouth because my breath must be 100 proof,\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nI say to the baby, 'Sir or Madam,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nwhat is your considered opinion of the human species?'\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nAnd the baby looks, you know, the way babies look at you clearly,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nstarts laughing,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nstarts busting out with this crazy little laugh.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nI say, 'Thank God for a human reaction, we haven't lost yet.'\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\n\"But you see, the human touch, you see, it's disappearing.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nYou know, you see, you've got to question the official truth.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nYou know the thing that was so great about Mark Twain --\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nyou know we honor Mark Twain, but we don't read him.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nWe read 'Huck Finn,' of course, we read 'Huck Finn' of course.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nI mean, Huck, of course, was tremendous.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nRemember that great scene on the raft, remember what Huck did?\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nYou see, here's Huck; he's an illiterate kid; he's had no schooling,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nbut there's something in him.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nAnd the official truth, the truth was, the law was,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nthat a black man was a property, was a thing, you see.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nAnd Huck gets on the raft with a property named Jim, a slave, see.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nAnd he hears that Jim is going to go and take his wife and kids\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nand steal them from the woman who owns them,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nand Huck says, 'Ooh, oh my God, ooh, ooh --\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nthat woman, that woman never did anybody any harm.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nOoh, he's going to steal; he's going to steal;\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nhe's going to do a terrible thing.'\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nJust then, two slavers caught up, guys chasing slaves, looking for Jim.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:52.958\n'Anybody up on that raft with you?' Huck says, 'Yeah.'\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:59.958\n'Is he black or white?' 'White.' And they go off.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nAnd Huck said, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I lied, I lied, ooh,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nI did a terrible thing, did a terrible thing -- why do I feel so good?'\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\n\"But it's the goodness of Huck, that stuff that Huck's been made of,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nyou see, all been buried; it's all been buried.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nSo the human touch, you see, it's disappearing.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nSo you ask about a defining moment --\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nain't no defining moment in American history for me.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nIt's an accretion of moments that add up to where we are now,\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nwhere trivia becomes news.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nAnd more and more, less and less awareness of the pain of the other.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nHuh. You know, I don't know if you could use this or not,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nbut I was quoting Wright Morris, a writer from Nebraska, who says,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\n'We're more and more into communications\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nand less and less into communication.'\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nOkay, kids, I got to scram, got to go see my cardiologist.\"\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nAnd that's Studs Terkel.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:58.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nSo, talk about risk taking. I'm going to do somebody that nobody likes.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nYou know, most actors want to do characters that are likeable --\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nwell, not always, but the notion, especially at a conference like this,\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nI like to inspire people.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nBut since this was called \"risk taking,\"\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nI'm doing somebody who I never do, because she's so unlikeable\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nthat one person actually came backstage\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nand told me to take her out of the show she was in.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nAnd I'm doing her because I think we think of risk,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nat a conference like this, as a good thing.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nBut there are certain other connotations to the word \"risk,\"\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nand the same thing about the word \"nature.\" What is nature?\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nMaxine Greene, who's a wonderful philosopher\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nwho's as old as Studs, and was the head of a philosophy --\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:48.958\ngreat, big philosophy kind of an organization --\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nI went to her and asked her what are the two things\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nthat she doesn't know, that she still wants to know.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nAnd she said, \"Well, personally, I still feel like I have to curtsey\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nwhen I see the president of my university.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nAnd I still feel as though I've got to get coffee\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nfor my male colleagues, even though I've outlived most of them.\"\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nAnd she said, \"And then intellectually,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nI don't know enough about the negative imagination.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nAnd September 11th certainly taught us\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nthat that's a whole area we don't investigate.\"\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nSo this piece is about a negative imagination.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nIt raises questions about what nature is, what Mother Nature is,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nand about what a risk can be.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nAnd I got this in the Maryland Correctional Institute for Women.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nEverything I do is word for word off a tape.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nAnd I title things because I think people speak in organic poems,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nand this is called \"A Mirror to Her Mouth.\"\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nAnd this is an inmate named Paulette Jenkins.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.958\n\"I began to learn how to cover it up,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nbecause I didn't want nobody to know that this was happening in my home.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nI want everybody to think we were a normal family.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nI mean we had all the materialistic things,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nbut that didn't make my children pain any less;\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nthat didn't make their fears subside.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nI ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nand busted lips and bruises. I didn't had no more excuses.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nAnd he beat me too. But that didn't change the fact\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nthat it was a nightmare for my family; it was a nightmare.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nAnd I failed them dramatically,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nbecause I allowed it to go on and on and on.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\n\"But the night that Myesha got killed --\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nand the intensity just grew and grew and grew,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nuntil one night we came home from getting drugs,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nand he got angry with Myesha, and he started beating her,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand he put her in a bathtub. Oh, he would use a belt.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nHe had a belt because he had this warped perverted thing\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nthat Myesha was having sex with her little brother\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nand they was fondling each other -- that would be his reason.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nI'm just talking about the particular night that she died.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nAnd so he put her in the bathtub,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nand I was in the bedroom with the baby.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:59.958\n\"And four months before this happened, four months before Myesha died,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nI thought I could really fix this man. So I had a baby by him -- insane --\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nthinking that if I gave him his own kid, he would leave mine alone.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nAnd it didn't work, didn't work.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nAnd I ended up with three children, Houston, Myesha and Dominic,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nwho was four months old when I came to jail.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\n\"And I was in the bedroom. Like I said, he had her in the bathroom\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nand he -- he -- every time he hit her, she would fall.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nAnd she would hit her head on the tub. It happened continuously, repeatedly.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nI could hear it, but I dared not to move. I didn't move.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nI didn't even go and see what was happening.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nI just sat there and listened.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nAnd then he put her in the hallway.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nHe told her, just set there. And so she set there for about four or five hours.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nAnd then he told her, get up.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nAnd when she got up, she says she couldn't see.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nHer face was bruised. She had a black eye.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nAll around her head was just swollen;\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nher head was about two sizes of its own size.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nI told him, 'Let her go to sleep.'

And this next piece is from that.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nBecause this is what I would say\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nI've learned the most about race relations, from this piece.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nIt's a kind of an aria, I would say, and in many tapes that I have.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nEverybody knows that the Los Angeles riots happened\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nbecause four cops beat up a black man named Rodney King.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nIt was captured on videotape -- technology --\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nand it was played all over the world.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nEverybody thought the four cops would go to jail.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nThey did not, so there were riots.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nAnd what a lot of people forget, is there was a second trial,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nordered by George Bush, Sr.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nAnd that trial came back with two cops going to jail\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nand two cops declared innocent. I was at that trial.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nAnd I mean, the people just danced in the streets\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nbecause they were afraid there was going to be another riot.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nExplosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nSo there was a community that didn't -- the Korean-Americans,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nwhose stores had been burned to the ground.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nAnd so this woman, Mrs. Young-Soon Han,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nI suppose will have taught me the most that I have learned about race.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nAnd she asks also a question that Studs talks about:\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nthis notion of the \"official truth,\" to question the \"official truth.\"\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nSo what she's questioning here, she's taking a chance\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nand questioning what justice is in society.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nAnd this is called, \"Swallowing the Bitterness.\"\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:50.958\n\"I used to believe America was the best.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nI watched in Korea many luxurious Hollywood lifestyle movie.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nI never saw any poor man, any black.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nUntil 1992, I used to believe America was the best -- I still do;\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nI don't deny that because I am a victim.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nBut at the end of '92, when we were in such turmoil,\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nand having all the financial problems, and all the mental problems,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nI began to really realize that Koreans\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nare completely left out of this society and we are nothing.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nWhy? Why do we have to be left out?\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nWe didn't qualify for medical treatment, no food stamp, no GR,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nno welfare, anything.

OK.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nMany African-Americans probably think that they won by the trial.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nI was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nand all the day they were having a party, they celebrated,\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nall of South Central, all the churches.

They destroyed innocent people.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nAnd I wonder if that is really justice\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nfor them, to get their rights in that way.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nI was swallowing the bitterness, sitting here alone and watching them.\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nThey became so hilarious, but I was happy for them.\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nI was glad for them. At least they got something back, OK.\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nLet's just forget about Korean victims and other victims\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nwho were destroyed by them.\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nThey fought for their rights for over two centuries,\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nand maybe because they sacrifice other minorities,\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nHispanic, Asian, we would suffer more in the mainstream.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nThat's why I understand;\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nthat's why I have a mixed feeling about the verdict.\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:33.958\n\"But I wish that, I wish that, I wish that\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nI could be part of the enjoyment.\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nI wish that I could live together with black people.\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nBut after the riot, it's too much difference.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nThe fire is still there.

I usually say to people, when they say, \"What do you do?\" I say, \"I do hardware,\" because it sort of conveniently encompasses everything I do. And I recently said that to a venture capitalist casually at some Valley event, to which he replied, \"How quaint.\"(Laughter)And I sort of really was dumbstruck. And I really should have said something smart. And now I've had a little bit of time to think about it, I would have said, \"Well, you know, if we look at the next 100 years and we've seen all these problems in the last few days, most of the big issues \u2014 clean water, clean energy \u2014 and they're interchangeable in some respects \u2014 and cleaner, more functional materials \u2014 they all look to me to be hardware problems. This doesn't mean we should ignore software, or information, or computation.\" And that's in fact probably what I'm going to try and tell you about.So, this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we're going to make things in the future. Now, TED sends you a lot of spam if you're a speaker about \"do this, do that\" and you fill out all these forms, and you don't actually know how they're going to describe you, and it flashed across my desk that they were going to introduce me as a futurist. And I've always been nervous about the term \"futurist,\" because you seem doomed to failure because you can't really predict it. And I was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues I have, and said, \"You know, well, if I have to talk about the future, what is it?\" And George Homsey, a great guy, said, \"Oh, the future is amazing. It is so much stranger than you think. We're going to reprogram the bacteria in your gut, and we're going to make your poo smell like peppermint.\"(Laughter)So, you may think that's sort of really crazy, but there are some pretty amazing things that are happening that make this possible. So, this isn't my work, but it's work of good friends of mine at MIT. This is called the registry of standard biological parts. This is headed by Drew Endy and Tom Knight and a few other very, very bright individuals. Basically, what they're doing is looking at biology as a programmable system. Literally, think of proteins as subroutines that you can string together to execute a program. Now, this is actually becoming such an interesting idea. This is a state diagram. That's an extremely simple computer.This one is a two-bit counter. So that's essentially the computational equivalent of two light switches. And this is being built by a group of students at Zurich for a design competition in biology. And from the results of the same competition last year, a University of Texas team of students programmed bacteria so that they can detect light and switch on and off. So this is interesting in the sense that you can now do \"if-then-for\" statements in materials, in structure. This is a pretty interesting trend, because we used to live in a world where everyone's said glibly, \"Form follows function,\" but I think I've sort of grown up in a world \u2014 you listened to Neil Gershenfeld yesterday; I was in a lab associated with his \u2014 where it's really a world where information defines form and function.I spent six years thinking about that, but to show you the power of art over science \u2014 this is actually one of the cartoons I write. These are called \"HowToons.\" I work with a fabulous illustrator called Nick Dragotta. Took me six years at MIT, and about that many pages to describe what I was doing, and it took him one page. And so this is our muse Tucker. He's an interesting little kid \u2014 and his sister, Celine \u2014 and what he's doing here is observing the self-assembly of his Cheerios in his cereal bowl. And in fact you can program the self-assembly of things, so he starts chocolate-dipping edges, changing the hydrophobicity and the hydrophylicity. In theory, if you program those sufficiently, you should be able to do something pretty interesting and make a very complex structure. In this case, he's done self-replication of a complex 3D structure. And that's what I thought about for a long time, because this is how we currently make things. This is a silicon wafer, and essentially that's just a whole bunch of layers of two-dimensional stuff, sort of layered up. The feature side is \u2014 you know, people will say, [unclear] down around about 65 nanometers now.On the right, that's a radiolara. That's a unicellular organism ubiquitous in the oceans. And that has feature sizes down to about 20 nanometers, and it's a complex 3D structure. We could do a lot more with computers and things generally if we knew how to build things this way. The secret to biology is, it builds computation into the way it makes things. So this little thing here, polymerase, is essentially a supercomputer designed for replicating DNA. And the ribosome here is another little computer that helps in the translation of the proteins. I thought about this in the sense that it's great to build in biological materials, but can we do similar things? Can we get self-replicating-type behavior? Can we get complex 3D structure automatically assembling in inorganic systems? Because there are some advantages to inorganic systems, like higher speed semiconductors, etc.So, this is some of my work on how do you do an autonomously self-replicating system. And this is sort of Babbage's revenge. These are little mechanical computers. These are five-state state machines. So, that's about three light switches lined up. In a neutral state, they won't bind at all. Now, if I make a string of these, a bit string, they will be able to replicate. So we start with white, blue, blue, white. That encodes; that will now copy. From one comes two, and then from two comes three. And so you've got this sort of replicating system. It was work actually by Lionel Penrose, father of Roger Penrose, the tiles guy. He did a lot of this work in the '60s, and so a lot of this logic theory lay fallow as we went down the digital computer revolution, but it's now coming back.So now I'm going to show you the hands-free, autonomous self-replication. So we've tracked in the video the input string, which was green, green, yellow, yellow, green. We set them off on this air hockey table. You know, high science uses air hockey tables \u2014(Laughter)\u2014 and if you watch this thing long enough you get dizzy, but what you're actually seeing is copies of that original string emerging from the parts bin that you have here. So we've got autonomous replication of bit strings. So, why would you want to replicate bit strings? Well, it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme, that you can take a linear string, which is a convenient thing to copy, and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3D structure. So I was trying to, you know, take the engineer's version: Can we build a mechanical system in inorganic materials that will do the same thing?So what I'm showing you here is that we can make a 2D shape \u2014 the B \u2014 assemble from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules. And the whole point of going with the extremely simple rules here, and the incredibly simple state machines in the previous design, was that you don't need digital logic to do computation. And that way you can scale things much smaller than microchips. So you can literally use these as the tiny components in the assembly process.So, Neil Gershenfeld showed you this video on Wednesday, I believe, but I'll show you again. This is literally the colored sequence of those tiles. Each different color has a different magnetic polarity, and the sequence is uniquely specifying the structure that is coming out. Now, hopefully, those of you who know anything about graph theory can look at that, and that will satisfy you that that can also do arbitrary 3D structure, and in fact, you know, I can now take a dog, carve it up and then reassemble it so it's a linear string that will fold from a sequence. And now I can actually define that three-dimensional object as a sequence of bits. So, you know, it's a pretty interesting world when you start looking at the world a little bit differently. And the universe is now a compiler. And so I'm thinking about, you know, what are the programs for programming the physical universe? And how do we think about materials and structure, sort of as an information and computation problem? Not just where you attach a micro-controller to the end point, but that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic, are the computers.Having totally absorbed this philosophy, I started looking at a lot of problems a little differently. With the universe as a computer, you can look at this droplet of water as having performed the computations. You set a couple of boundary conditions, like gravity, the surface tension, density, etc., and then you press \"execute,\" and magically, the universe produces you a perfect ball lens. So, this actually applied to the problem of \u2014 so there's a half a billion to a billion people in the world don't have access to cheap eyeglasses. So can you make a machine that could make any prescription lens very quickly on site? This is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition. If it's circular, you make a spherical lens. If it's elliptical, you can make an astigmatic lens. You then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure \u2014 so that's part of the extra program. And literally with only those two inputs \u2014 so, the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure \u2014 you can define an infinite number of lenses that cover the range of human refractive error, from minus 12 to plus eight diopters, up to four diopters of cylinder. And then literally, you now pour on a monomer. You know, I'll do a Julia Childs here. This is three minutes of UV light. And you reverse the pressure on your membrane once you've cooked it. Pop it out. I've seen this video, but I still don't know if it's going to end right.(Laughter)So you reverse this. This is a very old movie, so with the new prototypes, actually both surfaces are flexible, but this will show you the point. Now you've finished the lens, you literally pop it out. That's next year's Yves Klein, you know, eyeglasses shape. And you can see that that has a mild prescription of about minus two diopters. And as I rotate it against this side shot, you'll see that that has cylinder, and that was programmed in \u2014 literally into the physics of the system. So, this sort of thinking about structure as computation and structure as information leads to other things, like this.This is something that my people at SQUID Labs are working on at the moment, called \"electronic rope.\" So literally, you think about a rope. It has very complex structure in the weave. And under no load, it's one structure. Under a different load, it's a different structure. And you can actually exploit that by putting in a very small number of conducting fibers to actually make it a sensor. So this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope at any particular point in the rope. Just by thinking about the physics of the world, materials as the computer, you can start to do things like this.I'm going to segue a little here. I guess I'm just going to casually tell you the types of things that I think about with this. One thing I'm really interested about this right now is, how, if you're really taking this view of the universe as a computer, how do we make things in a very general sense, and how might we share the way we make things in a general sense the same way you share open source hardware? And a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits of having lots of people look at problems, share the information and work on those things together. So, a convenient thing about being a human is you move in linear time, and unless Lisa Randall changes that, we'll continue to move in linear time. So that means anything you do, or anything you make, you produce a sequence of steps \u2014 and I think Lego in the '70s nailed this, and they did it most elegantly. But they can show you how to build things in sequence. So, I'm thinking about, how can we generalize the way we make all sorts of things, so you end up with this sort of guy, right? And I think this applies across a very broad \u2014 sort of, a lot of concepts.You know, Cameron Sinclair yesterday said, \"How do I get everyone to collaborate on design globally to do housing for humanity?\" And if you've seen Amy Smith, she talks about how you get students at MIT to work with communities in Haiti. And I think we have to sort of redefine and rethink how we define structure and materials and assembly things, so that we can really share the information on how you do those things in a more profound way and build on each other's source code for structure. I don't know exactly how to do this yet, but, you know, it's something being actively thought about.So, you know, that leads to questions like, is this a compiler? Is this a sub-routine? Interesting things like that. Maybe I'm getting a little too abstract, but you know, this is the sort of \u2014 returning to our comic characters \u2014 this is sort of the universe, or a different universe view, that I think is going to be very prevalent in the future \u2014 from biotech to materials assembly. It was great to hear Bill Joy. They're starting to invest in materials science, but these are the new things in materials science. How do we put real information and real structure into new ideas, and see the world in a different way? And it's not going to be binary code that defines the computers of the universe \u2014 it's sort of an analog computer. But it's definitely an interesting new worldview.I've gone too far. So that sounds like it's it. I've probably got a couple of minutes of questions, or I can show \u2014 I think they also said that I do extreme stuff in the introduction, so I may have to explain that. So maybe I'll do that with this short video.So this is actually a 3,000-square-foot kite, which also happens to be a minimal energy surface. So returning to the droplet, again, thinking about the universe in a new way. This is a kite designed by a guy called Dave Kulp. And why do you want a 3,000-square-foot kite? So that's a kite the size of your house. And so you want that to tow boats very fast. So I've been working on this a little, also, with a couple of other guys. But, you know, this is another way to look at the \u2014 if you abstract again, this is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe. You could just hang it as a bed sheet, but again, the computation of all the physics gives you the aerodynamic shape. And so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed with systems like that. So that's sort of another interesting aspect of the future.(Applause)", "id": 48, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:12.958\nSo anyway, who am I?\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nI usually say to people, when they say, \"What do you do?\"\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nI say, \"I do hardware,\"\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nbecause it sort of conveniently encompasses everything I do.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nAnd I recently said that to a venture capitalist casually at some\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nValley event, to which he replied, \"How quaint.\"\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nAnd I sort of really was dumbstruck.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nAnd I really should have said something smart.\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nAnd now I've had a little bit of time to think about it,\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nI would have said, \"Well, you know,\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nif we look at the next 100 years\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nand we've seen all these problems in the last few days,\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nmost of the big issues -- clean water, clean energy --\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nand they're interchangeable in some respects --\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nand cleaner, more functional materials --\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nthey all look to me to be hardware problems.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nThis doesn't mean we should ignore software,\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nor information, or computation.\"\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nAnd that's in fact probably what I'm going to try and tell you about.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nSo, this talk is going to be about how do we make things\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nand what are the new ways that we're going to make things in the future.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nNow, TED sends you a lot of spam if you're a speaker\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nabout \"do this, do that\" and you fill out all these forms,\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nand you don't actually know how they're going to describe you,\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nand it flashed across my desk that they were going to introduce me as a futurist.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nAnd I've always been nervous about the term \"futurist,\"\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nbecause you seem doomed to failure because you can't really predict it.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nAnd I was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues I have,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nand said, \"You know, well, if I have to talk about the future, what is it?\"\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nAnd George Homsey, a great guy, said, \"Oh, the future is amazing.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nIt is so much stranger than you think.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nWe're going to reprogram the bacteria in your gut,\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nand we're going to make your poo smell like peppermint.\"\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nSo, you may think that's sort of really crazy,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nbut there are some pretty amazing things that are happening\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nthat make this possible.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nSo, this isn't my work, but it's work of good friends of mine at MIT.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nThis is called the registry of standard biological parts.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nThis is headed by Drew Endy and Tom Knight\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nand a few other very, very bright individuals.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nBasically, what they're doing is looking at biology as a programmable system.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nLiterally, think of proteins as subroutines\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nthat you can string together to execute a program.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nNow, this is actually becoming such an interesting idea.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nThis is a state diagram. That's an extremely simple computer.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nThis one is a two-bit counter.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nSo that's essentially the computational equivalent of two light switches.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nAnd this is being built by a group of students at Zurich\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nfor a design competition in biology.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nAnd from the results of the same competition last year,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:45.958\na University of Texas team of students programmed bacteria\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nso that they can detect light and switch on and off.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nSo this is interesting in the sense that you can now\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:55.958\ndo \"if-then-for\" statements in materials, in structure.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nThis is a pretty interesting trend,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nbecause we used to live in a world where everyone's said glibly,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:03.958\n\"Form follows function,\" but I think I've sort of grown up in a world\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\n-- you listened to Neil Gershenfeld yesterday;\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nI was in a lab associated with his -- where it's really a world\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nwhere information defines form and function.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nI spent six years thinking about that,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nbut to show you the power of art over science --\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nthis is actually one of the cartoons I write. These are called \"HowToons.\"\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nI work with a fabulous illustrator called Nick Dragotta.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nTook me six years at MIT,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nand about that many pages to describe what I was doing,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nand it took him one page. And so this is our muse Tucker.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nHe's an interesting little kid -- and his sister, Celine --\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nand what he's doing here\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nis observing the self-assembly of his Cheerios in his cereal bowl.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nAnd in fact you can program the self-assembly of things,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nso he starts chocolate-dipping edges,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nchanging the hydrophobicity and the hydrophylicity.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nIn theory, if you program those sufficiently,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nyou should be able to do something pretty interesting\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nand make a very complex structure.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nIn this case, he's done self-replication of a complex 3D structure.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nAnd that's what I thought about for a long time,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nbecause this is how we currently make things.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nThis is a silicon wafer, and essentially\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nthat's just a whole bunch of layers of two-dimensional stuff, sort of layered up.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nThe feature side is -- you know, people will say,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\n[unclear] down around about 65 nanometers now.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nOn the right, that's a radiolara.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nThat's a unicellular organism ubiquitous in the oceans.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nAnd that has feature sizes down to about 20 nanometers,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nand it's a complex 3D structure.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nWe could do a lot more with computers and things generally\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nif we knew how to build things this way.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nThe secret to biology is, it builds computation\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\ninto the way it makes things. So this little thing here, polymerase,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nis essentially a supercomputer designed for replicating DNA.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nAnd the ribosome here is another little computer\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nthat helps in the translation of the proteins.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nI thought about this\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nin the sense that it's great to build in biological materials,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nbut can we do similar things?\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nCan we get self-replicating-type behavior?\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nCan we get complex 3D structure automatically assembling\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nin inorganic systems?\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nBecause there are some advantages to inorganic systems,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nlike higher speed semiconductors, etc.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nSo, this is some of my work\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:16.958\non how do you do an autonomously self-replicating system.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nAnd this is sort of Babbage's revenge.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nThese are little mechanical computers.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nThese are five-state state machines.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nSo, that's about three light switches lined up.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nIn a neutral state, they won't bind at all.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nNow, if I make a string of these, a bit string,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nthey will be able to replicate.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nSo we start with white, blue, blue, white.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nThat encodes; that will now copy. From one comes two,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nand then from two comes three.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAnd so you've got this sort of replicating system.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nIt was work actually by Lionel Penrose,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nfather of Roger Penrose, the tiles guy.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nHe did a lot of this work in the '60s,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nand so a lot of this logic theory lay fallow\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nas we went down the digital computer revolution, but it's now coming back.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nSo now I'm going to show you the hands-free, autonomous self-replication.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nSo we've tracked in the video the input string,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nwhich was green, green, yellow, yellow, green.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nWe set them off on this air hockey table.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nYou know, high science uses air hockey tables --\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\n-- and if you watch this thing long enough you get dizzy,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nbut what you're actually seeing is copies of that original string\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nemerging from the parts bin that you have here.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nSo we've got autonomous replication of bit strings.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nSo, why would you want to replicate bit strings?\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nWell, it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nthat you can take a linear string, which is a convenient thing to copy,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nand you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3D structure.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nSo I was trying to, you know, take the engineer's version:\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nCan we build a mechanical system in inorganic materials\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nthat will do the same thing?\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nSo what I'm showing you here is that we can make a 2D shape --\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nthe B -- assemble from a string of components\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nthat follow extremely simple rules.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nAnd the whole point of going with the extremely simple rules here,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nand the incredibly simple state machines in the previous design,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nwas that you don't need digital logic to do computation.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nAnd that way you can scale things much smaller than microchips.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nSo you can literally use these as the tiny components in the assembly process.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nSo, Neil Gershenfeld showed you this video on Wednesday, I believe,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nbut I'll show you again.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nThis is literally the colored sequence of those tiles.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nEach different color has a different magnetic polarity,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nand the sequence is uniquely specifying the structure that is coming out.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nNow, hopefully, those of you who know anything about graph theory\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\ncan look at that, and that will satisfy you\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nthat that can also do arbitrary 3D structure,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nand in fact, you know, I can now take a dog, carve it up\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nand then reassemble it so it's a linear string\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nthat will fold from a sequence. And now\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nI can actually define that three-dimensional object as a sequence of bits.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nSo, you know, it's a pretty interesting world\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nwhen you start looking at the world a little bit differently.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nAnd the universe is now a compiler.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nAnd so I'm thinking about, you know, what are the programs\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nfor programming the physical universe?\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nAnd how do we think about materials and structure,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nsort of as an information and computation problem?\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nNot just where you attach a micro-controller to the end point,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nbut that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic, are the computers.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nHaving totally absorbed this philosophy,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nI started looking at a lot of problems a little differently.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nWith the universe as a computer,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nyou can look at this droplet of water\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nas having performed the computations.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nYou set a couple of boundary conditions, like gravity,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nthe surface tension, density, etc., and then you press \"execute,\"\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nand magically, the universe produces you a perfect ball lens.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nSo, this actually applied to the problem\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nof -- so there's a half a billion to a billion people in the world\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\ndon't have access to cheap eyeglasses.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nSo can you make a machine\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nthat could make any prescription lens very quickly on site?\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nThis is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nIf it's circular, you make a spherical lens.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nIf it's elliptical, you can make an astigmatic lens.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nYou then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure --\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nso that's part of the extra program.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd literally with only those two inputs --\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nso, the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure --\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nyou can define an infinite number of lenses\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nthat cover the range of human refractive error,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nfrom minus 12 to plus eight diopters, up to four diopters of cylinder.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nAnd then literally, you now pour on a monomer.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nYou know, I'll do a Julia Childs here.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nThis is three minutes of UV light.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nAnd you reverse the pressure on your membrane\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nonce you've cooked it. Pop it out.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nI've seen this video, but I still don't know if it's going to end right.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nSo you reverse this. This is a very old movie,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nso with the new prototypes, actually both surfaces are flexible,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nbut this will show you the point.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nNow you've finished the lens, you literally pop it out.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nThat's next year's Yves Klein, you know, eyeglasses shape.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nAnd you can see that that has a mild prescription of about minus two diopters.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nAnd as I rotate it against this side shot, you'll see that that has cylinder,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nand that was programmed in --\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nliterally into the physics of the system.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nSo, this sort of thinking about structure as computation\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nand structure as information leads to other things, like this.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nThis is something that my people at SQUID Labs\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nare working on at the moment, called \"electronic rope.\"\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nSo literally, you think about a rope. It has very complex structure in the weave.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nAnd under no load, it's one structure.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nUnder a different load, it's a different structure. And you can actually exploit that\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nby putting in a very small number of\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nconducting fibers to actually make it a sensor.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nSo this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nat any particular point in the rope.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nJust by thinking about the physics of the world,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nmaterials as the computer,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nyou can start to do things like this.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nI'm going to segue a little here.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nI guess I'm just going to casually tell you the types of things\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nthat I think about with this.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nOne thing I'm really interested about this right now is, how,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nif you're really taking this view of the universe as a computer,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nhow do we make things in a very general sense,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nand how might we share the way we make things in a general sense\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nthe same way you share open source hardware?\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nAnd a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nof having lots of people look at problems,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nshare the information and work on those things together.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nSo, a convenient thing about being a human is you move in linear time,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nand unless Lisa Randall changes that,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nwe'll continue to move in linear time.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nSo that means anything you do, or anything you make,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nyou produce a sequence of steps --\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nand I think Lego in the '70s nailed this,\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nand they did it most elegantly.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nBut they can show you how to build things in sequence.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nSo, I'm thinking about, how can we generalize\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nthe way we make all sorts of things,\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nso you end up with this sort of guy, right?\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nAnd I think this applies across a very broad -- sort of, a lot of concepts.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nYou know, Cameron Sinclair yesterday said,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\n\"How do I get everyone to collaborate on design\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nglobally to do housing for humanity?\"\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nAnd if you've seen Amy Smith,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nshe talks about how you get students at MIT\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nto work with communities in Haiti.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nAnd I think we have to sort of redefine and rethink\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nhow we define structure and materials and assembly things,\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nso that we can really share the information\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\non how you do those things in a more profound way\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nand build on each other's source code for structure.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nI don't know exactly how to do this yet,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nbut, you know, it's something being actively thought about.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nSo, you know, that leads to questions\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nlike, is this a compiler? Is this a sub-routine?\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nInteresting things like that.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nMaybe I'm getting a little too abstract, but you know,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nthis is the sort of -- returning to our comic characters --\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nthis is sort of the universe, or a different universe view,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nthat I think is going to be very prevalent in the future --\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nfrom biotech to materials assembly. It was great to hear Bill Joy.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nThey're starting to invest in materials science,\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nbut these are the new things in materials science.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nHow do we put real information and real structure into new ideas,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nand see the world in a different way? And it's not going to be binary code\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nthat defines the computers of the universe --\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nit's sort of an analog computer.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nBut it's definitely an interesting new worldview.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nI've gone too far. So that sounds like it's it.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nI've probably got a couple of minutes of questions,\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nor I can show -- I think they also said that I do extreme stuff\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nin the introduction, so I may have to explain that.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nSo maybe I'll do that with this short video.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nSo this is actually a 3,000-square-foot kite,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nwhich also happens to be a minimal energy surface.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nSo returning to the droplet, again,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nthinking about the universe in a new way.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nThis is a kite designed by a guy called Dave Kulp.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nAnd why do you want a 3,000-square-foot kite?\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nSo that's a kite the size of your house.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nAnd so you want that to tow boats very fast.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nSo I've been working on this a little, also,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nwith a couple of other guys.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nBut, you know, this is another way to look at the --\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nif you abstract again,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nthis is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nYou could just hang it as a bed sheet,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nbut again, the computation of all the physics\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\ngives you the aerodynamic shape.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nAnd so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nwith systems like that. So that's sort of another interesting aspect of the future.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:23.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Unleash your creativity in a Fab Lab", "duration": "1038", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/neil_gershenfeld_on_fab_labs", "transcript": "This meeting has really been about a digital revolution, but I'd like to argue that it's done; we won. We've had a digital revolution but we don't need to keep having it. And I'd like to look after that, to look what comes after the digital revolution. So, let me start projecting forward. These are some projects I'm involved in today at MIT, looking what comes after computers.This first one, Internet Zero, up here \u2014 this is a web server that has the cost and complexity of an RFID tag \u2014 about a dollar \u2014 that can go in every light bulb and doorknob, and this is getting commercialized very quickly. And what's interesting about it isn't the cost; it's the way it encodes the Internet. It uses a kind of a Morse code for the Internet so you could send it optically; you can communicate acoustically through a power line, through RF. It takes the original principle of the Internet, which is inter-networking computers, and now lets devices inter-network. That we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the Internet and bring it down to the physical world in this Internet Zero, this internet of devices.So this is the next step from there to here, and this is getting commercialized today. A step after that is a project on fungible computers. Fungible goods in economics can be extended and traded. So, half as much grain is half as much useful, but half a baby or half a computer is less useful than a whole baby or a whole computer, and we've been trying to make computers that work that way. So, what you see in the background is a prototype. This was from a thesis of a student, Bill Butow, now at Intel, who wondered why, instead of making bigger and bigger chips, you don't make small chips, put them in a viscous medium, and pour out computing by the pound or by the square inch. And that's what you see here. On the left was postscript being rendered by a conventional computer; on the right is postscript being rendered from the first prototype we made, but there's no frame buffer, IO processor, any of that stuff \u2014 it's just this material. Unlike this screen where the dots are placed carefully, this is a raw material. If you add twice as much of it, you have twice as much display. If you shoot a gun through the middle, nothing happens. If you need more resource, you just apply more computer.So, that's the step after this \u2014 of computing as a raw material. That's still conventional bits, the step after that is \u2014 this is an earlier prototype in the lab; this is high-speed video slowed down. Now, integrating chemistry in computation, where the bits are bubbles. This is showing making bits, this is showing \u2014 once again, slowed down so you can see it, bits interacting to do logic and multiplexing and de-multiplexing. So, now we can compute that the output arranges material as well as information. And, ultimately, these are some slides from an early project I did, computing where the bits are stored quantum-mechanically in the nuclei of atoms, so programs rearrange the nuclear structure of molecules. All of these are in the lab pushing further and further and further, not as metaphor but literally integrating bits and atoms, and they lead to the following recognition.We all know we've had a digital revolution, but what is that? Well, Shannon took us, in the '40s, from here to here: from a telephone being a speaker wire that degraded with distance to the Internet. And he proved the first threshold theorem, that shows if you add information and remove it to a signal, you can compute perfectly with an imperfect device. And that's when we got the Internet. Von Neumann, in the '50s, did the same thing for computing; he showed you can have an unreliable computer but restore its state to make it perfect. This was the last great analog computer at MIT: a differential analyzer, and the more you ran it, the worse the answer got.After Von Neumann, we have the Pentium, where the billionth transistor is as reliable as the first one. But all our fabrication is down in this lower left corner. A state-of-the-art airplane factory rotating metal wax at fixed metal, or you maybe melt some plastic. A 10-billion-dollar chip fab uses a process a village artisan would recognize \u2014 you spread stuff around and bake it. All the intelligence is external to the system; the materials don't have information. Yesterday you heard about molecular biology, which fundamentally computes to build. It's an information processing system. We've had digital revolutions in communication and computation, but precisely the same idea, precisely the same math Shannon and Von Neuman did, hasn't yet come out to the physical world. So, inspired by that, colleagues in this program \u2014 the Center for Bits and Atoms at MIT \u2014 which is a group of people, like me, who never understood the boundary between physical science and computer science. I would even go further and say computer science is one of the worst things that ever happened to either computers or to science \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 because the canon \u2014 computer science \u2014 many of them are great but the canon of computer science prematurely froze a model of computation based on technology that was available in 1950, and nature's a much more powerful computer than that.So, you'll hear, tomorrow, from Saul Griffith. He was one of the first students to emerge from this program. We started to figure out how you can compute to fabricate. This was just a proof of principle he did of tiles that interact magnetically, where you write a code, much like protein folding, that specifies their structure. So, there's no feedback to a tool metrology; the material itself codes for its structure in just the same ways that protein are fabricated. So, you can, for example, do that. You can do other things. That's in 2D. It works in 3D. The video on the upper right \u2014 I won't show for time \u2014 shows self-replication, templating so something can make something that can make something, and we're doing that now over, maybe, nine orders of magnitude. Those ideas have been used to show the best fidelity and direct rate DNA to make an organism, in functionalizing nanoclusters with peptide tails that code for their assembly \u2014 so, much like the magnets, but now on nanometer scales. Laser micro-machining: essentially 3D printers that digitally fabricate functional systems, all the way up to building buildings, not by having blueprints, but having the parts code for the structure of the building.So, these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies to digitize fabrication. Computers that don't control tools but computers that are tools, where the output of a program rearranges atoms as well as bits. Now, to do that \u2014 with your tax dollars, thank you \u2014 I bought all these machines. We made a modest proposal to the NSF. We wanted to be able to make anything on any length scale, all in one place, because you can't segregate digital fabrication by a discipline or a length scale. So we put together focused nano beam writers and supersonic water jet cutters and excimer micro-machining systems.But I had a problem. Once I had all these machines, I was spending too much time teaching students to use them. So I started teaching a class, modestly called, \"How To Make Almost Anything.\" And that wasn't meant to be provocative; it was just for a few research students. But the first day of class looked like this. You know, hundreds of people came in begging, all my life I've been waiting for this class; I'll do anything to do it. Then they'd ask, can you teach it at MIT? It seems too useful? And then the next \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 surprising thing was they weren't there to do research. They were there because they wanted to make stuff. They had no conventional technical background. At the end of a semester they integrated their skills.I'll show an old video. Kelly was a sculptor, and this is what she did with her semester project.(Video): Kelly: Hi, I'm Kelly and this is my scream buddy. Do you ever find yourself in a situation where you really have to scream, but you can't because you're at work, or you're in a classroom, or you're watching your children, or you're in any number of situations where it's just not permitted? Well, scream buddy is a portable space for screaming. When a user screams into scream buddy, their scream is silenced. It is also recorded for later release where, when and how the user chooses. (Scream) (Laughter) (Applause)So, Einstein would like this. This student made a web browser for parrots \u2014 lets parrots surf the Net and talk to other parrots. This student's made an alarm clock you wrestle to prove you're awake; this is one that defends \u2014 a dress that defends your personal space. This isn't technology for communication; it's technology to prevent it. This is a device that lets you see your music. This is a student who made a machine that makes machines, and he made it by making Lego bricks that do the computing. Just year after year \u2014 and I finally realized the students were showing the killer app of personal fabrication is products for a market of one person. You don't need this for what you can get in Wal-Mart; you need this for what makes you unique. Ken Olsen famously said, nobody needs a computer in the home. But you don't use it for inventory and payroll; DEC is now twice bankrupt. You don't need personal fabrication in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it. You need it for what makes you unique, just like personalization. So, with that, in turn, 20 million dollars today does this; 20 years from now we'll make Star Trek replicators that make anything. The students hijacked all the machines I bought to do personal fabrication.Today, when you spend that much of your money, there's a government requirement to do outreach, which often means classes at a local school, a website \u2014 stuff that's just not that exciting. So, I made a deal with my NSF program managers that instead of talking about it, I'd give people the tools. This wasn't meant to be provocative or important, but we put together these Fab Labs. It's about 20,000 dollars in equipment that approximate both what the 20 million dollars does and where it's going. A laser cutter to do press-fit assembly with 3D from 2D, a sign cutter to plot in copper to do electromagnetics, a micron scale, numerically-controlled milling machine for precise structures, programming tools for less than a dollar, 100-nanosecond microcontrollers. It lets you work from microns and microseconds on up, and they exploded around the world. This wasn't scheduled, but they went from inner-city Boston to Pobal in India, to Secondi-Takoradi on Ghana's coast to Soshanguve in a township in South Africa, to the far north of Norway, uncovering, or helping uncover, for all the attention to the digital divide, we would find unused computers in all these places. A farmer in a rural village \u2014 a kid needs to measure and modify the world, not just get information about it on a screen. That there's really a fabrication and an instrumentation divide bigger than the digital divide. And the way you close it is not IT for the masses but IT development for the masses.So, in place after place we saw this same progression: that we'd open one of these Fab Labs, where we didn't \u2014 this is too crazy to think of. We didn't think this up, that we would get pulled to these places; we'd open it. The first step was just empowerment. You can see it in their face, just this joy of, I can do it. This is a girl in inner-city Boston who had just done a high-tech on-demand craft sale in the inner city community center. It goes on from there to serious hands-on technical education informally, out of schools. In Ghana we had set up one of these labs. We designed a network sensor, and kids would show up and refuse to leave the lab. There was a girl who insisted we stay late at night \u2014 (Video): Kids: I love the Fab Lab. \u2014 her first night in the lab because she was going to make the sensor. So she insisted on fabbing the board, learning how to stuff it, learning how to program it. She didn't really know what she was doing or why she was doing it, but she knew she just had to do it. There was something electric about it. This is late at, you know, 11 o'clock at night and I think I was the only person surprised when what she built worked the first time. And I've shown this to engineers at big companies, and they say they can't do this. Any one thing she's doing, they can do better, but it's distributed over many people and many sites and they can't do in an afternoon what this little girl in rural Ghana is doing. (Video): Girl: My name is Valentina Kofi; I am eight years old. I made a stacking board. And, again, that was just for the joy of it.Then these labs started doing serious problem solving \u2014 instrumentation for agriculture in India, steam turbines for energy conversion in Ghana, high-gain antennas in thin client computers. And then, in turn, businesses started to grow, like making these antennas. And finally, the lab started doing invention. We're learning more from them than we're giving them. I was showing my kids in a Fab Lab how to use it. They invented a way to do a construction kit out of a cardboard box \u2014 which, as you see up there, that's becoming a business \u2014 but their design was better than Saul's design at MIT, so there's now three students at MIT doing their theses on scaling the work of eight-year-old children because they had better designs. Real invention is happening in these labs.And I still kept \u2014 so, in the last year I've been spending time with heads of state and generals and tribal chiefs who all want this, and I keep saying, but this isn't the real thing. Wait, like, 20 years and then we'll be done. And I finally got what's been going on. This is Kernigan and Ritchie inventing UNIX on a PDP. PDPs came between mainframes and minicomputers. They were tens of thousands of dollars, hard to use, but they brought computing down to work groups, and everything we do today happened there. These Fab Labs are the cost and complexity of a PDP. The projection of digital fabrication isn't a projection for the future; we are now in the PDP era. We talked in hushed tones about the great discoveries then. It was very chaotic, it wasn't, sort of, clear what was going on. In the same sense we are now, today, in the minicomputer era of digital fabrication. The only problem with that is it breaks everybody's boundaries.In DC, I go to every agency that wants to talk, you know; in the Bay Area, I go to every organization you can think of \u2014 they all want to talk about it, but it breaks their organizational boundaries. In fact, it's illegal for them, in many cases, to equip ordinary people to create rather than consume technology. And that problem is so severe that the ultimate invention coming from this community surprised me: it's the social engineering. That the lab in far north of Norway \u2014 this is so far north its satellite dishes look at the ground rather than the sky because that's where the satellites are \u2014 the lab outgrew the little barn that it was in. It was there because they wanted to find animals in the mountains but it outgrew it, so they built this extraordinary village for the lab. This isn't a university; it's not a company. It's essentially a village for invention; it's a village for the outliers in society, and those have been growing up around these Fab Labs all around the world.So this program has split into an NGO foundation, a Fab Foundation to support the scaling, a micro VC fund. The person who runs it nicely describes it as \"machines that make machines need businesses that make businesses:\" it's a cross between micro-finance and VC to do fan-out, and then the research partnerships back at MIT for what's making it possible.So I'd like to leave you with two thoughts. There's been a sea change in aid, from top-down mega-projects to bottom-up, grassroots, micro-finance investing in the roots, so that everybody's got that that's what works. But we still look at technology as top-down mega-projects. Computing, communication, energy for the rest of the planet are these top-down mega-projects. If this room full of heroes is just clever enough, you can solve the problems. The message coming from the Fab Labs is that the other five billion people on the planet aren't just technical sinks; they're sources. The real opportunity is to harness the inventive power of the world to locally design and produce solutions to local problems. I thought that's the projection 20 years hence into the future, but it's where we are today. It breaks every organizational boundary we can think of. The hardest thing at this point is the social engineering and the organizational engineering, but it's here today.And, finally, any talk like this on the future of computing is required to show Moore's law, but my favorite version \u2014 this is Gordon Moore's original one from his original paper \u2014 and what's happened is, year after year after year, we've scaled and we've scaled and we've scaled and we've scaled, and we've scaled and we've scaled, and we've scaled and we've scaled, and there's this looming bug of what's going to happen at the end of Moore's law; this ultimate bug is coming. But we're coming to appreciate, is the transition from 2D to 3D, from programming bits to programming atoms, turns the ends of Moore's law scaling from the ultimate bug to the ultimate feature. So, we're just at the edge of this digital revolution in fabrication, where the output of computation programs the physical world. So, together, these two projects answer questions I hadn't asked carefully. The class at MIT shows the killer app for personal fabrication in the developed world is technology for a market of one: personal expression in technology that touches a passion unlike anything I've seen in technology for a very long time. And the killer app for the rest of the planet is the instrumentation and the fabrication divide: people locally developing solutions to local problems. Thank you.", "id": 90, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nThis meeting has really been about a digital revolution,\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nbut I'd like to argue that it's done; we won.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nWe've had a digital revolution but we don't need to keep having it.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nAnd I'd like to look after that,\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nto look what comes after the digital revolution.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nSo, let me start projecting forward.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nThese are some projects I'm involved in today at MIT,\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nlooking what comes after computers.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nThis first one, Internet Zero, up here -- this is a web server\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nthat has the cost and complexity of an RFID tag --\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nabout a dollar -- that can go in every light bulb and doorknob,\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nand this is getting commercialized very quickly.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nAnd what's interesting about it isn't the cost;\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nit's the way it encodes the Internet.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nIt uses a kind of a Morse code for the Internet\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nso you could send it optically; you can communicate acoustically\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nthrough a power line, through RF.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nIt takes the original principle of the Internet,\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nwhich is inter-networking computers,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nand now lets devices inter-network.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nThat we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the Internet\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nand bring it down to the physical world in this Internet Zero,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nthis internet of devices.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nSo this is the next step from there to here,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nand this is getting commercialized today.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nA step after that is a project on fungible computers.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nFungible goods in economics can be extended and traded.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nSo, half as much grain is half as much useful,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nbut half a baby or half a computer is less useful than\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\na whole baby or a whole computer,\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nand we've been trying to make computers that work that way.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nSo, what you see in the background is a prototype.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nThis was from a thesis of a student, Bill Butow, now at Intel,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nwho wondered why, instead of making bigger and bigger chips,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nyou don't make small chips, put them in a viscous medium,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nand pour out computing by the pound or by the square inch.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nAnd that's what you see here.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nOn the left was postscript being rendered by a conventional computer;\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\non the right is postscript being rendered from the first prototype\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nwe made, but there's no frame buffer, IO processor,\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nany of that stuff -- it's just this material.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nUnlike this screen where the dots are placed carefully,\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nthis is a raw material.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nIf you add twice as much of it, you have twice as much display.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nIf you shoot a gun through the middle, nothing happens.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nIf you need more resource, you just apply more computer.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nSo, that's the step after this -- of computing as a raw material.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nThat's still conventional bits, the step after that is --\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nthis is an earlier prototype in the lab;\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nthis is high-speed video slowed down.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nNow, integrating chemistry in computation, where the bits are bubbles.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nThis is showing making bits, this is showing --\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nonce again, slowed down so you can see it,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nbits interacting to do logic and multiplexing and de-multiplexing.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nSo, now we can compute that the output arranges material\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nas well as information. And, ultimately, these are some slides\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nfrom an early project I did, computing where the bits are stored\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nquantum-mechanically in the nuclei of atoms, so\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nprograms rearrange the nuclear structure of molecules.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nAll of these are in the lab pushing further and further and further,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nnot as metaphor but literally integrating bits and atoms,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nand they lead to the following recognition.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nWe all know we've had a digital revolution, but what is that?\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nWell, Shannon took us, in the '40s, from here to here:\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nfrom a telephone being a speaker wire that degraded with distance\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nto the Internet. And he proved the first threshold theorem, that shows\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nif you add information and remove it to a signal,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nyou can compute perfectly with an imperfect device.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nAnd that's when we got the Internet.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nVon Neumann, in the '50s, did the same thing for computing;\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nhe showed you can have an unreliable computer but restore its state\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nto make it perfect. This was the last great analog computer at MIT:\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\na differential analyzer, and the more you ran it,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nthe worse the answer got.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nAfter Von Neumann, we have the Pentium, where the billionth transistor\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nis as reliable as the first one.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nBut all our fabrication is down in this lower left corner.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nA state-of-the-art airplane factory rotating metal wax at fixed metal,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nor you maybe melt some plastic. A 10-billion-dollar chip fab\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nuses a process a village artisan would recognize --\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nyou spread stuff around and bake it.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nAll the intelligence is external to the system;\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nthe materials don't have information.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nYesterday you heard about molecular biology,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nwhich fundamentally computes to build.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nIt's an information processing system.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nWe've had digital revolutions in communication and computation,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nbut precisely the same idea, precisely the same math\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nShannon and Von Neuman did, hasn't yet come out\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nto the physical world. So, inspired by that,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\ncolleagues in this program -- the Center for Bits and Atoms\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nat MIT -- which is a group of people, like me,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nwho never understood the boundary between physical science\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nand computer science. I would even go further and say\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\ncomputer science is one of the worst things that ever happened\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nto either computers or to science --\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:42.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.958\n-- because the canon -- computer science --\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nmany of them are great but the canon of computer science\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nprematurely froze a model of computation\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nbased on technology that was available in 1950,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nand nature's a much more powerful computer than that.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nSo, you'll hear, tomorrow, from Saul Griffith. He was one of the\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nfirst students to emerge from this program.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nWe started to figure out how you can compute to fabricate.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nThis was just a proof of principle he did of tiles\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nthat interact magnetically, where you write a code,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nmuch like protein folding, that specifies their structure.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nSo, there's no feedback to a tool metrology;\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nthe material itself codes for its structure in just the same ways\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nthat protein are fabricated. So, you can, for example, do that.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nYou can do other things. That's in 2D. It works in 3D.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nThe video on the upper right -- I won't show for time --\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nshows self-replication, templating so something can make something\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nthat can make something, and we're doing that now over, maybe,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nnine orders of magnitude. Those ideas have been used to show\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nthe best fidelity and direct rate DNA to make an organism,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nin functionalizing nanoclusters with peptide tails\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nthat code for their assembly -- so, much like the magnets,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nbut now on nanometer scales.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nLaser micro-machining: essentially 3D printers that digitally fabricate\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nfunctional systems, all the way up to building buildings,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nnot by having blueprints,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nbut having the parts code for the structure of the building.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nSo, these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nto digitize fabrication. Computers that don't control tools\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nbut computers that are tools, where the output of a program\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nrearranges atoms as well as bits.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nNow, to do that -- with your tax dollars, thank you --\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nI bought all these machines. We made a modest proposal\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nto the NSF. We wanted to be able to make anything on any length scale,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nall in one place, because you can't segregate digital fabrication\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nby a discipline or a length scale.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nSo we put together focused nano beam writers\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand supersonic water jet cutters and excimer micro-machining systems.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nBut I had a problem. Once I had all these machines,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nI was spending too much time teaching students to use them.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nSo I started teaching a class, modestly called,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\n\"How To Make Almost Anything.\" And that wasn't meant to be provocative;\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nit was just for a few research students.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nBut the first day of class looked like this.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nYou know, hundreds of people came in begging,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nall my life I've been waiting for this class; I'll do anything to do it.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nThen they'd ask, can you teach it at MIT? It seems too useful?\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nAnd then the next --\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:12.958\n-- surprising thing was they weren't there to do research.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nThey were there because they wanted to make stuff.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nThey had no conventional technical background.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nAt the end of a semester they integrated their skills.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nI'll show an old video. Kelly was a sculptor, and this is what she did\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nwith her semester project.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\n(Video): Kelly: Hi, I'm Kelly and this is my scream buddy.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nDo you ever find yourself in a situation\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nwhere you really have to scream, but you can't because you're at work,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nor you're in a classroom, or you're watching your children,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nor you're in any number of situations where it's just not permitted?\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nWell, scream buddy is a portable space for screaming.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nWhen a user screams into scream buddy, their scream is silenced.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nIt is also recorded for later release where, when and how\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nthe user chooses.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\n(Scream)\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.958\n(Laughter) (Applause)\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nSo, Einstein would like this.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nThis student made a web browser for parrots --\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nlets parrots surf the Net and talk to other parrots.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nThis student's made an alarm clock you wrestle\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nto prove you're awake; this is one that defends --\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\na dress that defends your personal space.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nThis isn't technology for communication;\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nit's technology to prevent it.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nThis is a device that lets you see your music.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nThis is a student who made a machine that makes machines,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nand he made it by making Lego bricks that do the computing.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nJust year after year -- and I finally realized\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nthe students were showing the killer app of personal fabrication\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nis products for a market of one person.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nYou don't need this for what you can get in Wal-Mart;\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nyou need this for what makes you unique.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nKen Olsen famously said, nobody needs a computer in the home.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nBut you don't use it for inventory and payroll;\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nDEC is now twice bankrupt. You don't need personal fabrication\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nin the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nYou need it for what makes you unique, just like personalization.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nSo, with that, in turn, 20 million dollars today does this;\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:28.958\n20 years from now we'll make Star Trek replicators that make anything.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nThe students hijacked all the machines I bought to do personal fabrication.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nToday, when you spend that much of your money,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nthere's a government requirement to do outreach, which often means\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nclasses at a local school, a website -- stuff that's just not that exciting.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nSo, I made a deal with my NSF program managers that\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\ninstead of talking about it, I'd give people the tools.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nThis wasn't meant to be provocative or important,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nbut we put together these Fab Labs. It's about 20,000 dollars in equipment\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nthat approximate both what the 20 million dollars does and where it's going.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nA laser cutter to do press-fit assembly with 3D from 2D,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\na sign cutter to plot in copper to do electromagnetics,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\na micron scale,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nnumerically-controlled milling machine for precise structures,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nprogramming tools for less than a dollar,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\n100-nanosecond microcontrollers. It lets you work from microns\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nand microseconds on up, and they exploded around the world.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nThis wasn't scheduled, but they went from inner-city Boston\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nto Pobal in India, to Secondi-Takoradi on Ghana's coast\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nto Soshanguve in a township in South Africa,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nto the far north of Norway, uncovering, or helping uncover,\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nfor all the attention to the digital divide,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nwe would find unused computers in all these places.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nA farmer in a rural village -- a kid needs to measure and modify\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nthe world, not just get information about it on a screen.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nThat there's really a fabrication and an instrumentation divide\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nbigger than the digital divide.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nAnd the way you close it is not IT for the masses but IT development for the masses.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nSo, in place after place\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nwe saw this same progression: that we'd open one of these Fab Labs,\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nwhere we didn't -- this is too crazy to think of.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nWe didn't think this up, that we would get pulled to these places;\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nwe'd open it. The first step was just empowerment.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nYou can see it in their face, just this joy of, I can do it.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nThis is a girl in inner-city Boston who had just done a high-tech\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:14.958\non-demand craft sale in the inner city community center.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nIt goes on from there to serious hands-on technical education\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:23.958\ninformally, out of schools. In Ghana we had set up one of these labs.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nWe designed a network sensor, and kids would show up\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nand refuse to leave the lab.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nThere was a girl who insisted we stay late at night --\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\n(Video): Kids: I love the Fab Lab.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\n-- her first night in the lab because she was going to make the sensor.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nSo she insisted on fabbing the board, learning how to stuff it,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nlearning how to program it. She didn't really know\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nwhat she was doing or why she was doing it, but she knew\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nshe just had to do it. There was something electric about it.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nThis is late at, you know, 11 o'clock at night\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nand I think I was the only person surprised when what she built\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nworked the first time.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nAnd I've shown this to engineers at big companies, and they say\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nthey can't do this. Any one thing she's doing, they can do better,\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nbut it's distributed over many people and many sites\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nand they can't do in an afternoon\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nwhat this little girl in rural Ghana is doing.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:23.958\n(Video): Girl: My name is Valentina Kofi; I am eight years old.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nI made a stacking board.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nAnd, again, that was just for the joy of it.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nThen these labs started doing serious problem solving --\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\ninstrumentation for agriculture in India,\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nsteam turbines for energy conversion in Ghana,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nhigh-gain antennas in thin client computers.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nAnd then, in turn, businesses started to grow,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nlike making these antennas.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nAnd finally, the lab started doing invention.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nWe're learning more from them than we're giving them.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nI was showing my kids in a Fab Lab how to use it.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nThey invented a way to do a construction kit out of a cardboard box --\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nwhich, as you see up there, that's becoming a business --\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nbut their design was better than Saul's design at MIT,\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nso there's now three students at MIT doing their theses on\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nscaling the work of eight-year-old children\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nbecause they had better designs.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nReal invention is happening in these labs.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nAnd I still kept -- so, in the last year I've been spending time with\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nheads of state and generals and tribal chiefs who all want this,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nand I keep saying, but this isn't the real thing.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nWait, like, 20 years and then we'll be done.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nAnd I finally got what's been going on. This is Kernigan and Ritchie\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\ninventing UNIX on a PDP.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nPDPs came between mainframes and minicomputers.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nThey were tens of thousands of dollars, hard to use,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nbut they brought computing down to work groups,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nand everything we do today happened there.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nThese Fab Labs are the cost and complexity of a PDP.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nThe projection of digital fabrication\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nisn't a projection for the future; we are now in the PDP era.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nWe talked in hushed tones about the great discoveries then.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nIt was very chaotic, it wasn't, sort of, clear what was going on.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nIn the same sense we are now, today, in the minicomputer era\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nof digital fabrication.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nThe only problem with that is it breaks everybody's boundaries.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nIn DC, I go to every agency that wants to talk, you know;\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nin the Bay Area, I go to every organization you can think of --\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nthey all want to talk about it, but it breaks\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\ntheir organizational boundaries. In fact, it's illegal for them,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nin many cases, to equip ordinary people to create\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nrather than consume technology.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nAnd that problem is so severe that the ultimate invention\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\ncoming from this community surprised me:\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nit's the social engineering. That the lab in far north of Norway --\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nthis is so far north its satellite dishes look at the ground\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nrather than the sky because that's where the satellites are --\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nthe lab outgrew the little barn that it was in.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nIt was there because they wanted to find animals in the mountains\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nbut it outgrew it, so they built this extraordinary village for the lab.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nThis isn't a university; it's not a company. It's essentially\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:42.958\na village for invention; it's a village for the outliers in society,\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nand those have been growing up around these Fab Labs\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nall around the world.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nSo this program has split into an NGO foundation,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:53.958\na Fab Foundation to support the scaling, a micro VC fund.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nThe person who runs it nicely describes it as\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:58.958\n\"machines that make machines need businesses that make businesses:\"\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nit's a cross between micro-finance and VC to do fan-out,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nand then the research partnerships back at MIT for what's\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nmaking it possible.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nSo I'd like to leave you with two thoughts.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nThere's been a sea change in aid, from top-down mega-projects\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nto bottom-up, grassroots, micro-finance investing in the roots,\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nso that everybody's got that that's what works.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nBut we still look at technology as top-down mega-projects.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nComputing, communication, energy for the rest of the planet\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nare these top-down mega-projects.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nIf this room full of heroes is just clever enough,\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nyou can solve the problems.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nThe message coming from the Fab Labs is that\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nthe other five billion people on the planet\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\naren't just technical sinks; they're sources.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nThe real opportunity is to harness the inventive power of the world\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nto locally design and produce solutions to local problems.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nI thought that's the projection 20 years hence into the future,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nbut it's where we are today.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nIt breaks every organizational boundary we can think of.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nThe hardest thing at this point is the social engineering\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nand the organizational engineering, but it's here today.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nAnd, finally, any talk like this on the future of computing\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nis required to show Moore's law, but my favorite version --\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nthis is Gordon Moore's original one from his original paper --\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nand what's happened is, year after year after year,\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nwe've scaled and we've scaled and we've scaled\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nand we've scaled, and we've scaled and we've scaled,\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nand we've scaled and we've scaled,\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nand there's this looming bug of what's going to happen\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nat the end of Moore's law; this ultimate bug is coming.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nBut we're coming to appreciate, is the transition from 2D to 3D,\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nfrom programming bits to programming atoms,\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nturns the ends of Moore's law scaling from the ultimate bug\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nto the ultimate feature.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nSo, we're just at the edge of this digital revolution in fabrication,\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nwhere the output of computation programs the physical world.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nSo, together, these two projects answer questions\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nI hadn't asked carefully. The class at MIT shows the killer app\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nfor personal fabrication in the developed world\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nis technology for a market of one: personal expression in technology\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nthat touches a passion unlike anything I've seen in technology\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nfor a very long time.\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nAnd the killer app for the rest of the planet is the instrumentation\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nand the fabrication divide: people locally developing solutions\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nto local problems. Thank you."}, {"title": "In praise of slowness", "duration": "1155", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/carl_honore_praises_slowness", "transcript": "What I'd like to start off with is an observation, which is that if I've learned anything over the last year, it's that the supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness is that you have to go around promoting it really fast. I seem to spend most of my time these days zipping from city to city, studio to studio, interview to interview, serving up the book in really tiny bite-size chunks. Because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down, but they want to know how to slow down really quickly. So ... so I did a spot on CNN the other day where I actually spent more time in makeup than I did talking on air. And I think that \u2014 that's not really surprising though, is it? Because that's kind of the world that we live in now, a world stuck in fast-forward.A world obsessed with speed, with doing everything faster, with cramming more and more into less and less time. Every moment of the day feels like a race against the clock. To borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher, which is in my bio there; I'll just toss it out again \u2014 \"These days even instant gratification takes too long.\" (Laughter) And if you think about how we to try to make things better, what do we do? No, we speed them up, don't we? So we used to dial; now we speed dial. We used to read; now we speed read. We used to walk; now we speed walk. And of course, we used to date and now we speed date. And even things that are by their very nature slow \u2014 we try and speed them up too. So I was in New York recently, and I walked past a gym that had an advertisement in the window for a new course, a new evening course. And it was for, you guessed it, speed yoga. So this \u2014 the perfect solution for time-starved professionals who want to, you know, salute the sun, but only want to give over about 20 minutes to it. I mean, these are sort of the extreme examples, and they're amusing and good to laugh at.But there's a very serious point, and I think that in the headlong dash of daily life, we often lose sight of the damage that this roadrunner form of living does to us. We're so marinated in the culture of speed that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes on every aspect of our lives \u2014 on our health, our diet, our work, our relationships, the environment and our community. And sometimes it takes a wake-up call, doesn't it, to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives, instead of actually living them; that we're living the fast life, instead of the good life. And I think for many people, that wake-up call takes the form of an illness. You know, a burnout, or eventually the body says, \"I can't take it anymore,\" and throws in the towel. Or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke because we haven't had the time, or the patience, or the tranquility, to be with the other person, to listen to them.And my wake-up call came when I started reading bedtime stories to my son, and I found that at the end of day, I would go into his room and I just couldn't slow down \u2014 you know, I'd be speed reading \"The Cat In The Hat.\" I'd be \u2014 you know, I'd be skipping lines here, paragraphs there, sometimes a whole page, and of course, my little boy knew the book inside out, so we would quarrel. And what should have been the most relaxing, the most intimate, the most tender moment of the day, when a dad sits down to read to his son, became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills, a clash between my speed and his slowness. And this went on for some time, until I caught myself scanning a newspaper article with timesaving tips for fast people. And one of them made reference to a series of books called \"The One-Minute Bedtime Story.\" And I wince saying those words now, but my first reaction at the time was very different. My first reflex was to say, \"Hallelujah \u2014 what a great idea! This is exactly what I'm looking for to speed up bedtime even more.\" But thankfully, a light bulb went on over my head, and my next reaction was very different, and I took a step back, and I thought, \"Whoa \u2014 you know, has it really come to this? Am I really in such a hurry that I'm prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day?\" And I put away the newspaper \u2014 and I was getting on a plane \u2014 and I sat there, and I did something I hadn't done for a long time \u2014 which is I did nothing. I just thought, and I thought long and hard. And by the time I got off that plane, I'd decided I wanted to do something about it. I wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture, and what it was doing to me and to everyone else.And I had two questions in my head. The first was, how did we get so fast? And the second is, is it possible, or even desirable, to slow down? Now, if you think about how our world got so accelerated, the usual suspects rear their heads. You think of, you know, urbanization, consumerism, the workplace, technology. But I think if you cut through those forces, you get to what might be the deeper driver, the nub of the question, which is how we think about time itself. In other cultures, time is cyclical. It's seen as moving in great, unhurried circles. It's always renewing and refreshing itself. Whereas in the West, time is linear. It's a finite resource; it's always draining away. You either use it, or lose it. \"Time is money,\" as Benjamin Franklin said. And I think what that does to us psychologically is it creates an equation. Time is scarce, so what do we do? Well \u2014 well, we speed up, don't we? We try and do more and more with less and less time. We turn every moment of every day into a race to the finish line \u2014 a finish line, incidentally, that we never reach, but a finish line nonetheless. And I guess that the question is, is it possible to break free from that mindset? And thankfully, the answer is yes, because what I discovered, when I began looking around, that there is a global backlash against this culture that tells us that faster is always better, and that busier is best.Right across the world, people are doing the unthinkable: they're slowing down, and finding that, although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down, you're road kill, the opposite turns out to be true: that by slowing down at the right moments, people find that they do everything better. They eat better; they make love better; they exercise better; they work better; they live better. And, in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration, lie what a lot of people now refer to as the \"International Slow Movement.\"Now if you'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy, I'll just give you a very quick overview of what's going on inside the Slow Movement. If you think of food, many of you will have heard of the Slow Food movement. Started in Italy, but has spread across the world, and now has 100,000 members in 50 countries. And it's driven by a very simple and sensible message, which is that we get more pleasure and more health from our food when we cultivate, cook and consume it at a reasonable pace. I think also the explosion of the organic farming movement, and the renaissance of farmers' markets, are other illustrations of the fact that people are desperate to get away from eating and cooking and cultivating their food on an industrial timetable. They want to get back to slower rhythms. And out of the Slow Food movement has grown something called the Slow Cities movement, which has started in Italy, but has spread right across Europe and beyond. And in this, towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape, so that people are encouraged to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another. So they might curb traffic, or put in a park bench, or some green space.And in some ways, these changes add up to more than the sum of their parts, because I think when a Slow City becomes officially a Slow City, it's kind of like a philosophical declaration. It's saying to the rest of world, and to the people in that town, that we believe that in the 21st century, slowness has a role to play. In medicine, I think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned with the kind of quick-fix mentality you find in conventional medicine. And millions of them around the world are turning to complementary and alternative forms of medicine, which tend to tap into sort of slower, gentler, more holistic forms of healing. Now, obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies, and I personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever, you know, gain mainstream approval. But other treatments such as acupuncture and massage, and even just relaxation, clearly have some kind of benefit. And blue-chip medical colleges everywhere are starting to study these things to find out how they work, and what we might learn from them.Sex. There's an awful lot of fast sex around, isn't there? I was coming to \u2014 well \u2014 no pun intended there. I was making my way, let's say, slowly to Oxford, and I went through a news agent, and I saw a magazine, a men's magazine, and it said on the front, \"How to bring your partner to orgasm in 30 seconds.\" So, you know, even sex is on a stopwatch these days. Now, you know, I like a quickie as much as the next person, but I think that there's an awful lot to be gained from slow sex \u2014 from slowing down in the bedroom. You know, you tap into that \u2014 those deeper, sort of, psychological, emotional, spiritual currents, and you get a better orgasm with the buildup. You can get more bang for your buck, let's say. I mean, the Pointer Sisters said it most eloquently, didn't they, when they sang the praises of \"a lover with a slow hand.\" Now, we all laughed at Sting a few years ago when he went Tantric, but you fast-forward a few years, and now you find couples of all ages flocking to workshops, or maybe just on their own in their own bedrooms, finding ways to put on the brakes and have better sex. And of course, in Italy where \u2014 I mean, Italians always seem to know where to find their pleasure \u2014 they've launched an official Slow Sex movement.The workplace. Right across much of the world \u2014 North America being a notable exception \u2014 working hours have been coming down. And Europe is an example of that, and people finding that their quality of life improves as they're working less, and also that their hourly productivity goes up. Now, clearly there are problems with the 35-hour workweek in France \u2014 too much, too soon, too rigid. But other countries in Europe, notably the Nordic countries, are showing that it's possible to have a kick-ass economy without being a workaholic. And Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on Earth, and they work the kind of hours that would make the average American weep with envy. And if you go beyond sort of the country level, down at the micro-company level, more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just to unplug \u2014 to take a lunch break, or to go sit in a quiet room, to switch off their Blackberrys and laptops \u2014 you at the back \u2014 mobile phones, during the work day or on the weekend, so that they have time to recharge and for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought.It's not just, though, these days, adults who overwork, though, is it? It's children, too. I'm 37, and my childhood ended in the mid-'80s, and I look at kids now, and I'm just amazed by the way they race around with more homework, more tutoring, more extracurriculars than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago. And some of the most heartrending emails that I get on my website are actually from adolescents hovering on the edge of burnout, pleading with me to write to their parents, to help them slow down, to help them get off this full-throttle treadmill. But thankfully, there is a backlash there in parenting as well, and you're finding that, you know, towns in the United States are now banding together and banning extracurriculars on a particular day of the month, so that people can, you know, decompress and have some family time, and slow down.Homework is another thing. There are homework bans springing up all over the developed world in schools which had been piling on the homework for years, and now they're discovering that less can be more. So there was a case up in Scotland recently where a fee-paying, high-achieving private school banned homework for everyone under the age of 13, and the high-achieving parents freaked out and said, \"What are you \u2014 you know, our kids will fall\" \u2014 the headmaster said, \"No, no, your children need to slow down at the end of the day.\" And just this last month, the exam results came in, and in math, science, marks went up 20 percent on average last year. And I think what's very revealing is that the elite universities, who are often cited as the reason that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much, are starting to notice the caliber of students coming to them is falling. These kids have wonderful marks; they have CVs jammed with extracurriculars, to the point that would make your eyes water. But they lack spark; they lack the ability to think creatively and think outside \u2014 they don't know how to dream. And so what these Ivy League schools, and Oxford and Cambridge and so on, are starting to send a message to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit. And in Harvard, for instance, they send out a letter to undergraduates \u2014 freshmen \u2014 telling them that they'll get more out of life, and more out of Harvard, if they put on the brakes, if they do less, but give time to things, the time that things need, to enjoy them, to savor them. And even if they sometimes do nothing at all. And that letter is called \u2014 very revealing, I think \u2014 \"Slow Down!\" \u2014 with an exclamation mark on the end.So wherever you look, the message, it seems to me, is the same: that less is very often more, that slower is very often better. But that said, of course, it's not that easy to slow down, is it? I mean, you heard that I got a speeding ticket while I was researching my book on the benefits of slowness, and that's true, but that's not all of it. I was actually en route to a dinner held by Slow Food at the time. And if that's not shaming enough, I got that ticket in Italy. And if any of you have ever driven on an Italian highway, you'll have a pretty good idea of how fast I was going.(Laughter)But why is it so hard to slow down? I think there are various reasons. One is that speed is fun, you know, speed is sexy. It's all that adrenaline rush. It's hard to give it up. I think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension \u2014 that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger, deeper questions. We fill our head with distraction, with busyness, so that we don't have to ask, am I well? Am I happy? Are my children growing up right? Are politicians making good decisions on my behalf? Another reason \u2014 although I think, perhaps, the most powerful reason \u2014 why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo that we've erected against slowing down. \"Slow\" is a dirty word in our culture. It's a byword for \"lazy,\" \"slacker,\" for being somebody who gives up. You know, \"he's a bit slow.\" It's actually synonymous with being stupid.I guess what the Slow Movement \u2014 the purpose of the Slow Movement, or its main goal, really, is to tackle that taboo, and to say that yes, sometimes slow is not the answer, that there is such a thing as \"bad slow.\" You know, I got stuck on the M25, which is a ring road around London, recently, and spent three-and-a-half hours there. And I can tell you, that's really bad slow. But the new idea, the sort of revolutionary idea, of the Slow Movement, is that there is such a thing as \"good slow,\" too. And good slow is, you know, taking the time to eat a meal with your family, with the TV switched off. Or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles in the office to make the best decision at work. Or even simply just taking the time to slow down and savor your life.Now, one of the things that I found most uplifting about all of this stuff that's happened around the book since it came out, is the reaction to it. And I knew that when my book on slowness came out, it would be welcomed by the New Age brigade, but it's also been taken up, with great gusto, by the corporate world \u2014 you know, business press, but also big companies and leadership organizations. Because people at the top of the chain, people like you, I think, are starting to realize that there's too much speed in the system, there's too much busyness, and it's time to find, or get back to that lost art of shifting gears. Another encouraging sign, I think, is that it's not just in the developed world that this idea's been taken up. In the developing world, in countries that are on the verge of making that leap into first world status \u2014 China, Brazil, Thailand, Poland, and so on \u2014 these countries have embraced the idea of the Slow Movement, many people in them, and there's a debate going on in their media, on the streets. Because I think they're looking at the West, and they're saying, \"Well, we like that aspect of what you've got, but we're not so sure about that.\"So all of that said, is it, I guess, is it possible? That's really the main question before us today. Is it possible to slow down? And I'm happy to be able to say to you that the answer is a resounding yes. And I present myself as Exhibit A, a kind of reformed and rehabilitated speed-aholic. I still love speed. You know, I live in London, and I work as a journalist, and I enjoy the buzz and the busyness, and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things. I play squash and ice hockey, two very fast sports, and I wouldn't give them up for the world. But I've also, over the last year or so, got in touch with my inner tortoise.(Laughter)And what that means is that I no longer overload myself gratuitously. My default mode is no longer to be a rush-aholic. I no longer hear time's winged chariot drawing near, or at least not as much as I did before. I can actually hear it now, because I see my time is ticking off. And the upshot of all of that is that I actually feel a lot happier, healthier, more productive than I ever have. I feel like I'm living my life rather than actually just racing through it. And perhaps, the most important measure of the success of this is that I feel that my relationships are a lot deeper, richer, stronger.And for me, I guess, the litmus test for whether this would work, and what it would mean, was always going to be bedtime stories, because that's sort of where the journey began. And there too the news is rosy. You know, at the end of the day, I go into my son's room. I don't wear a watch. I switch off my computer, so I can't hear the email pinging into the basket, and I just slow down to his pace and we read. And because children have their own tempo and internal clock, they don't do quality time, where you schedule 10 minutes for them to open up to you. They need you to move at their rhythm. I find that 10 minutes into a story, you know, my son will suddenly say, \"You know, something happened in the playground today that really bothered me.\" And we'll go off and have a conversation on that. And I now find that bedtime stories used to be a box on my to-do list, something that I dreaded, because it was so slow and I had to get through it quickly. It's become my reward at the end of the day, something I really cherish. And I have a kind of Hollywood ending to my talk this afternoon, which goes a little bit like this:a few months ago, I was getting ready to go on another book tour, and I had my bags packed. I was downstairs by the front door, and I was waiting for a taxi, and my son came down the stairs and he'd made a card for me. And he was carrying it. He'd gone and stapled two cards, very like these, together, and put a sticker of his favorite character, Tintin, on the front. And he said to me, or he handed this to me, and I read it, and it said, \"To Daddy, love Benjamin.\" And I thought, \"Aw, that's really sweet. Is that a good luck on the book tour card?\" And he said, \"No, no, no, Daddy \u2014 this is a card for being the best story reader in the world.\" And I thought, \"Yeah, you know, this slowing down thing really does work.\"Thank you very much.", "id": 73, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nWhat I'd like to start off with is an observation,\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nwhich is that if I've learned anything over the last year,\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nit's that the supreme irony\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nof publishing a book about slowness\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nis that you have to go around promoting it really fast.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nI seem to spend most of my time these days\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nzipping from city to city, studio to studio,\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\ninterview to interview,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nserving up the book in really tiny bite-size chunks.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nBecause everyone these days\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nwants to know how to slow down,\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nbut they want to know how to slow down really quickly. So ...\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nso I did a spot on CNN the other day\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nwhere I actually spent more time in makeup than I did talking on air.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nAnd I think that -- that's not really surprising though, is it?\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nBecause that's kind of the world that we live in now,\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\na world stuck in fast-forward.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nA world obsessed with speed,\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nwith doing everything faster, with cramming more and more\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\ninto less and less time.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nEvery moment of the day feels like\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\na race against the clock.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nTo borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher, which is\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nin my bio there; I'll just toss it out again --\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\n\"These days even instant gratification takes too long.\" (Laughter)\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nAnd\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nif you think about how we to try to make things better, what do we do?\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nNo, we speed them up, don't we? So we used to dial; now we speed dial.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nWe used to read; now we speed read. We used to walk; now we speed walk.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nAnd of course, we used to date and now we speed date.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nAnd even things that are by their very nature slow --\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nwe try and speed them up too.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nSo I was in New York recently, and I walked past a gym\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nthat had an advertisement in the window for a new course, a new evening course.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nAnd it was for, you guessed it, speed yoga.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nSo this -- the perfect solution for time-starved professionals\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nwho want to, you know, salute the sun,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nbut only want to give over about 20 minutes to it.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nI mean, these are sort of the extreme examples,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nand they're amusing and good to laugh at.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nBut there's a very serious point,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nand I think that in the headlong dash of daily life,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nwe often lose sight of the damage\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nthat this roadrunner form of living does to us.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nWe're so marinated in the culture of speed\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nthat we almost fail to notice the toll it takes\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\non every aspect of our lives --\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\non our health, our diet, our work,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nour relationships, the environment and our community.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nAnd sometimes it takes\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\na wake-up call, doesn't it,\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nto alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\ninstead of actually living them; that we're\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nliving the fast life, instead of the good life.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nAnd I think for many people, that wake-up call\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\ntakes the form of an illness.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nYou know, a burnout, or eventually the body says,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\n\"I can't take it anymore,\" and throws in the towel.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nOr maybe a relationship goes up in smoke\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nbecause we haven't had the time, or the patience,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nor the tranquility,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nto be with the other person, to listen to them.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nAnd my wake-up call came when I started\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nreading bedtime stories to my son,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nand I found that at the end of day,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nI would go into his room and I just couldn't slow down -- you know,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nI'd be speed reading \"The Cat In The Hat.\"\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nI'd be -- you know, I'd be skipping lines here,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nparagraphs there, sometimes a whole page,\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nand of course, my little boy knew the book inside out, so we would quarrel.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nAnd what should have been the most relaxing, the most intimate,\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nthe most tender moment of the day,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nwhen a dad sits down to read to his son,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nbecame instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\na clash between my speed\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nand his slowness.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nAnd this went on for some time,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nuntil I caught myself scanning a newspaper article\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nwith timesaving tips for fast people.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nAnd one of them made reference to a series of books called\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\n\"The One-Minute Bedtime Story.\"\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nAnd I wince saying those words now,\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nbut my first reaction at the time was very different.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nMy first reflex was to say,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\n\"Hallelujah -- what a great idea!\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nThis is exactly what I'm looking for to speed up bedtime even more.\"\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nBut thankfully,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\na light bulb went on over my head, and my next reaction was very different,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nand I took a step back, and I thought,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\n\"Whoa -- you know, has it really come to this?\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nAm I really in such a hurry that I'm prepared\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nto fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day?\"\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nAnd I put away the newspaper --\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nand I was getting on a plane -- and I sat there,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nand I did something I hadn't done for a long time -- which is I did nothing.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nI just thought, and I thought long and hard.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nAnd by the time I got off that plane, I'd decided I wanted to do something about it.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nI wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nand what it was doing to me and to everyone else.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nAnd I had two questions in my head.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nThe first was, how did we get so fast?\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nAnd the second is, is it possible,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nor even desirable, to slow down?\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nNow, if you think about\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nhow our world got so accelerated, the usual suspects rear their heads.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nYou think of, you know, urbanization,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nconsumerism, the workplace, technology.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nBut I think if you cut through\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nthose forces, you get to what might be the deeper\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\ndriver, the nub of the question,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nwhich is how we think about time itself.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nIn other cultures, time is cyclical.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nIt's seen as moving in great,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nunhurried circles.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nIt's always renewing and refreshing itself.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nWhereas in the West, time is linear.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nIt's a finite resource;\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nit's always draining away.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nYou either use it, or lose it.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\n\"Time is money,\" as Benjamin Franklin said.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nAnd I think what that does to us psychologically\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nis it creates an equation.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nTime is scarce, so what do we do?\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nWell -- well, we speed up, don't we?\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nWe try and do more and more with less and less time.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nWe turn every moment of every day\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\ninto a race to the finish line --\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\na finish line, incidentally, that we never reach,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nbut a finish line nonetheless.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nAnd I guess that the question is,\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nis it possible to break free from that mindset?\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd thankfully, the answer is yes, because\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nwhat I discovered, when I began looking around, that there is\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\na global backlash against this culture that\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\ntells us that faster is always better, and that busier is best.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nRight across the world, people are doing the unthinkable:\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nthey're slowing down, and finding that,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nalthough conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down, you're road kill,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nthe opposite turns out to be true:\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nthat by slowing down at the right moments,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\npeople find that they do everything better.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nThey eat better; they make love better; they exercise better;\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nthey work better; they live better.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nAnd, in this kind of cauldron\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nof moments and places and acts of deceleration,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nlie what a lot of people now refer to as\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nthe \"International Slow Movement.\"\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nNow if you'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nI'll just give you a very quick overview of\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nwhat's going on inside the Slow Movement. If you think of food,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nmany of you will have heard of the Slow Food movement.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nStarted in Italy, but has spread across the world,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nand now has 100,000 members\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nin 50 countries.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nAnd it's driven by a very simple and sensible message,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nwhich is that we get more pleasure and more health\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nfrom our food when we\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:36.958\ncultivate, cook and consume it at a reasonable pace.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nI think also the explosion of\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nthe organic farming movement, and the renaissance of farmers' markets,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nare other illustrations\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nof the fact that people are desperate to get away from\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\neating and cooking and cultivating their food\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\non an industrial timetable.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nThey want to get back to slower rhythms.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nAnd out of the Slow Food movement has grown something\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\ncalled the Slow Cities movement, which has started in Italy,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nbut has spread right across Europe and beyond.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nAnd in this, towns\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nbegin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nso that people are encouraged to slow down\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nand smell the roses and connect with one another.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nSo they might curb traffic,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nor put in a park bench, or some green space.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nAnd in some ways, these changes add up to more than the sum of their parts,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nbecause I think when a Slow City becomes officially a Slow City,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nit's kind of like a philosophical declaration.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nIt's saying to the rest of world, and to the people in that town,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nthat we believe that in the 21st century,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:34.958\n\nslowness has a role to play.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nIn medicine, I think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nwith the kind of quick-fix mentality\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nyou find in conventional medicine.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nAnd millions of them around the world are turning\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nto complementary and alternative forms of medicine,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nwhich tend to tap into sort of\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nslower, gentler, more holistic forms of healing.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nNow, obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nand I personally doubt that the coffee enema\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nwill ever, you know, gain mainstream approval.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nBut other treatments\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nsuch as acupuncture and massage, and even just relaxation,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nclearly have some kind of benefit.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nAnd blue-chip medical colleges everywhere\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nare starting to study these things to find out how they work,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nand what we might learn from them.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nSex. There's an awful lot of fast sex around, isn't there?\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nI was coming to --\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nwell -- no pun intended there.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nI was making my way, let's say, slowly to Oxford,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nand I went through a news agent, and I saw a magazine,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\na men's magazine, and it said on the front,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\n\"How to bring your partner to orgasm in 30 seconds.\"\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nSo, you know, even sex\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nis on a stopwatch these days.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nNow, you know,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nI like a quickie as much as the next person,\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nbut I think that there's an awful lot to be gained\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nfrom slow sex -- from slowing down in the bedroom.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nYou know, you tap into that -- those deeper,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nsort of, psychological, emotional, spiritual currents,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nand you get a better orgasm with the buildup.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nYou can get more bang for your buck, let's say.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nI mean, the Pointer Sisters said it most eloquently, didn't they,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nwhen they sang the praises of \"a lover with a slow hand.\"\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nNow, we all laughed at Sting\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\na few years ago when he went Tantric,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nbut you fast-forward a few years, and now you find couples of all ages\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nflocking to workshops, or maybe just\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\non their own in their own bedrooms, finding ways\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nto put on the brakes and have better sex.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd of course, in Italy where -- I mean, Italians always seem to know\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nwhere to find their pleasure --\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nthey've launched an official Slow Sex movement.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nThe workplace.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nRight across much of the world --\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nNorth America being a notable exception --\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nworking hours have been coming down.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nAnd Europe is an example of that,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nand people finding that their quality of life improves\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nas they're working less, and also\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nthat their hourly productivity goes up.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nNow, clearly there are problems with\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nthe 35-hour workweek in France --\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\ntoo much, too soon, too rigid.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nBut other countries in Europe, notably the Nordic countries,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nare showing that it's possible\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nto have a kick-ass economy\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nwithout being a workaholic.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nAnd Norway, Sweden,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nDenmark and Finland now rank\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\namong the top six most competitive nations on Earth,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nand they work the kind of hours that would make the average American\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nweep with envy.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nAnd if you go beyond sort of the country level,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\ndown at the micro-company level,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nmore and more companies now are realizing\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nthat they need to allow their staff\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\neither to work fewer hours or just to unplug --\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nto take a lunch break, or to go sit in a quiet room,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nto switch off their Blackberrys and laptops -- you at the back --\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nmobile phones,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nduring the work day or on the weekend, so that they have time to recharge\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nand for the brain to slide into that\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nkind of creative mode of thought.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nIt's not just, though, these days,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nadults who overwork, though, is it? It's children, too.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nI'm 37, and my childhood ended in the mid-'80s,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nand I look at kids now, and I'm just amazed by the way they\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nrace around with more homework,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nmore tutoring, more extracurriculars\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nthan we would ever have conceived of a generation ago.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nAnd some of the most heartrending emails\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nthat I get on my website\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nare actually from adolescents\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nhovering on the edge of burnout, pleading with me\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nto write to their parents,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nto help them slow down, to help them get off this\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nfull-throttle treadmill.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nBut thankfully, there is a backlash there in parenting as well,\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nand you're finding that, you know, towns in the United States\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nare now banding together and banning extracurriculars\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\non a particular day of the month, so that people can,\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nyou know, decompress and have some family time, and slow down.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nHomework is another thing. There are homework bans\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nspringing up all over the developed world\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nin schools which had been piling on the homework for years,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nand now they're discovering that less can be more.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nSo there was a case up in Scotland recently\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nwhere a fee-paying, high-achieving private school\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nbanned homework\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nfor everyone under the age of 13,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nand the high-achieving parents freaked out and said,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\n\"What are you -- you know, our kids will fall\" -- the headmaster said,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\n\"No, no, your children need to slow down at the end of the day.\"\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nAnd just this last month, the exam results came in,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nand in math, science, marks went up 20 percent\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\non average last year.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nAnd I think what's very revealing is that\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nthe elite universities, who are often cited as the reason\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nthat people drive their kids and hothouse them so much,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nare starting to notice the caliber of students\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\ncoming to them is falling. These kids have wonderful marks;\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nthey have CVs jammed with extracurriculars,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nto the point that would make your eyes water.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nBut they lack spark; they lack\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nthe ability to think creatively and think outside --\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nthey don't know how to dream. And so what these Ivy League schools,\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nand Oxford and Cambridge and so on, are starting to send a message\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nto parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nAnd in Harvard, for instance, they send out\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\na letter to undergraduates -- freshmen --\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\ntelling them that they'll get more out of life, and more out of Harvard,\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nif they put on the brakes, if they do less,\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nbut give time to things, the time that things need,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nto enjoy them, to savor them.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nAnd even if they sometimes do nothing at all.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nAnd that letter is called -- very revealing, I think --\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\n\"Slow Down!\" -- with an exclamation mark on the end.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nSo wherever you look, the message, it seems to me, is the same:\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nthat less is very often more,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nthat slower is very often\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nbetter. But that said, of course,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nit's not that easy to slow down, is it?\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nI mean, you heard that I got a speeding ticket\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nwhile I was researching my book on the benefits of slowness,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nand that's true, but that's not all of it.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nI was actually en route to a dinner\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nheld by Slow Food at the time.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nAnd if that's not shaming enough, I got that ticket in Italy.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nAnd if any of you have ever driven on an Italian highway,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nyou'll have a pretty good idea of how fast I was going.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nBut why is it so hard to slow down?\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nI think there are various reasons.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nOne is that speed is fun, you know, speed is sexy.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nIt's all that adrenaline rush. It's hard to give it up.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nI think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension --\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nthat speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nfrom the bigger, deeper questions.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nWe fill our head with distraction, with busyness,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nso that we don't have to ask,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nam I well? Am I happy? Are my children growing up right?\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nAre politicians making good decisions on my behalf?\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nAnother reason -- although I think, perhaps, the most powerful reason --\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nwhy we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nthat we've erected against slowing down.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\n\"Slow\" is a dirty word in our culture.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nIt's a byword for \"lazy,\" \"slacker,\"\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nfor being somebody who gives up.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nYou know, \"he's a bit slow.\" It's actually synonymous\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nwith being stupid.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nI guess what the Slow Movement -- the purpose of the Slow Movement,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nor its main goal, really, is to tackle that taboo,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nand to say that yes,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nsometimes slow is not the answer,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nthat there is such a thing as \"bad slow.\"\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nYou know, I got stuck on the M25,\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nwhich is a ring road around London, recently,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nand spent three-and-a-half hours there. And I can tell you,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nthat's really bad slow.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nBut the new idea,\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nthe sort of revolutionary idea, of the Slow Movement,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nis that there is such a thing as \"good slow,\" too.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nAnd good slow is, you know, taking the time\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nto eat a meal with your family, with the TV switched off.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nOr taking the time to look at a problem from all angles\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nin the office to make the best decision\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nat work.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nOr even simply just taking the time\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nto slow down\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nand savor your life.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nNow, one of the things that I found most uplifting\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nabout all of this stuff that's happened around the book\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nsince it came out, is the reaction to it.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nAnd I knew that when my book on slowness came out,\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nit would be welcomed by the New Age brigade,\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nbut it's also been taken up, with great gusto,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nby the corporate world -- you know,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nbusiness press, but also\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nbig companies and leadership organizations.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nBecause people at the top of the chain, people like you, I think,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nare starting to realize that there's too much\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nspeed in the system,\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nthere's too much busyness, and it's time to find,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nor get back to that lost art of shifting gears.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nAnother encouraging sign, I think,\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nis that it's not just in the developed world\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nthat this idea's been taken up. In the developing world,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nin countries that are on the verge of making that leap\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\ninto first world status -- China, Brazil,\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nThailand, Poland, and so on --\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nthese countries have embraced the idea of the Slow Movement,\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nmany people in them, and there's a debate going on\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nin their media, on the streets.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nBecause I think they're looking at the West, and they're saying,\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.958\n\"Well, we like that aspect of what you've got,\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nbut we're not so sure about that.\"\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nSo all of that said, is it,\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nI guess, is it possible?\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nThat's really the main question before us today. Is it possible\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nto slow down? And\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nI'm happy to be able to say to you\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nthat the answer is a resounding yes.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nAnd I present myself as Exhibit A,\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.958\na kind of reformed and rehabilitated\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nspeed-aholic.\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nI still love speed. You know, I live in London,\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nand I work as a journalist,\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nand I enjoy the buzz and the busyness,\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nand the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nI play squash and ice hockey,\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\ntwo very fast sports, and I wouldn't give them up for the world.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nBut I've also, over the last year or so,\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.958\ngot in touch with my inner tortoise.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nAnd what that means is that\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nI no longer\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:47.958\noverload myself gratuitously.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nMy default mode is no longer\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nto be a rush-aholic.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nI no longer hear\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\ntime's winged chariot drawing near,\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nor at least not as much as I did before.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nI can actually hear it now, because I see my time is ticking off.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nAnd the upshot of all of that is that\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nI actually feel a lot happier, healthier,\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nmore productive than I ever have.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nI feel like I'm living\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nmy life rather than actually just racing through it.\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nAnd perhaps, the most important\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nmeasure of the success of this\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nis that I feel that my relationships are a lot deeper,\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nricher, stronger.\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nAnd for me, I guess, the litmus test\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nfor whether this would work, and what it would mean,\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nwas always going to be bedtime stories, because that's sort of where\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nthe journey began. And there too the news is\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nrosy. You know,\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nat the end of the day, I go into my son's room.\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nI don't wear a watch. I switch off my computer,\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nso I can't hear the email pinging into the basket,\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:48.958\nand I just slow down to his pace and we read.\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nAnd because children have their own tempo and internal clock,\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nthey don't do quality time,\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nwhere you schedule 10 minutes for them to open up to you.\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nThey need you to move at their rhythm.\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nI find that 10 minutes into a story, you know,\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nmy son will suddenly say, \"You know,\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nsomething happened in the playground today that really bothered me.\"\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nAnd we'll go off and have a conversation on that.\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nAnd I now find that bedtime stories\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nused to be\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:16.958\na box on my to-do list, something that I dreaded,\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nbecause it was so slow and I had to get through it quickly.\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nIt's become my reward at the end of the day,\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nsomething I really cherish.\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nAnd I have a kind of Hollywood ending\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nto my talk this afternoon,\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nwhich goes a little bit like this:\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:31.958\na few months ago, I was getting ready to go on\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nanother book tour, and I had my bags packed.\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nI was downstairs by the front door, and I was waiting for a taxi,\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nand my son came down the stairs and\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nhe'd made a card for me. And he was carrying it.\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nHe'd gone and stapled two cards, very like these, together,\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:46.958\nand put a sticker of his favorite\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:48.958\ncharacter, Tintin, on the front.\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nAnd he said to me,\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:52.958\nor he handed this to me, and I read it,\n\n00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nand it said, \"To Daddy, love Benjamin.\"\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nAnd I thought, \"Aw, that's really sweet.\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nIs that a good luck on the book tour card?\"\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nAnd he said, \"No, no, no, Daddy -- this is a card\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:04.958\nfor being the best story reader in the world.\"\n\n00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nAnd I thought, \"Yeah, you know, this slowing down thing really does work.\"\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nThank you very much."}, {"title": "My wish: Rebuilding Rwanda", "duration": "1447", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_clinton_on_rebuilding_rwanda", "transcript": "I thought in getting up to my TED wish I would try to begin by putting in  perspective what I try to do and how it fits with what they try to do. We live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent, but insufficient in three major ways. It is, first of all, profoundly unequal: half the world's people still living on less than two dollars a day; a billion people with no access to clean water; two and a half billion no access to sanitation; a billion going to bed hungry every night; one in four deaths every year from AIDS, TB, malaria and the variety of infections associated with dirty water \u2014 80 percent of them under five years of age.Even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing. In the United States, since 2001 we've had five years of economic growth, five years of productivity growth in the workplace, but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent. The percentage of working families without health care up by four percent. So this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us \u2014 which is why we're all here in Northern California doing what we do for a living, enjoying this evening \u2014 is profoundly unequal. It is also unstable. Unstable because of the threats of terror, weapons of mass destruction, the spread of global disease and a sense that we are vulnerable to it in a way that we weren't not so many years ago. And perhaps most important of all, it is unsustainable because of climate change, resource depletion and species destruction.When I think about the world I would like to leave to my daughter and the grandchildren I hope to have, it is a world that moves away from unequal, unstable, unsustainable interdependence to integrated communities \u2014 locally, nationally and globally \u2014 that share the characteristics of all successful communities: a broadly shared, accessible set of opportunities, a shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common enterprise and a genuine sense of belonging. All easier said than done. When the terrorist incidents occurred in the United Kingdom a couple of years ago, I think even though they didn't claim as many lives as we lost in the United States on 9/11, I think the thing that troubled the British most was that the perpetrators were not invaders, but homegrown citizens whose religious and political identities were more important to them than the people they grew up with, went to school with, worked with, shared weekends with, shared meals with. In other words, they thought their differences were more important than their common humanity. It is the central psychological plague of humankind in the 21st century.Into this mix, people like us, who are not in public office, have more power to do good than at any time in history, because more than half the world's people live under governments they voted in and can vote out. And even non-democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion. Because primarily of the power of the Internet, people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money that can change the world for some public good if they all agree. When the tsunami hit South Asia, the United States contributed 1.2 billion dollars. 30 percent of our households gave. Half of them gave over the Internet. The median contribution was somewhere around 57 dollars. And thirdly, because of the rise of non-governmental organizations. They, businesses, other citizens' groups, have enormous power to affect the lives of our fellow human beings. When I became president in 1993, there were none of these organizations in Russia. There are now a couple of hundred thousand. None in India. There are now at least a half a million active. None in China. There are now 250,000 registered with the government, probably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons.When I organized my foundation, and I thought about the world as it is and the world that I hope to leave to the next generation, and I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my life that I could still have an impact on. I wanted to focus on activities that would help to alleviate poverty, fight disease, combat climate change, bridge the religious, racial and other divides that torment the world, but to do it in a way that would either use whatever particular skills we could put together in our group to change the way some public good function was performed so that it would sweep across the world more.You saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with AIDS drugs. And I want to say that the head of our AIDS effort, and the person who also is primarily active in the wish I'll make tonight, Ira Magaziner, is here with me and I want to thank him for everything he's done. He's over there. (Applause) When I got out of office and was asked to work, first in the Caribbean, to try to help deal with the AIDS crisis, generic drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year. If you bought them in vast bulks, you could get them at a little under 400 dollars. The first country we went to work in, the Bahamas, was paying 3,500 dollars for these drugs. The market was so terribly disorganized that they were buying this medicine through two agents who were gigging them sevenfold. So the very first week we were working, we got the price down to 500 dollars. And all of a sudden, they could save seven times as many lives for the same amount of money.Then we went to work with the manufacturers of AIDS medicines, one of whom was cited in the film, and negotiated a whole different change in business strategy, because even at 500 dollars, these drugs were being sold on a high-margin, low-volume, uncertain-payment basis. So we worked on improving the productivity of the operations and the supply chain, and went to a low-margin, high-volume, absolutely certain-payment business. I joked that the main contribution we made to the battle against AIDS was to get the manufacturers to change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy. But the price went to 140 dollars from 500. And pretty soon, the average price was 192 dollars. Now we can get it for about 100 dollars. Children's medicine was 600 dollars, because nobody could afford to buy any of it. We negotiated it down to 190. Then, the French imposed their brilliantly conceived airline tax to create a something called UNITAID, got a bunch of other countries to help. That children's medicine is now 60 dollars a person a year.The only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives of everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive are the absence of systems necessary to diagnose, treat and care for people and deliver this medicine. We started a childhood obesity initiative with the Heart Association in America. We tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry-right deals with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools. We just reorganized the markets. And it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world, somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets. And that is now what we're trying to do, and working with this large cities group to fight climate change, to negotiate huge, big, volume deals that will enable cities which generate 75 percent of the world's greenhouse gases, to drastically and quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a way that is good economics. And this whole discussion as if it's some sort of economic burden, is a mystery to me. I think it's a bird's nest on the ground.When Al Gore won his well-deserved Oscar for the \"Inconvenient Truth\" movie, I was thrilled, but I had urged him to make a second movie quickly. For those of you who saw \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" the most important slide in the Gore lecture is the last one, which shows here's where greenhouse gases are going if we don't do anything, here's where they could go. And then there are six different categories of things we can do to change the trajectory. We need a movie on those six categories. And all of you need to have it embedded in your brains and to organize yourselves around it. So we're trying to do that.So organizing these markets is one thing we try to do. Now we have taken on a second thing, and this gets to my wish. It has been my experience in working in developing countries that while the headlines may all be \u2014 the pessimistic headlines may say, well, we can't do this, that or the other thing because of corruption \u2014 I think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption, and feeds corruption. We now have the money, given these low prices, to distribute AIDS drugs all over the world to people we cannot presently reach. Today these low prices are available in the 25 countries where we work, and in a total of 62 countries, and about 550,000 people are getting the benefits of them. But the money is there to reach others. The systems are not there to reach the people.So what we have been trying to do, working first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other places \u2014 but I want to talk about Rwanda tonight \u2014 is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area that can be used to deal with AIDS, TB, malaria, other infectious diseases, maternal and child health, and a whole range of health issues poor people are grappling with in the developing world, that can first be scaled for the whole nation of Rwanda, and then will be a model that could literally be implemented in any other poor country in the world.And the test is: one, will it do the job? Will it provide high quality care? And two, will it do it at a price that will enable the country to sustain a health care system without foreign donors after five to 10 years? Because the longer I deal with these problems, the more convinced I am that we have to \u2014 whether it's economics, health, education, whatever \u2014 we have to build systems. And the absence of systems that function break the connection which got you all in this seat tonight. You think about whatever your life has been, however many obstacles you have faced in your life, at critical junctures you always knew there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted and the result you achieved. In a world with no systems, with chaos, everything becomes a guerilla struggle, and this predictability is not there. And it becomes almost impossible to save lives, educate kids, develop economies, whatever.The person, in my view, who has done the best job of this in the health care area, of building a system in a very poor area, is Dr. Paul Farmer, who, many of you know, has worked for now 20 years with his group, Partners in Health, primarily in Haiti where he started, but they've also worked in Russia, in Peru and other places around the world. As poor as Haiti is, in the area where Farmer's clinic is active \u2014 and they serve a catchment area far greater than the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve \u2014 since 1988, they have not lost one person to tuberculosis, not one. And they've achieved a lot of other amazing health results. So when we decided to work in Rwanda on trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem, we wanted to build a healthcare network, because it had been totally destroyed during the genocide in 1994, and the per capita income was still under a dollar a day. So I rang up, asked Paul Farmer if he would help. Because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haiti and a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country, number one, it would be a wonderful thing for a country that has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last 15 years, and number two, we would have something that could then be adapted to any other poor country anywhere in the world. And so we have set about doing that.Now, we started working together 18 months ago. And we're working in an area called Southern Kayonza, which is one of the poorest areas in Rwanda, with a group that originally includes about 400,000 people. We're essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti: he develops and trains paid community health workers who are able to identify health problems, ensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosed and take their medicine regularly, who work on bringing about health education, clean water and sanitation, providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care if they have problems of the severity that require it. The procedures that make this work have been perfected, as I said, by Paul Farmer and his team in their work in rural Haiti over the last 20 years. Recently we did an evaluation of the first 18 months of our efforts in Rwanda. And the results were so good that the Rwandan government has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country, and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it.I'll tell you a little bit about our team because it's indicative of what we do. We have about 500 people around the world working in our AIDS program, some of them for nothing \u2014 just for transportation, room and board. And then we have others working in these other related programs. Our business plan in Rwanda was put together under the leadership of Diana Noble, who is an unusually gifted woman, but not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work. She was the youngest partner at Schroder Ventures in London in her 20s. She was CEO of a successful e-venture \u2014 she started and built Reed Elsevier Ventures \u2014 and at 45 she decided she wanted to do something different with her life. So she now works full-time on this for very little pay. She and her team of former business people have created a business plan that will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country. And it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work she used to do when she was making a lot more money for it.When we came to this rural area, 45 percent of the children under the age of five had stunted growth due to malnutrition. 23 percent of them died before they reached the age of five. Mortality at birth was over two-and-a-half percent. Over 15 percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred because of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation \u2014 all entirely preventable and treatable. Over 13 percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses \u2014 again, all preventable and treatable. And not a single soul in this area was being treated for AIDS or tuberculosis.Within the first 18 months, the following things happened: we went from zero to about 2,000 people being treated for AIDS. That's 80 percent of the people who need treatment in this area. Listen to this: less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment. That's lower than the figure in the United States. Less than three-tenths of one percent had to transfer to the more expensive second-line drugs. 400,000 pregnant women were brought into counseling and will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system. That's about 43 percent of all the pregnancies. About 40 percent of all the people \u2014 I said 400,000. I meant 40,000. About 40 percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it \u2014 in just 18 months, up from zero when we started. 43 percent of the children in need of an infant feeding program to prevent malnutrition and early death are now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow.We've started the first malaria treatment programs they've ever had there. Patients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide that we have renovated along with four other clinics, complete with solar power generators, good lab technology. We now are treating 325 people a month, despite the fact that almost 100 percent of the AIDS patients are now treated at home. And the most important thing is because we've implemented Paul Farmer's model, using community health workers, we estimate that this system could be put into place for all of Rwanda for between five and six percent of GDP, and that the government could sustain that without depending on foreign aid after five or six years. And for those of you who understand healthcare economics you know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and 11 percent of GDP on health care, except for the United States, we spend 16 \u2014 but that's a story for another day. (Laughter)We're now working with Partners in Health and the Ministry of Health in Rwanda and our Foundation folks to scale this system up. We're also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho. And we have similar projects in Tanzania, Mozambique, Kenya and Ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing: to save as many lives as quickly as we can, but to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented nationwide and then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world. We need initial upfront investment to train doctors, nurses, health administration and community health workers throughout the country, to set up the information technology, the solar energy, the water and sanitation, the transportation infrastructure. But over a five- to 10-year period, we will take down the need for outside assistance and eventually it will be phased out.My wish is that TED assist us in our work and help us to build a high-quality rural health system in a poor country, Rwanda, that can be a model for Africa, and indeed, for any poor country anywhere in the world. My belief is that this will help us to build a more integrated world with more partners and fewer terrorists, with more productive citizens and fewer haters, a place we'd all want our kids and our grandchildren to grow up in. It has been an honor for me, particularly, to work in Rwanda where we also have a major economic development project in partnership with Sir Tom Hunter, the Scottish philanthropist, where last year we, using the same thing with AIDS drugs, cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on microcredit loans by 30 percent and achieved three- to four-hundred percent increases in crop yields with the farmers.These people have been through a lot and none of us, most of all me, helped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other. We're undoing that now, and they are so over it and so into their future. We're doing this in an environmentally responsible way. I'm doing my best to convince them not to run the electric grid to the 35 percent of the people that have no access, but to do it with clean energy. To have responsible reforestation projects, the Rwandans, interestingly enough, have been quite good, Mr. Wilson, in preserving their topsoil. There's a couple of guys from southern farming families \u2014 the first thing I did when I went out to this place was to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt and see what they'd done with it.We have a chance here to prove that a country that almost slaughtered itself out of existence can practice reconciliation, reorganize itself, focus on tomorrow and provide comprehensive, quality health care with minimal outside help. I am grateful for this prize, and I will use it to that end. We could use some more help to do this, but think of what it would mean if we could have a world-class health system in Rwanda \u2014 in a country with a less-than-one-dollar-a-day-per-capita income, one that could save hundreds of millions of lives over the next decade if applied to every similarly situated country on Earth. It's worth a try and I believe it would succeed. Thank you and God bless you.

00:00:24.958\nI would try to begin by putting in \nperspective what I try to do\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nand how it fits with what they try to do.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nWe live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent,\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nbut insufficient in three major ways.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nIt is, first of all, profoundly unequal:\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nhalf the world's people still living on less than two dollars a day;\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\na billion people with no access to clean water;\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\ntwo and a half billion no access to sanitation;\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\na billion going to bed hungry every night;\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:58.958\none in four deaths every year from AIDS, TB, malaria\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nand the variety of infections associated with dirty water --\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\n80 percent of them under five years of age.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nEven in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nIn the United States, since 2001 we've had five years of economic growth,\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nfive years of productivity growth in the workplace,\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nbut median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:27.958\ndropping below the poverty line is up by four percent.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nThe percentage of working families without health care up by four percent.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nSo this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us --\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nwhich is why we're all here in Northern California doing what we do\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nfor a living, enjoying this evening -- is profoundly unequal.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nIt is also unstable.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nUnstable because of the threats of terror,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nweapons of mass destruction, the spread of global disease\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nand a sense that we are vulnerable to it in a way that we weren't not so many years ago.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nAnd perhaps most important of all, it is unsustainable\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nbecause of climate change, resource depletion and species destruction.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nWhen I think about the world I would like to leave to my daughter\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nand the grandchildren I hope to have,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nit is a world that moves away from unequal, unstable, unsustainable\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:31.958\ninterdependence to integrated communities -- locally, nationally and globally --\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nthat share the characteristics of all successful communities:\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:39.958\na broadly shared, accessible set of opportunities,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:44.958\na shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common enterprise\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nand a genuine sense of belonging.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nAll easier said than done.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nWhen the terrorist incidents occurred in the United Kingdom a couple of years ago,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nI think even though they didn't claim as many lives as we lost in the United States on 9/11,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nI think the thing that troubled the British most\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nwas that the perpetrators were not invaders, but homegrown citizens\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nwhose religious and political identities were more important to them\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nthan the people they grew up with, went to school with,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nworked with, shared weekends with, shared meals with.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nIn other words, they thought their differences\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nwere more important than their common humanity.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nIt is the central psychological plague of humankind in the 21st century.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nInto this mix, people like us, who are not in public office,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nhave more power to do good than at any time in history,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nbecause more than half the world's people\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nlive under governments they voted in and can vote out.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nAnd even non-democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nBecause primarily of the power of the Internet,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:06.958\npeople of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nthat can change the world for some public good if they all agree.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nWhen the tsunami hit South Asia, the United States contributed 1.2 billion dollars.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\n30 percent of our households gave.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nHalf of them gave over the Internet.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nThe median contribution was somewhere around 57 dollars.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nAnd thirdly, because of the rise of non-governmental organizations.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nThey, businesses, other citizens' groups, have enormous power\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nto affect the lives of our fellow human beings.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nWhen I became president in 1993,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nthere were none of these organizations in Russia.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nThere are now a couple of hundred thousand.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nNone in India. There are now at least a half a million active.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nNone in China. There are now 250,000 registered with the government,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nprobably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nWhen I organized my foundation, and I thought about the world as it is\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nand the world that I hope to leave to the next generation,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nand I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my life\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nthat I could still have an impact on.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nI wanted to focus on activities\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nthat would help to alleviate poverty, fight disease, combat climate change,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nbridge the religious, racial and other divides that torment the world,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nbut to do it in a way that would either use\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nwhatever particular skills we could put together in our group\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nto change the way some public good function was performed\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nso that it would sweep across the world more.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nYou saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with AIDS drugs.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nAnd I want to say that the head of our AIDS effort,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nand the person who also is primarily active in the wish I'll make tonight,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nIra Magaziner, is here with me and I want to thank him for everything he's done.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nHe's over there.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:17.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nWhen I got out of office and was asked to work, first in the Caribbean,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nto try to help deal with the AIDS crisis,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:30.958\ngeneric drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nIf you bought them in vast bulks,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nyou could get them at a little under 400 dollars.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nThe first country we went to work in, the Bahamas,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nwas paying 3,500 dollars for these drugs.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nThe market was so terribly disorganized\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nthat they were buying this medicine through two agents\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nwho were gigging them sevenfold.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nSo the very first week we were working,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nwe got the price down to 500 dollars.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nAnd all of a sudden, they could save seven times as many lives\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nfor the same amount of money.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nThen we went to work with the manufacturers of AIDS medicines,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\none of whom was cited in the film,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nand negotiated a whole different change in business strategy,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nbecause even at 500 dollars, these drugs\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nwere being sold on a high-margin, low-volume, uncertain-payment basis.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nSo we worked on improving the productivity of the operations\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nand the supply chain, and went to a low-margin, high-volume,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nabsolutely certain-payment business.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nI joked that the main contribution we made\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nto the battle against AIDS was to get the manufacturers\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nto change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nBut the price went to 140 dollars from 500.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nAnd pretty soon, the average price was 192 dollars.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nNow we can get it for about 100 dollars.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nChildren's medicine was 600 dollars,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nbecause nobody could afford to buy any of it.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nWe negotiated it down to 190.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nThen, the French imposed their brilliantly conceived airline tax\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nto create a something called UNITAID,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\ngot a bunch of other countries to help.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nThat children's medicine is now 60 dollars a person a year.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nThe only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nof everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nare the absence of systems necessary to diagnose, treat and care\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nfor people and deliver this medicine.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nWe started a childhood obesity initiative with the Heart Association in America.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nWe tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry-right deals\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nwith the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nand other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nWe just reorganized the markets.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nAnd it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nsomebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nAnd that is now what we're trying to do,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nand working with this large cities group to fight climate change,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nto negotiate huge, big, volume deals that will enable cities\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nwhich generate 75 percent of the world's greenhouse gases,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nto drastically and quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nin a way that is good economics.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nAnd this whole discussion as if it's some sort of economic burden,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nis a mystery to me.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nI think it's a bird's nest on the ground.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nWhen Al Gore won his well-deserved Oscar\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nfor the \"Inconvenient Truth\" movie, I was thrilled,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nbut I had urged him to make a second movie quickly.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nFor those of you who saw \"An Inconvenient Truth,\"\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nthe most important slide in the Gore lecture is the last one,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nwhich shows here's where greenhouse gases are going\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nif we don't do anything, here's where they could go.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nAnd then there are six different categories\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nof things we can do to change the trajectory.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nWe need a movie on those six categories.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nAnd all of you need to have it embedded in your brains\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nand to organize yourselves around it.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nSo we're trying to do that.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nSo organizing these markets is one thing we try to do.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nNow we have taken on a second thing, and this gets to my wish.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nIt has been my experience in working in developing countries\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nthat while the headlines may all be -- the pessimistic headlines may say,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nwell, we can't do this, that or the other thing because of corruption --\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nI think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption,\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nand feeds corruption.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nWe now have the money, given these low prices, to distribute\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nAIDS drugs all over the world to people we cannot presently reach.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nToday these low prices are available in the 25 countries where we work,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nand in a total of 62 countries,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nand about 550,000 people are getting the benefits of them.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nBut the money is there to reach others.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nThe systems are not there to reach the people.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nSo what we have been trying to do,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nworking first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other places --\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nbut I want to talk about Rwanda tonight --\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nis to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nthat can be used to deal with AIDS, TB, malaria, other infectious diseases,\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nmaternal and child health, and a whole range of health issues\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\npoor people are grappling with in the developing world,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nthat can first be scaled for the whole nation of Rwanda,\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nand then will be a model that could literally\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nbe implemented in any other poor country in the world.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nAnd the test is: one, will it do the job?\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nWill it provide high quality care?\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nAnd two, will it do it at a price\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nthat will enable the country to sustain a health care system\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nwithout foreign donors after five to 10 years?\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nBecause the longer I deal with these problems,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nthe more convinced I am that we have to --\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nwhether it's economics, health, education, whatever --\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nwe have to build systems.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nAnd the absence of systems that function\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nbreak the connection which got you all in this seat tonight.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nYou think about whatever your life has been,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nhowever many obstacles you have faced in your life,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nat critical junctures you always knew\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nthere was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nand the result you achieved.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nIn a world with no systems, with chaos,\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\neverything becomes a guerilla struggle,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nand this predictability is not there.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nAnd it becomes almost impossible to save lives,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\neducate kids, develop economies, whatever.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nThe person, in my view,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nwho has done the best job of this in the health care area,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nof building a system in a very poor area, is Dr. Paul Farmer,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nwho, many of you know, has worked for now 20 years with his group,\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nPartners in Health, primarily in Haiti where he started,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nbut they've also worked in Russia, in Peru\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nand other places around the world.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nAs poor as Haiti is, in the area where Farmer's clinic is active --\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nand they serve a catchment area far greater\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nthan the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve --\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nsince 1988, they have not lost one person to tuberculosis, not one.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nAnd they've achieved a lot of other amazing health results.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nSo when we decided to work in Rwanda\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:35.958\non trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nwe wanted to build a healthcare network,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nbecause it had been totally destroyed during the genocide in 1994,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nand the per capita income was still under a dollar a day.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nSo I rang up, asked Paul Farmer if he would help.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nBecause it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haiti\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nand a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nnumber one, it would be a wonderful thing for a country\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nthat has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last 15 years,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nand number two, we would have something that could then be adapted\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nto any other poor country anywhere in the world.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nAnd so we have set about doing that.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nNow, we started working together 18 months ago.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nAnd we're working in an area called Southern Kayonza,\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nwhich is one of the poorest areas in Rwanda,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nwith a group that originally includes about 400,000 people.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nWe're essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti:\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nhe develops and trains paid community health workers\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nwho are able to identify health problems,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosed\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nand take their medicine regularly,\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nwho work on bringing about health education, clean water and sanitation,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nproviding nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nif they have problems of the severity that require it.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nThe procedures that make this work have been perfected,\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nas I said, by Paul Farmer and his team\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nin their work in rural Haiti over the last 20 years.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nRecently we did an evaluation of the first 18 months of our efforts in Rwanda.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nAnd the results were so good that the Rwandan government\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nhas now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country,\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nand has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nI'll tell you a little bit about our team because it's indicative of what we do.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nWe have about 500 people around the world\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nworking in our AIDS program, some of them for nothing --\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.958\njust for transportation, room and board.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nAnd then we have others working in these other related programs.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nOur business plan in Rwanda\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nwas put together under the leadership of Diana Noble,\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nwho is an unusually gifted woman,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nbut not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nShe was the youngest partner at Schroder Ventures in London in her 20s.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nShe was CEO of a successful e-venture --\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nshe started and built Reed Elsevier Ventures --\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nand at 45 she decided she wanted to do something different with her life.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nSo she now works full-time on this for very little pay.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nShe and her team of former business people have created a business plan\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nthat will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country.\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nAnd it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nshe used to do when she was making a lot more money for it.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nWhen we came to this rural area, 45 percent of the children under the age of five\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nhad stunted growth due to malnutrition.\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:17:01.958\n23 percent of them died before they reached the age of five.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nMortality at birth was over two-and-a-half percent.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nOver 15 percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nbecause of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation --\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nall entirely preventable and treatable.\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nOver 13 percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses --\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nagain, all preventable and treatable.\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:30.958\nAnd not a single soul in this area was being treated for AIDS or tuberculosis.\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nWithin the first 18 months, the following things happened:\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nwe went from zero to about 2,000 people being treated for AIDS.\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nThat's 80 percent of the people who need treatment in this area.\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:48.958\nListen to this: less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nstopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment.\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nThat's lower than the figure in the United States.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nLess than three-tenths of one percent\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nhad to transfer to the more expensive second-line drugs.\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:06.958\n400,000 pregnant women were brought into counseling\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nand will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system.\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nThat's about 43 percent of all the pregnancies.\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nAbout 40 percent of all the people -- I said 400,000. I meant 40,000.\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nAbout 40 percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it --\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nin just 18 months, up from zero when we started.\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:31.958\n43 percent of the children in need of an infant feeding program\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nto prevent malnutrition and early death\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nare now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow.\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nWe've started the first malaria treatment programs they've ever had there.\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nPatients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nthat we have renovated along with four other clinics,\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:55.958\ncomplete with solar power generators, good lab technology.\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nWe now are treating 325 people a month,\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:05.958\ndespite the fact that almost 100 percent of the AIDS patients are now treated at home.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nAnd the most important thing is\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nbecause we've implemented Paul Farmer's model, using community health workers,\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:20.958\nwe estimate that this system could be put into place for all of Rwanda\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nfor between five and six percent of GDP,\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nand that the government could sustain that\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:33.958\nwithout depending on foreign aid after five or six years.\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:36.958\nAnd for those of you who understand healthcare economics\n\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:41.958\nyou know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and 11 percent of GDP\n\n00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:43.958\non health care, except for the United States, we spend 16 --\n\n00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:45.958\nbut that's a story for another day.\n\n00:19:46.958 --> 00:19:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:48.958 --> 00:19:53.958\nWe're now working with Partners in Health and the Ministry of Health in Rwanda\n\n00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:57.958\nand our Foundation folks to scale this system up.\n\n00:19:57.958 --> 00:20:03.958\nWe're also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho.\n\n00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:07.958\nAnd we have similar projects in Tanzania, Mozambique,\n\n00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:12.958\nKenya and Ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing:\n\n00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:14.958\nto save as many

implemented in any country in the world.\n\n00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:25.958\nWe need initial upfront investment to train doctors, nurses,\n\n00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:28.958\nhealth administration and community health workers throughout the country,\n\n00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:31.958\nto set up the information technology, the solar energy,\n\n00:20:31.958 --> 00:20:34.958\nthe water and sanitation, the transportation infrastructure.\n\n00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:37.958\nBut over a five- to 10-year period,\n\n00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:39.958\nwe will take down the need for outside assistance\n\n00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:41.958\nand eventually it will be phased out.\n\n00:20:42.958 --> 00:20:50.958\nMy wish is that TED assist us in our work and help us to build\n\n00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:54.958\na high-quality rural health system in a poor country, Rwanda,\n\n00:20:54.958 --> 00:20:56.958\nthat can be a model for Africa,\n\n00:20:56.958 --> 00:21:01.958\nand indeed, for any poor country anywhere in the world.\n\n00:21:01.958 --> 00:21:07.958\nMy belief is that this will help us to build a more integrated world\n\n00:21:07.958 --> 00:21:10.958\nwith more partners and fewer terrorists,\n\n00:21:10.958 --> 00:21:13.958\nwith more productive citizens and fewer haters,\n\n00:21:13.958 --> 00:21:18.958\na place we'd all want our kids and our grandchildren to grow up in.\n\n00:21:19.958 --> 00:21:25.958\nIt has been an honor for me, particularly, to work in Rwanda\n\n00:21:25.958 --> 00:21:28.958\nwhere we also have a major economic development project\n\n00:21:28.958 --> 00:21:33.958\nin partnership with Sir Tom Hunter, the Scottish philanthropist,\n\n00:21:33.958 --> 00:21:36.958\nwhere last year we, using the same thing with AIDS drugs,\n\n00:21:36.958 --> 00:21:42.958\ncut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on microcredit loans by 30 percent\n\n00:21:42.958 --> 00:21:46.958\nand achieved three- to four-hundred percent increases\n\n00:21:46.958 --> 00:21:48.958\nin crop yields with the farmers.\n\n00:21:48.958 --> 00:21:54.958\nThese people have been through a lot and none of us, most of all me,\n\n00:21:54.958 --> 00:21:57.958\nhelped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other.\n\n00:21:58.958 --> 00:22:04.958\nWe're undoing that now, and they are so over it and so into their future.\n\n00:22:04.958 --> 00:22:08.958\nWe're doing this in an environmentally responsible way.\n\n00:22:08.958 --> 00:22:12.958\nI'm doing my best to convince them not to run the electric

After two days here, I declare myself boggled, and enormously impressed, and feel that you are one of the great hopes \u2014 not just for American achievement in science and technology, but for the whole world. I've come, however, on a special mission on behalf of my constituency, which are the 10-to-the-18th-power \u2014 that's a million trillion \u2014 insects and other small creatures, and to make a plea for them. If we were to wipe out insects alone, just that group alone, on this planet \u2014 which we are trying hard to do \u2014 the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land. And within a few months. Now, how did I come to this particular position of advocacy?As a little boy, and through my teenage years, I became increasingly fascinated by the diversity of life. I had a butterfly period, a snake period, a bird period, a fish period, a cave period and finally and definitively, an ant period. By my college years, I was a devoted myrmecologist, a specialist on the biology of ants, but my attention and research continued to make journeys across the great variety of life on Earth in general \u2014 including all that it means to us as a species, how little we understand it and how pressing a danger that our activities have created for it.Out of that broader study has emerged a concern and an ambition, crystallized in the wish that I'm about to make to you. My choice is the culmination of a lifetime commitment that began with growing up on the Gulf Coast of Alabama, on the Florida peninsula. As far back as I can remember, I was enchanted by the natural beauty of that region and the almost tropical exuberance of the plants and animals that grow there. One day when I was only seven years old and fishing, I pulled a \"pinfish,\" they're called, with sharp dorsal spines, up too hard and fast, and I blinded myself in one eye. I later discovered I was also hard of hearing, possibly congenitally, in the upper registers. So in planning to be a professional naturalist \u2014 I never considered anything else in my entire life \u2014 I found that I was lousy at bird watching and couldn't track frog calls either. So I turned to the teeming small creatures that can be held between the thumb and forefinger: the little things that compose the foundation of our ecosystems, the little things, as I like to say, who run the world. In so doing, I reached a frontier of biology so strange, so rich, that it seemed as though it exists on another planet. In fact, we live on a mostly unexplored planet. The great majority of organisms on Earth remain unknown to science.In the last 30 years, thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world and advances in technology, biologists have, for example, added a full one-third of the known frog and other amphibian species, to bring the current total to 5,400, and more continue to pour in. Two new kinds of whales have been discovered, along with two new antelopes, dozens of monkey species and a new kind of elephant \u2014 and even a distinct kind of gorilla. At the extreme opposite end of the size scale, the class of marine bacteria, the Prochlorococci \u2014 that will be on the final exam \u2014 although discovered only in 1988, are now recognized as likely the most abundant organisms on Earth, and moreover, responsible for a large part of the photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean. These bacteria were not uncovered sooner because they are also among the smallest of all Earth's organisms \u2014 so minute that they cannot be seen with conventional optical microscopy. Yet life in the sea may depend on these tiny creatures.These examples are just the first glimpse of our ignorance of life on this planet. Consider the fungi \u2014 including mushrooms, rusts, molds and many disease-causing organisms. 60,000 species are known to science, but more than 1.5 million have been estimated to exist. Consider the nematode roundworm, the most abundant of all animals. Four out of five animals on Earth are nematode worms \u2014 if all solid materials except nematode worms were to be eliminated, you could still see the ghostly outline of most of it in nematode worms. About 16,000 species of nematode worms have been discovered and diagnosed by scientists; there could be hundreds of thousands of them, even millions, still unknown. This vast domain of hidden biodiversity is increased still further by the dark matter of the biological world of bacteria, which within just the last several years still were known from only about 6,000 species of bacteria worldwide. But that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil, just a little handful of soil, in the 10 billion bacteria that would be there. It's been estimated that a single ton of soil \u2014 fertile soil \u2014 contains approximately four million species of bacteria, all unknown.So the question is: what are they all doing? The fact is, we don't know. We are living on a planet with a lot of activities, with reference to our living environment, done by faith and guess alone. Our lives depend upon these creatures. To take an example close to home: there are over 500 species of bacteria now known \u2014 friendly bacteria \u2014 living symbiotically in your mouth and throat probably necessary to your health for holding off pathogenic bacteria.At this point I think we have a little impressionistic film that was made especially for this occasion. And I'd like to show it. Assisted in this by Billie Holiday. (Video)And that may be just the beginning! The viruses, those quasi-organisms among which are the prophages, the gene weavers that promote the continued evolution in the lives of the bacteria, are a virtually unknown frontier of modern biology, a world unto themselves. What constitutes a viral species is still unresolved, although they're obviously of enormous importance to us. But this much we can say: the variety of genes on the planet in viruses exceeds, or is likely to exceed, that in all of the rest of life combined. Nowadays, in addressing microbial biodiversity, scientists are like explorers in a rowboat launched onto the Pacific Ocean.But that is changing rapidly with the aid of new genomic technology. Already it is possible to sequence the entire genetic code of a bacterium in under four hours. Soon we will be in a position to go forth in the field with sequencers on our backs \u2014 to hunt bacteria in tiny crevices of the habitat's surface in the way you go watching for birds with binoculars. What will we find as we map the living world, as, finally, we get this underway seriously? As we move past the relatively gigantic mammals, birds, frogs and plants to the more elusive insects and other small invertebrates and then beyond to the countless millions of organisms in the invisible living world enveloped and living within humanity? Already what were thought to be bacteria for generations have been found to compose, instead, two great domains of microorganisms: true bacteria and one-celled organisms the archaea, which are closer than other bacteria to the eukaryota, the group that we belong to.Some serious biologists, and I count myself among them, have begun to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganisms, one might \u2014 just might \u2014 find aliens among them. True aliens, stocks that arrived from outer space. They've had billions of years to do it, but especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet. We do know that some bacterial species that have earthly origin are capable of almost unimaginable extremes of temperature and other harsh changes in environment, including hard radiation strong enough and maintained long enough to crack the Pyrex vessels around the growing population of bacteria. There may be a temptation to treat the biosphere holistically and the species that compose it as a great flux of entities hardly worth distinguishing one from the other. But each of these species, even the tiniest Prochlorococci, are masterpieces of evolution. Each has persisted for thousands to millions of years. Each is exquisitely adapted to the environment in which it lives, interlocked with other species to form ecosystems upon which our own lives depend in ways we have not begun even to imagine. We will destroy these ecosystems and the species composing them at the peril of our own existence \u2014 and unfortunately we are destroying them with ingenuity and ceaseless energy.My own epiphany as a conservationist came in 1953, while a Harvard graduate student, searching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of Cuba, ants that shine in the sunlight \u2014 metallic green or metallic blue, according to species, and one species, I discovered, metallic gold. I found my magical ants, but only after a tough climb into the mountains where the last of the native Cuban forests hung on, and were then \u2014 and still are \u2014 being cut back. I realized then that these species and a large part of the other unique, marvelous animals and plants on that island \u2014 and this is true of practically every part of the world \u2014 which took millions of years to evolve, are in the process of disappearing forever. And so it is everywhere one looks.The human juggernaut is permanently eroding Earth's ancient biosphere by a combination of forces that can be summarized by the acronym \"HIPPO,\" the animal hippo. H is for habitat destruction, including climate change forced by greenhouse gases. I is for the invasive species like the fire ants, the zebra mussels, broom grasses and pathogenic bacteria and viruses that are flooding every country, and at an exponential rate \u2014 that's the I. The P, the first one in \"HIPPO,\" is for pollution. The second is for continued population, human population expansion. And the final letter is O, for over-harvesting \u2014 driving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing. The HIPPO juggernaut we have created, if unabated, is destined \u2014 according to the best estimates of ongoing biodiversity research \u2014 to reduce half of Earth's still surviving animal and plant species to extinction or critical endangerment by the end of the century. Human-forced climate change alone \u2014 again, if unabated \u2014 could eliminate a quarter of surviving species during the next five decades. What will we and all future generations lose if much of the living environment is thus degraded? Huge potential sources of scientific information yet to be gathered, much of our environmental stability and new kinds of pharmaceuticals and new products of unimaginable strength and value \u2014 all thrown away.The loss will inflict a heavy price in wealth, security and yes, spirituality for all time to come, because previous cataclysms of this kind \u2014 the last one, that ended the age of dinosaurs \u2014 took, normally, five to 10 million years to repair. Sadly, our knowledge of biodiversity is so incomplete that we are at risk of losing a great deal of it before it is even discovered. For example, even in the United States, the 200,000 species known currently actually has been found to be only partial in coverage; it is mostly unknown to us in basic biology. Only about 15 percent of the known species have been studied well enough to evaluate their status. Of the 15 percent evaluated, 20 percent are classified as \"in peril,\" that is, in danger of extinction. That's in the United States. We are, in short, flying blind into our environmental future. We urgently need to change this. We need to have the biosphere properly explored so that we can understand and competently manage it. We need to settle down before we wreck the planet. And we need that knowledge.This should be a big science project equivalent to the Human Genome Project. It should be thought of as a biological moonshot with a timetable. So this brings me to my wish for TEDsters, and to anyone else around the world who hears this talk. I wish we will work together to help create the key tools that we need to inspire preservation of Earth's biodiversity. And let us call it the \"Encyclopedia of Life.\" What is the \"Encyclopedia of Life?\" A concept that has already taken hold and is beginning to spread and be looked at seriously? It is an encyclopedia that lives on the Internet and is contributed to by thousands of scientists around the world. Amateurs can do it also. It has an indefinitely expandable page for each species.It makes all key information about life on Earth accessible to anyone, on demand, anywhere in the world. I've written about this idea before, and I know there are people in this room who have expended significant effort on it in the past. But what excites me is that since I first put forward this particular idea in that form, science has advanced. Technology has moved forward. Today, the practicalities of making such an encyclopedia, regardless of the magnitude of the information put into it, are within reach. Indeed, in the past year, a group of influential scientific institutions have begun mobilizing to realize this dream. I wish you would help them. Working together, we can make this real.The encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications. It will address transcendent qualities in the human consciousness, and sense of human need. It will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity. And most of all, it can inspire a new generation of biologists to continue the quest that started, for me personally, 60 years ago: to search for life, to understand it and finally, above all, to preserve it. That is my wish.

conventional optical microscopy.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nYet life in the sea may depend on these tiny creatures.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nThese examples are just the first glimpse of our ignorance of life on this planet.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nConsider the fungi -- including mushrooms, rusts, molds and many disease-causing organisms.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:17.958\n60,000 species are known to science,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nbut more than 1.5 million have been estimated to exist.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nConsider the nematode roundworm, the most abundant of all animals.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nFour out of five animals on Earth are nematode worms --\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nif all solid materials except nematode worms were to be eliminated,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nyou could still see the ghostly outline of most of it in nematode worms.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nAbout 16,000 species of nematode worms\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nhave been discovered and diagnosed by scientists;\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nthere could be hundreds of thousands of them, even millions, still unknown.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nThis vast domain of hidden biodiversity is increased still further\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nby the dark matter of the biological world of bacteria,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nwhich within just the last several years\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nstill were known from only about 6,000 species of bacteria worldwide.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nBut that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:38.958\njust a little handful of soil, in the 10 billion bacteria that would be there.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nIt's been estimated that a single ton of soil -- fertile soil --\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:51.958\ncontains approximately four million species of bacteria, all unknown.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nSo the question is: what are they all doing?\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nThe fact is, we don't know.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nWe are living on a planet with a lot of activities, with reference to our living environment,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:15.958\ndone by faith and guess alone.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nOur lives depend upon these creatures.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nTo take an example close to home: there are over 500 species of bacteria now known --\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nfriendly bacteria -- living symbiotically in your mouth and throat\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nprobably necessary to your health for holding off pathogenic bacteria.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nAt this point I think we have a little impressionistic film\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nthat was made especially for this occasion.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nAnd I'd like to show it.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nAssisted in this by Billie Holiday.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\n(Video)\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nAnd that may be just the beginning!\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nThe viruses, those quasi-organisms among which are the prophages,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nthe gene weavers that promote the continued evolution in the lives of the bacteria,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nare a virtually unknown frontier of modern biology, a world unto themselves.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nWhat constitutes a viral species is still unresolved,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nalthough they're obviously of enormous importance to us.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nBut this much we can say: the variety of genes on the planet in viruses\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nexceeds, or is likely to exceed, that in all of the rest of life combined.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nNowadays, in addressing microbial biodiversity,\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nscientists are like explorers in a rowboat launched onto the Pacific Ocean.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nBut that is changing rapidly with the aid of new genomic technology.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAlready it is possible to sequence the entire genetic code of a bacterium in under four hours.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nSoon we will be in a position to go forth in the field with sequencers on our backs --\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nto hunt bacteria in tiny crevices of the habitat's surface\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nin the way you go watching for birds with binoculars.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nWhat will we find as we map the living world, as, finally, we get this underway seriously?\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nAs we move past the relatively gigantic mammals, birds, frogs and plants\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nto the more elusive insects and other small invertebrates and then beyond\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nto the countless millions of organisms in the invisible living world\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nenveloped and living within humanity?\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nAlready what were thought to be bacteria for generations\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nhave been found to compose, instead, two great domains of microorganisms:\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:02.958\ntrue bacteria and one-celled organisms the archaea,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nwhich are closer than other bacteria to the eukaryota, the group that we belong to.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nSome serious biologists, and I count myself among them,\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nhave begun to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganisms,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:28.958\none might -- just might -- find aliens among them.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nTrue aliens, stocks that arrived from outer space.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nThey've had billions of years to do it,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nbut especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nWe do know that some bacterial species that have earthly origin\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nare capable of almost unimaginable extremes of temperature\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nand other harsh changes in environment,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nincluding hard radiation strong enough and maintained long enough to crack the Pyrex vessels\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\naround the growing population of bacteria.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nThere may be a temptation to treat the biosphere holistically\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nand the species that compose it as a great flux of entities\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nhardly worth distinguishing one from the other.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nBut each of these species, even the tiniest Prochlorococci,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nare masterpieces of evolution.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nEach has persisted for thousands to millions of years.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nEach is exquisitely adapted to the environment in which it lives,\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:48.958\ninterlocked with other species to form ecosystems upon which our own lives depend\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nin ways we have not begun even to imagine.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nWe will destroy these ecosystems and the species composing them\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nat the peril of our own existence --\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nand unfortunately we are destroying them with ingenuity and ceaseless energy.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nMy own epiphany as a conservationist came in 1953, while a Harvard graduate student,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nsearching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of Cuba,\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nants that shine in the sunlight --\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nmetallic green or metallic blue, according to species, and one species, I discovered, metallic gold.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nI found my magical ants, but only after a tough climb into the mountains\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nwhere the last of the native Cuban forests hung on,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nand were then -- and still are -- being cut back.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nI realized then that these species\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nand a large part of the other unique, marvelous animals and plants on that island --\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nand this is true of practically every part of the world --\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nwhich took millions of years to evolve, are in the process of disappearing forever.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nAnd so it is everywhere one looks.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nThe human juggernaut is permanently eroding Earth's ancient biosphere by a combination of forces\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nthat can be summarized by the acronym \"HIPPO,\" the animal hippo.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nH is for habitat destruction, including climate change forced by greenhouse gases.\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nI is for the invasive species like the fire ants, the zebra mussels, broom grasses\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nand pathogenic bacteria and viruses that are flooding every country, and at an exponential rate -- that's the I.\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nThe P, the first one in \"HIPPO,\" is for pollution.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nThe second is for continued population, human population expansion.\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nAnd the final letter is O, for over-harvesting --\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:07.958\ndriving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing.\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nThe HIPPO juggernaut we have created, if unabated, is destined --\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:17.958\naccording to the best estimates of ongoing biodiversity research --\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nto reduce half of Earth's still surviving animal and plant species\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nto extinction or critical endangerment by the end of the century.\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nHuman-forced climate change alone -- again, if unabated --\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:38.958\ncould eliminate a quarter of surviving species during the next five decades.\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nWhat will we and all future generations lose\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nif much of the living environment is thus degraded?\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nHuge potential sources of scientific information yet to be gathered,\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nmuch of our environmental stability\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nand new kinds of pharmaceuticals and new products of unimaginable strength and value --\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nall thrown away.\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nThe loss will inflict a heavy price\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nin wealth, security and yes, spirituality for all time to come,\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nbecause previous cataclysms of this kind --\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nthe last one, that ended the age of dinosaurs --\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:27.958\ntook, normally, five to 10 million years to repair.\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:31.958\nSadly, our knowledge of biodiversity is so incomplete\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nthat we are at risk of losing a great deal of it before it is even discovered.\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nFor example, even in the United States, the 200,000 species known currently\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:52.958\nactually has been found to be only partial in coverage;\n\n00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nit is mostly unknown to us in basic biology.\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:04.958\nOnly about 15 percent of the known species have been studied well enough to evaluate their status.\n\n00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:10.958\nOf the 15 percent evaluated, 20 percent are classified as \"in peril,\"\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:12.958\nthat is, in danger of extinction.\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nThat's in the United States.\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nWe are, in short, flying blind into our environmental future.\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:23.958\nWe urgently need to change this.\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:27.958\nWe need to have the biosphere properly explored\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:31.958\nso that we can understand and competently manage it.\n\n00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:35.958\nWe need to settle down before we wreck the planet.\n\n00:19:35.958 --> 00:19:36.958\nAnd we need that knowledge.\n\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:41.958\nThis should be a big science project equivalent to the Human Genome Project.\n\n00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:46.958\nIt should be thought of as a biological moonshot with a timetable.\n\n00:19:46.958 --> 00:19:50.958\nSo this brings me to my wish for TEDsters,\n\n00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:53.958\nand to anyone else around the world who hears this talk.\n\n00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:59.958\nI wish we will work together to help create the key tools\n\n00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:03.958\nthat we need to inspire preservation of Earth's biodiversity.\n\n00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:07.958\nAnd let us call it the \"Encyclopedia of Life.\"\n\n00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:11.958\nWhat is the \"Encyclopedia of Life?\" A concept that has already taken hold\n\n00:20:11.958 --> 00:20:15.958\nand is beginning to spread and be looked at seriously?\n\n00:20:15.958 --> 00:20:18.958\nIt is an encyclopedia that lives on the Internet\n\n00:20:18.958 --> 00:20:23.958\nand is contributed to by thousands of scientists around the world.\n\n00:20:23.958 --> 00:20:26.958\nAmateurs can do it also.\n\n00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:31.958\nIt has an indefinitely expandable page for each species.\n\n00:20:31.958 --> 00:20:37.958\nIt makes all key information about life on Earth accessible to anyone,\n\n00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:39.958\non demand, anywhere in the world.\n\n00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:43.958\nI've written about this idea before,\n\n00:20:43.958 --> 00:20:50.958\nand I know there are people in this room who have expended significant effort on it in the past.\n\n00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:58.958\nBut what excites me is that since I first put forward this particular idea in that form,\n\n00:20:58.958 --> 00:21:00.958\nscience has advanced.\n\n00:21:00.958 --> 00:21:03.958\nTechnology has moved forward.\n\n00:21:03.958 --> 00:21:07.958\nToday, the practicalities of making such an encyclopedia,\n\n00:21:07.958 --> 00:21:13.958\nregardless of the magnitude of the information put into it, are within reach.\n\n00:21:13.958 --> 00:21:17.958\nIndeed, in the past year, a group of influential scientific institutions\n\n00:21:17.958 --> 00:21:21.958\nhave begun mobilizing to realize this dream.\n\n00:21:21.958 --> 00:21:24.958\nI wish you would help them.\n\n00:21:24.958 --> 00:21:27.958\nWorking together, we can make this real.\n\n00:21:28.958 --> 00:21:33.958\nThe encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications.\n\n00:21:33.958 --> 00:21:39.958\nIt will address transcendent qualities in the human consciousness, and sense of human need.\n\n00:21:39.958 --> 00:21:45.958\nIt will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity.\n\n00:21:45.958 --> 00:21:50.958\nAnd most of all, it can inspire a new generation of biologists\n\n00:21:50.958 --> 00:21:55.958\nto continue the quest that started, for me personally, 60 years ago:\n\n00:21:55.958 --> 00:22:00.958\nto search for life, to understand it and finally, above all, to preserve it.\n\n00:22:00.958 --> 00:22:02.958\nThat is my wish. Thank you."}, {"title": "My wish: Let my photographs bear witness", "duration": "1316", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/james_nachtwey_s_searing_pictures_of_war", "transcript": "As someone who has spent his entire career trying to be invisiblestanding in front of an audience is a cross between an out-of-body experience and a deer caught in the headlights, so please forgive me for violating one of the TED commandments by relying on words on paper, and I only hope I'm not struck by lightning bolts before I'm done. I'd like to begin by talking about some of the ideas that motivated me to become a documentary photographer.I was a student in the '60s, a time of social upheaval and questioning, and on a personal level, an awakening sense of idealism. The war in Vietnam was raging; the Civil Rights Movement was under way; and pictures had a powerful influence on me. Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing, and photographers were telling us another. I believed the photographers, and so did millions of other Americans. Their images fueled resistance to the war and to racism. They not only recorded history; they helped change the course of history. Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and, as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience, change became not only possible, but inevitable.I saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism, specifically visual journalism, can bring into focus both the benefits and the cost of political policies. It can give credit to sound decision-making, adding momentum to success. In the face of poor political judgment or political inaction, it becomes a kind of intervention, assessing the damage and asking us to reassess our behavior. It puts a human face on issues which from afar can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact. What happens at ground level, far from the halls of power, happens to ordinary citizens one by one.And I understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view. It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice. And as a reaction, it stimulates public opinion and gives impetus to public debate, thereby preventing the interested parties from totally controlling the agenda, much as they would like to. Coming of age in those days made real the concept that the free flow of information is absolutely vital for a free and dynamic society to function properly. The press is certainly a business, and in order to survive it must be a successful business, but the right balance must be found between marketing considerations and journalistic responsibility.Society's problems can't be solved until they're identified. On a higher plane, the press is a service industry, and the service it provides is awareness. Every story does not have to sell something. There's also a time to give. That was a tradition I wanted to follow. Seeing the war created such incredibly high stakes for everyone involved and that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution \u2014 I wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer. But I was driven by an inherent sense that a picture that revealed the true face of war would almost by definition be an anti-war photograph.I'd like to take you on a visual journey through some of the events and issues I've been involved in over the past 25 years. In 1981, I went to Northern Ireland. 10 IRA prisoners were in the process of starving themselves to death in protest against conditions in jail. The reaction on the streets was violent confrontation. I saw that the front lines of contemporary wars are not on isolated battlefields, but right where people live. During the early '80s, I spent a lot of time in Central America, which was engulfed by civil wars that straddled the ideological divide of the Cold War.In Guatemala, the central government \u2014 controlled by a oligarchy of European decent \u2014 was waging a scorched Earth campaign against an indigenous rebellion, and I saw an image that reflected the history of Latin America: conquest through a combination of the Bible and the sword. An anti-Sandinista guerrilla was mortally wounded as Commander Zero attacked a town in Southern Nicaragua. A destroyed tank belonging to Somoza's national guard was left as a monument in a park in Managua, and was transformed by the energy and spirit of a child. At the same time, a civil war was taking place in El Salvador, and again, the civilian population was caught up in the conflict.I've been covering the Palestinian-Israeli conflict since 1981. This is a moment from the beginning of the second intifada, in 2000, when it was still stones and Molotovs against an army. In 2001, the uprising escalated into an armed conflict, and one of the major incidents was the destruction of the Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank town of Jenin. Without the political will to find common ground, the continual friction of tactic and counter-tactic only creates suspicion and hatred and vengeance, and perpetuates the cycle of violence.In the '90s, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia fractured along ethnic fault lines, and civil war broke out between Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia. This is a scene of house-to-house fighting in Mostar, neighbor against neighbor. A bedroom, the place where people share intimacy, where life itself is conceived, became a battlefield. A mosque in northern Bosnia was destroyed by Serbian artillery and was used as a makeshift morgue. Dead Serbian soldiers were collected after a battle and used as barter for the return of prisoners or Bosnian soldiers killed in action. This was once a park. The Bosnian soldier who guided me told me that all of his friends were there now.At the same time in South Africa, after Nelson Mandela had been released from prison, the black population commenced the final phase of liberation from apartheid. One of the things I had to learn as a journalist was what to do with my anger. I had to use it, channel its energy, turn it into something that would clarify my vision, instead of clouding it. In Transkei, I witnessed a rite of passage into manhood, of the Xhosa tribe. Teenage boys lived in isolation, their bodies covered with white clay. After several weeks, they washed off the white and took on the full responsibilities of men. It was a very old ritual that seemed symbolic of the political struggle that was changing the face of South Africa.Children in Soweto playing on a trampoline. Elsewhere in Africa there was famine. In Somalia, the central government collapsed and clan warfare broke out. Farmers were driven off their land, and crops and livestock were destroyed or stolen. Starvation was being used as a weapon of mass destruction \u2014 primitive but extremely effective. Hundreds of thousands of people were exterminated, slowly and painfully. The international community responded with massive humanitarian relief, and hundreds of thousands of more lives were saved. American troops were sent to protect the relief shipments, but they were eventually drawn into the conflict, and after the tragic battle in Mogadishu, they were withdrawn. In southern Sudan, another civil war saw similar use of starvation as a means of genocide.Again, international NGOs, united under the umbrella of the U.N., staged a massive relief operation and thousands of lives were saved. I'm a witness, and I want my testimony to be honest and uncensored. I also want it to be powerful and eloquent, and to do as much justice as possible to the experience of the people I'm photographing. This man was in an NGO feeding center, being helped as much as he could be helped. He literally had nothing. He was a virtual skeleton, yet he could still summon the courage and the will to move. He had not given up, and if he didn't give up, how could anyone in the outside world ever dream of losing hope? In 1994, after three months of covering the South African election, I saw the inauguration of Nelson Mandela, and it was the most uplifting thing I've ever seen. It exemplified the best that humanity has to offer. The next day I left for Rwanda, and it was like taking the express elevator to hell.This man had just been liberated from a Hutu death camp. He allowed me to photograph him for quite a long time, and he even turned his face toward the light, as if he wanted me to see him better. I think he knew what the scars on his face would say to the rest of the world. This time, maybe confused or discouraged by the military disaster in Somalia, the international community remained silent, and somewhere around 800,000 people were slaughtered by their own countrymen \u2014 sometimes their own neighbors \u2014 using farm implements as weapons.Perhaps because a lesson had been learned by the weak response to the war in Bosnia and the failure in Rwanda, when Serbia attacked Kosovo, international action was taken much more decisively. NATO forces went in, and the Serbian army withdrew. Ethnic Albanians had been murdered, their farms destroyed and a huge number of people forcibly deported. They were received in refugee camps set up by NGOs in Albania and Macedonia. The imprint of a man who had been burned inside his own home. The image reminded me of a cave painting, and echoed how primitive we still are in so many ways.Between 1995 and '96, I covered the first two wars in Chechnya from inside Grozny. This is a Chechen rebel on the front line against the Russian army. The Russians bombarded Grozny constantly for weeks, killing mainly the civilians who were still trapped inside. I found a boy from the local orphanage wandering around the front line. My work has evolved from being concerned mainly with war to a focus on critical social issues as well. After the fall of Ceausescu, I went to Romania and discovered a kind of gulag of children, where thousands of orphans were being kept in medieval conditions. Ceausescu had imposed a quota on the number of children to be produced by each family, thereby making women's bodies an instrument of state economic policy. Children who couldn't be supported by their families were raised in government orphanages. Children with birth defects were labeled incurables, and confined for life to inhuman conditions.As reports began to surface, again international aid went in. Going deeper into the legacy of the Eastern European regimes, I worked for several months on a story about the effects of industrial pollution, where there had been no regard for the environment or the health of either workers or the general population. An aluminum factory in Czechoslovakia was filled with carcinogenic smoke and dust, and four out of five workers came down with cancer.After the fall of Suharto in Indonesia, I began to explore conditions of poverty in a country that was on its way towards modernization. I spent a good deal of time with a man who lived with his family on a railway embankment and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident. When the story was published, unsolicited donations poured in. A trust fund was established, and the family now lives in a house in the countryside and all their basic necessities are taken care of. It was a story that wasn't trying to sell anything. Journalism had provided a channel for people's natural sense of generosity, and the readers responded. I met a band of homeless children who'd come to Jakarta from the countryside, and ended up living in a train station. By the age of 12 or 14, they'd become beggars and drug addicts. The rural poor had become the urban poor, and in the process, they'd become invisible.These heroin addicts in detox in Pakistan reminded me of figures in a play by Beckett: isolated, waiting in the dark, but drawn to the light. Agent Orange was a defoliant used during the Vietnam War to deny cover to the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese army. The active ingredient was dioxin, an extremely toxic chemical that was sprayed in vast quantities, and whose effects passed through the genes to the next generation. In 2000, I began documenting global health issues, concentrating first on AIDS in Africa. I tried to tell the story through the work of caregivers. I thought it was important to emphasize that people were being helped, whether by international NGOs or by local grassroots organizations.So many children have been orphaned by the epidemic that grandmothers have taken the place of parents, and a lot of children had been born with HIV. A hospital in Zambia. I began documenting the close connection between HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. This is an MSF hospital in Cambodia. My pictures can play a supporting role to the work of NGOs by shedding light on the critical social problems they're trying to deal with. I went to Congo with MSF, and contributed to a book and an exhibition that focused attention on a forgotten war in which millions of people have died, and exposure to disease without treatment is used as a weapon. A malnourished child being measured as part of the supplemental feeding program.In the fall of 2004 I went to Darfur. This time I was on assignment for a magazine, but again worked closely with MSF. The international community still hasn't found a way to create the pressure necessary to stop this genocide. An MSF hospital in a camp for displaced people. I've been working on a long project on crime and punishment in America. This is a scene from New Orleans. A prisoner on a chain gang in Alabama was punished by being handcuffed to a post in the midday sun. This experience raised a lot of questions, among them questions about race and equality and for whom in our country opportunities and options are available. In the yard of a chain gang in Alabama.I didn't see either of the planes hit, and when I glanced out my window, I saw the first tower burning, and I thought it might have been an accident. A few minutes later when I looked again and saw the second tower burning, I knew we were at war. In the midst of the wreckage at Ground Zero, I had a realization. I'd been photographing in the Islamic world since 1981 \u2014 not only in the Middle East, but also in Africa, Asia and Europe. At the time I was photographing in these different places, I thought I was covering separate stories, but on 9/11 history crystallized, and I understood I'd actually been covering a single story for more than 20 years, and the attack on New York was its latest manifestation.The central commercial district of Kabul, Afghanistan at the end of the civil war, shortly before the city fell to the Taliban. Land mine victims being helped at the Red Cross rehab center being run by Alberto Cairo. A boy who lost a leg to a leftover mine. I'd witnessed immense suffering in the Islamic world from political oppression, civil war, foreign invasions, poverty, famine. I understood that in its suffering, the Islamic world had been crying out. Why weren't we listening? A Taliban fighter shot during a battle as the Northern Alliance entered the city of Kunduz. When war with Iraq was imminent, I realized the American troops would be very well covered, so I decided to cover the invasion from inside Baghdad. A marketplace was hit by a mortar shell that killed several members of a single family. A day after American forces entered Baghdad, a company of Marines began rounding up bank robbers and were cheered on by the crowds \u2014 a hopeful moment that was short lived.For the first time in years, Shi'ites were allowed to make the pilgrimage to Karbala to observe Ashura, and I was amazed by the sheer number of people and how fervently they practiced their religion. A group of men march through the streets cutting themselves with knives. It was obvious that the Shi'ites were a force to be reckoned with, and we would do well to understand them and learn how to deal with them. Last year I spent several months documenting our wounded troops, from the battlefield in Iraq all the way home.This is a helicopter medic giving CPR to a soldier who had been shot in the head. Military medicine has become so efficient that the percentage of troops who survive after being wounded is much higher in this war than in any other war in our history. The signature weapon of the war is the IED, and the signature wound is severe leg damage. After enduring extreme pain and trauma, the wounded face a grueling physical and psychological struggle in rehab. The spirit they displayed was absolutely remarkable. I tried to imagine myself in their place, and I was totally humbled by their courage and determination in the face of such catastrophic loss. Good people had been put in a very bad situation for questionable results. One day in rehab someone, started talking about surfing and all these guys who'd never surfed before said, \"Hey, let's go.\" And they went surfing.Photographers go to the extreme edges of human experience to show people what's going on. Sometimes they put their lives on the line, because they believe your opinions and your influence matter. They aim their pictures at your best instincts, generosity, a sense of right and wrong, the ability and the willingness to identify with others, the refusal to accept the unacceptable. My TED wish: there's a vital story that needs to be told, and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news photography in the digital era. Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 84, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:16.663\nAs someone who has spent his entire career trying to

me\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nto become a documentary photographer.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nI was a student in the '60s, a time of social upheaval and questioning,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nand on a personal level, an awakening sense of idealism.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nThe war in Vietnam was raging;\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nthe Civil Rights Movement was under way;\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nand pictures had a powerful influence on me.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nOur political and military leaders were telling us one thing,\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nand photographers were telling us another.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nI believed the photographers, and so did millions of other Americans.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nTheir images fueled resistance to the war and to racism.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nThey not only recorded history; they helped change the course of history.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nTheir pictures became part of our collective consciousness\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nand, as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience,\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nchange became not only possible, but inevitable.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nI saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nspecifically visual journalism, can bring into focus\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nboth the benefits and the cost of political policies.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nIt can give credit to sound decision-making, adding momentum to success.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nIn the face of poor political judgment or political inaction,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nit becomes a kind of intervention, assessing the damage\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nand asking us to reassess our behavior.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nIt puts a human face on issues\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nwhich from afar can appear abstract\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nor ideological or monumental in their global impact.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nWhat happens at ground level, far from the halls of power,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nhappens to ordinary citizens one by one.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nAnd I understood that documentary photography\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nhas the ability to interpret events from their point of view.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nIt gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nAnd as a reaction, it stimulates public opinion\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nand gives impetus to public debate,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nthereby preventing the interested parties\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nfrom totally controlling the agenda, much as they would like to.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nComing of age in those days made real\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nthe concept that the free flow of information is absolutely vital\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nfor a free and dynamic society to function properly.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThe press is certainly a business, and in order to survive\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nit must be a successful business,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nbut the right balance must be found\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nbetween marketing considerations and journalistic responsibility.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nSociety's problems can't be solved until they're identified.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nOn a higher plane, the press is a service industry,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nand

turn it into something\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nthat would clarify my vision, instead of clouding it.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nIn Transkei, I witnessed a rite of passage into manhood, of the Xhosa tribe.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nTeenage boys lived in isolation, their bodies covered with white clay.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAfter several weeks, they washed off the white\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nand took on the full responsibilities of men.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.558\nIt was a very old ritual that seemed symbolic\n\n00:07:35.573 --> 00:07:39.958\nof the political struggle that was changing the face of South Africa.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nChildren in Soweto playing on a trampoline.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nElsewhere in Africa there was famine.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nIn Somalia, the central government collapsed and clan warfare broke out.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nFarmers were driven off their land,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nand crops and livestock were destroyed or stolen.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nStarvation was being used as a weapon of mass destruction --\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nprimitive but extremely effective.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nHundreds of thousands of people were exterminated,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nslowly and painfully.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nThe international community responded with massive humanitarian relief,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nand hundreds of thousands of more lives were saved.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nAmerican troops were sent to protect the relief shipments,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nbut they were eventually drawn into the conflict,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nand after the tragic battle in Mogadishu, they were withdrawn.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nIn southern Sudan, another civil war saw similar use of starvation\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nas a means of genocide.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nAgain, international NGOs, united under the umbrella of the U.N.,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nstaged a massive relief operation and thousands of lives were saved.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nI'm a witness, and I want my testimony to be honest and uncensored.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nI also want it to be powerful and eloquent,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nand to do as much justice as possible\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nto the experience of the people I'm photographing.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nThis man was in an NGO feeding center,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nbeing helped as much as he could be helped.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nHe literally had nothing. He was a virtual skeleton,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nyet he could still summon the courage and the will to move.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nHe had not given up, and if he didn't give up,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nhow could anyone in the outside world ever dream of losing hope?\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nIn 1994, after three months of covering the South African election,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nI saw the inauguration of Nelson Mandela,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nand it was the most uplifting thing I've ever seen.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nIt exemplified the best that humanity has to offer.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nThe next day I left for Rwanda,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nand it was like taking the express elevator to hell.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nThis man had just been liberated from a Hutu death camp.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nHe allowed me to photograph him for quite a long time,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nand he even turned his face toward the light,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nas if he wanted me to see him better.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nI think he knew what the scars on his face would say to the rest of the world.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nThis time, maybe confused or discouraged\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nby the military disaster in Somalia,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nthe international community remained silent,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nand somewhere around 800,000 people were slaughtered\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nby their own countrymen -- sometimes their own neighbors --\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nusing farm implements as weapons.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.604\nPerhaps because a lesson had been learned\n\n00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.958\nby the weak response to the war in Bosnia\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nand the failure in Rwanda,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nwhen Serbia attacked Kosovo,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.650\ninternational action was taken much more decisively.\n\n00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.958\nNATO forces went in, and the Serbian army withdrew.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.681\nEthnic Albanians had been murdered,\n\n00:10:47.681 --> 00:10:51.958\ntheir farms destroyed and a huge number of people forcibly deported.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nThey were received in refugee camps\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nset up by NGOs in Albania and Macedonia.\n\n00:11:00.496 --> 00:11:03.958\nThe imprint of a man who had been burned inside his own home.\n\n00:11:04.543 --> 00:11:07.512\nThe image reminded me of a cave painting,\n\n00:11:07.512 --> 00:11:11.958\nand echoed how primitive we still are in so many ways.\n\n00:11:13.435 --> 00:11:17.481\nBetween 1995 and '96, I covered the first two wars\n\n00:11:17.481 --> 00:11:19.958\nin Chechnya from inside Grozny.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nThis is a Chechen rebel on the front line against the Russian army.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:29.604\nThe Russians bombarded Grozny constantly for weeks,\n\n00:11:29.604 --> 00:11:32.958\nkilling mainly the civilians who were still trapped inside.\n\n00:11:34.127 --> 00:11:36.435\nI found a boy from the local orphanage\n\n00:11:36.435 --> 00:11:38.958\nwandering around the front line.\n\n00:11:40.266 --> 00:11:43.958\nMy work has evolved from being concerned mainly with war\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:47.650\nto a focus on critical social issues as well.\n\n00:11:48.235 --> 00:11:50.958\nAfter the fall of Ceausescu, I went to Romania\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nand discovered a kind of gulag of children,\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nwhere thousands of orphans were being kept in medieval conditions.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nCeausescu had imposed a quota\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\non the number of children to be produced by each family,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nthereby making women's bodies an instrument of state economic policy.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nChildren who couldn't be supported by their families\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nwere raised in government orphanages.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nChildren with birth defects were labeled incurables,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nand confined for life to inhuman conditions.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nAs reports began to surface, again international aid went in.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nGoing deeper into the legacy of the Eastern European regimes,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nI worked for several months on a story about the effects of industrial pollution,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nwhere there had been no regard for the environment\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nor the health of either workers or the general population.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nAn aluminum factory in Czechoslovakia\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nwas filled with carcinogenic smoke and dust,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nand four out of five workers came down with cancer.\n\n00:12:54.358 --> 00:12:56.620\nAfter the fall of Suharto in Indonesia,\n\n00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.389\nI began to explore conditions of poverty\n\n00:12:59.389 --> 00:13:02.620\nin a country that was on its way towards modernization.\n\n00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.958\nI spent a good deal of time with a man\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nwho lived with his family on a railway embankment\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nand had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nWhen the story was published, unsolicited donations poured in.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nA trust fund was established,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nand the family now lives in a house in the countryside\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nand all their basic necessities are taken care of.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nIt was a story that wasn't trying to sell anything.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nJournalism had provided a channel\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nfor people's natural sense of generosity, and the readers responded.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nI met a band of homeless children who'd come to Jakarta from the countryside,\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nand ended up living in a train station.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nBy the age of 12 or 14, they'd become beggars and drug addicts.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nThe rural poor had become the urban poor,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nand in the process, they'd become invisible.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.558\nThese heroin addicts in detox in Pakistan\n\n00:13:58.558 --> 00:14:01.450\nreminded me of figures in a play by Beckett:\n\n00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.958\nisolated, waiting in the dark, but drawn to the light.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:12.143\nAgent Orange was a defoliant used during the Vietnam War\n\n00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:16.081\nto deny cover to the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese army.\n\n00:14:16.081 --> 00:14:20.958\nThe active ingredient was dioxin, an extremely toxic chemical\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nthat was sprayed in vast quantities,\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nand whose effects passed through the genes to the next generation.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.620\nIn 2000, I began documenting global health issues,\n\n00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.789\nconcentrating first on AIDS in Africa.\n\n00:14:34.789 --> 00:14:37.958\nI tried to tell the story through the work of caregivers.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nI thought it was important to emphasize that people were being helped,\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:46.404\nwhether by international NGOs or by local grassroots organizations.\n\n00:14:46.404 --> 00:14:48.958\nSo many children have been orphaned by the epidemic\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nthat grandmothers have taken the place of parents,\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nand a lot of children had been born with HIV.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nA hospital in Zambia.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nI began documenting the close connection\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nbetween HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nThis is an MSF hospital in Cambodia.\n\n00:15:14.558 --> 00:15:17.296\nMy pictures can play a supporting role to the work of NGOs\n\n00:15:17.296 --> 00:15:21.958\nby shedding light on the critical social problems they're trying to deal with.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nI went to Congo with MSF,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nand contributed to a book and an exhibition\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nthat focused attention on a forgotten war\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nin which millions of people have died,\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nand exposure to disease without treatment is used as a weapon.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nA malnourished child being measured\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nas part of the supplemental feeding program.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nIn the fall of 2004 I went to Darfur.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nThis time I was on assignment for a magazine,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nbut again worked closely with MSF.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nThe international community still hasn't found a way\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nto create the pressure necessary to stop this genocide.\n\n00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.958\nAn MSF hospital in a camp for displaced people.\n\n00:16:04.312 --> 00:16:08.958\nI've been working on a long project on crime and punishment in America.\n\n00:16:09.127 --> 00:16:11.958\nThis is a scene from New Orleans.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.296\nA prisoner on a chain gang in Alabama\n\n00:16:16.296 --> 00:16:19.958\nwas punished by being handcuffed to a post in the midday sun.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nThis experience raised a lot of questions,\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:27.958\namong them questions about race and equality\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nand for whom in our country opportunities and options are available.\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nIn the yard of a chain gang in Alabama.\n\n00:16:38.235 --> 00:16:40.389\nI didn't see either of the planes hit,\n\n00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:43.958\nand when I glanced out my window, I saw the first tower burning,\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nand I thought it might have been an accident.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nA few minutes later when I looked again\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nand saw the second tower burning, I knew we were at war.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nIn the midst of the wreckage at Ground Zero, I had a realization.\n\n00:16:57.173 --> 00:17:01.958\nI'd been photographing in the Islamic world since 1981 --\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:06.604\nnot only in the Middle East, but also in Africa, Asia and Europe.\n\n00:17:06.604 --> 00:17:09.573\nAt the time I was photographing in these different places,\n\n00:17:09.573 --> 00:17:11.604\nI thought I was covering separate stories,\n\n00:17:11.604 --> 00:17:14.958\nbut on 9/11 history crystallized, and I understood\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:19.204\nI'd actually been covering a single story for more than 20 years,\n\n00:17:19.358 --> 00:17:22.958\nand the attack on New York was its latest manifestation.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nThe central commercial district of Kabul, Afghanistan\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nat the end of the civil war,\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nshortly before the city fell to the Taliban.\n\n00:17:34.343 --> 00:17:36.958\nLand mine victims being helped\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nat the Red Cross rehab center being run by Alberto Cairo.\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:44.573\nA boy who lost a leg to a leftover

famine.\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nI understood that in its suffering,\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nthe Islamic world had been crying out.

First of all, it's been fantastic being here over these past few days. And secondly, I feel it's a great honor to kind of wind up this extraordinary gathering of people, these amazing talks that we've had. I feel that I've fitted in, in many ways, to some of the things that I've heard. I came directly here from the deep, deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador, where I was out \u2014 you could only get there by a plane \u2014 with indigenous people with paint on their faces and parrot feathers on their headdresses, where these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies, and keep the roads, out of their forests. They're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that's clean, a world that isn't contaminated, a world that isn't polluted. And what was so amazing to me, and what fits right in with what we're all talking about here at TED, is that there, right in the middle of this rainforest, was some solar panels \u2014 the first in that part of Ecuador \u2014 and that was mainly to bring water up by pump so that the women wouldn't have to go down. The water was cleaned, but because they got a lot of batteries, they were able to store a lot of electricity. So every house \u2014 and there were, I think, eight houses in this little community \u2014 could have light for, I think it was about half an hour each evening. And there is the Chief, in all his regal finery, with a laptop computer. (Laughter) And this man, he has been outside, but he's gone back, and he was saying, \"You know, we have suddenly jumped into a whole new era, and we didn't even know about the white man 50 years ago, and now here we are with laptop computers, and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world. We want to know about health care. We want to know about what other people do \u2014 we're interested in it. And we want to learn other languages. We want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese, and we're good at languages.\" So there he is with his little laptop computer, but fighting against the might of the pressures \u2014 because of the debt, the foreign debt of Ecuador \u2014 fighting the pressure of World Bank, IMF, and of course the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil. And so, coming directly from there to here. But, of course, my real field of expertise lies in an even different kind of civilization \u2014 I can't really call it a civilization. A different way of life, a different being. We've talked earlier \u2014 this wonderful talk by Wade Davis about the different cultures of the humans around the world \u2014 but the world is not composed only of human beings; there are also other animal beings. And I propose to bring into this TED conference, as I always do around the world, the voice of the animal kingdom. Too often we just see a few slides, or a bit of film, but these beings have voices that mean something. And so, I want to give you a greeting, as from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania \u2014 Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! (Applause) I've been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since 1960. During that time, there have been modern technologies that have really transformed the way that field biologists do their work. For example, for the first time, a few years ago, by simply collecting little fecal samples we were able to have them analyzed \u2014 to have DNA profiling done \u2014 so for the first time, we actually know which male chimps are the fathers of each individual infant. Because the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society. So this opens up a whole new avenue of research. And we use GSI \u2014 geographic whatever it is, GSI \u2014 to determine the range of the chimps. And we're using \u2014 you can see that I'm not really into this kind of stuff \u2014 but we're using satellite imagery to look at the deforestation in the area. And of course, there's developments in infrared, so you can watch animals at night, and equipment for recording by video, and tape recording is getting lighter and better. So in many, many ways, we can do things today that we couldn't do when I began in 1960. Especially when chimpanzees, and other animals with large brains, are studied in captivity, modern technology is helping us to search for the upper levels of cognition in some of these non-human animals. So that we know today, they're capable of performances that would have been thought absolutely impossible by science when I began. I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled in intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan \u2014 her name means love \u2014 and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her. She loves her computer \u2014 she'll leave her big group, and her running water, and her trees and everything. And she'll come in to sit at this computer \u2014 it's like a video game for a kid; she's hooked. She's 28, by the way, and she does things with her computer screen and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans. She does very complex tasks, and I haven't got time to go into them, but the amazing thing about this female is she doesn't like making mistakes. If she has a bad run, and her score isn't good, she'll come and reach up and tap on the glass \u2014 because she can't see the experimenter \u2014 which is asking to have another go. And her concentration \u2014 she's already concentrated hard for 20 minutes or so, and now she wants to do it all over again, just for the satisfaction of having done it better. And the food is not important \u2014 she does get a tiny reward, like one raisin for a correct response \u2014 but she will do it for nothing, if you tell her beforehand. So here we are, a chimpanzee using a computer. Chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans also learn human sign language. But the point is that when I was first in Gombe in 1960 \u2014 I remember so well, so vividly, as though it was yesterday \u2014 the first time, when I was going through the vegetation, the chimpanzees were still running away from me, for the most part, although some were a little bit acclimatized \u2014 and I saw this dark shape, hunched over a termite mound, and I peered with my binoculars. It was, fortunately, one adult male whom I'd named David Greybeard \u2014 and by the way, science at that time was telling me that I shouldn't name the chimps; they should all have numbers; that was more scientific. Anyway, David Greybeard \u2014 and I saw that he was picking little pieces of grass and using them to fish termites from their underground nest. And not only that \u2014 he would sometimes pick a leafy twig and strip the leaves \u2014 modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose \u2014 the beginning of tool-making. The reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough is at that time, it was thought that humans, and only humans, used and made tools. When I was at school, we were defined as man, the toolmaker. So that when Louis Leakey, my mentor, heard this news, he said, \"Ah, we must now redefine 'man,' redefine 'tool,' or accept chimpanzees as humans.\" (Laughter) We now know that at Gombe alone, there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes. Moreover, we know that in different parts of Africa, wherever chimps have been studied, there are completely different tool-using behaviors. And because it seems that these patterns are passed from one generation to the next, through observation, imitation and practice \u2014 that is a definition of human culture. What we find is that over these 40-odd years that I and others have been studying chimpanzees and the other great apes, and, as I say, other mammals with complex brains and social systems, we have found that after all, there isn't a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom. It's a very wuzzy line. It's getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things that we, in our arrogance, used to think was just human. The chimps \u2014 there's no time to discuss their fascinating lives \u2014 but they have this long childhood, five years of suckling and sleeping with the mother, and then another three, four or five years of emotional dependence on her, even when the next child is born. The importance of learning in that time, when behavior is flexible \u2014 and there's an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society. The long-term affectionate supportive bonds that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother, with the brothers and sisters, and which can last through a lifetime, which may be up to 60 years. They can actually live longer than 60 in captivity, so we've only done 40 years in the wild so far. And we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism. We find in their non-verbal communication \u2014 this is very rich \u2014 they have a lot of sounds, which they use in different circumstances, but they also use touch, posture, gesture, and what do they do? They kiss; they embrace; they hold hands. They pat one another on the back; they swagger; they shake their fist \u2014 the kind of things that we do, and they do them in the same kind of context. They have very sophisticated cooperation. Sometimes they hunt \u2014 not that often, but when they hunt, they show sophisticated cooperation, and they share the prey. We find that they show emotions, similar to \u2014 maybe sometimes the same \u2014 as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness, sadness, fear, despair. They know mental as well as physical suffering. And I don't have time to go into the information that will prove some of these things to you, save to say that there are very bright students, in the best universities, studying emotions in animals, studying personalities in animals. We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors \u2014 \"self\" as opposed to \"other.\" They have a sense of humor, and these are the kind of things which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives. But this teaches us a new respect \u2014 and it's a new respect not only for the chimpanzees, I suggest, but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet. Once we're prepared to admit that after all, we're not the only beings with personalities, minds and above all feelings, and then we start to think about ways we use and abuse so many other sentient, sapient creatures on this planet, it really gives cause for deep shame, at least for me. So, the sad thing is that these chimpanzees \u2014 who've perhaps taught us, more than any other creature, a little humility \u2014 are in the wild, disappearing very fast. They're disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well. The deforestation, the growth of human populations, needing more land. They're disappearing because some timber companies go in with clear-cutting. They're disappearing in the heart of their range in Africa because the big multinational logging companies have come in and made roads \u2014 as they want to do in Ecuador and other parts where the forests remain untouched \u2014 to take out oil or timber. And this has led in Congo basin, and other parts of the world, to what is known as the bush-meat trade. This means that although for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years, people have lived in those forests, or whatever habitat it is, in harmony with their world, just killing the animals they need for themselves and their families \u2014 now, suddenly, because of the roads, the hunters can go in from the towns. They shoot everything, every single thing that moves that's bigger than a small rat; they sun-dry it or smoke it. And now they've got transport; they take it on the logging trucks or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it. And people will pay more for bush-meat, as it's called, than for domestic meat \u2014 it's culturally preferred. And it's not sustainable, and the huge logging camps in the forest are now demanding meat, so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin who've lived there with their wonderful way of living for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted. They're given weapons; they shoot for the logging camps; they get money. Their culture is being destroyed, along with the animals upon whom they depend. So, when the logging camp moves, there's nothing left. We talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity, and I've seen it happening with my own eyes. And the grim picture in Africa \u2014 I love Africa, and what do we see in Africa? We see deforestation; we see the desert spreading; we see massive hunger; we see disease and we see population growth in areas where there are more people living on a certain piece of land than the land can possibly support, and they're too poor to buy food from elsewhere. Were the people that we heard about yesterday, on the Easter Island, who cut down their last tree \u2014 were they stupid? Didn't they know what was happening? Of course, but if you've seen the crippling poverty in some of these parts of the world it isn't a question of \"Let's leave the tree for tomorrow.\" \"How am I going to feed my family today? Maybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree which will keep us going a little bit longer, and then we'll pray that something will happen to save us from the inevitable end.\" So, this is a pretty grim picture. The one thing we have, which makes us so different from chimpanzees or other living creatures, is this sophisticated spoken language \u2014 a language with which we can tell children about things that aren't here. We can talk about the distant past, plan for the distant future, discuss ideas with each other, so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group. We can do it by talking to each other; we can do it through video; we can do it through the written word. And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards, and we're destroying the world. In the developed world, in a way, it's worse, because we have so much access to knowledge of the stupidity of what we're doing. Do you know, we're bringing little babies into a world where, in many places, the water is poisoning them? And the air is harming them, and the food that's grown from the contaminated land is poisoning them. And that's not just in the far-away developing world; that's everywhere. Do you know we all have about 50 chemicals in our bodies we didn't have about 50 years ago? And so many of these diseases, like asthma and certain kinds of cancers, are on the increase around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped. We're harming ourselves around the world, as well as harming the animals, as well as harming nature herself \u2014 Mother Nature, that brought us into being; Mother Nature, where I believe we need to spend time, where there's trees and flowers and birds for our good psychological development. And yet, there are hundreds and hundreds of children in the developed world who never see nature, because they're growing up in concrete and all they know is virtual reality, with no opportunity to go and lie in the sun, or in the forest, with the dappled sun-specks coming down from the canopy above. As I was traveling around the world, you know, I had to leave the forest \u2014 that's where I love to be. I had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees for my students and field staff to continue studying because, finding they dwindled from about two million 100 years ago to about 150,000 now, I knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could to raise awareness around the world. And the more I talked about the chimpanzees' plight, the more I realized the fact that everything's interconnected, and the problems of the developing world so often stem from the greed of the developed world, and everything was joining together, and making \u2014 not sense, hope lies in sense, you said \u2014 it's making a nonsense. How can we do it? Somebody said that yesterday. And as I was traveling around, I kept meeting young people who'd lost hope. They were feeling despair, they were feeling, \"Well, it doesn't matter what we do; eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die. Everything is hopeless \u2014 we're always being told so by the media.\" And then I met some who were angry, and anger that can turn to violence, and we're all familiar with that. And I have three little grandchildren, and when some of these students would say to me at high school or university, they'd say, \"We're angry,\" or \"We're filled with despair, because we feel you've compromised our future, and there's nothing we can do about it.\" And I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren, and think how much we've harmed this planet since I was their age. I feel this deep shame, and that's why in 1991 in Tanzania, I started a program that's called Roots and Shoots. There's little brochures all around outside, and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future, I beg that you pick up that brochure. And Roots and Shoots is a program for hope. Roots make a firm foundation. Shoots seem tiny, but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls. See the brick walls as all the problems that we've inflicted on this planet. Then, you see, it is a message of hope. Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through, and can make this a better world. And the most important message of Roots and Shoots is that every single individual makes a difference. Every individual has a role to play. Every one of us impacts the world around us everyday, and you scientists know that you can't actually \u2014 even if you stay in bed all day, you're breathing oxygen and giving out CO2, and probably going to the loo, and things like that \u2014 you're making a difference in the world. So, the Roots and Shoots program involves youth in three kinds of projects. And these are projects to make the world around them a better place. One project to show care and concern for your own human community. One for animals, including domestic animals \u2014 and I have to say, I learned everything I know about animal behavior even before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog, Rusty, who was my childhood companion. And the third kind of project: something for the local environment. So what the kids do depends first of all, how old are they \u2014 and we go now from pre-school right through university. It's going to depend whether they're inner-city or rural. It's going to depend if they're wealthy or impoverished. It's going to depend which part, say, of America they're in. We're in every state now, and the problems in Florida are different from the problems in New York. It's going to depend on which country they're in \u2014 and we're already in 60-plus countries, with about 5,000 active groups \u2014 and there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about that I've never even heard of, because the kids are taking the program and spreading it themselves. Why? Because they're buying into it, and they're the ones who get to decide what they're going to do. It isn't something that their parents tell them, or their teachers tell them. That's effective, but if they decide themselves, \"We want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there. We want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have an organic garden. We want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral histories. We want to go and work in a dog shelter. We want to learn about animals. We want ... \" You know, it goes on and on, and this is very hopeful for me. As I travel around the world 300 days a year, everywhere there's a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages. Everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying, \"Look at the difference we've made.\" And now comes the technology into it, because with this new way of communicating electronically these kids can communicate with each other around the world. And if anyone is interested to help us, we've got so many ideas but we need help \u2014 we need help to create the right kind of system that will help these young people to communicate their excitement. But also \u2014 and this is so important \u2014 to communicate their despair, to say, \"We've tried this and it doesn't work, and what shall we do?\" And then, lo and behold, there's another group answering these kids who may be in America, or maybe this is a group in Israel, saying, \"Yeah, you did it a little bit wrong. This is how you should do it.\" The philosophy is very simple. We do not believe in violence. No violence, no bombs, no guns. That's not the way to solve problems. Violence leads to violence, at least in my view. So how do we solve? The tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding. Know the facts, but see how they fit in the big picture. Hard work and persistence \u2014don't give up \u2014 and love and compassion leading to respect for all life. How many more minutes? Two, one? Chris Anderson: One \u2014 one to two. Jane Goodall: Two, two, I'm going to take two. (Laughter) Are you going to come and drag me off? (Laughter) Anyway \u2014 so basically, Roots and Shoots is beginning to change young people's lives. It's what I'm devoting most of my energy to. And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact, not just because you can share technology with us, but because so many of you have children. And if you take this program out, and give it to your children, they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good, because they've got parents like you. And it's been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place. It's very encouraging. But the kids do ask me \u2014 and this won't take more than two minutes, I promise \u2014 the kids say, \"Dr. Jane, do you really have hope for the future? You travel, you see all these horrible things happening.\" Firstly, the human brain \u2014 I don't need to say anything about that. Now that we know what the problems are around the world, human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems. And we've talked a lot about that. Secondly, the resilience of nature. We can destroy a river, and we can bring it back to life. We can see a whole area desolated, and it can be brought back to bloom again, with time or a little help. And thirdly, the last speaker talked about \u2014 or the speaker before last, talked about the indomitable human spirit. We are surrounded by the most amazing people who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible. Nelson Mandela \u2014 I take a little piece of limestone from Robben Island Prison, where he labored for 27 years, and came out with so little bitterness, he could lead his people from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath. Even after the 11th of September \u2014 and I was in New York and I felt the fear \u2014 nevertheless, there was so much human courage, so much love and so much compassion. And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear \u2014 the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldn't worry about the environment any more, in case they seemed not to be patriotic \u2014 and I was trying to encourage them, somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi, \"If you look back through human history, you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good.\" And just after that a woman brought me this little bell, and I want to end on this note. She said, \"If you're talking about hope and peace, ring this. This bell is made from metal from a defused landmine, from the killing fields of Pol Pot \u2014 one of the most evil regimes in human history \u2014 where people are now beginning to put their lives back together after the regime has crumbled. So, yes, there is hope, and where is the hope? Is it out there with the politicians? It's in our hands. It's in your hands and my hands and those of our children. It's really up to us. We're the ones who can make a difference. If we lead lives where we consciously leave the lightest possible ecological footprints, if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy and don't buy the things that are not, we can change the world overnight. Thank you.", "id": 11, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nGood morning everyone. First of all, it's been fantastic\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nbeing here over these past few days.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nAnd secondly, I feel it's a great honor to kind of wind up\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nthis extraordinary gathering of people,\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nthese amazing talks that we've had.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nI feel that I've fitted in, in many ways,\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nto some of the things that I've heard.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nI came directly here\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nfrom the deep, deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador,\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nwhere I was out -- you could only get there by a plane --\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nwith indigenous people with paint on their faces\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nand parrot feathers on their headdresses,\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nwhere these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nand keep the roads, out of their forests.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nThey're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nin a world that's clean, a world that isn't contaminated,\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:11.958\na world that isn't polluted.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nAnd what was so amazing to me, and what fits right in\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nwith what we're all talking about here at TED,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nis that there, right in the middle of this rainforest,\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nwas some solar panels -- the first in that part of Ecuador --\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nand that was mainly to bring water up by pump\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nso that the women wouldn't have to go down.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nThe water was cleaned, but because they got a lot of batteries,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nthey were able to store a lot of electricity.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nSo every house -- and there were, I think, eight houses\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nin this little community -- could have light\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nfor, I think it was about half an hour each evening.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nAnd there is the Chief, in all his regal finery, with a laptop computer.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nAnd this man, he has been outside, but he's gone back,\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nand he was saying, \"You know, we have suddenly jumped into\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:07.958\na whole new era, and we didn't even know about the white man\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\n50 years ago, and now here we are with laptop computers,\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nand there are some things we want to learn from the modern world.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nWe want to know about health care.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nWe want to know about what other people do -- we're interested in it.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nAnd we want to learn other languages.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nWe want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nand we're good at languages.\"\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nSo there he is with his little laptop computer,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nbut fighting against the might of the pressures --\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nbecause of the debt, the foreign debt of Ecuador --\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nfighting the pressure of World Bank, IMF, and of course\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nthe people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nAnd so, coming directly from there to here.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nBut, of course, my real field of expertise\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nlies in an even different kind of civilization --\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nI can't really call it a civilization.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nA different way of life, a different being.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nWe've talked earlier -- this wonderful talk by Wade Davis\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nabout the different cultures of the humans around the world --\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nbut the world is not composed only of human beings;\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nthere are also other animal beings.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nAnd I propose to bring into this TED conference,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nas I always do around the world, the voice of the animal kingdom.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nToo often we just see a few slides, or a bit of film,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nbut these beings have voices that mean something.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd so, I want to give you a greeting,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nas from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania --\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:55.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nI've been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since 1960.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nDuring that time, there have been modern technologies\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nthat have really transformed the way\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nthat field biologists do their work.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nFor example, for the first time, a few years ago,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nby simply collecting little fecal samples\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nwe were able to have them analyzed -- to have DNA profiling done --\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nso for the first time, we actually know which male chimps\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nare the fathers of each individual infant.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nBecause the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nSo this opens up a whole new avenue of research.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nAnd we use GSI -- geographic whatever it is, GSI --\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nto determine the range of the chimps.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nAnd we're using -- you can see that I'm not really into this kind of stuff --\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nbut we're using satellite imagery\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nto look at the deforestation in the area.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAnd of course, there's developments in infrared,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nso you can watch animals at night,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nand equipment for recording by video,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nand tape recording is getting lighter and better.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nSo in many, many ways, we can do things today\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nthat we couldn't do when I began in 1960.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nEspecially when chimpanzees, and other animals\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nwith large brains, are studied in captivity,\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nmodern technology is helping us to search\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nfor the upper levels of cognition in some of these non-human animals.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nSo that we know today, they're capable of performances\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nthat would have been thought absolutely impossible\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nby science when I began.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nI think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nin intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan --\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nher name means love --\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nand she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nShe loves her computer --\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nshe'll leave her big group, and her running water,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nand her trees and everything.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nAnd she'll come in to sit at this computer --\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nit's like a video game for a kid; she's hooked.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nShe's 28, by the way, and she does things with her computer screen\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nand a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nShe does very complex tasks, and I haven't got time to go into them,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nbut the amazing thing about this female is\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nshe doesn't like making mistakes.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nIf she has a bad run, and her score isn't good,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nshe'll come and reach up and tap on the glass --\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nbecause she can't see the experimenter --\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nwhich is asking to have another go.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nAnd her concentration -- she's already concentrated hard\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nfor 20 minutes or so, and now she wants to do it all over again,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\njust for the satisfaction of having done it better.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nAnd the food is not important -- she does get a tiny reward,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nlike one raisin for a correct response --\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nbut she will do it for nothing, if you tell her beforehand.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nSo here we are, a chimpanzee using a computer.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nChimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans also learn human sign language.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nBut the point is that when I was first in Gombe in 1960 --\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nI remember so well, so vividly, as though it was yesterday --\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nthe first time, when I was going through the vegetation,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nthe chimpanzees were still running away from me, for the most part,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nalthough some were a little bit acclimatized --\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nand I saw this dark shape, hunched over a termite mound,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nand I peered with my binoculars.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nIt was, fortunately, one adult male whom I'd named David Greybeard --\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nand by the way, science at that time was telling me that I shouldn't name the chimps;\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nthey should all have numbers; that was more scientific.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nAnyway, David Greybeard -- and I saw that\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nhe was picking little pieces of grass and using them\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nto fish termites from their underground nest.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nAnd not only that -- he would sometimes pick a leafy twig\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nand strip the leaves --\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nmodifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose --\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nthe beginning of tool-making.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nThe reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nis at that time, it was thought that humans,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nand only humans, used and made tools.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nWhen I was at school, we were defined as man, the toolmaker.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nSo that when Louis Leakey, my mentor, heard this news,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nhe said, \"Ah, we must now redefine 'man,' redefine 'tool,'\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nor accept chimpanzees as humans.\"\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nWe now know that at Gombe alone, there are nine different ways\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nin which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nMoreover, we know that in different parts of Africa,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nwherever chimps have been studied,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nthere are completely different tool-using behaviors.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nAnd because it seems that these patterns are passed\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nfrom one generation to the next, through observation,\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nimitation and practice -- that is a definition of human culture.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nWhat we find is that over these 40-odd years\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nthat I and others have been studying chimpanzees\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nand the other great apes, and, as I say, other mammals\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nwith complex brains and social systems,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nwe have found that after all, there isn't a sharp line\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\ndividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nIt's a very wuzzy line.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nIt's getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nthat we, in our arrogance, used to think was just human.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nThe chimps -- there's no time to discuss their fascinating lives --\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nbut they have this long childhood, five years\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nof suckling and sleeping with the mother,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nand then another three, four or five years\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nof emotional dependence on her, even when the next child is born.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nThe importance of learning in that time, when behavior is flexible --\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nand there's an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nThe long-term affectionate supportive bonds\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nthat develop throughout this long childhood with the mother,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nwith the brothers and sisters,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nand which can last through a lifetime,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nwhich may be up to 60 years.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nThey can actually live longer than 60 in captivity,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nso we've only done 40 years in the wild so far.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nAnd we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nWe find in their non-verbal communication -- this is very rich --\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nthey have a lot of sounds, which they use in different circumstances,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nbut they also use touch, posture, gesture,\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nand what do they do?\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nThey kiss; they embrace; they hold hands.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nThey pat one another on the back; they swagger; they shake their fist --\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nthe kind of things that we do,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nand they do them in the same kind of context.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nThey have very sophisticated cooperation.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nSometimes they hunt -- not that often,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nbut when they hunt, they show sophisticated cooperation,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nand they share the prey.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nWe find that they show emotions, similar to -- maybe sometimes the same --\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nas those that we describe in ourselves as happiness, sadness, fear, despair.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nThey know mental as well as physical suffering.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nAnd I don't have time to go into the information\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nthat will prove some of these things to you,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nsave to say that there are very bright students, in the best universities,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nstudying emotions in animals, studying personalities in animals.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nWe know that chimpanzees and some other creatures\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:20.958\ncan recognize themselves in mirrors -- \"self\" as opposed to \"other.\"\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nThey have a sense of humor, and these are the kind of things\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nwhich traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nBut this teaches us a new respect -- and it's a new respect\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nnot only for the chimpanzees, I suggest,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nbut some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nOnce we're prepared to admit that after all,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nwe're not the only beings with personalities, minds\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nand above all feelings, and then we start to think\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nabout ways we use and abuse\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nso many other sentient, sapient creatures on this planet,\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nit really gives cause for deep shame, at least for me.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nSo, the sad thing is that these chimpanzees --\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nwho've perhaps taught us, more than any other creature, a little humility --\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nare in the wild, disappearing very fast.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nThey're disappearing for the reasons\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nthat all of you in this room know only too well.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nThe deforestation, the growth of human populations, needing more land.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nThey're disappearing because some timber companies\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\ngo in with clear-cutting.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nThey're disappearing in the heart of their range in Africa\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nbecause the big multinational logging companies have come in and made roads --\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nas they want to do in Ecuador\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nand other parts where the forests remain untouched --\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nto take out oil or timber.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nAnd this has led in Congo basin, and other parts of the world,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nto what is known as the bush-meat trade.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nThis means that although for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:04.958\npeople have lived in those forests, or whatever habitat it is,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nin harmony with their world, just killing the animals they need\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nfor themselves and their families --\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nnow, suddenly, because of the roads,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nthe hunters can go in from the towns.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nThey shoot everything, every single thing that moves\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nthat's bigger than a small rat; they sun-dry it or smoke it.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nAnd now they've got transport; they take it on the logging trucks\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nor the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nAnd people will pay more for bush-meat, as it's called,\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nthan for domestic meat -- it's culturally preferred.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nAnd it's not sustainable, and the huge logging camps in the forest\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nare now demanding meat, so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nwho've lived there with their wonderful way of living\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nfor so many hundreds of years are now corrupted.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nThey're given weapons; they shoot for the logging camps; they get money.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nTheir culture is being destroyed,\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nalong with the animals upon whom they depend.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nSo, when the logging camp moves, there's nothing left.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nWe talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nand I've seen it happening with my own eyes.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nAnd the grim picture in Africa -- I love Africa,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nand what do we see in Africa?\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nWe see deforestation;\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nwe see the desert spreading; we see massive hunger;\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nwe see disease and we see population growth in areas\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nwhere there are more people living on a certain piece of land\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nthan the land can possibly support,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nand they're too poor to buy food from elsewhere.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nWere the people that we heard about yesterday,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:44.958\non the Easter Island, who cut down their last tree -- were they stupid?\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nDidn't they know what was happening?\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nOf course, but if you've seen the crippling poverty\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nin some of these parts of the world\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nit isn't a question of \"Let's leave the tree for tomorrow.\"\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\n\"How am I going to feed my family today?\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nMaybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nwhich will keep us going a little bit longer,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nand then we'll pray that something will happen\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nto save us from the inevitable end.\"\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nSo, this is a pretty grim picture.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nThe one thing we have, which makes us so different\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nfrom chimpanzees or other living creatures,\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nis this sophisticated spoken language --\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\na language with which we can tell children\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nabout things that aren't here.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nWe can talk about the distant past, plan for the distant future,\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\ndiscuss ideas with each other,\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nso that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nWe can do it by talking to each other;\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nwe can do it through video; we can do it through the written word.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nAnd we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards,\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nand we're destroying the world.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nIn the developed world, in a way, it's worse,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nbecause we have so much access to knowledge\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nof the stupidity of what we're doing.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nDo you know, we're bringing little babies\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:01.958\ninto a world where, in many places, the water is poisoning them?\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nAnd the air is harming them, and the food that's grown\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nfrom the contaminated land is poisoning them.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nAnd that's not just in the far-away developing world; that's everywhere.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nDo you know we all have about 50 chemicals\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nin our bodies we didn't have about 50 years ago?\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nAnd so many of these diseases, like asthma\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nand certain kinds of cancers, are on the increase\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:30.958\naround places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nWe're harming ourselves around the world,\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nas well as harming the animals, as well as harming nature herself --\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nMother Nature, that brought us into being;\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nMother Nature, where I believe we need to spend time,\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nwhere there's trees and flowers and birds\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nfor our good psychological development.\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nAnd yet, there are hundreds and hundreds of children\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nin the developed world who never see nature,\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nbecause they're growing up in concrete\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nand all they know is virtual reality,\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nwith no opportunity to go and lie in the sun,\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nor in the forest, with the dappled sun-specks\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.958\ncoming down from the canopy above.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nAs I was traveling around the world, you know,\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nI had to leave the forest -- that's where I love to be.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nI had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nfor my students and field staff to continue studying\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nbecause, finding they dwindled from about two million\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:28.958\n100 years ago to about 150,000 now,\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nI knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nto raise awareness around the world.\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nAnd the more I talked about the chimpanzees' plight,\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nthe more I realized the fact that everything's interconnected,\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nand the problems of the developing world\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nso often stem from the greed of the developed world,\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nand everything was joining together, and making -- not sense,\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nhope lies in sense, you said -- it's making a nonsense.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nHow can we do it?\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nSomebody said that yesterday.\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nAnd as I was traveling around, I kept meeting young people who'd lost hope.\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nThey were feeling despair,\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nthey were feeling, \"Well, it doesn't matter what we do;\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:11.958\neat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die.\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:15.958\nEverything is hopeless -- we're always being told so by the media.\"\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nAnd then I met some who were angry,\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nand anger that can turn to violence,\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:23.958\nand we're all familiar with that.\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nAnd I have three little grandchildren,\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nand when some of these students would say to me\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nat high school or university, they'd say, \"We're angry,\"\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nor \"We're filled with despair, because we feel\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nyou've compromised our future, and there's nothing we can do about it.\"\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nAnd I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren,\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:46.958\nand think how much we've harmed this planet since I was their age.\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:52.958\nI feel this deep shame, and that's why in 1991 in Tanzania,\n\n00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nI started a program that's called Roots and Shoots.\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:59.958\nThere's little brochures all around outside,\n\n00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:03.958\nand if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future,\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nI beg that you pick up that brochure.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:10.958\nAnd Roots and Shoots is a program for hope.\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:12.958\nRoots make a firm foundation.\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nShoots seem tiny,\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nbut to reach the sun they can break through brick walls.\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:19.958\nSee the brick walls as all the problems\n\n00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nthat we've inflicted on this planet.\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:25.958\nThen, you see, it is a message of hope.\n\n00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:27.958\nHundreds and thousands of young people around the world\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:31.958\ncan break through, and can make this a better world.\n\n00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:34.958\nAnd the most important message of Roots and Shoots\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:38.958\nis that every single individual makes a difference.\n\n00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:40.958\nEvery individual has a role to play.\n\n00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:44.958\nEvery one of us impacts the world around us everyday,\n\n00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:47.958\nand you scientists know that you can't actually --\n\n00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:50.958\neven if you stay in bed all day, you're breathing oxygen\n\n00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:54.958\nand giving out CO2, and probably going to the loo,\n\n00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:56.958\nand things like that --\n\n00:19:56.958 --> 00:19:58.958\nyou're making a difference in the world.\n\n00:19:58.958 --> 00:20:01.958\nSo, the Roots and Shoots program\n\n00:20:01.958 --> 00:20:06.958\ninvolves youth in three kinds of projects.\n\n00:20:06.958 --> 00:20:10.958\nAnd these are projects to make the world around them a better place.\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:16.958\nOne project to show care and concern for your own human community.\n\n00:20:16.958 --> 00:20:20.958\nOne for animals, including domestic animals -- and I have to say,\n\n00:20:20.958 --> 00:20:22.958\nI learned everything I know about animal behavior\n\n00:20:22.958 --> 00:20:26.958\neven before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog, Rusty,\n\n00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:29.958\nwho was my childhood companion.\n\n00:20:29.958 --> 00:20:33.958\nAnd the third kind of project: something for the local environment.\n\n00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:38.958\nSo what the kids do depends first of all, how old are they --\n\n00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:42.958\nand we go now from pre-school right through university.\n\n00:20:42.958 --> 00:20:45.958\nIt's going to depend whether they're inner-city or rural.\n\n00:20:45.958 --> 00:20:50.958\nIt's going to depend if they're wealthy or impoverished.\n\n00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:53.958\nIt's going to depend which part, say, of America they're in.\n\n00:20:53.958 --> 00:20:56.958\nWe're in every state now, and the problems in Florida\n\n00:20:56.958 --> 00:20:58.958\nare different from the problems in New York.\n\n00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:01.958\nIt's going to depend on which country they're in --\n\n00:21:01.958 --> 00:21:07.958\nand we're already in 60-plus countries, with about 5,000 active groups --\n\n00:21:07.958 --> 00:21:11.958\nand there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about\n\n00:21:11.958 --> 00:21:14.958\nthat I've never even heard of, because the kids are taking the program\n\n00:21:14.958 --> 00:21:16.958\nand spreading it themselves.\n\n00:21:16.958 --> 00:21:18.958\nWhy?\n\n00:21:18.958 --> 00:21:20.958\nBecause they're buying into it,\n\n00:21:20.958 --> 00:21:23.958\nand they're the ones who get to decide what they're going to do.\n\n00:21:23.958 --> 00:21:25.958\nIt isn't something that their parents tell them,\n\n00:21:25.958 --> 00:21:27.958\nor their teachers tell them.\n\n00:21:27.958 --> 00:21:30.958\nThat's effective, but if they decide themselves,\n\n00:21:30.958 --> 00:21:33.958\n\"We want to clean this river\n\n00:21:33.958 --> 00:21:35.958\nand put the fish back that used to be there.\n\n00:21:35.958 --> 00:21:40.958\nWe want to clear away the toxic soil\n\n00:21:40.958 --> 00:21:42.958\nfrom this area and have an organic garden.\n\n00:21:42.958 --> 00:21:45.958\nWe want to go and spend time with the old people\n\n00:21:45.958 --> 00:21:49.958\nand hear their stories and record their oral histories.\n\n00:21:50.958 --> 00:21:52.958\nWe want to go and work in a dog shelter.\n\n00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:54.958\nWe want to learn about animals. We want ... \"\n\n00:21:54.958 --> 00:21:58.958\nYou know, it goes on and on, and this is very hopeful for me.\n\n00:21:58.958 --> 00:22:02.958\nAs I travel around the world 300 days a year,\n\n00:22:02.958 --> 00:22:05.958\neverywhere there's a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages.\n\n00:22:05.958 --> 00:22:07.958\nEverywhere there are children with shining eyes saying,\n\n00:22:07.958 --> 00:22:10.958\n\"Look at the difference we've made.\"\n\n00:22:10.958 --> 00:22:12.958\nAnd now comes the technology into it,\n\n00:22:12.958 --> 00:22:17.958\nbecause with this new way of communicating electronically\n\n00:22:17.958 --> 00:22:21.958\nthese kids can communicate with each other around the world.\n\n00:22:21.958 --> 00:22:24.958\nAnd if anyone is interested to help us, we've got so many ideas\n\n00:22:24.958 --> 00:22:30.958\nbut we need help -- we need help to create the right kind of system\n\n00:22:30.958 --> 00:22:34.958\nthat will help these young people to communicate their excitement.\n\n00:22:34.958 --> 00:22:39.958\nBut also -- and this is so important -- to communicate their despair,\n\n00:22:39.958 --> 00:22:42.958\nto say, \"We've tried this and it doesn't work, and what shall we do?\"\n\n00:22:42.958 --> 00:22:46.958\nAnd then, lo and behold, there's another group answering these kids\n\n00:22:46.958 --> 00:22:49.958\nwho may be in America, or maybe this is a group in Israel,\n\n00:22:49.958 --> 00:22:54.958\nsaying, \"Yeah, you did it a little bit wrong. This is how you should do it.\"\n\n00:22:54.958 --> 00:22:57.958\nThe philosophy is very simple.\n\n00:22:57.958 --> 00:23:00.958\nWe do not believe in violence.\n\n00:23:00.958 --> 00:23:03.958\nNo violence, no bombs, no guns.\n\n00:23:03.958 --> 00:23:05.958\nThat's not the way to solve problems.\n\n00:23:05.958 --> 00:23:09.958\nViolence leads to violence, at least in my view.\n\n00:23:09.958 --> 00:23:11.958\nSo how do we solve?\n\n00:23:11.958 --> 00:23:16.958\nThe tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding.\n\n00:23:16.958 --> 00:23:19.958\nKnow the facts, but see how they fit in the big picture.\n\n00:23:19.958 --> 00:23:22.958\nHard work and persistence --don't give up --\n\n00:23:22.958 --> 00:23:27.958\nand love and compassion leading to respect for all life.\n\n00:23:27.958 --> 00:23:29.958\nHow many more minutes? Two, one?\n\n00:23:29.958 --> 00:23:31.958\nChris Anderson: One -- one to two.\n\n00:23:31.958 --> 00:23:33.958\nJane Goodall: Two, two, I'm going to take two.\n\n00:23:33.958 --> 00:23:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:23:34.958 --> 00:23:36.958\nAre you going to come and drag me off?\n\n00:23:36.958 --> 00:23:38.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:23:38.958 --> 00:23:42.958\nAnyway -- so basically, Roots and Shoots\n\n00:23:42.958 --> 00:23:45.958\nis beginning to change young people's lives.\n\n00:23:45.958 --> 00:23:49.958\nIt's what I'm devoting most of my energy to.\n\n00:23:49.958 --> 00:23:56.958\nAnd I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact,\n\n00:23:56.958 --> 00:23:59.958\nnot just because you can share technology with us,\n\n00:23:59.958 --> 00:24:02.958\nbut because so many of you have children.\n\n00:24:02.958 --> 00:24:07.958\nAnd if you take this program out, and give it to your children,\n\n00:24:07.958 --> 00:24:11.958\nthey have such a good opportunity to go out and do good,\n\n00:24:11.958 --> 00:24:13.958\nbecause they've got parents like you.\n\n00:24:13.958 --> 00:24:17.958\nAnd it's been so clear how much you all care\n\n00:24:17.958 --> 00:24:19.958\nabout trying to make this world a better place.\n\n00:24:19.958 --> 00:24:21.958\nIt's very encouraging.\n\n00:24:21.958 --> 00:24:23.958\nBut the kids do ask me --\n\n00:24:23.958 --> 00:24:25.958\nand this won't take more than two minutes, I promise --\n\n00:24:25.958 --> 00:24:30.958\nthe kids say, \"Dr. Jane, do you really have hope for the future?\n\n00:24:30.958 --> 00:24:34.958\nYou travel, you see all these horrible things happening.\"\n\n00:24:34.958 --> 00:24:38.958\nFirstly, the human brain -- I don't need to say anything about that.\n\n00:24:38.958 --> 00:24:41.958\nNow that we know what the problems are around the world,\n\n00:24:41.958 --> 00:24:45.958\nhuman brains like yours are rising to solve those problems.\n\n00:24:45.958 --> 00:24:47.958\nAnd we've talked a lot about that.\n\n00:24:47.958 --> 00:24:50.958\nSecondly, the resilience of nature.\n\n00:24:50.958 --> 00:24:52.958\nWe can destroy a river,\n\n00:24:52.958 --> 00:24:54.958\nand we can bring it back to life.\n\n00:24:54.958 --> 00:24:59.958\nWe can see a whole area desolated,\n\n00:24:59.958 --> 00:25:04.958\nand it can be brought back to bloom again, with time or a little help.\n\n00:25:04.958 --> 00:25:10.958\nAnd thirdly, the last speaker talked about -- or the speaker before last,\n\n00:25:10.958 --> 00:25:13.958\ntalked about the indomitable human spirit.\n\n00:25:13.958 --> 00:25:17.958\nWe are surrounded by the most amazing people\n\n00:25:17.958 --> 00:25:21.958\nwho do things that seem to be absolutely impossible.\n\n00:25:21.958 --> 00:25:24.958\nNelson Mandela -- I take a little piece of limestone\n\n00:25:24.958 --> 00:25:27.958\nfrom Robben Island Prison, where he labored for 27 years,\n\n00:25:27.958 --> 00:25:32.958\nand came out with so little bitterness, he could lead his people\n\n00:25:32.958 --> 00:25:35.958\nfrom the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath.\n\n00:25:35.958 --> 00:25:39.958\nEven after the 11th of September -- and I was in New York\n\n00:25:39.958 --> 00:25:45.958\nand I felt the fear -- nevertheless, there was so much human courage,\n\n00:25:45.958 --> 00:25:48.958\nso much love and so much compassion.\n\n00:25:48.958 --> 00:25:52.958\nAnd then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear --\n\n00:25:52.958 --> 00:25:54.958\nthe fear that was leading to people feeling\n\n00:25:54.958 --> 00:25:56.958\nthey couldn't worry about the environment any more,\n\n00:25:56.958 --> 00:25:59.958\nin case they seemed not to be patriotic --\n\n00:25:59.958 --> 00:26:01.958\nand I was trying to encourage them,\n\n00:26:01.958 --> 00:26:04.958\nsomebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi,\n\n00:26:04.958 --> 00:26:07.958\n\"If you look back through human history,\n\n00:26:07.958 --> 00:26:10.958\nyou see that every evil regime has been overcome by good.\"\n\n00:26:11.958 --> 00:26:15.958\nAnd just after that a woman brought me this little bell,\n\n00:26:15.958 --> 00:26:17.958\nand I want to end on this note.\n\n00:26:17.958 --> 00:26:20.958\nShe said, \"If you're talking about hope and peace, ring this.\n\n00:26:22.958 --> 00:26:28.958\nThis bell is made from metal from a defused landmine,\n\n00:26:28.958 --> 00:26:31.958\nfrom the killing fields of Pol Pot --\n\n00:26:31.958 --> 00:26:34.958\none of the most evil regimes in human history --\n\n00:26:34.958 --> 00:26:38.958\nwhere people are now beginning to put their lives back together\n\n00:26:38.958 --> 00:26:41.958\nafter the regime has crumbled.\n\n00:26:41.958 --> 00:26:45.958\nSo, yes, there is hope, and where is the hope?\n\n00:26:45.958 --> 00:26:48.958\nIs it out there with the politicians?\n\n00:26:49.958 --> 00:26:51.958\nIt's in our hands.\n\n00:26:51.958 --> 00:26:53.958\nIt's in your hands and my hands\n\n00:26:53.958 --> 00:26:55.958\nand those of our children.\n\n00:26:55.958 --> 00:26:57.958\nIt's really up to us.\n\n00:26:57.958 --> 00:26:59.958\nWe're the ones who can make a difference.\n\n00:26:59.958 --> 00:27:01.958\nIf we lead lives where we consciously leave\n\n00:27:01.958 --> 00:27:05.958\nthe lightest possible ecological footprints,\n\n00:27:05.958 --> 00:27:08.958\nif we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy\n\n00:27:08.958 --> 00:27:11.958\nand don't buy the things that are not,\n\n00:27:11.958 --> 00:27:14.958\nwe can change the world overnight.\n\n00:27:14.958 --> 00:27:15.958\nThank you."}, {"title": "How to get your ideas to spread", "duration": "1021", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/seth_godin_on_sliced_bread", "transcript": "I'm going to give you four specific examples, I'm going to cover at the end about how a company called Silk tripled their sales; how an artist named Jeff Koons went from being a nobody to making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact; to how Frank Gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect. And one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years \u2014 a record label I started that had a CD called \"Sauce.\"Before I can do that I've got to tell you about sliced bread, and a guy named Otto Rohwedder. Now, before sliced bread was invented in the 1910s I wonder what they said? Like the greatest invention since the telegraph or something. But this guy named Otto Rohwedder invented sliced bread, and he focused, like most inventors did, on the patent part and the making part. And the thing about the invention of sliced bread is this \u2014 that for the first 15 years after sliced bread was available no one bought it; no one knew about it; it was a complete and total failure. And the reason is that until Wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread, no one wanted it. That the success of sliced bread, like the success of almost everything we've talked about at this conference, is not always about what the patent is like, or what the factory is like \u2014 it's about can you get your idea to spread, or not. And I think that the way you're going to get what you want, or cause the change that you want to change, to happen, is to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread.And it doesn't matter to me whether you're running a coffee shop or you're an intellectual, or you're in business, or you're flying hot air balloons. I think that all this stuff applies to everybody regardless of what we do. That what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion. That people who can spread ideas, regardless of what those ideas are, win. When I talk about it I usually pick business, because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation, and because it's the easiest sort of way to keep score. But I want you to forgive me when I use these examples because I'm talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do.At the heart of spreading ideas is TV and stuff like TV. TV and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way. I call it the \"TV-industrial complex.\" The way the TV-industrial complex works, is you buy some ads, interrupt some people, that gets you distribution. You use the distribution you get to sell more products. You take the profit from that to buy more ads. And it goes around and around and around, the same way that the military-industrial complex worked a long time ago. That model of, and we heard it yesterday \u2014 if we could only get onto the homepage of Google, if we could only figure out how to get promoted there, or grab that person by the throat, and tell them about what we want to do. If we did that then everyone would pay attention, and we would win. Well, this TV-industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours. I mean, all of these products succeeded because someone figured out how to touch people in a way they weren't expecting, in a way they didn't necessarily want, with an ad, over and over again until they bought it.And the thing that's happened is, they canceled the TV-industrial complex. That just over the last few years, what anybody who markets anything has discovered is that it's not working the way that it used to. This picture is really fuzzy, I apologize; I had a bad cold when I took it.(Laughter)But the product in the blue box in the center is my poster child. I go to the deli; I'm sick; I need to buy some medicine. The brand manager for that blue product spent 100 million dollars trying to interrupt me in one year. 100 million dollars interrupting me with TV commercials and magazine ads and Spam and coupons and shelving allowances and spiff \u2014 all so I could ignore every single message. And I ignored every message because I don't have a pain reliever problem. I buy the stuff in the yellow box because I always have. And I'm not going to invest a minute of my time to solve her problem, because I don't care.Here's a magazine called \"Hydrate.\" It's 180 pages about water.(Laughter)Articles about water, ads about water. Imagine what the world was like 40 years ago, with just the Saturday Evening Post and Time and Newsweek. Now there are magazines about water. New product from Coke Japan: water salad.(Laughter)Coke Japan comes out with a new product every three weeks, because they have no idea what's going to work and what's not. I couldn't have written this better myself. It came out four days ago \u2014 I circled the important parts so you can see them here. They've come out... Arby's is going to spend 85 million dollars promoting an oven mitt with the voice of Tom Arnold, hoping that that will get people to go to Arby's and buy a roast beef sandwich.(Laughter)Now, I had tried to imagine what could possibly be in an animated TV commercial featuring Tom Arnold, that would get you to get in your car, drive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich.(Laughter)Now, this is Copernicus, and he was right, when he was talking to anyone who needs to hear your idea. \"The world revolves around me.\" Me, me, me, me. My favorite person \u2014 me. I don't want to get email from anybody; I want to get \"memail.\"(Laughter)So consumers, and I don't just mean people who buy stuff at the Safeway; I mean people at the Defense Department who might buy something, or people at, you know, the New Yorker who might print your article. Consumers don't care about you at all; they just don't care. Part of the reason is \u2014 they've got way more choices than they used to, and way less time. And in a world where we have too many choices and too little time, the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff. And my parable here is you're driving down the road and you see a cow, and you keep driving because you've seen cows before. Cows are invisible. Cows are boring. Who's going to stop and pull over and say \u2014 \"Oh, look, a cow.\" Nobody.(Laughter)But if the cow was purple \u2014 isn't that a great special effect? I could do that again if you want. If the cow was purple, you'd notice it for a while. I mean, if all cows were purple you'd get bored with those, too. The thing that's going to decide what gets talked about, what gets done, what gets changed, what gets purchased, what gets built, is: \"Is it remarkable?\" And \"remarkable\" is a really cool word, because we think it just means \"neat,\" but it also means \"worth making a remark about.\" And that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going. That two of the hottest cars in the United States is a 55,000-dollar giant car, big enough to hold a Mini in its trunk. People are paying full price for both, and the only thing they have in common is that they don't have anything in common.(Laughter)Every week, the number one best-selling DVD in America changes. It's never \"The Godfather,\" it's never \"Citizen Kane,\" it's always some third-rate movie with some second-rate star. But the reason it's number one is because that's the week it came out. Because it's new, because it's fresh. People saw it and said \"I didn't know that was there\" and they noticed it. Two of the big success stories of the last 20 years in retail \u2014 one sells things that are super-expensive in a blue box, and one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them. The only thing they have in common is that they're different.We're now in the fashion business, no matter what we do for a living, we're in the fashion business. And people in the fashion business know what it's like to be in the fashion business \u2014 they're used to it. The rest of us have to figure out how to think that way. How to understand that it's not about interrupting people with big full-page ads, or insisting on meetings with people. But it's a totally different sort of process that determines which ideas spread, and which ones don't. They sold a billion dollars' worth of Aeron chairs by reinventing what it meant to sell a chair. They turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought, to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work. This guy, Lionel Poil\u00e2ne, the most famous baker in the world \u2014 he died two and a half months ago, and he was a hero of mine and a dear friend. He lived in Paris. Last year, he sold 10 million dollars' worth of French bread. Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned, by one baker at a time, in a wood-fired oven. And when Lionel started his bakery, the French pooh-pooh-ed it. They didn't want to buy his bread. It didn't look like \"French bread.\" It wasn't what they expected. It was neat; it was remarkable; and slowly, it spread from one person to another person until finally, it became the official bread of three-star restaurants in Paris. Now he's in London, and he ships by FedEx all around the world.What marketers used to do is make average products for average people. That's what mass marketing is. Smooth out the edges; go for the center; that's the big market. They would ignore the geeks, and God forbid, the laggards. It was all about going for the center. But in a world where the TV-industrial complex is broken, I don't think that's a strategy we want to use any more. I think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people because they're really good at ignoring you. But market to these people because they care. These are the people who are obsessed with something. And when you talk to them, they'll listen, because they like listening \u2014 it's about them. And if you're lucky, they'll tell their friends on the rest of the curve, and it'll spread. It'll spread to the entire curve.They have something I call \"otaku\" \u2014 it's a great Japanese word. It describes the desire of someone who's obsessed to say, drive across Tokyo to try a new ramen noodle place, because that's what they do: they get obsessed with it. To make a product, to market an idea, to come up with any problem you want to solve that doesn't have a constituency with an otaku, is almost impossible. Instead, you have to find a group that really, desperately cares about what it is you have to say. Talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends. There's a hot sauce otaku, but there's no mustard otaku. That's why there's lots and lots of kinds of hot sauces, and not so many kinds of mustard. Not because it's hard to make interesting mustard \u2014 you could make interesting mustard \u2014 but people don't, because no one's obsessed with it, and thus no one tells their friends. Krispy Kreme has figured this whole thing out. It has a strategy, and what they do is, they enter a city, they talk to the people, with the otaku, and then they spread through the city to the people who've just crossed the street.This yoyo right here cost 112 dollars, but it sleeps for 12 minutes. Not everybody wants it but they don't care. They want to talk to the people who do, and maybe it'll spread. These guys make the loudest car stereo in the world.(Laughter)It's as loud as a 747 jet.You can't get in, the car's got bulletproof glass, because it'll blow out the windshield otherwise. But the fact remains that when someone wants to put a couple of speakers in their car, if they've got the otaku or they've heard from someone who does, they go ahead and they pick this.It's really simple \u2014 you sell to the people who are listening, and just maybe, those people tell their friends. So when Steve Jobs talks to 50,000 people at his keynote, who are all tuned in from 130 countries watching his two-hour commercial \u2014 that's the only thing keeping his company in business \u2014 it's that those 50,000 people care desperately enough to watch a two-hour commercial, and then tell their friends. Pearl Jam, 96 albums released in the last two years. Every one made a profit. How? They only sell them on their website. Those people who buy them have the otaku, and then they tell their friends, and it spreads and it spreads. This hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars, 10 times the standard. But hospitals are buying it faster than any other model. Hard Candy nail polish, doesn't appeal to everybody, but to the people who love it, they talk about it like crazy. This paint can right here saved the Dutch Boy paint company, making them a fortune. It costs 35 percent more than regular paint because Dutch Boy made a can that people talk about, because it's remarkable. They didn't just slap a new ad on the product; they changed what it meant to build a paint product. AmIhotornot.com \u2014 everyday 250,000 people go to this site, run by two volunteers, and I can tell you they are hard graders \u2014(Laughter)They didn't get this way by advertising a lot. They got this way by being remarkable, sometimes a little too remarkable. And this picture frame has a cord going out the back, and you plug it into the wall. My father has this on his desk, and he sees his grandchildren everyday, changing constantly. And every single person who walks into his office hears the whole story of how this thing ended up on his desk. And one person at a time, the idea spreads. These are not diamonds, not really. They're made from \"cremains.\" After you're cremated you can have yourself made into a gem.(Laughter)Oh, you like my ring? It's my grandmother.(Laughter)Fastest-growing business in the whole mortuary industry. But you don't have to be Ozzie Osborne \u2014 you don't have to be super-outrageous to do this. What you have to do is figure out what people really want and give it to them.A couple of quick rules to wrap up. The first one is: Design is free when you get to scale. The people who come up with stuff that's remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them. Number two: The riskiest thing you can do now is be safe. Proctor and Gamble knows this, right? The whole model of being Proctor and Gamble is always about average products for average people. That's risky. The safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes, be remarkable. And being very good is one of the worst things you can possibly do. Very good is boring. Very good is average. It doesn't matter whether you're making a record album, or you're an architect, or you have a tract on sociology. If it's very good, it's not going to work, because no one's going to notice it.So my three stories. Silk put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section. Sales tripled. Why? Milk, milk, milk, milk, milk \u2014 not milk. For the people who were there and looking at that section, it was remarkable. They didn't triple their sales with advertising; they tripled it by doing something remarkable. That is a remarkable piece of art. You don't have to like it, but a 40-foot tall dog made out of bushes in the middle of New York City is remarkable.(Laughter)Frank Gehry didn't just change a museum; he changed an entire city's economy by designing one building that people from all over the world went to see. Now, at countless meetings at, you know, the Portland City Council, or who knows where, they said, we need an architect \u2014 can we get Frank Gehry? Because he did something that was at the fringes. And my big failure? I came out with an entire \u2014(Music)A record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums in SACD, this remarkable new format \u2014 and I marketed it straight to people with 20,000-dollar stereos. People with 20,000-dollar stereos don't like new music.(Laughter)So what you need to do is figure out who does care. Who is going to raise their hand and say, \"I want to hear what you're doing next,\" and sell something to them. The last example I want to give you. This is a map of Soap Lake, Washington. As you can see, if that's nowhere, it's in the middle of it.(Laughter)But they do have a lake. And people used to come from miles around to swim in the lake. They don't anymore. So the founding fathers said, \"We've got some money to spend. What can we build here?\" And like most committees, they were going to build something pretty safe. And then an artist came to them \u2014 this is a true artist's rendering \u2014 he wants to build a 55-foot tall lava lamp in the center of town. That's a purple cow; that's something worth noticing. I don't know about you, but if they build it, that's where I'm going to go.Thank you very much for your attention.", "id": 28, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.696 --> 00:00:15.301\nI'm going to give you\nfour specific examples,\n\n00:00:15.325 --> 00:00:17.191\nI'm going to cover at the end\n\n00:00:17.215 --> 00:00:19.866\nabout how a company called Silk\ntripled their sales;\n\n00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.934\nhow an artist named Jeff Koons\nwent from being a nobody\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.934\nto making a whole bunch of money\nand having a lot of impact;\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nto how Frank Gehry redefined\nwhat it meant to be an architect.\n\n00:00:29.458 --> 00:00:33.053\nAnd one of my biggest failures\nas a marketer in the last few years --\n\n00:00:33.077 --> 00:00:36.751\na record label I started\nthat had a CD called \"Sauce.\"\n\n00:00:37.084 --> 00:00:40.012\nBefore I can do that\nI've got to tell you about sliced bread,\n\n00:00:40.036 --> 00:00:41.735\nand a guy named Otto Rohwedder.\n\n00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:45.018\nNow, before sliced bread\nwas invented in the 1910s\n\n00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:46.989\nI wonder what they said?\n\n00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:50.109\nLike the greatest invention\nsince the telegraph or something.\n\n00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:53.401\nBut this guy named Otto Rohwedder\ninvented sliced bread,\n\n00:00:53.425 --> 00:00:58.434\nand he focused, like most inventors did,\non the patent part and the making part.\n\n00:00:58.848 --> 00:01:01.681\nAnd the thing about the invention\nof sliced bread is this --\n\n00:01:01.705 --> 00:01:05.770\nthat for the first 15 years\nafter sliced bread was available\n\n00:01:05.794 --> 00:01:08.160\nno one bought it;

(Laughter) Chris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of DNA. And since, you know, I follow his orders, I'll do it. But it slightly bores me. (Laughter) And, you know, I wrote a book. So I'll say something \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 I'll say a little about, you know, how the discovery was made, and why Francis and I found it. And then, I hope maybe I have at least five minutes to say what makes me tick now.In back of me is a picture of me when I was 17. I was at the University of Chicago, in my third year, and I was in my third year because the University of Chicago let you in after two years of high school. So you \u2014 it was fun to get away from high school \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 because I was very small, and I was no good in sports, or anything like that.But I should say that my background \u2014 my father was, you know, raised to be an Episcopalian and Republican, but after one year of college, he became an atheist and a Democrat. (Laughter) And my mother was Irish Catholic, and \u2014 but she didn't take religion too seriously. And by the age of 11, I was no longer going to Sunday Mass, and going on birdwatching walks with my father. So early on, I heard of Charles Darwin. I guess, you know, he was the big hero. And, you know, you understand life as it now exists through evolution.And at the University of Chicago I was a zoology major, and thought I would end up, you know, if I was bright enough, maybe getting a Ph.D. from Cornell in ornithology. Then, in the Chicago paper, there was a review of a book called \"What is Life?\" by the great physicist, Schrodinger. And that, of course, had been a question I wanted to know. You know, Darwin explained life after it got started, but what was the essence of life?And Schrodinger said the essence was information present in our chromosomes, and it had to be present on a molecule. I'd never really thought of molecules before. You know chromosomes, but this was a molecule, and somehow all the information was probably present in some digital form. And there was the big question of, how did you copy the information?So that was the book. And so, from that moment on, I wanted to be a geneticist \u2014 understand the gene and, through that, understand life. So I had, you know, a hero at a distance. It wasn't a baseball player; it was Linus Pauling. And so I applied to Caltech and they turned me down. (Laughter) So I went to Indiana, which was actually as good as Caltech in genetics, and besides, they had a really good basketball team. (Laughter) So I had a really quite happy life at Indiana. And it was at Indiana I got the impression that, you know, the gene was likely to be DNA. And so when I got my Ph.D., I should go and search for DNA.So I first went to Copenhagen because I thought, well, maybe I could become a biochemist, but I discovered biochemistry was very boring. It wasn't going anywhere toward, you know, saying what the gene was; it was just nuclear science. And oh, that's the book, little book. You can read it in about two hours. And \u2014 but then I went to a meeting in Italy. And there was an unexpected speaker who wasn't on the program, and he talked about DNA. And this was Maurice Wilkins. He was trained as a physicist, and after the war he wanted to do biophysics, and he picked DNA because DNA had been determined at the Rockefeller Institute to possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes. Most people believed it was proteins. But Wilkins, you know, thought DNA was the best bet, and he showed this x-ray photograph. Sort of crystalline. So DNA had a structure, even though it owed it to probably different molecules carrying different sets of instructions. So there was something universal about the DNA molecule. So I wanted to work with him, but he didn't want a former birdwatcher, and I ended up in Cambridge, England.So I went to Cambridge, because it was really the best place in the world then for x-ray crystallography. And x-ray crystallography is now a subject in, you know, chemistry departments. I mean, in those days it was the domain of the physicists. So the best place for x-ray crystallography was at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge. And there I met Francis Crick. I went there without knowing him. He was 35. I was 23. And within a day, we had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of DNA. Not solve it like, you know, in rigorous fashion, but build a model, an electro-model, using some coordinates of, you know, length, all that sort of stuff from x-ray photographs. But just ask what the molecule \u2014 how should it fold up?And the reason for doing so, at the center of this photograph, is Linus Pauling. About six months before, he proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins. And in doing so, he banished the man out on the right, Sir Lawrence Bragg, who was the Cavendish professor. This is a photograph several years later, when Bragg had cause to smile. He certainly wasn't smiling when I got there, because he was somewhat humiliated by Pauling getting the alpha helix, and the Cambridge people failing because they weren't chemists. And certainly, neither Crick or I were chemists, so we tried to build a model. And he knew, Francis knew Wilkins. So Wilkins said he thought it was the helix. X-ray diagram, he thought was comparable with the helix.So we built a three-stranded model. The people from London came up. Wilkins and this collaborator, or possible collaborator, Rosalind Franklin, came up and sort of laughed at our model. They said it was lousy, and it was. So we were told to build no more models; we were incompetent. (Laughter) And so we didn't build any models, and Francis sort of continued to work on proteins. And basically, I did nothing. And \u2014 except read. You know, basically, reading is a good thing; you get facts. And we kept telling the people in London that Linus Pauling's going to move on to DNA. If DNA is that important, Linus will know it. He'll build a model, and then we're going to be scooped.And, in fact, he'd written the people in London: Could he see their x-ray photograph? And they had the wisdom to say \"no.\" So he didn't have it. But there was ones in the literature. Actually, Linus didn't look at them that carefully. But about, oh, 15 months after I got to Cambridge, a rumor began to appear from Linus Pauling's son, who was in Cambridge, that his father was now working on DNA. And so, one day Peter came in and he said he was Peter Pauling, and he gave me a copy of his father's manuscripts. And boy, I was scared because I thought, you know, we may be scooped. I have nothing to do, no qualifications for anything. (Laughter)And so there was the paper, and he proposed a three-stranded structure. And I read it, and it was just \u2014 it was crap. (Laughter) So this was, you know, unexpected from the world's \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 and so, it was held together by hydrogen bonds between phosphate groups. Well, if the peak pH that cells have is around seven, those hydrogen bonds couldn't exist. We rushed over to the chemistry department and said, \"Could Pauling be right?\" And Alex Hust said, \"No.\" So we were happy. (Laughter)And, you know, we were still in the game, but we were frightened that somebody at Caltech would tell Linus that he was wrong. And so Bragg said, \"Build models.\" And a month after we got the Pauling manuscript \u2014 I should say I took the manuscript to London, and showed the people. Well, I said, Linus was wrong and that we're still in the game and that they should immediately start building models. But Wilkins said \"no.\" Rosalind Franklin was leaving in about two months, and after she left he would start building models. And so I came back with that news to Cambridge, and Bragg said, \"Build models.\" Well, of course, I wanted to build models. And there's a picture of Rosalind. She really, you know, in one sense she was a chemist, but really she would have been trained \u2014 she didn't know any organic chemistry or quantum chemistry. She was a crystallographer.And I think part of the reason she didn't want to build models was, she wasn't a chemist, whereas Pauling was a chemist. And so Crick and I, you know, started building models, and I'd learned a little chemistry, but not enough. Well, we got the answer on the 28th February '53. And it was because of a rule, which, to me, is a very good rule: Never be the brightest person in a room, and we weren't. We weren't the best chemists in the room. I went in and showed them a pairing I'd done, and Jerry Donohue \u2014 he was a chemist \u2014 he said, it's wrong. You've got \u2014 the hydrogen atoms are in the wrong place. I just put them down like they were in the books. He said they were wrong.So the next day, you know, after I thought, \"Well, he might be right.\" So I changed the locations, and then we found the base pairing, and Francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions. And we knew we were right. So it was a pretty, you know, it all happened in about two hours. From nothing to thing. And we knew it was big because, you know, if you just put A next to T and G next to C, you have a copying mechanism. So we saw how genetic information is carried. It's the order of the four bases. So in a sense, it is a sort of digital-type information. And you copy it by going from strand-separating. So, you know, if it didn't work this way, you might as well believe it, because you didn't have any other scheme. (Laughter)But that's not the way most scientists think. Most scientists are really rather dull. They said, we won't think about it until we know it's right. But, you know, we thought, well, it's at least 95 percent right or 99 percent right. So think about it. The next five years, there were essentially something like five references to our work in \"Nature\" \u2014 none. And so we were left by ourselves, and trying to do the last part of the trio: how do you \u2014 what does this genetic information do? It was pretty obvious that it provided the information to an RNA molecule, and then how do you go from RNA to protein? For about three years we just \u2014 I tried to solve the structure of RNA. It didn't yield. It didn't give good x-ray photographs. I was decidedly unhappy; a girl didn't marry me. It was really, you know, sort of a shitty time. (Laughter)So there's a picture of Francis and I before I met the girl, so I'm still looking happy. (Laughter) But there is what we did when we didn't know where to go forward: we formed a club and called it the RNA Tie Club. George Gamow, also a great physicist, he designed the tie. He was one of the members. The question was: How do you go from a four-letter code to the 20-letter code of proteins? Feynman was a member, and Teller, and friends of Gamow. But that's the only \u2014 no, we were only photographed twice. And on both occasions, you know, one of us was missing the tie. There's Francis up on the upper right, and Alex Rich \u2014 the M.D.-turned-crystallographer \u2014 is next to me. This was taken in Cambridge in September of 1955. And I'm smiling, sort of forced, I think, because the girl I had, boy, she was gone. (Laughter)And so I didn't really get happy until 1960, because then we found out, basically, you know, that there are three forms of RNA. And we knew, basically, DNA provides the information for RNA. RNA provides the information for protein. And that let Marshall Nirenberg, you know, take RNA \u2014 synthetic RNA \u2014 put it in a system making protein. He made polyphenylalanine, polyphenylalanine. So that's the first cracking of the genetic code, and it was all over by 1966. So there, that's what Chris wanted me to do, it was \u2014 so what happened since then? Well, at that time \u2014 I should go back. When we found the structure of DNA, I gave my first talk at Cold Spring Harbor. The physicist, Leo Szilard, he looked at me and said, \"Are you going to patent this?\" And \u2014 but he knew patent law, and that we couldn't patent it, because you couldn't. No use for it. (Laughter)And so DNA didn't become a useful molecule, and the lawyers didn't enter into the equation until 1973, 20 years later, when Boyer and Cohen in San Francisco and Stanford came up with their method of recombinant DNA, and Stanford patented it and made a lot of money. At least they patented something which, you know, could do useful things. And then, they learned how to read the letters for the code. And, boom, we've, you know, had a biotech industry. And, but we were still a long ways from, you know, answering a question which sort of dominated my childhood, which is: How do you nature-nurture?And so I'll go on. I'm already out of time, but this is Michael Wigler, a very, very clever mathematician turned physicist. And he developed a technique which essentially will let us look at sample DNA and, eventually, a million spots along it. There's a chip there, a conventional one. Then there's one made by a photolithography by a company in Madison called NimbleGen, which is way ahead of Affymetrix. And we use their technique. And what you can do is sort of compare DNA of normal segs versus cancer. And you can see on the top that cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions. So the DNA is really badly mucked up, whereas if you have a chance of surviving, the DNA isn't so mucked up. So we think that this will eventually lead to what we call \"DNA biopsies.\" Before you get treated for cancer, you should really look at this technique, and get a feeling of the face of the enemy. It's not a \u2014 it's only a partial look, but it's a \u2014 I think it's going to be very, very useful.So, we started with breast cancer because there's lots of money for it, no government money. And now I have a sort of vested interest: I want to do it for prostate cancer. So, you know, you aren't treated if it's not dangerous. But Wigler, besides looking at cancer cells, looked at normal cells, and made a really sort of surprising observation. Which is, all of us have about 10 places in our genome where we've lost a gene or gained another one. So we're sort of all imperfect. And the question is well, if we're around here, you know, these little losses or gains might not be too bad. But if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene, maybe we'll feel sick.So the first disease he looked at is autism. And the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it. Looking at an individual is about 3,000 dollars. And the parent of a child with Asperger's disease, the high-intelligence autism, had sent his thing to a conventional company; they didn't do it. Couldn't do it by conventional genetics, but just scanning it we began to find genes for autism. And you can see here, there are a lot of them. So a lot of autistic kids are autistic because they just lost a big piece of DNA. I mean, big piece at the molecular level. We saw one autistic kid, about five million bases just missing from one of his chromosomes. We haven't yet looked at the parents, but the parents probably don't have that loss, or they wouldn't be parents. Now, so, our autism study is just beginning. We got three million dollars. I think it will cost at least 10 to 20 before you'd be in a position to help parents who've had an autistic child, or think they may have an autistic child, and can we spot the difference? So this same technique should probably look at all. It's a wonderful way to find genes.And so, I'll conclude by saying we've looked at 20 people with schizophrenia. And we thought we'd probably have to look at several hundred before we got the picture. But as you can see, there's seven out of 20 had a change which was very high. And yet, in the controls there were three. So what's the meaning of the controls? Were they crazy also, and we didn't know it? Or, you know, were they normal? I would guess they're normal. And what we think in schizophrenia is there are genes of predisposure, and whether this is one that predisposes \u2014 and then there's only a sub-segment of the population that's capable of being schizophrenic.Now, we don't have really any evidence of it, but I think, to give you a hypothesis, the best guess is that if you're left-handed, you're prone to schizophrenia. 30 percent of schizophrenic people are left-handed, and schizophrenia has a very funny genetics, which means 60 percent of the people are genetically left-handed, but only half of it showed. I don't have the time to say. Now, some people who think they're right-handed are genetically left-handed. OK. I'm just saying that, if you think, oh, I don't carry a left-handed gene so therefore my, you know, children won't be at risk of schizophrenia. You might. OK? (Laughter)So it's, to me, an extraordinarily exciting time. We ought to be able to find the gene for bipolar; there's a relationship. And if I had enough money, we'd find them all this year.

So I'll say something --\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\n-- I'll say a little about, you know, how the discovery was made,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nand why Francis and I found it.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nAnd then, I hope maybe I have at least five minutes to say\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nwhat makes me tick now.\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nIn back of me is a picture of me when I was 17.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nI was at the University of Chicago, in my third year,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nand I was in my third year because the University of Chicago\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nlet you in after two years of high school.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nSo you -- it was fun to get away from high school -- (Laughter) --\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nbecause I was very small, and I was no good in sports,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nor anything like that.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nBut I should say that my background -- my father was, you know,\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nraised to be an Episcopalian and Republican,\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nbut after one year of college, he became an atheist and a Democrat.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nAnd my mother was Irish Catholic,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nand -- but she didn't take religion too seriously.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nAnd by the age of 11, I was no longer going to Sunday Mass,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nand going on birdwatching walks with my father.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nSo early on, I heard of Charles Darwin.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nI guess, you know, he was the big hero.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nAnd, you know, you understand life as it now exists through evolution.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nAnd at the University of Chicago I was a zoology major,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nand thought I would end up, you know, if I was bright enough,\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nmaybe getting a Ph.D. from Cornell in ornithology.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nThen, in the Chicago paper, there was a review of a book\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:19.958\ncalled \"What is Life?\" by the great physicist, Schrodinger.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nAnd that, of course, had been a question I wanted to know.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nYou know, Darwin explained life after it got started,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nbut what was the essence of life?\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nAnd Schrodinger said the essence was information\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:35.958\npresent in our chromosomes, and it had to be present\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:41.958\non a molecule. I'd never really thought of molecules before.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nYou know chromosomes, but this was a molecule,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nand somehow all the information was probably present\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nin some digital form. And there was the big question\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nof, how did you copy the information?\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nSo that was the book. And so, from that moment on,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nI wanted to be a geneticist --\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nunderstand the gene and, through that, understand life.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nSo I had, you know, a hero at a distance.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nIt wasn't a baseball player; it was Linus Pauling.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nAnd so I applied to Caltech and they turned me down.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nSo I went to Indiana,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nwhich was actually as good as Caltech in genetics,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nand besides, they had a really good basketball team. (Laughter)\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nSo I had a really quite happy life at Indiana.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nAnd it was at Indiana I got the impression\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nthat, you know, the gene was likely to be DNA.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nAnd so when I got my Ph.D., I should go and search for DNA.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nSo I first went to Copenhagen because I thought, well,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nmaybe I could become a biochemist,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nbut I discovered biochemistry was very boring.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nIt wasn't going anywhere toward, you know, saying what the gene was;\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nit was just nuclear science. And oh, that's the book, little book.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nYou can read it in about two hours.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nAnd -- but then I went to a meeting in Italy.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nAnd there was an unexpected speaker who wasn't on the program,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nand he talked about DNA.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nAnd this was Maurice Wilkins. He was trained as a physicist,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nand after the war he wanted to do biophysics, and he picked DNA\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nbecause DNA had been determined at the Rockefeller Institute\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nto possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nMost people believed it was proteins.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nBut Wilkins, you know, thought DNA was the best bet,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand he showed this x-ray photograph.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nSort of crystalline. So DNA had a structure,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\neven though it owed it to probably different molecules\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\ncarrying different sets of instructions.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nSo there was something universal about the DNA molecule.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nSo I wanted to work with him, but he didn't want a former birdwatcher,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nand I ended up in Cambridge, England.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nSo I went to Cambridge,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nbecause it was really the best place in the world then\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nfor x-ray crystallography. And x-ray crystallography is now a subject\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nin, you know, chemistry departments.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nI mean, in those days it was the domain of the physicists.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nSo the best place for x-ray crystallography\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nwas at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nAnd there I met Francis Crick.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nI went there without knowing him. He was 35. I was 23.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nAnd within a day, we had decided that\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nmaybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of DNA.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nNot solve it like, you know, in rigorous fashion, but build a model,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nan electro-model, using some coordinates of, you know,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nlength, all that sort of stuff from x-ray photographs.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nBut just ask what the molecule -- how should it fold up?\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nAnd the reason for doing so, at the center of this photograph,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nis Linus Pauling. About six months before, he proposed\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nthe alpha helical structure for proteins. And in doing so,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nhe banished the man out on the right,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nSir Lawrence Bragg, who was the Cavendish professor.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nThis is a photograph several years later,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nwhen Bragg had cause to smile.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nHe certainly wasn't smiling when I got there,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nbecause he was somewhat humiliated by Pauling getting the alpha helix,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nand the Cambridge people failing because they weren't chemists.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nAnd certainly, neither Crick or I were chemists,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nso we tried to build a model. And he knew, Francis knew Wilkins.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nSo Wilkins said he thought it was the helix.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nX-ray diagram, he thought was comparable with the helix.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nSo we built a three-stranded model.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nThe people from London came up.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nWilkins and this collaborator, or possible collaborator,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nRosalind Franklin, came up and sort of laughed at our model.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nThey said it was lousy, and it was.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nSo we were told to build no more models; we were incompetent.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nAnd so we didn't build any models,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nand Francis sort of continued to work on proteins.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nAnd basically, I did nothing. And -- except read.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nYou know, basically, reading is a good thing; you get facts.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nAnd we kept telling the people in London\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nthat Linus Pauling's going to move on to DNA.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nIf DNA is that important, Linus will know it.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nHe'll build a model, and then we're going to be scooped.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd, in fact, he'd written the people in London:\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nCould he see their x-ray photograph?\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAnd they had the wisdom to say \"no.\" So he didn't have it.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nBut there was ones in the literature.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nActually, Linus didn't look at them that carefully.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nBut about, oh, 15 months after I got to Cambridge,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\na rumor began to appear from Linus Pauling's son,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nwho was in Cambridge, that his father was now working on DNA.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nAnd so, one day Peter came in and he said he was Peter Pauling,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nand he gave me a copy of his father's manuscripts.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nAnd boy, I was scared because I thought, you know, we may be scooped.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nI have nothing to do, no qualifications for anything.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nAnd so there was the paper, and he proposed a three-stranded structure.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nAnd I read it, and it was just -- it was crap.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nSo this was, you know, unexpected from the world's --\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\n-- and so, it was held together by hydrogen bonds\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nbetween phosphate groups.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nWell, if the peak pH that cells have is around seven,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nthose hydrogen bonds couldn't exist.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nWe rushed over to the chemistry department and said,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:40.958\n\"Could Pauling be right?\" And Alex Hust said, \"No.\" So we were happy.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nAnd, you know, we were still in the game, but we were frightened\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nthat somebody at Caltech would tell Linus that he was wrong.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nAnd so Bragg said, \"Build models.\"\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nAnd a month after we got the Pauling manuscript --\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nI should say I took the manuscript to London, and showed the people.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nWell, I said, Linus was wrong and that we're still in the game\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nand that they should immediately start building models.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nBut Wilkins said \"no.\" Rosalind Franklin was leaving in about two months,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nand after she left he would start building models.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nAnd so I came back with that news to Cambridge,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nand Bragg said, \"Build models.\"\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nWell, of course, I wanted to build models.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nAnd there's a picture of Rosalind. She really, you know,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nin one sense she was a chemist,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nbut really she would have been trained --\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nshe didn't know any organic chemistry or quantum chemistry.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nShe was a crystallographer.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nAnd I think part of the reason she didn't want to build models\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nwas, she wasn't a chemist, whereas Pauling was a chemist.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nAnd so Crick and I, you know, started building models,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nand I'd learned a little chemistry, but not enough.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nWell, we got the answer on the 28th February '53.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nAnd it was because of a rule, which, to me, is a very good rule:\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nNever be the brightest person in a room, and we weren't.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nWe weren't the best chemists in the room.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nI went in and showed them a pairing I'd done,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nand Jerry Donohue -- he was a chemist -- he said, it's wrong.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nYou've got -- the hydrogen atoms are in the wrong place.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nI just put them down like they were in the books.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nHe said they were wrong.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nSo the next day, you know, after I thought, \"Well, he might be right.\"\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nSo I changed the locations, and then we found the base pairing,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nand Francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nAnd we knew we were right.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nSo it was a pretty, you know, it all happened in about two hours.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nFrom nothing to thing.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nAnd we knew it was big because, you know, if you just put A next to T\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nand G next to C, you have a copying mechanism.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nSo we saw how genetic information is carried.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nIt's the order of the four bases.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nSo in a sense, it is a sort of digital-type information.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nAnd you copy it by going from strand-separating.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nSo, you know, if it didn't work this way, you might as well believe it,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nbecause you didn't have any other scheme.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nBut that's not the way most scientists think.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nMost scientists are really rather dull.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nThey said, we won't think about it until we know it's right.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nBut, you know, we thought, well, it's at least 95 percent right or 99 percent right.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nSo think about it. The next five years,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nthere were essentially something like five references\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nto our work in \"Nature\" -- none.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nAnd so we were left by ourselves,\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nand trying to do the last part of the trio: how do you --\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nwhat does this genetic information do?\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nIt was pretty obvious that it provided the information\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nto an RNA molecule, and then how do you go from RNA to protein?\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nFor about three years we just -- I tried to solve the structure of RNA.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nIt didn't yield. It didn't give good x-ray photographs.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nI was decidedly unhappy; a girl didn't marry me.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nIt was really, you know, sort of a shitty time.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nSo there's a picture of Francis and I before I met the girl,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nso I'm still looking happy.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nBut there is what we did when we didn't know\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nwhere to go forward: we formed a club and called it the RNA Tie Club.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nGeorge Gamow, also a great physicist, he designed the tie.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nHe was one of the members. The question was:\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nHow do you go from a four-letter code\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nto the 20-letter code of proteins?\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nFeynman was a member, and Teller, and friends of Gamow.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nBut that's the only -- no, we were only photographed twice.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nAnd on both occasions, you know, one of us was missing the tie.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nThere's Francis up on the upper right,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nand Alex Rich -- the M.D.-turned-crystallographer -- is next to me.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nThis was taken in Cambridge in September of 1955.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nAnd I'm smiling, sort of forced, I think,\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nbecause the girl I had, boy, she was gone.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nAnd so I didn't really get happy until 1960,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nbecause then we found out, basically, you know,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nthat there are three forms of RNA.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nAnd we knew, basically, DNA provides the information for RNA.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nRNA provides the information for protein.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nAnd that let Marshall Nirenberg, you know, take RNA -- synthetic RNA --\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nput it in a system making protein. He made polyphenylalanine,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:56.958\npolyphenylalanine. So that's the first cracking of the genetic code,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nand it was all over by 1966.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nSo there, that's what Chris wanted me to do, it was --\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nso what happened since then?\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nWell, at that time -- I should go back.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nWhen we found the structure of DNA, I gave my first talk\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nat Cold Spring Harbor. The physicist, Leo Szilard,\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nhe looked at me and said, \"Are you going to patent this?\"\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nAnd -- but he knew patent law, and that we couldn't patent it,\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nbecause you couldn't. No use for it.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nAnd so DNA didn't become a useful molecule,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nand the lawyers didn't enter into the equation until 1973,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:42.958\n20 years later, when Boyer and Cohen in San Francisco\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nand Stanford came up with their method of recombinant DNA,\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nand Stanford patented it and made a lot of money.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nAt least they patented something\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nwhich, you know, could do useful things.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nAnd then, they learned how to read the letters for the code.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nAnd, boom, we've, you know, had a biotech industry. And,\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nbut we were still a long ways from, you know,\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nanswering a question which sort of dominated my childhood,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nwhich is: How do you nature-nurture?\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nAnd so I'll go on. I'm already out of time,\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nbut this is Michael Wigler, a very, very clever mathematician\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nturned physicist. And he developed a technique\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nwhich essentially will let us look at sample DNA\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nand, eventually, a million spots along it.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nThere's a chip there, a conventional one. Then there's one\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nmade by a photolithography by a company in Madison\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:40.958\ncalled NimbleGen, which is way ahead of Affymetrix.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nAnd we use their technique.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nAnd what you can do is sort of compare DNA of normal segs versus cancer.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nAnd you can see on the top\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nthat cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nSo the DNA is really badly mucked up,\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nwhereas if you have a chance of surviving,\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nthe DNA isn't so mucked up.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nSo we think that this will eventually lead to what we call\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:10.958\n\"DNA biopsies.\" Before you get treated for cancer,\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nyou should really look at this technique,\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nand get a feeling of the face of the enemy.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nIt's not a -- it's only a partial look, but it's a --\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nI think it's going to be very, very useful.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nSo, we started with breast cancer\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nbecause there's lots of money for it, no government money.\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nAnd now I have a sort of vested interest:\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nI want to do it for prostate cancer. So, you know,\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nyou aren't treated if it's not dangerous.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nBut Wigler, besides looking at cancer cells, looked at normal cells,\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nand made a really sort of surprising observation.\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nWhich is, all of us have about 10 places in our genome\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nwhere we've lost a gene or gained another one.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nSo we're sort of all imperfect. And the question is well,\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nif we're around here, you know,\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nthese little losses or gains might not be too bad.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nBut if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene,\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nmaybe we'll feel sick.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nSo the first disease he looked at is autism.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nAnd the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it.\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nLooking at an individual is about 3,000 dollars. And the parent of a child\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nwith Asperger's disease, the high-intelligence autism,\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nhad sent his thing to a conventional company; they didn't do it.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nCouldn't do it by conventional genetics, but just scanning it\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nwe began to find genes for autism.\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nAnd you can see here, there are a lot of them.\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nSo a lot of autistic kids are autistic\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nbecause they just lost a big piece of DNA.\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nI mean, big piece at the molecular level.\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nWe saw one autistic kid,\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nabout five million bases just missing from one of his chromosomes.\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nWe haven't yet looked at the parents, but the parents probably\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:58.958\ndon't have that loss, or they wouldn't be parents.\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nNow, so, our autism study is just beginning. We got three million dollars.\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nI think it will cost at least 10 to 20 before you'd be in a position\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:12.958\nto help parents who've had an autistic child,\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nor think they may have an autistic child,\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nand can we spot the difference?\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nSo this same technique should probably look at all.\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:23.958\nIt's a wonderful way to find genes.\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:25.958\nAnd so, I'll conclude by saying\n\n00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nwe've looked at 20 people with schizophrenia.\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:31.958\nAnd we thought we'd probably have to look at several hundred\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nbefore we got the picture. But as you can see,\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nthere's seven out of 20 had a change which was very high.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nAnd yet, in the controls there were three.\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nSo what's the meaning of the controls?\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:44.958\nWere they crazy also, and we didn't know it?\n\n00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:48.958\nOr, you know, were they normal? I would guess they're normal.\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nAnd what we think in schizophrenia is there are genes of predisposure,\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nand whether this is one that predisposes --\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nand then there's only a sub-segment of the population\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nthat's capable of being schizophrenic.\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nNow, we don't have really any evidence of it,\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:16.958\nbut I think, to give you a hypothesis, the best guess\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:22.958\nis that if you're left-handed, you're prone to schizophrenia.\n\n00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:25.958\n30 percent of schizophrenic people are left-handed,\n\n00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nand schizophrenia has a very funny genetics,\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nwhich means 60 percent of the people are genetically left-handed,\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:35.958\nbut only half of it showed. I don't have the time to say.\n\n00:19:35.958 --> 00:19:38.958\nNow, some people who think they're right-handed\n\n00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:44.958\nare genetically left-handed. OK. I'm just saying that, if you think,\n\n00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:48.958\noh, I don't carry a left-handed gene so therefore my, you know,\n\n00:19:48.958 --> 00:19:51.958\nchildren won't be at risk of schizophrenia. You might. OK?\n\n00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:57.958\nSo it's, to me, an extraordinarily exciting time.\n\n00:19:57.958 --> 00:19:59.958\nWe ought to be able to find the gene for bipolar;\n\n00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:00.958\nthere's a relationship.\n\n00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:04.958\nAnd if I had enough money, we'd find them all this year.\n\n00:20:04.958 --> 00:20:05.958\nI thank you."}, {"title": "Visual illusions that show how we (mis)think", "duration": "873", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/al_seckel_says_our_brains_are_mis_wired", "transcript": "We're going to talk \u2014 my \u2014 a new lecture, just for TED \u2014 and I'm going show you some illusions that we've created for TED, and I'm going to try to relate this to happiness. What I was thinking about with happiness is, what gives happiness \u2014 or happiness, which I equate with joy in my particular area, and I think there's something very fundamental. And I was thinking about this. And it's in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that there's something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing way. You go see a movie. And it has an unexpected twist \u2014 something that you didn't expect \u2014 and you find a joyful experience. You look at those sort of illusions in my book and it's not as what you'd expect. And there's something joyful about it. And it's the same thing with jokes and all these sorts of things. So, what I'm going to try and do in my lecture is go a little bit further and see if I can violate your expectations in a pleasing way. I mean, sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant, but I'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way, in a very primal way, so I can make the audience here happy.So I'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations. First of all, I want to show you the particular illusion here. I want you first of all when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other. These are all perceptual tricks. These are real objects that I'm going to show you. Now I'm going to show you how it is done. I've looped the film here so you can get a very interesting experience. I want you to see how this illusion is constructed, and it's going to rotate so you see that it's inside out. Now watch, as it rotates back, how quickly your perception snaps. OK now. Watch it as it rotates back again. And this is a very bright audience, all right? See if you can stop it from happening, even though you know 100 percent it's true that \u2014 bam! You can't undo it. What does that tell you about yourselves? We're going to do it again. No doubt about it. See if you can stop it from happening. No. It's difficult.And we can violate your expectations in a whole variety of ways about representation, about shape, about color and so forth and it's very primal. And it's an interesting question to ponder, why these things \u2014 we find these things joyful. Why would we find them joyful? So, here's something that Lionel did a while ago. I like these sort of little things like this.Again, this is not an optical trick. This is what you would see. In other words, it's not a camera cut. It's a perceptual trick. OK. We can violate your expectations about shape. We can violate your expectations on representation \u2014 what an image represents. What do you see here? How many of you here see dolphins? Raise your hand if you see dolphins. OK, those people who raised their hands, afterwards, the rest of the audience, go talk to them, all right? Actually, this is the best example of priming by experience that I know. If you are a child under the age of 10 who haven't been ruined yet, you will look at this image and see dolphins. Now, some of you adults here are saying, \"What dolphins? What dolphins?\" But in fact, if you reversed the figure ground \u2014 in other words, the dark areas here \u2014 I forgot to ask for a pointer \u2014 but if you reverse it, you'll see a whole series of little dolphins. By the way, if you're also a student at CalTech \u2014 they also tend to just see the dolphins. It's based on experience.Now, something like this can be used because this is after all talk about design, too. This was done by Saatchi and Saatchi, and they actually got away with this ad in Australia. So, if you look at this ad for beer, all those people are in sort of provocative positions. But they got it passed, and actually won the Clio awards, so it's funny how you can do these things. Remember that sort of, um. This is the joke I did when the Florida ballot was going around. You know, count the dots for Gore; count the dots for Bush; count 'em again ...You can violate your expectations about experience. Here is an outside water fountain that I created with some friends of mine, but you can stop the water in drops and \u2014 actually make all the drops levitate. This is something we're building for, you know, amusement parks and that kind of stuff. Now let's take a static image. Can you see this? Do you see the middle section moving down and the outer sections moving up? It's completely static. It's a static image. How many people see this illusion? It's completely static. Right. Now, when \u2014 it's interesting that when we look at an image we see, you know, color, depth, texture. And you can look at this whole scene and analyze it. You can see the woman is in closer than the wall and so forth. But the whole thing is actually flat. It's painted. It's trompe l'oeil. And it was such a good trompe l'oeil that people got irritated when they tried to talk to the woman and she wouldn't respond.Now, you can make design mistakes. Like this building in New York. So that when you see it from this side, it looks like the balconies tilt up, and when you walk around to the other side it looks like the balconies go down. So there are cases where you have mistakes in design that incorporate illusions. Or, you take this particular un-retouched photograph. Now, interestingly enough, I get a lot of emails from people who say, \"Is there any perceptual difference between males and females?\" And I really say, \"No.\" I mean, women can navigate through the world just as well as males can \u2014 and why wouldn't they? However, this is the one illusion that women can consistently do better than males: in matching which head because they rely on fashion cues. They can match the hat.Okay, now getting to a part \u2014 I want to show design in illusions. I believe that the first example of illusions being used purposely was by da Vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye. So that when you saw from one little angle was like this. And this little technique got popular in the 16th century and the 17th century to disguise hidden meanings, where you could flip the image and see it from one little point of view like this. But these are early incorporations of illusions brought to \u2014 sort of high point with Hans Holbein's \"Ambassadors.\" And Hans Holbein worked for Henry VIII. This was hung on a wall where you could walk down from the stair and you can see this hidden skull.All right, now I'm going to show you some designers who work with illusions to give that element of surprise. One of my favorites is Scott Kim. I worked with Scott to create some illusions for TED that I hope you will enjoy. We have one here on TED and happiness. OK now. Arthur [Ganson] hasn't talked yet, but his is going to be a delightful talk and he has some of his really fantastic machines outside. And so, we \u2014 Scott created this wonderful tribute to Arthur Ganson.Well, there's analog and digital. Thought that was appropriate here. And figure goes to ground. And for the musicians. And of course, since happiness \u2014 we want \"joy to the world.\" Now, another great designer \u2014 he's very well known in Japan \u2014 Shigeo Fukuda. And he just builds some fantastic things. This is simply amazing. This is a pile of junk that when you view it from one particular angle, you see its reflection in the mirror as a perfect piano. Pianist transforms to violinist. This is really wild. This assemblage of forks, knives and spoons and various cutlery, welded together. It gives a shadow of a motorcycle. You learn something in the sort of thing that I do, which is there are people out there with a lot of time on their hands.Ken Knowlton does wonderful composite images, like creating Jacques Cousteau out of seashells \u2014 un-retouched seashells, but just by rearranging them. He did Einstein out of dice because, after all, Einstein said, \"God does not play dice with the universe.\" Bert Herzog out of un-retouched keyboards. Will Shortz, crossword puzzle. John Cederquist does these wonderful trompe l'oeil cabinets.Now, I'm going to skip ahead since I'm sort of running [behind]. I want to show you quickly what I've created, some new type of illusions. I've done something with taking the Pixar-type illusions. So you see these kids the same size here, running down the hall. The two table tops of the same size. They're looking out two directions at once. You have a larger piece fitting in with a smaller. And that's something for you to think about, all right? So you see larger pieces fitting in within smaller pieces here. Does everyone see that? Which is impossible. You can see the two kids are looking out simultaneously out of two different directions at once. Now can you believe these two table tops are the same size and shape? They are. So, if you measured them, they would be. And as I say, those two figures are identical in size and shape. And it's interesting, by doing this in this sort of rendered fashion, how much stronger the illusions are. Any case, I hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness, and if you're interested in seeing more cool effects, see me outside. I'd be happy to show you lots of things.", "id": 78, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:12.958\nWe're going to talk -- my -- a new lecture, just\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nfor TED -- and I'm going show you some illusions\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nthat we've created for TED, and I'm going to try\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nto relate this to happiness.

I mean, sometimes expectations that\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nare violated are not pleasant, but I'm going to try\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nto do it in a pleasant way, in a very primal way,\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nso I can make the audience here happy.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nSo I'm going to show you some ways that we can\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nviolate your expectations. First of all, I want to\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nshow you the particular illusion here. I want you\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nfirst of all when it pops up on the screen to\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nnotice that the two holes are perpendicular to\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:41.958\neach other.

No. It's difficult.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nAnd we can violate your expectations in a whole\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nvariety of ways about representation, about shape,\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nabout color and so forth and it's very primal. And\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nit's an interesting question to ponder, why these\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nthings -- we find these things joyful. Why would\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nwe find them joyful? So, here's something that\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nLionel did a while ago. I like these sort of\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nlittle things like this.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nAgain, this is not an optical trick. This is what\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nyou would see. In other words, it's not a camera\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\ncut. It's a perceptual trick.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nOK. We can violate your expectations about\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nshape.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nWe can violate your expectations on representation\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\n-- what an image represents. What do you see here?\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nHow many of you here see dolphins? Raise your hand\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nif you see dolphins. OK, those people who raised\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\ntheir hands, afterwards, the rest of the audience,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:28.958\ngo talk to them, all right? Actually, this is the\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nbest example of priming by experience that I know.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nIf you are a child under the age of 10 who\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nhaven't been ruined yet, you will look at this\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nimage and see dolphins. Now, some of you adults\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nhere are saying, \"What dolphins? What dolphins?\"\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nBut in fact, if you reversed the figure ground --\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nin other words, the dark areas here -- I forgot to\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nask for a pointer -- but if you reverse it, you'll\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nsee a whole series of little dolphins. By the way,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nif you're also a student at CalTech -- they also\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\ntend to just see the dolphins. It's based on\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nexperience.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nNow, something like this can be used because this\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nis after all talk about design, too. This was\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\ndone by Saatchi and Saatchi, and they actually got\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\naway with this ad in Australia. So, if you look at\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nthis ad for beer, all those people are in sort of\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nprovocative positions. But they got it passed, and\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nactually won the Clio awards, so it's funny how you can do\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nthese things.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nRemember that sort of, um. This is the joke I did\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nwhen the Florida ballot was going around. You\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nknow, count the dots for Gore; count the dots for\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nBush; count 'em again ...\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nYou can violate your expectations about\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nexperience. Here is an outside water fountain that\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nI created with some friends of mine, but you can\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nstop the water in drops and -- actually make all\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nthe drops levitate. This is something we're\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nbuilding for, you know, amusement parks and that\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nkind of stuff.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nNow let's take a static image. Can you see this?\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nDo you see the middle section moving down and the\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nouter sections moving up? It's completely static.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nIt's a static image. How many people see this\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nillusion? It's completely static.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nRight. Now, when -- it's interesting that when we\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nlook at an image we see, you know, color, depth,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\ntexture. And you can look at this whole scene and\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nanalyze it. You can see the woman is in closer than\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nthe wall and so forth. But the whole thing is\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nactually flat. It's painted. It's trompe l'oeil.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nAnd it was such a good trompe l'oeil that people\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\ngot irritated when they tried to talk to the\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nwoman and she wouldn't respond.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nNow, you can make design mistakes. Like this\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nbuilding in New York. So that when you see it from\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nthis side, it looks like the balconies tilt up,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nand when you walk around to the other side it\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nlooks like the balconies go down. So there are\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\ncases where you have mistakes in design that\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nincorporate illusions.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nOr, you take this particular un-retouched\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nphotograph. Now, interestingly enough, I get a lot\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nof emails from people who say, \"Is there any\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nperceptual difference between males and females?\"\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nAnd I really say, \"No.\" I mean, women can navigate\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nthrough the world just as well as males can -- and\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nwhy wouldn't they? However, this is the one\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nillusion that women can consistently do better\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nthan males: in matching which head because they\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nrely on fashion cues. They can match the hat.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nOkay, now getting to a part -- I want to show\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\ndesign in illusions. I believe that the first\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nexample of illusions being used purposely was by\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nda Vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye. So\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nthat when you saw from one little angle was like\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nthis. And this little technique got popular in the\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\n16th century and the 17th century to disguise\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nhidden meanings, where you could flip the image and\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nsee it from one little point of view like this.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nBut these are early incorporations of illusions\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nbrought to -- sort of high point with Hans\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nHolbein's \"Ambassadors.\" And Hans Holbein worked\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nfor Henry VIII. This was hung on a wall where you\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\ncould walk down from the stair and you can see\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nthis hidden skull.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nAll right, now I'm going to show you some\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\ndesigners who work with illusions to give that\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nelement of surprise. One of my favorites is Scott\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nKim. I worked with Scott to create some illusions\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nfor TED that I hope you will enjoy. We have one\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nhere on TED and happiness.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nOK now. Arthur [Ganson] hasn't talked yet, but his is\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\ngoing to be a delightful talk and he has some of\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nhis really fantastic machines outside. And so, we\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\n-- Scott created this wonderful tribute to Arthur\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nGanson.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nWell, there's analog and digital. Thought that\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nwas appropriate here.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nAnd figure goes to ground.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nAnd for the musicians.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nAnd of course, since happiness -- we want \"joy to the\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nworld.\"\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nNow, another great designer -- he's very well\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nknown in Japan -- Shigeo Fukuda. And he just\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nbuilds some fantastic things. This is simply\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:13.958\namazing. This is a pile of junk that when you view\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nit from one particular angle, you see its\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nreflection in the mirror as a perfect piano.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nPianist transforms to violinist.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nThis is really wild. This assemblage of forks,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nknives and spoons and various cutlery, welded\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:14.958\ntogether. It gives a shadow of a motorcycle. You learn\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nsomething in the sort of thing that I do, which\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nis there are people out there with a lot of time\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:21.958\non their hands.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nKen Knowlton does wonderful composite images, like\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\ncreating Jacques Cousteau out of seashells --\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nun-retouched seashells, but just by rearranging\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nthem. He did Einstein out of dice because, after\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nall, Einstein said, \"God does not play dice with\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nthe universe.\" Bert Herzog out of un-retouched\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nkeyboards. Will Shortz, crossword puzzle. John\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nCederquist does these wonderful trompe l'oeil\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:57.958\ncabinets.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nNow, I'm going to skip ahead since I'm sort of running\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\n[behind]. I want to show you quickly what I've\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:08.958\ncreated, some new type of illusions. I've done\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nsomething with taking the Pixar-type illusions. So\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nyou see these kids the same size here, running\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\ndown the hall. The two table tops of the same size.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nThey're looking out two directions at once. You\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nhave a larger piece fitting in with a smaller. And\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nthat's something for you to think about, all\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nright? So you see larger pieces fitting in within\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nsmaller pieces here. Does everyone see that? Which\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nis impossible. You can see the two kids are\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nlooking out simultaneously out of two different\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:51.958\ndirections at once. Now can you believe these two\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:56.958\ntable tops are the same size and shape? They are.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nSo, if you measured them, they would be. And as I say,\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nthose two figures are identical in size and shape.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nAnd it's interesting, by doing this in this sort\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nof rendered fashion, how much stronger the\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nillusions are. Any case, I hope this has brought\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nyou a little joy and happiness, and if you're\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\ninterested in seeing more cool effects, see me\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\noutside. I'd be happy to show you lots of things."}, {"title": "To invent is to give", "duration": "1207", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/dean_kamen_on_inventing_and_giving", "transcript": "As you pointed out, every time you come here, you learn something. This morning, the world's experts from I guess three or four different companies on building seats, I think concluded that ultimately, the solution is, people shouldn't sit down. I could have told them that. (Laughter) Yesterday, the automotive guys gave us some new insights. They pointed out that, I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today, they will be steering cars by wire, without all that mechanical stuff. (Laughter) That's reassuring. (Applause) They then pointed out that there'd be, sort of, the other controls by wire, to get rid of all that mechanical stuff. That's pretty good, but why not get rid of the wires? Then you don't need anything to control the car, except thinking about it. I would love to talk about the technology, and sometime, in what's past the 15 minutes, I'll be happy to talk to all the techno-geeks around here about what's in here. But if I had one thing to say about this, before we get to first, it would be that from the time we started building this, the big idea wasn't the technology. It really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the iBOT for the disabled community. The big idea here is, I think, a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation. And maybe to put that in perspective: there's so much data on this, I'll be happy to give it to you in different forms. You never know what strikes the fancy of whom, but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world. And Henry Ford, just about 100 years ago, started cranking out Model Ts. What I don't think most people think about is the context of how technology is applied. For instance, in that time, 91 percent of America lived either on farms or in small towns. So, the car \u2014 the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage \u2014 was a big deal; it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage. It was half as long. And it was an environmental improvement, because, for instance, in 1903 they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan, because you can imagine what the roads look like when you have a million horses, and a million of them urinating and doing other things, and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable. So the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy. It also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm, or their farm to a town, or from a town to a city. It all made sense, with 91 percent of the people living there. By the 1950s, we started connecting all the towns together with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world, the highway system. And it is certainly a wonder. And by the way, as I take shots at old technologies, I want to assure everybody, and particularly the automotive industry \u2014 who's been very supportive of us \u2014 that I don't think this in any way competes with airplanes, or cars. But think about where the world is today. 50 percent of the global population now lives in cities. That's 3.2 billion people. We've solved all the transportation problems that have changed the world to get it to where we are today. 500 years ago, sailing ships started getting reliable enough; we found a new continent. 150 years ago, locomotives got efficient enough, steam power, that we turned the continent into a country. Over the last hundred years, we started building cars, and then over the 50 years we've connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way, and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that. But during that entire process, more and more people have been born, and more and more people are moving to cities. China alone is going to move four to six hundred million people into cities in the next decade and a half. And so, nobody, I think, would argue that airplanes, in the last 50 years, have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood. And if you just look at how technology has been applied, we've solved all the long-range, high-speed, high-volume, large-weight problems of moving things around. Nobody would want to give them up. And I certainly wouldn't want to give up my airplane, or my helicopter, or my Humvee, or my Porsche. I love them all. I don't keep any of them in my living room. The fact is, the last mile is the problem, and half the world now lives in dense cities. And people spend, depending on who they are, between 90 and 95 percent of their energy getting around on foot. I think there's \u2014 I don't know what data would impress you, but how about, 43 percent of the refined fuel produced in the world is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the United States. Three million people die every year in cities due to bad air, and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced by transportation devices, particularly sitting in cities. And again, I say that not to attack any industry, I think \u2014 I really do \u2014 I love my airplane, and cars on highways moving 60 miles an hour are extraordinarily efficient, both from an engineering point of view, an energy consumption point of view, and a utility point of view. And we all love our cars, and I do. The problem is, you get into the city and you want to go four blocks, it's neither fun nor efficient nor productive. It's not sustainable. If \u2014 in China, in the year 1998, 417 million people used bicycles; 1.7 million people used cars. If five percent of that population became, quote, middle class, and wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years at the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of Manhattan, every six weeks \u2014 it isn't sustainable environmentally; it isn't sustainable economically \u2014 there just ain't enough oil \u2014 and it's not sustainable politically. I mean, what are we fighting over right now? We can make it complicated, but what's the world fighting over right now? So it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile, and it was dumb luck. We were working on iBOTs, but once we made this, we instantly decided it could be a great alternative to jet skis. You don't need the water. Or snowmobiles. You don't need the snow. Or skiing. It's just fun, and people love to move around doing fun things. And every one of those industries, by the way \u2014 just golf carts alone is a multi-billion-dollar industry. But rather than go license this off, which is what we normally do, it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology, but into an understanding of a world that's solved all its other problems, but has somehow come to accept that cities \u2014 which, right back from ancient Greece on, were meant to walk around, cities that were architected and built for people \u2014 now have a footprint that, while we've solved every other transportation problem \u2014 and it's like Moore's law. I mean, look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon, then on a railroad, then an airplane. Every other form of transportation's been improved. In 5,000 years, we've gone backwards in getting around cities. They've gotten bigger; they're spread out. The most expensive real estate on this planet in every city \u2014 Wilshire Boulevard, or Fifth Avenue, or Tokyo, or Paris \u2014 the most expensive real estate is their downtowns. 65 percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars. The 20 largest cities in the world. So you wonder, what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities? What if you could make them fun, attractive, clean, environmentally friendly? What if it would make it a little bit more palatable to have access via this, as that last link to mass transit, to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want, and then have our cities energized again? We thought it would be really neat to do that, and one of the problems we really were worried about is: how do we get legal on the sidewalk? Because technically I've got motors; I've got wheels \u2014 I'm a motor vehicle. I don't look like a motor vehicle. I have the same footprint as a pedestrian; I have the same unique capability to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space. I took this down to Ground Zero, and knocked my way through crowds for an hour. I'm a pedestrian. But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two, and if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk, we have two choices. We're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter, and I don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff. Or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle. We've been so concerned about that, we went to the Postmaster General of the United States, as the first person we ever showed on the outside, and said, \"Put your people on it. Everybody trusts their postman. And they belong on the sidewalks, and they'll use it seriously.\" He agreed. We went to a number of police departments that want their police officers back in the neighborhood on the beat, carrying 70 pounds of stuff. They love it. And I can't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket. (Laughter) So we've been working really, really hard, but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an attitude about what's important, and how to apply the technology. We went out and we found some visionary people with enough money to let us design and build these things, and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted. So, I'm happy, really, I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want. And yes, it's really fun, and yes, you should all go out and try it. But if I could ask you to do one thing, it's not to think about it as a piece of technology, but just imagine that, although we all understand somehow that it's reasonable that we use our 4,000-pound machine, which can go 60 miles an hour, that can bring you everywhere you want to go, and somehow it's also what we used for the last mile, and it's broken, and it doesn't work. One of the more exciting things that occurred to us about why it might get accepted, happened out here in California. A few weeks ago, after we launched it, we were here with a news crew on Venice Beach, zipping up and back, and he's marveling at the technology, and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by, and skateboarders are zipping by, and a little old lady \u2014 I mean, if you looked in the dictionary, a little old lady \u2014 came by me \u2014 and now that I'm on this, I'm the height of a normal adult now \u2014 and she just stops, and the camera is there, and she looks up at me and says, \"Can I try that?\" And what was I \u2014 you know, how are you going to say anything? And so I said, \"Sure.\" So I get off, and she gets on, and with a little bit of the usual, ah, then she turns around, and she goes about 20 feet, and she turns back around, and she's all smiles. And she comes back to me and she stops, and she says, \"Finally, they made something for us.\" And the camera is looking down at her. I'm thinking, \"Wow, that was great \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 please lady, don't say another word.\" (Laughter) And the camera is down at her, and this guy has to put the microphone in her face, said, \"What do you mean by that?\" And I figured, \"It's all over now,\" and she looks up and she says, \"Well,\" she's still watching these guys go; she says, \"I can't ride a bike,\" no, she says, \"I can't use a skateboard, and I've never used roller blades,\" she knew them by name; she says, \"And it's been 50 years since I rode a bicycle.\" Then she looks up, she's looking up, and she says, \"And I'm 81 years old, and I don't drive a car anymore. I still have to get to the store, and I can't carry a lot of things.\" And it suddenly occurred to me, that among my many fears, were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators and the legislators might not get it \u2014 it was that, fundamentally, you believe there's pressure among the people not to invade the most precious little bit of space left, the sidewalks in these cities. When you look at the 36 inches of legal requirement for sidewalk, then the eight foot for the parked car, then the three lanes, and then the other eight feet \u2014 it's \u2014 that little piece is all that's there. But she looks up and says this, and it occurs to me, well, kids aren't going to mind these things, and they don't vote, and business people and then young adults aren't going to mind these things \u2014 they're pretty cool \u2014 so I guess subliminally I was worried that it's the older population that's going to worry. So, having seen this, and having worried about it for eight years, the first thing I do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys, call AARP, get an appointment right away. We've got to show them this thing. And they took it to Washington; they showed them; and they're going to be involved now, watching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities, like Atlanta, where we're doing trials to see if it really can, in fact, help re-energize their downtown. (Applause) The bottom line is, whether you believe the United Nations, or any of the other think tanks \u2014 in the next 20 years, all human population growth on this planet will be in cities. In Asia alone, it will be over a billion people. They learned to start with cell phones. They didn't have to take the 100-year trip we took. They start at the top of the technology food chain. We've got to start building cities and human environments where a 150-pound person can go a couple of miles in a dense, rich, green-space environment, without being in a 4,000-pound machine to do it. Cars were not meant for parallel parking; they're wonderful machines to go between cities, but just think about it: we've solved all the long-range, high-speed problems. The Greeks went from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in their sandals. You do it in your sneakers. Not much has changed. If this thing goes only three times as fast as walking \u2014 three times \u2014 a 30-minute walk becomes 10 minutes. Your choice, when living in a city, if it's now 10 minutes \u2014 because at 30 minutes you want an alternative, whether it's a bus, a train \u2014 we've got to build an infrastructure \u2014 a light rail \u2014 or you're going to keep parking those cars. But if you could put a pin in most cities, and imagine how far you could, if you had the time, walk in one half-hour, it's the city. If you could make it fun, and make it eight or 10 minutes, you can't find your car, un-park your car, move your car, re-park your car and go somewhere; you can't get to a cab or a subway. We could change the way people allocate their resources, the way this planet uses its energy, make it more fun. And we're hoping to some extent history will say we were right. That's Segway. This is a Stirling cycle engine; this had been confused by a lot of things we're doing. This little beast, right now, is producing a few hundred watts of electricity. Yes, it could be attached to this, and yes, on a kilogram of propane, you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose. Perhaps more interesting about this little engine is it'll burn any fuel, because some of you might be skeptical about the capability of this to have an impact, where most of the world you can't simply plug into your 120-volt outlet. We've been working on this, actually, as an alternative energy source, starting way back with Johnson & Johnson, to run an iBOT, because the best batteries you could get \u2014 10 watt-hours per kilogram in lead, 20 watt-hours per kilogram nickel-cadmium, 40 watt-hours per kilogram in nickel-metal hydride, 60 watt-hours per kilogram in lithium, 8,750 watt-hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline \u2014 which is why nobody drives electric cars. But, in any event, if you can burn it with the same efficiency \u2014 because it's external combustion \u2014 as your kitchen stove, if you can burn any fuel, it turns out to be pretty neat. It makes just enough electricity to, for instance, do this, which at night is enough electricity, in the rest of the world, as Mr. Holly \u2014 Dr. Holly \u2014 pointed out, can run computers and a light bulb. But more interestingly, the thermodynamics of this say, you're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency. It doesn't matter much \u2014 it says if you get 200 watts of electricity, you'll get 700 or 800 watts of heat. If you wanted to boil water and re-condense it at a rate of 10 gallons an hour, it takes about 25, a little over 25.3 kilowatt \u2014 25,000 watts of continuous power \u2014 to do it. That's so much energy, you couldn't afford to desalinate or clean water in this country that way. Certainly, in the rest of the world, your choice is to devastate the place, turning everything that will burn into heat, or drink the water that's available. The number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water. Depending on whose numbers you believe, it's between 60 and 85,000 people per day. We don't need sophisticated heart transplants around the world. We need water. And women shouldn't have to spend four hours a day looking for it, or watching their kids die. We figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing, with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat, then using a little bit of the electricity control that process, and for 450 watts, which is a little more than half of its waste heat, it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it. So if we put this box on here in a few years, could we have a solution to transportation, electricity, and communication, and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds? I don't know, but we'll try it. I better shut up.

something.\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nThis morning, the world's experts\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nfrom I guess three or four different companies on building seats,\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nI think concluded that ultimately, the solution is, people shouldn't sit down.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nI could have told them that.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nYesterday, the automotive guys gave us some new insights.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nThey pointed out that, I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today,\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nthey will be steering cars by wire,\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nwithout all that mechanical stuff.\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nThat's reassuring.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:55.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nThey then pointed out that there'd be, sort of, the other controls by wire,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nto get rid of all that mechanical stuff.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nThat's pretty good, but why not get rid of the wires?\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nThen you don't need anything to control the car, except thinking about it.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nI would love to talk about the technology,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nand sometime, in what's past the 15 minutes,\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nI'll be happy to talk to all the techno-geeks around here\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nabout what's in here.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nBut if I had one thing to say about this, before we get to first,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nit would be that from the time we started building this,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nthe big idea wasn't the technology.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nIt really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nin the iBOT for the disabled community.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nThe big idea here is, I think, a new piece of a solution\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nto a fairly big problem in transportation.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nAnd maybe to put that in perspective: there's so much data on this,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nI'll be happy to give it to you in different forms.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nYou never know what strikes the fancy of whom,\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nbut everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nAnd Henry Ford, just about 100 years ago, started cranking out Model Ts.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nWhat I don't think most people think about\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nis the context of how technology is applied.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nFor instance, in that time, 91 percent of America\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nlived either on farms or in small towns.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nSo, the car --\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nthe horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal;\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nit went twice as fast as a horse and carriage.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nIt was half as long.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nAnd it was an environmental improvement, because, for instance,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nin 1903 they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nbecause you can imagine what the roads look like\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nwhen you have a million horses,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nand a million of them urinating and doing other things,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nand the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nSo the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nIt also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nor their farm to a town, or from a town to a city.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nIt all made sense, with 91 percent of the people living there.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nBy the 1950s, we started connecting all the towns together\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nwith what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world, the highway system.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nAnd it is certainly a wonder.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nAnd by the way, as I take shots at old technologies,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nI want to assure everybody, and particularly the automotive industry --\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nwho's been very supportive of us --\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nthat I don't think this in any way competes with airplanes, or cars.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nBut think about where the world is today.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\n50 percent of the global population now lives in cities.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nThat's 3.2 billion people.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nWe've solved all the transportation problems\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nthat have changed the world to get it to where we are today.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\n500 years ago, sailing ships started getting reliable enough;\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nwe found a new continent.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:11.958\n150 years ago, locomotives got efficient enough, steam power,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nthat we turned the continent into a country.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nOver the last hundred years, we started building cars,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nand then over the 50 years we've connected every city to every other city\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nin an extraordinarily efficient way,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nand we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nBut during that entire process, more and more people have been born,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nand more and more people are moving to cities.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nChina alone is going to move four to six hundred million people\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\ninto cities in the next decade and a half.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nAnd so, nobody, I think, would argue that airplanes, in the last 50 years,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nhave turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nAnd if you just look at how technology has been applied,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nwe've solved all the long-range, high-speed, high-volume,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nlarge-weight problems of moving things around.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nNobody would want to give them up.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nAnd I certainly wouldn't want to give up my airplane,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nor my helicopter, or my Humvee, or my Porsche.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nI love them all. I don't keep any of them in my living room.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nThe fact is, the last mile is the problem,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nand half the world now lives in dense cities.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nAnd people spend, depending on who they are,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nbetween 90 and 95 percent of their energy getting around on foot.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nI think there's -- I don't know what data would impress you,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nbut how about, 43 percent of the refined fuel produced in the world\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nis consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the United States.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nThree million people die every year in cities due to bad air,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nand almost all particulate pollution on this planet\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nis produced by transportation devices, particularly sitting in cities.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nAnd again, I say that not to attack any industry,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nI think -- I really do -- I love my airplane,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nand cars on highways moving 60 miles an hour\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nare extraordinarily efficient,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nboth from an engineering point of view,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nan energy consumption point of view, and a utility point of view.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd we all love our cars, and I do.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nThe problem is, you get into the city and you want to go four blocks,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nit's neither fun nor efficient nor productive.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nIt's not sustainable.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nIf -- in China, in the year 1998, 417 million people used bicycles;\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\n1.7 million people used cars.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nIf five percent of that population became, quote, middle class,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nand wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nat the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into cities\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nof the size and density of Manhattan, every six weeks --\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nit isn't sustainable environmentally;\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nit isn't sustainable economically -- there just ain't enough oil --\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nand it's not sustainable politically.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nI mean, what are we fighting over right now?\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nWe can make it complicated, but what's the world fighting over right now?\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nSo it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nand it was dumb luck. We were working on iBOTs,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nbut once we made this, we instantly decided\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nit could be a great alternative to jet skis. You don't need the water.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nOr snowmobiles. You don't need the snow.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nOr skiing. It's just fun, and people love to move around doing fun things.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nAnd every one of those industries, by the way --\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\njust golf carts alone is a multi-billion-dollar industry.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nBut rather than go license this off, which is what we normally do,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nit seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nbut into an understanding of a world that's solved all its other problems,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nbut has somehow come to accept that cities -- which,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nright back from ancient Greece on, were meant to walk around,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\ncities that were architected and built for people --\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nnow have a footprint that,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nwhile we've solved every other transportation problem --\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nand it's like Moore's law.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nI mean, look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nthen on a railroad, then an airplane.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nEvery other form of transportation's been improved.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nIn 5,000 years, we've gone backwards in getting around cities.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nThey've gotten bigger; they're spread out.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nThe most expensive real estate on this planet in every city --\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nWilshire Boulevard, or Fifth Avenue, or Tokyo, or Paris --\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nthe most expensive real estate is their downtowns.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\n65 percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nThe 20 largest cities in the world.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nSo you wonder, what if cities could give to their pedestrians\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nwhat we take for granted as we now go between cities?\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nWhat if you could make them fun, attractive, clean,\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nenvironmentally friendly?\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nWhat if it would make it a little bit more palatable\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nto have access via this, as that last link to mass transit,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nto get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nand use our cars the way we want,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nand then have our cities energized again?\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nWe thought it would be really neat to do that,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nand one of the problems we really were worried about\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nis: how do we get legal on the sidewalk?\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nBecause technically I've got motors; I've got wheels -- I'm a motor vehicle.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nI don't look like a motor vehicle.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nI have the same footprint as a pedestrian;\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nI have the same unique capability\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nto deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nI took this down to Ground Zero,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nand knocked my way through crowds for an hour.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nI'm a pedestrian. But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nand if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk, we have two choices.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nWe're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nand I don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nOr maybe we should be out in the street\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nin front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nWe've been so concerned about that,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nwe went to the Postmaster General of the United States,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nas the first person we ever showed on the outside,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nand said, \"Put your people on it. Everybody trusts their postman.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nAnd they belong on the sidewalks, and they'll use it seriously.\"\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nHe agreed. We went to a number of police departments\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nthat want their police officers back in the neighborhood\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:30.958\non the beat, carrying 70 pounds of stuff.

And you should be really afraid, but not for the reasons why you think you should be. You should be really afraid that \u2014 if we stick up the first slide on this thing \u2014 there we go \u2014 that you're missing out. Because if you spend this week thinking about Iraq and thinking about Bush and thinking about the stock market, you're going to miss one of the greatest adventures that we've ever been on. And this is what this adventure's really about. This is crystallized DNA. Every life form on this planet \u2014 every insect, every bacteria, every plant, every animal, every human, every politician \u2014 (Laughter) is coded in that stuff. And if you want to take a single crystal of DNA, it looks like that. And we're just beginning to understand this stuff. And this is the single most exciting adventure that we have ever been on. It's the single greatest mapping project we've ever been on. If you think that the mapping of America's made a difference, or landing on the moon, or this other stuff, it's the map of ourselves and the map of every plant and every insect and every bacteria that really makes a difference. And it's beginning to tell us a lot about evolution. (Laughter)It turns out that what this stuff is \u2014 and Richard Dawkins has written about this \u2014 is, this is really a river out of Eden. So, the 3.2 billion base pairs inside each of your cells is really a history of where you've been for the past billion years. And we could start dating things, and we could start changing medicine and archeology. It turns out that if you take the human species about 700 years ago, white Europeans diverged from black Africans in a very significant way. White Europeans were subject to the plague. And when they were subject to the plague, most people didn't survive, but those who survived had a mutation on the CCR5 receptor. And that mutation was passed on to their kids because they're the ones that survived, so there was a great deal of population pressure. In Africa, because you didn't have these cities, you didn't have that CCR5 population pressure mutation. We can date it to 700 years ago. That is one of the reasons why AIDS is raging across Africa as fast as it is, and not as fast across Europe. And we're beginning to find these little things for malaria, for sickle cell, for cancers. And in the measure that we map ourselves, this is the single greatest adventure that we'll ever be on. And this Friday, I want you to pull out a really good bottle of wine, and I want you to toast these two people. Because this Friday, 50 years ago, Watson and Crick found the structure of DNA, and that is almost as important a date as the 12th of February when we first mapped ourselves, but anyway, we'll get to that.I thought we'd talk about the new zoo. So, all you guys have heard about DNA, all the stuff that DNA does, but some of the stuff we're discovering is kind of nifty because this turns out to be the single most abundant species on the planet. If you think you're successful or cockroaches are successful, it turns out that there's ten trillion trillion Pleurococcus sitting out there. And we didn't know that Pleurococcus was out there, which is part of the reason why this whole species-mapping project is so important. Because we're just beginning to learn where we came from and what we are. And we're finding amoebas like this. This is the amoeba dubia. And the amoeba dubia doesn't look like much, except that each of you has about 3.2 billion letters, which is what makes you you, as far as gene code inside each of your cells, and this little amoeba which, you know, sits in water in hundreds and millions and billions, turns out to have 620 billion base pairs of gene code inside. So, this little thingamajig has a genome that's 200 times the size of yours. And if you're thinking of efficient information storage mechanisms, it may not turn out to be chips. It may turn out to be something that looks a little like that amoeba.And, again, we're learning from life and how life works. This funky little thing: people didn't used to think that it was worth taking samples out of nuclear reactors because it was dangerous and, of course, nothing lived there. And then finally somebody picked up a microscope and looked at the water that was sitting next to the cores. And sitting next to that water in the cores was this little Deinococcus radiodurans, doing a backstroke, having its chromosomes blown apart every day, six, seven times, restitching them, living in about 200 times the radiation that would kill you. And by now you should be getting a hint as to how diverse and how important and how interesting this journey into life is, and how many different life forms there are, and how there can be different life forms living in very different places, maybe even outside of this planet. Because if you can live in radiation that looks like this, that brings up a whole series of interesting questions.This little thingamajig: we didn't know this thingamajig existed. We should have known that this existed because this is the only bacteria that you can see to the naked eye. So, this thing is 0.75 millimeters. It lives in a deep trench off the coast of Namibia. And what you're looking at with this namibiensis is the biggest bacteria we've ever seen. So, it's about the size of a little period on a sentence. Again, we didn't know this thing was there three years ago. We're just beginning this journey of life in the new zoo.This is a really odd one. This is Ferroplasma. The reason why Ferroplasma is interesting is because it eats iron, lives inside the equivalent of battery acid, and excretes sulfuric acid. So, when you think of odd life forms, when you think of what it takes to live, it turns out this is a very efficient life form, and they call it an archaea. Archaea means \"the ancient ones.\" And the reason why they're ancient is because this thing came up when this planet was covered by things like sulfuric acid in batteries, and it was eating iron when the earth was part of a melted core. So, it's not just dogs and cats and whales and dolphins that you should be aware of and interested in on this little journey.Your fear should be that you are not, that you're paying attention to stuff which is temporal. I mean, George Bush \u2014 he's going to be gone, alright? Life isn't. Whether the humans survive or don't survive, these things are going to be living on this planet or other planets. And it's just beginning to understand this code of DNA that's really the most exciting intellectual adventure that we've ever been on.And you can do strange things with this stuff. This is a baby gaur. Conservation group gets together, tries to figure out how to breed an animal that's almost extinct. They can't do it naturally, so what they do with this thing is they take a spoon, take some cells out of an adult gaur's mouth, code, take the cells from that and insert it into a fertilized cow's egg, reprogram cow's egg \u2014 different gene code. When you do that, the cow gives birth to a gaur. We are now experimenting with bongos, pandas, elands, Sumatran tigers, and the Australians \u2014 bless their hearts \u2014 are playing with these things.Now, the last of these things died in September 1936. These are Tasmanian tigers. The last known one died at the Hobart Zoo. But it turns out that as we learn more about gene code and how to reprogram species, we may be able to close the gene gaps in deteriorate DNA. And when we learn how to close the gene gaps, then we can put a full string of DNA together. And if we do that, and insert this into a fertilized wolf's egg, we may give birth to an animal that hasn't walked the earth since 1936. And then you can start going back further, and you can start thinking about dodos, and you can think about other species. And in other places, like Maryland, they're trying to figure out what the primordial ancestor is. Because each of us contains our entire gene code of where we've been for the past billion years, because we've evolved from that stuff, you can take that tree of life and collapse it back, and in the measure that you learn to reprogram, maybe we'll give birth to something that is very close to the first primordial ooze. And it's all coming out of things that look like this.These are companies that didn't exist five years ago. Huge gene sequencing facilities the size of football fields. Some are public. Some are private. It takes about 5 billion dollars to sequence a human being the first time. Takes about 3 million dollars the second time. We will have a 1,000-dollar genome within the next five to eight years. That means each of you will contain on a CD your entire gene code. And it will be really boring. It will read like this. (Laughter) The really neat thing about this stuff is that's life. And Laurie's going to talk about this one a little bit. Because if you happen to find this one inside your body, you're in big trouble, because that's the source code for Ebola. That's one of the deadliest diseases known to humans. But plants work the same way and insects work the same way, and this apple works the same way. This apple is the same thing as this floppy disk. Because this thing codes ones and zeros, and this thing codes A, T, C, Gs, and it sits up there, absorbing energy on a tree, and one fine day it has enough energy to say, execute, and it goes [thump]. Right? (Laughter) And when it does that, pushes a .EXE, what it does is, it executes the first line of code, which reads just like that, AATCAGGGACCC, and that means: make a root. Next line of code: make a stem. Next line of code, TACGGGG: make a flower that's white, that blooms in the spring, that smells like this. In the measure that you have the code and the measure that you read it \u2014 and, by the way, the first plant was read two years ago; the first human was read two years ago; the first insect was read two years ago.The first thing that we ever read was in 1995: a little bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae. In the measure that you have the source code, as all of you know, you can change the source code, and you can reprogram life forms so that this little thingy becomes a vaccine, or this little thingy starts producing biomaterials, which is why DuPont is now growing a form of polyester that feels like silk in corn. This changes all rules. This is life, but we're reprogramming it. This is what you look like. This is one of your chromosomes. And what you can do now is, you can outlay exactly what your chromosome is, and what the gene code on that chromosome is right here, and what those genes code for, and what animals they code against, and then you can tie it to the literature. And in the measure that you can do that, you can go home today, and get on the Internet, and access the world's biggest public library, which is a library of life. And you can do some pretty strange things because in the same way as you can reprogram this apple, if you go to Cliff Tabin's lab at the Harvard Medical School, he's reprogramming chicken embryos to grow more wings. Why would Cliff be doing that? He doesn't have a restaurant. (Laughter)The reason why he's reprogramming that animal to have more wings is because when you used to play with lizards as a little child, and you picked up the lizard, sometimes the tail fell off, but it regrew. Not so in human beings: you cut off an arm, you cut off a leg \u2014 it doesn't regrow. But because each of your cells contains your entire gene code, each cell can be reprogrammed, if we don't stop stem cell research and if we don't stop genomic research, to express different body functions. And in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings, and what the program is for those cells to differentiate, one of the things we're going to be able to do is to stop undifferentiated cells, which you know as cancer, and one of the things we're going to learn how to do is how to reprogram cells like stem cells in such a way that they express bone, stomach, skin, pancreas. And you are likely to be wandering around \u2014 and your children \u2014 on regrown body parts in a reasonable period of time, in some places in the world where they don't stop the research.How's this stuff work? If each of you differs from the person next to you by one in a thousand, but only three percent codes, which means it's only one in a thousand times three percent, very small differences in expression and punctuation can make a significant difference. Take a simple declarative sentence. (Laughter) Right? That's perfectly clear. So, men read that sentence, and they look at that sentence, and they read this. Okay? Now, women look at that sentence and they say, uh-uh, wrong. This is the way it should be seen. (Laughter) That's what your genes are doing. That's why you differ from this person over here by one in a thousand. Right? But, you know, he's reasonably good looking, but... I won't go there. You can do this stuff even without changing the punctuation. You can look at this, right? And they look at the world a little differently. They look at the same world and they say... (Laughter) That's how the same gene code \u2014 that's why you have 30,000 genes, mice have 30,000 genes, husbands have 30,000 genes. Mice and men are the same. Wives know that, but anyway. You can make very small changes in gene code and get really different outcomes, even with the same string of letters. That's what your genes are doing every day. That's why sometimes a person's genes don't have to change a lot to get cancer.These little chippies, these things are the size of a credit card. They will test any one of you for 60,000 genetic conditions. That brings up questions of privacy and insurability and all kinds of stuff, but it also allows us to start going after diseases, because if you run a person who has leukemia through something like this, it turns out that three diseases with completely similar clinical syndromes are completely different diseases. Because in ALL leukemia, that set of genes over there over-expresses. In MLL, it's the middle set of genes, and in AML, it's the bottom set of genes. And if one of those particular things is expressing in your body, then you take Gleevec and you're cured. If it is not expressing in your body, if you don't have one of those types \u2014 a particular one of those types \u2014 don't take Gleevec. It won't do anything for you. Same thing with Receptin if you've got breast cancer. Don't have an HER-2 receptor? Don't take Receptin. Changes the nature of medicine. Changes the predictions of medicine. Changes the way medicine works.The greatest repository of knowledge when most of us went to college was this thing, and it turns out that this is not so important any more. The U.S. Library of Congress, in terms of its printed volume of data, contains less data than is coming out of a good genomics company every month on a compound basis. Let me say that again: A single genomics company generates more data in a month, on a compound basis, than is in the printed collections of the Library of Congress. This is what's been powering the U.S. economy. It's Moore's Law. So, all of you know that the price of computers halves every 18 months and the power doubles, right? Except that when you lay that side by side with the speed with which gene data's being deposited in GenBank, Moore's Law is right here: it's the blue line. This is on a log scale, and that's what superexponential growth means. This is going to push computers to have to grow faster than they've been growing, because so far, there haven't been applications that have been required that need to go faster than Moore's Law. This stuff does.And here's an interesting map. This is a map which was finished at the Harvard Business School. One of the really interesting questions is, if all this data's free, who's using it? This is the greatest public library in the world. Well, it turns out that there's about 27 trillion bits moving inside from the United States to the United States; about 4.6 trillion is going over to those European countries; about 5.5's going to Japan; there's almost no communication between Japan, and nobody else is literate in this stuff. It's free. No one's reading it. They're focusing on the war; they're focusing on Bush; they're not interested in life. So, this is what a new map of the world looks like. That is the genomically literate world. And that is a problem. In fact, it's not a genomically literate world. You can break this out by states. And you can watch states rise and fall depending on their ability to speak a language of life, and you can watch New York fall off a cliff, and you can watch New Jersey fall off a cliff, and you can watch the rise of the new empires of intelligence. And you can break it out by counties, because it's specific counties. And if you want to get more specific, it's actually specific zip codes. (Laughter)So, you want to know where life is happening? Well, in Southern California it's happening in 92121. And that's it. And that's the triangle between Salk, Scripps, UCSD, and it's called Torrey Pines Road. That means you don't need to be a big nation to be successful; it means you don't need a lot of people to be successful; and it means you can move most of the wealth of a country in about three or four carefully picked 747s.Same thing in Massachusetts. Looks more spread out but \u2014 oh, by the way, the ones that are the same color are contiguous. What's the net effect of this? In an agricultural society, the difference between the richest and the poorest, the most productive and the least productive, was five to one. Why? Because in agriculture, if you had 10 kids and you grow up a little bit earlier and you work a little bit harder, you could produce about five times more wealth, on average, than your neighbor. In a knowledge society, that number is now 427 to 1. It really matters if you're literate, not just in reading and writing in English and French and German, but in Microsoft and Linux and Apple. And very soon it's going to matter if you're literate in life code. So, if there is something you should fear, it's that you're not keeping your eye on the ball. Because it really matters who speaks life. That's why nations rise and fall.And it turns out that if you went back to the 1870s, the most productive nation on earth was Australia, per person. And New Zealand was way up there. And then the U.S. came in about 1950, and then Switzerland about 1973, and then the U.S. got back on top \u2014 beat up their chocolates and cuckoo clocks. And today, of course, you all know that the most productive nation on earth is Luxembourg, producing about one third more wealth per person per year than America. Tiny landlocked state. No oil. No diamonds. No natural resources. Just smart people moving bits. Different rules.Here's differential productivity rates. Here's how many people it takes to produce a single U.S. patent. So, about 3,000 Americans, 6,000 Koreans, 14,000 Brits, 790,000 Argentines. You want to know why Argentina's crashing? It's got nothing to do with inflation. It's got nothing to do with privatization. You can take a Harvard-educated Ivy League economist, stick him in charge of Argentina. He still crashes the country because he doesn't understand how the rules have changed. Oh, yeah, and it takes about 5.6 million Indians. Well, watch what happens to India. India and China used to be 40 percent of the global economy just at the Industrial Revolution, and they are now about 4.8 percent. Two billion people. One third of the global population producing 5 percent of the wealth because they didn't get this change, because they kept treating their people like serfs instead of like shareholders of a common project. They didn't keep the people who were educated. They didn't foment the businesses. They didn't do the IPOs. Silicon Valley did. And that's why they say that Silicon Valley has been powered by ICs. Not integrated circuits: Indians and Chinese. (Laughter)Here's what's happening in the world. It turns out that if you'd gone to the U.N. in 1950, when it was founded, there were 50 countries in this world. It turns out there's now about 192. Country after country is splitting, seceding, succeeding, failing \u2014 and it's all getting very fragmented. And this has not stopped. In the 1990s, these are sovereign states that did not exist before 1990. And this doesn't include fusions or name changes or changes in flags. We're generating about 3.12 states per year. People are taking control of their own states, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. And the really interesting thing is, you and your kids are empowered to build great empires, and you don't need a lot to do it. (Music) And, given that the music is over, I was going to talk about how you can use this to generate a lot of wealth, and how code works. Moderator: Two minutes. (Laughter) Juan Enriquez: No, I'm going to stop there and we'll do it next year because I don't want to take any of Laurie's time.

00:01:32.958\nIt turns out that what this stuff is --\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nand Richard Dawkins has written about this --\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nis, this is really a river out

turns out that if you take the human species about 700 years ago,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nwhite Europeans diverged from black Africans in a very significant way.\n\n00:01:54.958 -->

those who survived had a mutation on the CCR5 receptor.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nAnd that mutation was passed on to their kids\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nbecause they're the ones that survived,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nso there was a great deal of population pressure.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nIn Africa, because you didn't have these cities,\n\n00:02:15.958 -->

you to toast these two people.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nBecause this Friday, 50 years ago, Watson and Crick found the structure of DNA,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nand that is almost as

00:03:01.958\nI thought we'd talk about the new zoo.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nSo, all you guys have heard about DNA, all the stuff that DNA does,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nbut some of the stuff we're discovering is kind of nifty\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nbecause this turns out to be the single most abundant species on the planet.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nIf you

00:03:22.958\nAnd we didn't know that Pleurococcus was out there,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nwhich is part of the reason\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nwhy this whole species-mapping project is so important.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nBecause we're just beginning to learn\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nwhere we came from and what we are.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nAnd we're finding amoebas like this. This is the amoeba dubia.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nAnd the amoeba dubia doesn't look like much,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nexcept that each of you has about 3.2 billion letters,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nwhich is what makes you you,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nas far as gene code inside each of your cells,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nand this little amoeba which, you know,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nsits in water in hundreds and millions and billions,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nturns out to have 620 billion base pairs of gene code inside.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nSo, this little thingamajig has a genome\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nthat's 200 times the size of yours.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nAnd if you're thinking of efficient information storage mechanisms,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nit may not turn out to be chips.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nIt may turn out to be something that looks a little like that amoeba.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nAnd, again, we're learning from life and how life works.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nThis funky little thing: people didn't used to think\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nthat it was worth taking samples out of nuclear reactors\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nbecause it was dangerous and, of course, nothing lived there.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nAnd then finally somebody picked up a microscope\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand looked at the water that was sitting next to the cores.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nAnd sitting next to that water in the cores\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nwas this little Deinococcus radiodurans, doing a backstroke,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nhaving its chromosomes blown apart every day,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nsix, seven times, restitching them,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nliving in about 200 times the radiation that would kill you.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nAnd by now you should be getting a hint as to how diverse\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nand how important and how interesting this journey into life is,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nand how many different life forms there are,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nand how there can be different life forms living in\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nvery different places, maybe even outside of this planet.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nBecause if you can live in radiation that looks like this,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nthat brings up a whole series of interesting questions.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nThis little thingamajig: we didn't know this thingamajig existed.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nWe should have known that this existed\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nbecause this is the only bacteria that you can see to the naked eye.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nSo, this thing is 0.75 millimeters.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nIt lives in a deep trench off the coast of Namibia.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd what you're looking at with this namibiensis\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nis the biggest bacteria we've ever seen.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nSo, it's about the size of a little period on a sentence.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nAgain, we didn't know this thing was there three years ago.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nWe're just beginning this journey of life in the new zoo.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nThis is a really odd one. This is Ferroplasma.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nThe reason why Ferroplasma is interesting is because it eats iron,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nlives inside the equivalent of battery acid,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nand excretes sulfuric acid.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nSo, when you think of odd life forms,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nwhen you think of what it takes to live,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nit turns out this is a very efficient life form,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nand they call it an archaea. Archaea means \"the ancient ones.\"\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nAnd the reason why they're ancient is because this thing came up\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nwhen this planet was covered\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nby things like sulfuric acid in batteries,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nand it was eating iron when the earth was part of a melted core.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nSo, it's not just dogs and cats and whales and dolphins\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nthat you should be aware of and interested in on this little journey.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nYour fear should be that you are not,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nthat you're paying attention to stuff which is temporal.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nI mean, George Bush -- he's going to be gone, alright? Life isn't.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nWhether the humans survive or don't survive,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nthese things are going to be living on this planet or other planets.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd it's just beginning to understand this code of DNA\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nthat's really the most exciting intellectual adventure\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nthat we've ever been on.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nAnd you can do strange things with this stuff. This is a baby gaur.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nConservation group gets together,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:06.958\ntries to figure out how to breed an animal that's almost extinct.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nThey can't do it naturally, so what they do with this thing is\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nthey take a spoon, take some cells out of an adult gaur's mouth, code,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:20.958\ntake the cells from that and insert it into a fertilized cow's egg,\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nreprogram cow's egg -- different gene code.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nWhen you do that, the cow gives birth to a gaur.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nWe are now experimenting with bongos, pandas, elands, Sumatran tigers,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nand the Australians -- bless their hearts --\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nare playing with these things.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nNow, the last of these things died in September 1936.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nThese are Tasmanian tigers. The last known one died at the Hobart Zoo.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nBut it turns out that as we learn more about gene code\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nand how to reprogram species,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nwe may be able to close the gene gaps in deteriorate DNA.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nAnd when we learn how to close the gene gaps,\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nthen we can put a full string of DNA together.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nAnd if we do that, and insert this into a fertilized wolf's egg,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nwe may give birth to an animal\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nthat hasn't walked the earth since 1936.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd then you can start going back further,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nand you can start thinking about dodos,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nand you can think about other species.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nAnd in other places, like Maryland, they're trying to figure out\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nwhat the primordial ancestor is.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nBecause each of us contains our entire gene code\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nof where we've been for the past billion years,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nbecause we've evolved from that stuff,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nyou can take that tree of life and collapse it back,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nand in the measure that you learn to reprogram,\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nmaybe we'll give birth to something\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nthat is very close to the first primordial ooze.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nAnd it's all coming out of things that look like this.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nThese are companies that didn't exist five years ago.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nHuge gene sequencing facilities the size of football fields.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nSome are public. Some are private.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nIt takes about 5 billion dollars to sequence a human being the first time.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nTakes about 3 million dollars the second time.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nWe will have a 1,000-dollar genome within the next five to eight years.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nThat means each of you will contain on a CD your entire gene code.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nAnd it will be really boring. It will read like this.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nThe really neat thing about this stuff is that's life.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd Laurie's going to talk about this one a little bit.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nBecause if you happen to find this one inside your body,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nyou're in big trouble, because that's the source code for Ebola.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nThat's one of the deadliest diseases known to humans.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nBut plants work the same way and insects work the same way,\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nand this apple works the same way.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nThis apple is the same thing as this floppy disk.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nBecause this thing codes ones and zeros,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nand this thing codes A, T, C, Gs, and it sits up there,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nabsorbing energy on a tree, and one fine day\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nit has enough energy to say, execute, and it goes [thump]. Right?\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nAnd when it does that, pushes a .EXE, what it does is,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nit executes the first line of code, which reads just like that,\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nAATCAGGGACCC, and that means: make a root.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nNext line of code: make a stem.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nNext line of code, TACGGGG: make a flower that's white,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nthat blooms in the spring, that smells like this.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nIn the measure that you have the code\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nand the measure that you read it --\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nand, by the way, the first plant was read two years ago;\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nthe first human was read two years ago;\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nthe first insect was read two years ago.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nThe first thing that we ever read was in 1995:\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\na little bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nIn the measure that you have the source code, as all of you know,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nyou can change the source code, and you can reprogram life forms\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nso that this little thingy becomes a vaccine,\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nor this little thingy starts producing biomaterials,\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nwhich is why DuPont is now growing a form of polyester\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nthat feels like silk in corn.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nThis changes all rules. This is life, but we're reprogramming it.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nThis is what you look like. This is one of your chromosomes.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nAnd what you can do now is,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nyou can outlay exactly what your chromosome is,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nand what the gene code on that chromosome is right here,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nand what those genes code for, and what animals they code against,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nand then you can tie it to the literature.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nAnd in the measure that you can do that, you can go home today,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nand get on the Internet, and access\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nthe world's biggest public library, which is a library of life.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nAnd you can do some pretty strange things\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nbecause in the same way as you can reprogram this apple,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nif you go to Cliff Tabin's lab at the Harvard Medical School,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nhe's reprogramming chicken embryos to grow more wings.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nWhy would Cliff be doing that? He doesn't have a restaurant.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:28.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nThe reason why he's reprogramming that animal to have more wings\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nis because when you used to play with lizards as a little child,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nand you picked up the lizard, sometimes the tail fell off, but it regrew.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nNot so in human beings:\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nyou cut off an arm, you cut off a leg -- it doesn't regrow.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nBut because each of your cells contains your entire gene code,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:54.958\neach cell can be reprogrammed, if we don't stop stem cell research\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nand if we don't stop genomic research,\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nto express different body functions.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nAnd in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nand what the program is for those cells to differentiate,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\none of the things we're going to be able to do\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nis to stop undifferentiated cells, which you know as cancer,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nand one of the things we're going to learn how to do\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nis how to reprogram cells like stem cells\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nin such a way that they express bone, stomach, skin, pancreas.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nAnd you are likely to be wandering around -- and your children --\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\non regrown body parts in a reasonable period of time,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nin some places in the world where they don't stop the research.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nHow's this stuff work? If each of you differs\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nfrom the person next to you by one in a thousand, but only three percent codes,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nwhich means it's only one in a thousand times three percent,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nvery small differences in expression and punctuation\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\ncan make a significant difference. Take a simple declarative sentence.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nRight?\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nThat's perfectly clear. So, men read that sentence,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nand they look at that sentence, and they read this.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nOkay?\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nNow, women look at that sentence and they say, uh-uh, wrong.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nThis is the way it should be seen.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:26.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nThat's what your genes are doing.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nThat's why you differ from this person over here by one in a thousand.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nRight? But, you know, he's reasonably good looking, but...\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nI won't go there.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nYou can do this stuff even without changing the punctuation.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nYou can look at this, right?\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nAnd they look at the world a little differently.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nThey look at the same world and they say...\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nThat's how the same gene code -- that's why you have 30,000 genes,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nmice have 30,000 genes, husbands have 30,000 genes.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nMice and men are the same. Wives know that, but anyway.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nYou can make very small changes in gene code\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nand get really different outcomes,\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\neven with the same string of letters.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nThat's what your genes are doing every day.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nThat's why sometimes a person's genes\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\ndon't have to change a lot to get cancer.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nThese little chippies, these things are the size of a credit card.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nThey will test any one of you for 60,000 genetic conditions.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nThat brings up questions of privacy and insurability\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nand all kinds of stuff, but it also allows us to start going after diseases,\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nbecause if you run a person who has leukemia through something like this,\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nit turns out that three diseases with\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:52.958\ncompletely similar clinical syndromes\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nare completely different diseases.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nBecause in ALL leukemia, that set of genes over there over-expresses.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nIn MLL, it's the middle set of genes,\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nand in AML, it's the bottom set of genes.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nAnd if one of those particular things is expressing in your body,\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nthen you take Gleevec and you're cured.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nIf it is not expressing in your body,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nif you don't have one of those types --\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\na particular one of those types -- don't take Gleevec.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nIt won't do anything for you.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nSame thing with Receptin if you've got breast cancer.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nDon't have an HER-2 receptor? Don't take Receptin.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nChanges the nature of medicine. Changes the predictions of medicine.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nChanges the way medicine works.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nThe greatest repository of knowledge when most of us went to college\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nwas this thing, and it turns out that\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nthis is not so important any more.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nThe U.S. Library of Congress, in terms of its printed volume of data,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:45.958\ncontains less data than is coming out of a good genomics company\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nevery month on a compound basis.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nLet me say that again: A single genomics company\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\ngenerates more data in a month, on a compound basis,\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nthan is in the printed collections of the Library of Congress.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nThis is what's been powering the U.S. economy. It's Moore's Law.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nSo, all of you know that the price of computers halves every 18 months\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nand the power doubles, right?\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nExcept that when you lay that side by side with the speed\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nwith which gene data's being deposited in GenBank,\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nMoore's Law is right here: it's the blue line.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nThis is on a log scale, and that's what superexponential growth means.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nThis is going to push computers to have to grow faster\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nthan they've been growing, because so far,\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nthere haven't been applications that have been required\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nthat need to go faster than Moore's Law. This stuff does.\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nAnd here's an interesting map.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nThis is a map which was finished at the Harvard Business School.\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nOne of the really interesting questions is, if all this data's free,\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nwho's using it? This is the greatest public library in the world.\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nWell, it turns out that there's about 27 trillion bits\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nmoving inside from the United States to the United States;\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nabout 4.6 trillion is going over to those European countries;\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nabout 5.5's going to Japan; there's almost no communication\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nbetween Japan, and nobody else is literate in this stuff.\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nIt's free. No one's reading it. They're focusing on the war;\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nthey're focusing on Bush; they're not interested in life.\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nSo, this is what a new map of the world looks like.\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nThat is the genomically literate world. And that is a problem.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nIn fact, it's not a genomically literate world.\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nYou can break this out by states.\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:30.958\nAnd you can watch states rise and fall depending on\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:32.958\ntheir ability to speak a language of life,\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nand you can watch New York fall off a cliff,\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nand you can watch New Jersey fall off a cliff,\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nand you can watch the rise of the new empires of intelligence.\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nAnd you can break it out by counties, because it's specific counties.\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nAnd if you want to get more specific,\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nit's actually specific zip codes.\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:49.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nSo, you want to know where life is happening?\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nWell, in Southern California it's happening in 92121. And that's it.\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nAnd that's the triangle between Salk, Scripps, UCSD,\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nand it's called Torrey Pines Road.\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nThat means you don't need to be a big nation to be successful;\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nit means you don't need a lot of people to be successful;\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nand it means you can move most of the wealth of a country\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nin about three or four carefully picked 747s.\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nSame thing in Massachusetts. Looks more spread out but --\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:24.958\noh, by the way, the ones that are the same color are contiguous.\n\n00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nWhat's the net effect of this?\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nIn an agricultural society, the difference between\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nthe richest and the poorest,\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nthe most productive and the least productive, was five to one. Why?\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nBecause in agriculture, if you had 10 kids\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nand you grow up a little bit earlier and you work a little bit harder,\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nyou could produce about five times more wealth, on average,\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nthan your neighbor.\n\n00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nIn a knowledge society, that number is now 427 to 1.\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:52.958\nIt really matters if you're literate, not just in reading and writing\n\n00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nin English and French and German,\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nbut in Microsoft and Linux and Apple.\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nAnd very soon it's going to matter if you're literate in life code.\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:03.958\nSo, if there is something you should fear,\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nit's that you're not keeping your eye on the ball.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nBecause it really matters who speaks life.\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nThat's why nations rise and fall.\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:15.958\nAnd it turns out that if you went back to the 1870s,\n\n00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nthe most productive nation on earth was Australia, per person.\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nAnd New Zealand was way up there. And then the U.S. came in about 1950,\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nand then Switzerland about 1973, and then the U.S. got back on top --\n\n00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:27.958\nbeat up their chocolates and cuckoo clocks.\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nAnd today, of course, you all know that the most productive nation\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:35.958\non earth is Luxembourg, producing about one third more wealth\n\n00:19:35.958 --> 00:19:37.958\nper person per year than America.\n\n00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:42.958\nTiny landlocked state. No oil. No diamonds. No natural resources.\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:47.958\nJust smart people moving bits. Different rules.\n\n00:19:48.958 --> 00:19:51.958\nHere's differential productivity rates.\n\n00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:55.958\nHere's how many people it takes to produce a single U.S. patent.\n\n00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:59.958\nSo, about 3,000 Americans, 6,000 Koreans, 14,000 Brits,\n\n00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:02.958\n790,000 Argentines. You want to know why Argentina's crashing?\n\n00:20:02.958 --> 00:20:04.958\nIt's got nothing to do with inflation.\n\n00:20:04.958 --> 00:20:06.958\nIt's got nothing to do with privatization.\n\n00:20:06.958 --> 00:20:10.958\nYou can take a Harvard-educated Ivy League economist,\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:13.958\nstick him in charge of Argentina. He still crashes the country\n\n00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:15.958\nbecause he doesn't understand how the rules have changed.\n\n00:20:16.958 --> 00:20:19.958\nOh, yeah, and it takes about 5.6 million Indians.\n\n00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:21.958\nWell, watch what happens to India.\n\n00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:24.958\nIndia and China used to be 40 percent of the global economy\n\n00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:29.958\njust at the Industrial Revolution, and they are now about 4.8 percent.\n\n00:20:29.958 --> 00:20:33.958\nTwo billion people. One third of the global population producing 5 percent of the wealth\n\n00:20:33.958 --> 00:20:36.958\nbecause they didn't get this change,\n\n00:20:36.958 --> 00:20:38.958\nbecause they kept treating their people like serfs\n\n00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:41.958\ninstead of like shareholders of a common project.\n\n00:20:42.958 --> 00:20:45.958\nThey didn't keep the people who were educated.\n\n00:20:45.958 --> 00:20:47.958\nThey didn't foment the businesses. They didn't do the IPOs.\n\n00:20:48.958 --> 00:20:52.958\nSilicon Valley did. And that's why they say\n\n00:20:52.958 --> 00:20:54.958\nthat Silicon Valley has been powered by ICs.\n\n00:20:55.958 --> 00:20:58.958\nNot integrated circuits: Indians and Chinese.\n\n00:20:58.958 --> 00:21:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:04.958\nHere's what's happening in the world.\n\n00:21:04.958 --> 00:21:07.958\nIt turns out that if you'd gone to the U.N. in 1950,\n\n00:21:07.958 --> 00:21:09.958\nwhen it was founded, there were 50 countries in this world.\n\n00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:12.958\nIt turns out there's now about 192.\n\n00:21:12.958 --> 00:21:16.958\nCountry after country is splitting, seceding, succeeding, failing --\n\n00:21:17.958 --> 00:21:22.958\nand it's all getting very fragmented. And this has not stopped.\n\n00:21:22.958 --> 00:21:25.958\nIn the 1990s, these are sovereign states\n\n00:21:25.958 --> 00:21:27.958\nthat did not exist before 1990.\n\n00:21:27.958 --> 00:21:32.958\nAnd this doesn't include fusions or name changes or changes in flags.\n\n00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:35.958\nWe're generating about 3.12 states per year.\n\n00:21:35.958 --> 00:21:38.958\nPeople are taking control of their own states,\n\n00:21:38.958 --> 00:21:41.958\nsometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.\n\n00:21:41.958 --> 00:21:43.958\nAnd the really interesting thing is,\n\n00:21:43.958 --> 00:21:45.958\nyou and your kids are empowered to build great empires,\n\n00:21:45.958 --> 00:21:47.958\nand you don't need a lot to do it.\n\n00:21:47.958 --> 00:21:49.958\n(Music)\n\n00:21:49.958 --> 00:21:52.958\nAnd, given that the music is over, I was going to talk\n\n00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:55.958\nabout how you can use this to generate a lot of wealth,\n\n00:21:55.958 --> 00:21:57.958\nand how code works.\n\n00:21:57.958 --> 00:21:58.958\nModerator: Two minutes.\n\n00:21:58.958 --> 00:22:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:22:00.958 --> 00:22:04.958\nJuan Enriquez: No, I'm going to stop there and we'll do it next year\n\n00:22:04.958 --> 00:22:06.958\nbecause I don't want to take any of Laurie's time.\n\n00:22:07.958 --> 00:22:08.958\nBut thank you very much."}, {"title": "Happiness by design", "duration": "930", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/stefan_sagmeister_shares_happy_design", "transcript": "About 15 years ago, I went to visit a friend in Hong Kong. And at the time I was very superstitious. So, upon landing \u2014 this was still at the old Hong Kong airport that's Kai Tak, when it was smack in the middle of the city \u2014 I thought, \"If I see something good, I'm going to have a great time here in my two weeks. And if I see something negative, I'm going to be miserable, indeed.\"So the plane landed in between the buildings and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard. (Laughter) And I actually went to see some of the design companies in Hong Kong in my stay there. And it turned out that \u2014 I just went to see, you know, what they are doing in Hong Kong.But I actually walked away with a great job offer. And I flew back to Austria, packed my bags, and, another week later, I was again on my way to Hong Kong still superstitions and thinking, \"Well, if that 'Winner' billboard is still up, I'm going to have a good time working here. (Laughter) But if it's gone, it's going to be really miserable and stressful.\" So it turned out that not only was the billboard still up but they had put this one right next to it. (Laughter) On the other hand, it also taught me where superstition gets me because I really had a terrible time in Hong Kong. (Laughter)However, I did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life \u2014 of, you know, I think what the conference brochure refers to as \"moments that take your breath away.\" And since I'm a big list maker, I actually listed them all. (Laughter) Now, you don't have to go through the trouble of reading them and I won't read them for you. I know that it's incredibly boring to hear about other people's happinesses. (Laughter)What I did do, though is, I actually looked at them from a design standpoint and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design. And, very surprisingly, over half of them had, actually, something to do with design.So there are, of course, two different possibilities. There's one from a consumer's point of view \u2014 where I was happy while experiencing design. And I'll just give you one example. I had gotten my first Walkman. This is 1983. My brother had this great Yamaha motorcycle that he was willing to borrow to me freely. And The Police's \"Synchronicity\" cassette had just been released and there was no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz. So you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting The Police on the new Sony Walkman. (Laughter) And I remember it as a true moment of happiness. You know, of course, they are related to this combination of at least two of them being, you know, design objects. And, you know, there's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design but the motorcycle incident would definitely be, you know, situated somewhere here \u2014 right in there between Delight and Bliss.Now, there is the other part, from a designer's standpoint \u2014 if you're happy while actually doing it. And one way to see how happy designers are when they're designing could be to look at the authors' photos on the back of their monographs? (Laughter) So, according to this, the Australians and the Japanese as well as the Mexicans are very happy. (Laughter) While, somewhat, the Spaniards ... and, I think, particularly, the Swiss (Laughter), don't seem to be doing all that well. (Laughter)Last November, a museum opened in Tokyo called The Mori Museum, in a skyscraper, up on the 56th floor. And their inaugural exhibit was called \"Happiness.\" And I went, very eagerly, to see it, because \u2014 well, also, with an eye on this conference. And they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas. Under \"Arcadia,\" they showed things like this, from the Edo period \u2014 a hundred ways to write \"happiness\" in different forms. Or they had this apple by Yoko Ono \u2014 that, of course, later on was, you know, made into the label for The Beatles.Under \"Nirvana\" they showed this Constable painting. And there was a little \u2014 an interesting theory about abstraction. This is a blue field \u2014 it's actually an Yves Klein painting. And the theory was that if you abstract an image, you really, you know open as much room for the un-representable \u2014 and, therefore, you know, are able to involve the viewer more.Then, under \"Desire,\" they showed these Shunsho paintings \u2014 also from the Edo period \u2014 ink on silk. And, lastly, under \"Harmony,\" they had this 13th-century mandala from Tibet.Now, what I took away from the exhibit was that maybe with the exception of the mandala most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness. And I felt a little bit cheated, because the visualization \u2014 that's a really easy thing to do. And, you know, my studio \u2014 we've done it all the time. This is, you know, a book. A happy dog \u2014 and you take it out, it's an aggressive dog. It's a happy David Byrne and an angry David Byrne. Or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face. You know, that's not a big deal to accomplish.It has gotten to the point where, you know, within advertising or within the movie industry, \"happy\" has gotten such a bad reputation that if you actually want to do something with the subject and still appear authentic, you almost would have to, you know, do it from a cynical point of view. This is, you know, the movie poster. Or we, a couple of weeks ago, designed a box set for The Talking Heads where the happiness visualized on the cover definitely has, very much, a dark side to it.Much, much more difficult is this, where the designs actually can evoke happiness \u2014 and I'm going to just show you three that actually did this for me. This is a campaign done by a young artist in New York, who calls himself \"True.\" Everybody who has ridden the New York subway system will be familiar with these signs? True printed his own version of these signs. Met every Wednesday at a subway stop with 20 of his friends. They divided up the different subway lines and added their own version. (Laughter) So this is one. (Laughter)Now, the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs. So you're (Laughter) you're really bored in the subway, and you kind of stare at something. And it takes you a while until it actually \u2014 you realize that this says something different than what it normally says. (Laughter) I mean, that's, at least, how it made me happy. (Laughter)Now, True is a real humanitarian. He didn't want any of his friends to be arrested, so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card. (Laughter) And also gave this fake letter from the MTA to everybody \u2014 sort of like pretending that it's an art project financed by The Metropolitan Transit Authority. (Laughter)Another New York project. This is at P.S. 1 \u2014 a sculpture that's basically a square room by James Turrell, that has a retractable ceiling. Opens up at dusk and dawn every day. You don't see the horizon. You're just in there, watching the incredible, subtle changes of color in the sky. And the room is truly something to be seen. People's demeanor changes when they go in there. And, for sure, I haven't looked at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there.There are, of course, more than those three projects that I'm showing here. I would definitely say that observing Vik Muniz' \"Cloud\" a couple of years ago in Manhattan for sure made me happy, as well. But my last project is, again, from a young designer in New York. He's from Korea originally. And he took it upon himself to print 55,000 speech bubbles \u2014 empty speech bubbles stickers, large ones and small ones. And he goes around New York and just puts them, empty as they are, on posters. (Laughter) And other people go and fill them in. (Laughter)This one says, \"Please let me die in peace.\" (Laughter) I think that was \u2014 the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good. This is on a musician poster, that says: \"I am concerned that my CD will not sell more than 200,000 units and that, as a result, my recoupable advance from my label will be taken from me, after which, my contract will be cancelled, and I'll be back doing Journey covers on Bleecker Street.\" (Laughter)I think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins. Jee gets to have his project; the public gets a sweeter environment; and different public gets a place to express itself; and the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads. (Laughter)Well, there was a question, of course, that was on my mind for a while: You know, can I do more of the things that I like doing in design and less of the ones that I don't like to be doing? Which brought me back to my list making \u2014 you know, just to see what I actually like about my job.You know, one is: just working without pressure. Then: working concentrated, without being frazzled. Or, as Nancy said before, like really immerse oneself into it. Try not to get stuck doing the same thing \u2014 or try not get stuck behind the computer all day. This is, you know, related to it: getting out of the studio. Then, of course, trying to, you know, work on things where the content is actually important for me. And being able to enjoy the end results.And then I found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained all the things that I thought I learned in my life so far. And, just about at that time, an Austrian magazine called and asked if we would want to do six spreads \u2014 design six spreads that work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine? And the whole thing just fell together. So I just picked one of the things that I thought I learned \u2014 in this case, \"Everything I do always comes back to me\" \u2014 and we made these spreads right out of this. So it was: \"Everything I do always comes back to me.\"A couple of weeks ago, a (Laughter) French company asked us to design five billboards for them. Again, we could supply the content for it. So I just picked another one. And this was two weeks ago. We flew to Arizona \u2014 the designer who works with me, and myself \u2014 and photographed this one. So it's: \"Trying to look good limits my life.\"And then we did one more of these. This is, again, for a magazine, dividing pages. This is: \"Having\" \u2014 this is the same thing; it's just, you know, photographed from the side. This is from the front. Then it's: \"guts.\" Again, it's the same thing \u2014 \"guts\" is just the same room, reworked. Then it's: \"always works out.\" Then it's \"for,\" with the light on. (Laughter) And it's \"me.\"Thank you so much.

And if I see something negative, I'm going to be miserable, indeed.\"\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nSo the plane landed in between the buildings\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nand got to a full stop in front of this little billboard.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nAnd I actually went to see some of the design companies\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nin Hong Kong in my stay there.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nAnd it turned out that --\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nI just went to see, you know, what they are doing in Hong Kong.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nBut I actually walked away with a great job offer.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nAnd I flew back to Austria, packed my bags,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nand, another week later, I was again on my way to Hong Kong\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nstill superstitions and thinking, \"Well, if that 'Winner' billboard is still up,\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nI'm going to have a good time working here.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nBut if it's gone, it's going to be really miserable and stressful.\"\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nSo it turned out that not only was the billboard still up\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nbut they had put this one right next to it.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nOn the other hand, it also taught me where superstition gets me\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nbecause I really had a terrible time in Hong Kong.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nHowever, I did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life --\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nof, you know, I think what the conference brochure refers to\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nas \"moments that take your breath away.\"\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nAnd since I'm a big list maker, I actually listed them all.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nNow, you don't have to go through the trouble of reading them\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nand I won't read them for you.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nI know that it's incredibly boring to hear about other people's happinesses.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nWhat I did do, though is, I actually looked at them from a design standpoint\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nand just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nAnd, very surprisingly, over half of them had, actually, something to do with design.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nSo there are, of course, two different possibilities.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nThere's one from a consumer's point of view --\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nwhere I was happy while experiencing design.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nAnd I'll just give you one example. I had gotten my first Walkman.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nThis is 1983.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nMy brother had this great Yamaha motorcycle\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nthat he was willing to borrow to me freely.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nAnd The Police's \"Synchronicity\"\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\ncassette had just been released\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nand there was no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nSo you could drive up into the mountains\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nfreely blasting The Police on the new Sony Walkman.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nAnd I remember it as a true moment of happiness.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nYou

somewhere here -- right in there between Delight and Bliss.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nNow, there is the other part, from a designer's standpoint --\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nif you're happy while actually doing it.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nAnd one way to see how happy designers are when they're designing could be to\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nlook at the authors' photos on the back of their monographs?\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:18.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nSo, according to this, the Australians and the Japanese\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nas well as the Mexicans\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nare very happy.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:27.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nWhile, somewhat, the Spaniards ...\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nand, I think, particularly, the Swiss\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\n(Laughter),\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\ndon't seem to be doing all that well.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:45.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nLast November, a museum opened in Tokyo called The Mori Museum,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nin a skyscraper,

00:09:26.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nAnd also gave this fake letter from the MTA to everybody --\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nsort of like pretending that it's an art project\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nfinanced by The Metropolitan Transit Authority.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nAnother New York project.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nThis is at P.S. 1 -- a sculpture that's basically a square room\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nby James Turrell, that has a retractable ceiling.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nOpens up at dusk and dawn every day.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nYou don't see the horizon.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nYou're just in there, watching the incredible, subtle changes of color in the sky.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nAnd the room is truly something to be seen.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nPeople's demeanor changes when they go in there.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nAnd, for sure, I haven't looked at the sky in the same way\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nafter spending an hour in there.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nThere are, of course, more than those three projects that I'm showing here.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nI would definitely say that observing Vik Muniz' \"Cloud\"\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:29.958\na couple of years ago in Manhattan for sure made me happy, as well.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nBut my last project is, again, from a young designer in New York.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nHe's from Korea originally.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nAnd he took it upon himself to print 55,000 speech bubbles --\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nempty speech bubbles stickers, large ones and small ones.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nAnd he goes around New York and just puts them, empty as they are, on posters.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nAnd other people go and fill them in.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nThis one says, \"Please let me die in peace.\"\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nI think that was --\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nthe most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nThis is on a musician poster, that says:\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:23.958\n\"I am concerned that my CD will not sell more than 200,000 units\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nand that, as a result, my recoupable advance\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nfrom my label will be taken from me,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nafter which, my contract will be cancelled,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nand I'll be back doing Journey covers on Bleecker Street.\"\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nI think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nJee gets to have his project;\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nthe public gets a sweeter environment;\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand different public gets a place to express itself;\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nand the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:19.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nWell, there was a question, of course, that was on my mind for a while:\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nYou know, can I do more of the things that I like doing in design\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nand less of the ones that I don't like to be doing?\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nWhich brought me back to my list making --\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nyou know, just to see what I actually like about my job.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nYou know, one is: just working without pressure.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nThen: working concentrated, without being frazzled.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nOr, as Nancy said before, like really immerse oneself into it.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nTry not to get stuck doing the same thing --\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nor try not get stuck behind the computer all day.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nThis is, you know, related to it: getting out of the studio.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nThen, of course, trying to, you know, work on things\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nwhere the content is actually important for me.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nAnd being able to enjoy the end results.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nAnd then I found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nall the things that I thought I learned in my life so far.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nAnd, just about at that time, an Austrian magazine called and asked\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nif we would want to do six spreads -- design six spreads\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nthat work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine?\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nAnd the whole thing just fell together.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nSo I just picked one of the things that I thought I learned --\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nin this case, \"Everything I do always comes back to me\" --\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nand we made these spreads right out of this.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nSo it was: \"Everything\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nI do\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nalways\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:05.958\ncomes\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nback\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nto me.\"\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nA couple of weeks ago, a\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nFrench company asked us to design five billboards for them.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nAgain, we could supply the content for it.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nSo I just picked another one.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nAnd this was two weeks ago.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nWe flew to Arizona -- the designer who works with me, and myself --\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nand photographed this one.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nSo it's: \"Trying\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nto look\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\ngood\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nlimits\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nmy life.\"\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nAnd then we did one more of these.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nThis is, again, for a magazine, dividing pages.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nThis is: \"Having\" --\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nthis is the same thing;\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nit's just, you know, photographed from the side.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nThis is from the front.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nThen it's: \"guts.\"\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nAgain, it's the same thing -- \"guts\" is just the same room, reworked.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nThen it's: \"always\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nworks out.\"\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nThen it's \"for,\" with the light on.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nAnd it's \"me.\"\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nThank you so much.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:24.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The route to a sustainable future", "duration": "1054", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/alex_steffen_sees_a_sustainable_future", "transcript": "When I'm starting talks like this, I usually do a whole spiel about sustainability because a lot of people out there don't know what that is. This is a crowd that does know what it is, so I'll like just do like the 60-second crib-note version. Right? So just bear with me. We'll go real fast, you know? Fill in the blanks. So, you know, sustainability, small planet. Right? Picture a little Earth, circling around the sun. You know, about a million years ago, a bunch of monkeys fell out of trees, got a little clever, harnessed fire, invented the printing press, made, you know, luggage with wheels on it. And, you know, built the society that we now live in. Unfortunately, while this society is, without a doubt, the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created, it's got some major, major flaws.One of them is that every society has an ecological footprint. It has an amount of impact on the planet that's measurable. How much stuff goes through your life, how much waste is left behind you. And we, at the moment, in our society, have a really dramatically unsustainable level of this. We're using up about five planets. If everybody on the planet lived the way we did, we'd need between five, six, seven, some people even say 10 planets to make it. Clearly we don't have 10 planets. Again, you know, mental, visual, 10 planets, one planet, 10 planets, one planet. Right? We don't have that. So that's one problem.The second problem is that the planet that we have is being used in wildly unfair ways. Right? North Americans, such as myself, you know, we're basically sort of wallowing, gluttonous hogs, and we're eating all sorts of stuff. And, you know, then you get all the way down to people who live in the Asia-Pacific region, or even more, Africa. And people simply do not have enough to survive. This is producing all sorts of tensions, all sorts of dynamics that are deeply disturbing. And there's more and more people on the way. Right? So, this is what the planet's going to look like in 20 years. It's going to be a pretty crowded place, at least eight billion people.So to make matters even more difficult, it's a very young planet. A third of the people on this planet are kids. And those kids are growing up in a completely different way than their parents did, no matter where they live. They've been exposed to this idea of our society, of our prosperity. And they may not want to live exactly like us. They may not want to be Americans, or Brits, or Germans, or South Africans, but they want their own version of a life which is more prosperous, and more dynamic, and more, you know, enjoyable. And all of these things combine to create an enormous amount of torque on the planet. And if we cannot figure out a way to deal with that torque, we are going to find ourselves more and more and more quickly facing situations which are simply unthinkable.Everybody in this room has heard the worst-case scenarios. I don't need to go into that. But I will ask the question, what's the alternative? And I would say that, at the moment, the alternative is unimaginable. You know, so on the one hand we have the unthinkable; on the other hand we have the unimaginable. We don't know yet how to build a society which is environmentally sustainable, which is shareable with everybody on the planet, which promotes stability and democracy and human rights, and which is achievable in the time-frame necessary to make it through the challenges we face. We don't know how to do this yet.So what's Worldchanging? Well, Worldchanging you might think of as being a bit of a news service for the unimaginable future. You know, what we're out there doing is looking for examples of tools, models and ideas, which, if widely adopted, would change the game. A lot of times, when I do a talk like this, I talk about things that everybody in this room I'm sure has already heard of, but most people haven't. So I thought today I'd do something a little different, and talk about what we're looking for, rather than saying, you know, rather than giving you tried-and-true examples. Talk about the kinds of things we're scoping out. Give you a little peek into our editorial notebook. And given that I have 13 minutes to do this, this is going to go kind of quick. So, I don't know, just stick with me. Right?So, first of all, what are we looking for? Bright Green city. One of the biggest levers that we have in the developed world for changing the impact that we have on the planet is changing the way that we live in cities. We're already an urban planet; that's especially true in the developed world. And people who live in cities in the developed world tend to be very prosperous, and thus use a lot of stuff. If we can change the dynamic, by first of all creating cities that are denser and more livable ... Here, for example, is Vancouver, which if you haven't been there, you ought to go for a visit. It's a fabulous city. And they are doing density, new density, better than probably anybody else on the planet right now. They're actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars, which is a pretty great thing. So you have density. You also have growth management. You leave aside what is natural to be natural.This is in Portland. That is an actual development. That land there will remain pasture in perpetuity. They've bounded the city with a line. Nature, city. Nothing changes. Once you do those things, you can start making all sorts of investments. You can start doing things like, you know, transit systems that actually work to transport people, in effective and reasonably comfortable manners. You can also start to change what you build. This is the Beddington Zero Energy Development in London, which is one of the greenest buildings in the world. It's a fabulous place. We're able to now build buildings that generate all their own electricity, that recycle much of their water, that are much more comfortable than standard buildings, use all-natural light, etc., and, over time, cost less. Green roofs. Bill McDonough covered that last night, so I won't dwell on that too much.But once you also have people living in close proximity to each other, one of the things you can do is \u2014 as information technologies develop \u2014 you can start to have smart places. You can start to know where things are. When you know where things are, it becomes easier to share them. When you share them, you end up using less. So one great example is car-share clubs, which are really starting to take off in the U.S., have already taken off in many places in Europe, and are a great example. If you're somebody who drives, you know, one day a week, do you really need your own car?Another thing that information technology lets us do is start figuring out how to use less stuff by knowing, and by monitoring, the amount we're actually using. So, here's a power cord which glows brighter the more energy that you use, which I think is a pretty cool concept, although I think it ought to work the other way around, that it gets brighter the more you don't use. But, you know, there may even be a simpler approach. We could just re-label things. This light switch that reads, on the one hand, flashfloods, and on the other hand, off. How we build things can change as well. This is a bio-morphic building. It takes its inspiration in form from life. Many of these buildings are incredibly beautiful, and also much more effective. This is an example of bio-mimicry, which is something we're really starting to look a lot more for. In this case, you have a shell design which was used to create a new kind of exhaust fan, which is greatly more effective. There's a lot of this stuff happening; it's really pretty remarkable. I encourage you to look on Worldchanging if you're into it. We're starting to cover this more and more. There's also neo-biological design, where more and more we're actually using life itself and the processes of life to become part of our industry. So this, for example, is hydrogen-generating algae. So we have a model in potential, an emerging model that we're looking for of how to take the cities most of us live in, and turn them into Bright Green cities.But unfortunately, most of the people on the planet don't live in the cites we live in. They live in the emerging megacities of the developing world. And there's a statistic I often like to use, which is that we're adding a city of Seattle every four days, a city the size of Seattle to the planet every four days. I was giving a talk about two months ago, and this guy, who'd done some work with the U.N., came up to me and was really flustered, and he said, look, you've got that totally wrong; it's totally wrong. It's every seven days. So, we're adding a city the size of Seattle every seven days, and most of those cities look more like this than the city that you or I live in. Most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly. They don't have existing infrastructure; they have enormous numbers of people who are struggling with poverty, and enormous numbers of people are trying to figure out how to do things in new ways.So what do we need in order to make developing nation megacities into Bright Green megacities? Well, the first thing we need is, we need leapfrogging. And this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere. The idea behind leapfrogging is that if you are a person, or a country, who is stuck in a situation where you don't have the tools and technologies that you need, there's no reason for you to invest in last generation's technologies. Right? That you're much better off, almost universally, looking for a low-cost or locally applicable version of the newest technology. One place we're all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones. Right? All throughout the developing world, people are going directly to cell phones, skipping the whole landline stage. If there are landlines in many developing world cities, they're usually pretty crappy systems that break down a lot and cost enormous amounts of money. So I rather like this picture here. I particularly like the Ganesh in the background, talking on the cell phone. So what we have, increasingly, is cell phones just permeating out through society. We've heard all about this here this week, so I won't say too much more than that, other than to say what is true for cell phones is true for all sorts of technologies.The second thing is tools for collaboration, be they systems of collaboration, or intellectual property systems which encourage collaboration. Right? When you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate, you get different kinds of solutions. And those solutions are accessible in a different way to people who don't have capital. Right? So, you know, we have open source software, we have Creative Commons and other kinds of Copyleft solutions. And those things lead to things like this. This is a Telecentro in Sao Paulo. This is a pretty remarkable program using free and open source software, cheap, sort of hacked-together machines, and basically sort of abandoned buildings \u2014 has put together a bunch of community centers where people can come in, get high-speed internet access, learn computer programming skills for free. And a quarter-million people every year use these now in Sao Paulo. And those quarter-million people are some of the poorest people in Sao Paolo. I particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back. (Laughter)So one of the things that that's leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion. And one of the things we're really, really interested in at Worldchanging is the ways in which the south is re-identifying itself, and re-categorizing itself in ways that have less and less to do with most of us in this room. So it's not, you know, Bollywood isn't just answering Hollywood. Right? You know, Brazilian music scene isn't just answering the major labels. It's doing something new. There's new things happening. There's interplay between them. And, you know, you get amazing things. Like, I don't know if any of you have seen the movie \"City of God?\" Yeah, it's a fabulous movie if you haven't seen it. And it's all about this question, in a very artistic and indirect kind of way.You have other radical examples where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out. These are people who have just been visited by the Internet bookmobile in Uganda. And who are waving their first books in the air, which, I just think that's a pretty cool picture. You know? So you also have the ability for people to start coming together and acting on their own behalf in political and civic ways, in ways that haven't happened before. And as we heard last night, as we've heard earlier this week, are absolutely, fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solutions, is we've got to craft new political realities.And I would personally say that we have to craft new political realities, not only in places like India, Afghanistan, Kenya, Pakistan, what have you, but here at home as well. Another world is possible. And sort of the big motto of the anti-globalization movement. Right? We tweak that a lot. We talk about how another world isn't just possible; another world's here. That it's not just that we have to sort of imagine there being a different, vague possibility out there, but we need to start acting a little bit more on that possibility. We need to start doing things like Lula, President of Brazil. How many people knew of Lula before today? OK, so, much, much better than the average crowd, I can tell you that. So Lula, he's full of problems, full of contradictions, but one of the things that he's doing is, he is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations that completely shifts the balance from the standard sort of north-south dialogue into a whole new way of global collaboration. I would keep your eye on this fellow.Another example of this sort of second superpower thing is the rise of these games that are what we call \"serious play.\" We're looking a lot at this. This is spreading everywhere. This is from \"A Force More Powerful.\" It's a little screenshot. \"A Force More Powerful\" is a video game that, while you're playing it, it teaches you how to engage in non-violent insurrection and regime change. (Laughter) Here's another one. This is from a game called \"Food Force,\" which is a game that teaches children how to run a refugee camp. These things are all contributing in a very dynamic way to a huge rise in, especially in the developing world, in people's interest in and passion for democracy. We get so little news about the developing world that we often forget that there are literally millions of people out there struggling to change things to be fairer, freer, more democratic, less corrupt. And, you know, we don't hear those stories enough. But it's happening all over the place, and these tools are part of what's making it possible.Now when you add all those things together, when you add together leapfrogging and new kinds of tools, you know, second superpower stuff, etc., what do you get? Well, very quickly, you get a Bright Green future for the developing world. You get, for example, green power spread throughout the world. You get \u2014 this is a building in Hyderabad, India. It's the greenest building in the world. You get grassroots solutions, things that work for people who have no capital or limited access. You get barefoot solar engineers carrying solar panels into the remote mountains. You get access to distance medicine. These are Indian nurses learning how to use PDAs to access databases that have information that they don't have access to at home in a distant manner. You get new tools for people in the developing world. These are LED lights that help the roughly billion people out there, for whom nightfall means darkness, to have a new means of operating. These are refrigerators that require no electricity; they're pot within a pot design.And you get water solutions. Water's one of the most pressing problems. Here's a design for harvesting rainwater that's super cheap and available to people in the developing world. Here's a design for distilling water using sunlight. Here's a fog-catcher, which, if you live in a moist, jungle-like area, will distill water from the air that's clean and drinkable. Here's a way of transporting water. I just love this, you know \u2014 I mean carrying water is such a drag, and somebody just came up with the idea of well, what if you rolled it. Right? I mean, that's a great design. This is a fabulous invention, LifeStraw. Basically you can suck any water through this and it will become drinkable by the time it hits your lips. So, you know, people who are in desperate straits can get this. This is one of my favorite Worldchanging kinds of things ever. This is a merry-go-round invented by the company Roundabout, which pumps water as kids play. You know? Seriously \u2014 give that one a hand, it's pretty great. And the same thing is true for people who are in absolute crisis. Right?We're expecting to have upwards of 200 million refugees by the year 2020 because of climate change and political instability. How do we help people like that? Well, there's all sorts of amazing new humanitarian designs that are being developed in collaborative ways all across the planet. Some of those designs include models for acting, such as new models for village instruction in the middle of refugee camps. New models for pedagogy for the displaced. And we have new tools. This is one of my absolute favorite things anywhere. Does anyone know what this is?Audience: It detects landmines.Alex Steffen: Exactly, this is a landmine-detecting flower. If you are living in one of the places where the roughly half-billion unaccounted for mines are scattered, you can fling these seeds out into the field. And as they grow up, they will grow up around the mines, their roots will detect the chemicals in them, and where the flowers turn red you don't step. Yeah, so seeds that could save your life. You know?(Applause)I also love it because it seems to me that the example, the tools we use to change the world, ought to be beautiful in themselves. You know, that it's not just enough to survive. We've got to make something better than what we've got. And I think that we will. Just to wrap up, in the immortal words of H.G. Wells, I think that better things are on the way. I think that, in fact, that \"all of the past is but the beginning of a beginning. All that the human mind has accomplished is but the dream before the awakening.\" I hope that that turns out to be true. The people in this room have given me more confidence than ever that it will.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 74, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nWhen I'm starting talks like this,\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nI usually do a whole spiel about sustainability\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nbecause a lot of people out there don't know what that is.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nThis is a crowd that does know what it is,\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nso I'll like just do like the 60-second crib-note version. Right?\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nSo just bear with me. We'll go real fast, you know?\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nFill in the blanks.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nSo, you know, sustainability, small planet.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nRight? Picture a little Earth, circling around the sun.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nYou know, about a million years ago,\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\na bunch of monkeys fell out of trees,\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\ngot a little clever, harnessed fire,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:38.958\ninvented the printing press,\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nmade, you know, luggage with wheels on it.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nAnd, you know, built the society that we now live in.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nUnfortunately, while this society is, without a doubt,\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nthe most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nit's got some major, major flaws.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nOne of them is that every society has an ecological footprint.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nIt has an amount of impact on the planet that's measurable.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nHow much stuff goes through your life,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nhow much waste is left behind you.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nAnd we, at the moment, in our society,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nhave a really dramatically unsustainable level of this.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nWe're using up about five planets.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nIf everybody on the planet lived the way we did,\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nwe'd need between five, six, seven,\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nsome people even say 10 planets to make it.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nClearly we don't have 10 planets.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nAgain, you know, mental, visual, 10 planets, one planet,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\n10 planets, one planet. Right?\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nWe don't have that. So that's one problem.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nThe second problem is that the planet that we have\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nis being used in wildly unfair ways. Right?\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nNorth Americans, such as myself, you know,\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nwe're basically sort of wallowing, gluttonous hogs,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nand we're eating all sorts of stuff.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nAnd, you know, then you get all the way down\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nto people who live in the Asia-Pacific region, or even more, Africa.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nAnd people simply do not have enough to survive.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nThis is producing all sorts of tensions,\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nall sorts of dynamics that are deeply disturbing.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nAnd there's more and more people on the way. Right?\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nSo, this is what the planet's going to look like in 20 years.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nIt's going to be a pretty crowded place, at least eight billion people.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nSo to make matters even more difficult, it's a very young planet.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nA third of the people on this planet are kids.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nAnd those kids are growing up in a completely different way\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nthan their parents did, no matter where they live.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nThey've been exposed to this idea of our society, of our prosperity.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nAnd they may not want to live exactly like us.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nThey may not want to be Americans, or Brits,\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nor Germans, or South Africans,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nbut they want their own version\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nof a life which is more prosperous, and more dynamic,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nand more, you know, enjoyable.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nAnd all of these things combine to create\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nan enormous amount of torque on the planet.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nAnd if we cannot figure out a way to deal with that torque,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nwe are going to find ourselves more and more and more quickly\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nfacing situations which are simply unthinkable.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nEverybody in this room has heard the worst-case scenarios.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nI don't need to go into that.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nBut I will ask the question, what's the alternative?\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nAnd I would say that, at the moment, the alternative is unimaginable.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nYou know, so on the one hand we have the unthinkable;\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\non the other hand we have the unimaginable.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nWe don't know yet how to build a society\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nwhich is environmentally sustainable,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nwhich is shareable with everybody on the planet,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nwhich promotes stability and democracy and human rights,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nand which is achievable in the time-frame necessary\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nto make it through the challenges we face.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nWe don't know how to do this yet.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nSo what's Worldchanging?\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nWell, Worldchanging you might think of\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nas being a bit of a news service for the unimaginable future.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nYou know, what we're out there doing is looking\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nfor examples of tools, models and ideas,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nwhich, if widely adopted, would change the game.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nA lot of times, when I do a talk like this, I talk about things\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nthat everybody in this room I'm sure has already heard of,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nbut most people haven't.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nSo I thought today I'd do something a little different,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nand talk about what we're looking for, rather than saying, you know,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nrather than giving you tried-and-true examples.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nTalk about the kinds of things we're scoping out.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nGive you a little peek into our editorial notebook.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nAnd given that I have 13 minutes to do this, this is going to go kind of quick.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nSo, I don't know, just stick with me. Right?\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nSo, first of all, what are we looking for? Bright Green city.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nOne of the biggest levers that we have in the developed world\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nfor changing the impact that we have on the planet\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nis changing the way that we live in cities.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nWe're already an urban planet;\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nthat's especially true in the developed world.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd people who live in cities in the developed world\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\ntend to be very prosperous, and thus use a lot of stuff.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nIf we can change the dynamic,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nby first of all creating cities that are denser and more livable ...\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nHere, for example, is Vancouver, which if you haven't been there,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nyou ought to go for a visit. It's a fabulous city.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nAnd they are doing density, new density,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nbetter than probably anybody else on the planet right now.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nThey're actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nwhich is a pretty great thing.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nSo you have density. You also have growth management.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nYou leave aside what is natural to be natural.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nThis is in Portland. That is an actual development.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nThat land there will remain pasture in perpetuity.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nThey've bounded the city with a line.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nNature, city. Nothing changes.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nOnce you do those things, you can start making all sorts of investments.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nYou can start doing things like, you know,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\ntransit systems that actually work to transport people,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nin effective and reasonably comfortable manners.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nYou can also start to change what you build.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nThis is the Beddington Zero Energy Development in London,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nwhich is one of the greenest buildings in the world. It's a fabulous place.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nWe're able to now build buildings that generate all their own electricity,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nthat recycle much of their water,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nthat are much more comfortable than standard buildings,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nuse all-natural light, etc., and, over time, cost less.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nGreen roofs. Bill McDonough covered that last night, so I won't dwell on that too much.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nBut once you also have people living\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nin close proximity to each other,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\none of the things you can do is --\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nas information technologies develop --\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nyou can start to have smart places.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nYou can start to know where things are.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nWhen you know where things are, it becomes easier to share them.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nWhen you share them, you end up using less.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nSo one great example is car-share clubs,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nwhich are really starting to take off in the U.S.,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nhave already taken off in many places in Europe, and are a great example.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nIf you're somebody who drives, you know, one day a week,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\ndo you really need your own car?\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nAnother thing that information technology lets us do\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nis start figuring out how to use less stuff\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nby knowing, and by monitoring, the amount we're actually using.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nSo, here's a power cord which glows brighter the more energy that you use,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nwhich I think is a pretty cool concept,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nalthough I think it ought to work the other way around,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nthat it gets brighter the more you don't use.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nBut, you know, there may even be a simpler approach.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nWe could just re-label things.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nThis light switch that reads, on the one hand, flashfloods,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nand on the other hand, off.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nHow we build things can change as well.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nThis is a bio-morphic building.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nIt takes its inspiration in form from life.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nMany of these buildings are incredibly beautiful,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nand also much more effective.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nThis is an example of bio-mimicry,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nwhich is something we're really starting to look a lot more for.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nIn this case, you have a shell design\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nwhich was used to create a new kind of exhaust fan, which is greatly more effective.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nThere's a lot of this stuff happening; it's really pretty remarkable.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nI encourage you to look on Worldchanging if you're into it.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nWe're starting to cover this more and more.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nThere's also neo-biological design,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nwhere more and more we're actually using life itself\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nand the processes of life to become part of our industry.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nSo this, for example, is hydrogen-generating algae.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nSo we have a model in potential, an emerging model that we're looking for\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nof how to take the cities most of us live in,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nand turn them into Bright Green cities.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nBut unfortunately, most of the people on the planet don't live in the cites we live in.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nThey live in the emerging megacities of the developing world.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nAnd there's a statistic I often like to use,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nwhich is that we're adding a city of Seattle every four days,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\na city the size of Seattle to the planet every four days.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nI was giving a talk about two months ago,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nand this guy, who'd done some work with the U.N., came up to me\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nand was really flustered, and he said, look,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nyou've got that totally wrong; it's totally wrong.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nIt's every seven days.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nSo, we're adding a city the size of Seattle every seven days,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nand most of those cities look more like this than the city that you or I live in.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nMost of those cites are growing incredibly quickly.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nThey don't have existing infrastructure;\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nthey have enormous numbers of people who are struggling with poverty,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nand enormous numbers of people are trying to figure out\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nhow to do things in new ways.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nSo what do we need in order to make developing nation\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nmegacities into Bright Green megacities?\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nWell, the first thing we need is, we need leapfrogging.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nAnd this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nThe idea behind leapfrogging is that\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nif you are a person, or a country, who is stuck in a situation\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nwhere you don't have the tools and technologies that you need,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nthere's no reason for you to invest in last generation's technologies. Right?\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nThat you're much better off, almost universally,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nlooking for a low-cost or locally applicable version of the newest technology.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nOne place we're all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones. Right?\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nAll throughout the developing world, people are going directly to cell phones,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nskipping the whole landline stage.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nIf there are landlines in many developing world cities,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nthey're usually pretty crappy systems that break down a lot\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nand cost enormous amounts of money.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nSo I rather like this picture here.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nI particularly like the Ganesh in the background, talking on the cell phone.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nSo what we have, increasingly, is cell phones just permeating out through society.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nWe've heard all about this here this week,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nso I won't say too much more than that, other than to say\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nwhat is true for cell phones is true for all sorts of technologies.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nThe second thing is tools for collaboration,\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nbe they systems of collaboration, or intellectual property systems\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nwhich encourage collaboration. Right?\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nWhen you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nyou get different kinds of solutions.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nAnd those solutions are accessible in a different way\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nto people who don't have capital. Right?\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nSo, you know, we have open source software,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nwe have Creative Commons and other kinds of Copyleft solutions.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nAnd those things lead to things like this.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nThis is a Telecentro in Sao Paulo.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nThis is a pretty remarkable program\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nusing free and open source software, cheap, sort of hacked-together machines,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nand basically sort of abandoned buildings --\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nhas put together a bunch of community centers\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nwhere people can come in, get high-speed internet access,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nlearn computer programming skills for free.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nAnd a quarter-million people every year use these now in Sao Paulo.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nAnd those quarter-million people are some of the poorest people in Sao Paolo.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nI particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back. (Laughter)\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nSo one of the things that that's leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nAnd one of the things we're really, really interested in at Worldchanging\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nis the ways in which the south is re-identifying itself,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nand re-categorizing itself in ways\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nthat have less and less to do with most of us in this room.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nSo it's not, you know, Bollywood isn't just answering Hollywood. Right?\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nYou know, Brazilian music scene isn't just answering the major labels.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nIt's doing something new. There's new things happening.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nThere's interplay between them. And, you know, you get amazing things.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nLike, I don't know if any of you have seen the movie \"City of God?\"\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nYeah, it's a fabulous movie if you haven't seen it.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nAnd it's all about this question, in a very artistic and indirect kind of way.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nYou have other radical examples\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nwhere the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nThese are people who have just been visited by\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nthe Internet bookmobile in Uganda.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nAnd who are waving their first books in the air,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nwhich, I just think that's a pretty cool picture. You know?\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nSo you also have the ability for people to start coming together\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nand acting on their own behalf in political and civic ways,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nin ways that haven't happened before.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nAnd as we heard last night, as we've heard earlier this week,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nare absolutely, fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solutions,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nis we've got to craft new political realities.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nAnd I would personally say that we have to craft new political realities,\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nnot only in places like India, Afghanistan, Kenya, Pakistan,\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nwhat have you, but here at home as well.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nAnother world is possible.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAnd sort of the big motto of the anti-globalization movement. Right?\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nWe tweak that a lot.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nWe talk about how another world isn't just possible; another world's here.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nThat it's not just that we have to sort of imagine\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nthere being a different, vague possibility out there,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nbut we need to start acting a little bit more on that possibility.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nWe need to start doing things like Lula, President of Brazil.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nHow many people knew of Lula before today?\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nOK, so, much, much better than the average crowd, I can tell you that.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nSo Lula, he's full of problems, full of contradictions,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nbut one of the things that he's doing is,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nhe is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations that\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:43.958\ncompletely shifts the balance from the standard sort of north-south dialogue\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:47.958\ninto a whole new way of global collaboration.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nI would keep your eye on this fellow.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nAnother example of this sort of second superpower thing\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nis the rise of these games that are what we call \"serious play.\"\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nWe're looking a lot at this. This is spreading everywhere.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nThis is from \"A Force More Powerful.\" It's a little screenshot.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\n\"A Force More Powerful\" is a video game that,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nwhile you're playing it, it teaches you how to engage\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nin non-violent insurrection and regime change. (Laughter)\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nHere's another one. This is from a game called \"Food Force,\"\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nwhich is a game that teaches children how to run a refugee camp.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nThese things are all contributing in a very dynamic way\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nto a huge rise in, especially in the developing world,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nin people's interest in and passion for democracy.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nWe get so little news about the developing world\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nthat we often forget that there are literally\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nmillions of people out there struggling to change things\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nto be fairer, freer, more democratic, less corrupt.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nAnd, you know, we don't hear those stories enough.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nBut it's happening all over the place,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nand these tools are part of what's making it possible.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nNow when you add all those things together,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nwhen you add together leapfrogging and new kinds of tools,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nyou know, second superpower stuff, etc., what do you get?\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nWell, very quickly, you get a Bright Green future for the developing world.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nYou get, for example, green power spread throughout the world.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nYou get -- this is a building in Hyderabad, India.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nIt's the greenest building in the world.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nYou get grassroots solutions, things that work\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nfor people who have no capital or limited access.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nYou get barefoot solar engineers carrying solar panels into the remote mountains.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nYou get access to distance medicine.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nThese are Indian nurses learning how to use PDAs\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nto access databases that have information\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nthat they don't have access to at home in a distant manner.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nYou get new tools for people in the developing world.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nThese are LED lights that help the roughly billion people out there,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nfor whom nightfall means darkness,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nto have a new means of operating.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nThese are refrigerators that require no electricity;\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nthey're pot within a pot design.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nAnd you get water solutions. Water's one of the most pressing problems.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nHere's a design for harvesting rainwater that's super cheap\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nand available to people in the developing world.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nHere's a design for distilling water using sunlight.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nHere's a fog-catcher, which, if you live in a moist, jungle-like area,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nwill distill water from the air that's clean and drinkable.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nHere's a way of transporting water.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nI just love this, you know -- I mean carrying water is such a drag,\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nand somebody just came up with the idea of well, what if you rolled it. Right?\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nI mean, that's a great design.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nThis is a fabulous invention, LifeStraw.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nBasically you can suck any water through this\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nand it will become drinkable by the time it hits your lips.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nSo, you know, people who are in desperate straits can get this.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nThis is one of my favorite Worldchanging kinds of things ever.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nThis is a merry-go-round invented by the company Roundabout,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nwhich pumps water as kids play. You know?\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nSeriously -- give that one a hand, it's pretty great.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nAnd the same thing is true for people who are in absolute crisis. Right?\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nWe're expecting to have upwards of 200 million refugees by the year 2020\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nbecause of climate change and political instability.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nHow do we help people like that?\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nWell, there's all sorts of amazing new humanitarian designs\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nthat are being developed in collaborative ways all across the planet.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nSome of those designs include models for acting,\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nsuch as new models for village instruction in the middle of refugee camps.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nNew models for pedagogy for the displaced.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nAnd we have new tools.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nThis is one of my absolute favorite things anywhere.\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nDoes anyone know what this is?\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nAudience: It detects landmines.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nAlex Steffen: Exactly, this is a landmine-detecting flower.\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nIf you are living in one of the places\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nwhere the roughly half-billion unaccounted for mines are scattered,\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nyou can fling these seeds out into the field.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nAnd as they grow up, they will grow up around the mines,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:29.958\ntheir roots will detect the chemicals in them,\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nand where the flowers turn red you don't step.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nYeah, so seeds that could save your life. You know?\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:39.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nI also love it because it seems to me\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nthat the example, the tools we use to change the world,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nought to be beautiful in themselves.\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nYou know, that it's not just enough to survive.\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nWe've got to make something better than what we've got.\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nAnd I think that we will.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nJust to wrap up, in the immortal words of H.G.

Audience Member: Howard. Howard.Thom Mayne: Howard? I'm sitting next to Howard. I don't know Howard, obviously, and he's going, I hope you're not next.(Laughter)Amazing. Amazing performance. I kind of erased everything in my brain to follow that. Let me start some place. I'm interested \u2014 I kind of do the same thing, but I don't move my body. (Laughter) And instead of using human figures to develop ideas of time and space, I work in the mineral world. I work with more or less inert matter. And I organize it. And, well, it's also a bit different because an architect versus, let's say, a dance company finally is a negotiation between one's private world, one's conceptual world, the world of ideas, the world of aspirations, of inventions, with the relationship of the exterior world and all the limitations, the naysayers. Because I have to say, for my whole career, if there's anything that's been consistent, it's been that you can't do it. No matter what I've done, what I've tried to do, everybody says it can't be done. And it's continuous across the complete spectrum of the various kind of realities that you confront with your ideas.And to be an architect, somehow you have to negotiate between left and right, and you have to negotiate between this very private place where ideas take place and the outside world, and then make it understood. I can start any number of places, because this process is also \u2014 I think \u2014 very different from some of the morning sessions, which you had such a kind of very clear, such a lineal idea, like the last one, say, with Howard, that I think the creative process in architecture, the design process, is extremely circuitous. It's labyrinthine. It's Calvino's idea of the quickest way between two points is the circuitous line, not the straight line. And definitely my life has been part of that. I'm going to start with some simple kind of notions of how we organize things.But basically, what we do is, we try to give coherence to the world. We make physical things, buildings that become a part in an accretional process; they make cities. And those things are the reflection of the processes, and the time that they are made. And what I'm doing is attempting to synthesize the way one sees the world and the territories which are useful as generative material. Because, really, all I'm interested in, always, as an architect, is the way things are produced because that's what I do. Right? And it's not based on an a priori notion. I have no interest at all in conceiving something in my brain and saying, \"This is what it looks like.\" In fact, somebody mentioned \u2014 Ewan, maybe it was you in your introduction \u2014 about this is what architects \u2014 did somebody say it's what business people come to, it's what the corporate world comes to when they want to make it look like something at the end of the line? Huh. Wow. It doesn't work that way for me at all. I have no interest in that whatsoever.Architecture is the beginning of something, because it's \u2014 if you're not involved in first principles, if you're not involved in the absolute, the beginning of that generative process, it's cake decoration. And I've nothing wrong with cake decoration and cake decorators, if anybody's involved in cake decorations \u2014 it's not what I'm interested in doing. (Laughter) And so, in the formation of things, in giving it form, in concretizing these things, it starts with some notion of how one organizes. And I've had for 30 years an interest in a series of complexities where a series of forces are brought to bear, and to understand the nature of the final result of that, representing the building itself. There's been a continual relationship between inventions, which are private, and reality, which has been important to me.A project which is part of an exhibition in Copenhagen 10 years ago, which was the modeling of a hippocampus \u2014 the territory of the brain that records short-term memory \u2014 and the documentation of that, the imaginative and documentation of that through a series of drawings which literally attempt to organize that experience. And it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer, observing every kilometer a particular object of desire, and then placing that within this. And the notion was that I could make an organization not built on normal coherencies, but built on non-sequiturs, built on randomness. And I'd been extremely interested in this notion of randomness as it produces architectural work and as it definitely connects to the notion of the city, an accretional notion of the city, and that led to various ideas of organization. And then this led to broader ideas of buildings that come together through the multiplicity of systems.And it's not any single system that makes the work. It's the relationship \u2014 it's the dynamics between the systems \u2014 which have the power to transform and invent and produce an architecture that is \u2014 that would otherwise not exist. And those systems could be identified, and they could be grouped together. And of course, today, with the technology of the computer and with the rapid prototyping, etc., we have the mechanisms to understand and to respond to these systems, and to allow them to adjust to the various accommodations of functionalities because that's all we do. We're producing spaces that accommodate human activity. And what I'm interested in is not the styling of that, but the relationship of that as it enhances that activity. And that directly connects to ideas of city-making.This is a project that we just finished in Penang for a very, very large city project that came directly out of this process, which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it. And the project \u2014 again, enormous, enormous competition \u2014 on the Hudson River and in New York that we were asked to do three years ago, which uses these processes. And what you're looking at are possibilities that have to do with the generation of the city as one applies a methodology that uses notions of these multiple forces, that deals with the enormity of the problem, the complexity of the problem, when we're designing cities at larger and larger aggregates. Because one of the issues today is that the economic aggregate is driving the development aggregate, and as the aggregates get larger we require more and more complex investigation processes to solve these problems. And that led us directly to the Olympic Village.I was in New York on Monday presenting it to the IOC. We won the competition \u2014 what was it, nine months ago? Again, a direct reflection from using these processes to develop extremely complicated, very large-scale organisms. And then, also, was working with broad strategies. In this case, we only used 15 of the 60 acres of land, and the 45 acres was a park and would become the legacy of the Olympic Village. And it would become the second largest park in the boroughs, etc. Its position, of course, in the middle of Manhattan \u2014 it's on Hunter's Point. And then the broader ideas of city-making start having direct influences on architecture, on the elements that make up the broader scheme, the buildings themselves, and start guiding us. Architecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces that could come from literally any place. And so I can start this discussion in any number of places, and I've chosen three or four to talk about. And it has also to do with an interest in the vast kind of territory that architecture touches. It literally is connected to anything in terms of knowledge base. There's just no place that it doesn't somehow have a connective tissue to.This is Jim Dine, and it's the absence of presence, etc. It's the clothing, the skin, without the presence of the character. It became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work, and it was used in a project where we could unravel that surface, and it was a figurative idea that was going to be folded and made into a very, kind of complex space. And the idea was the relationship of the space, which was made up of the fold of the image, and the dialectic or the conflict between the figuration, and the clarity of the image and the complexity of the space, which were in dialog. And it made us rethink the whole notion of how we work and how we make things, and it led us to ideas that were closer to fashion design as we flattened out surfaces, and then brought them back together as they could make spatial combinations. And this was the first prototype in Korea, as we're dealing with a dynamic envelope, and then the same characteristic of the fabric. It has a material identity and it's translucent and it's porous, and it allows us for a very different notion of what a skin of a building is. And that turned right away into another project.This is the Caltrans building in Los Angeles. And now we're seeing as the skin and the body is differentiated. Again, it's a very, very simple notion. If you look at most buildings, what you look at is the building, the facade, and it is the building. And all of a sudden we're kind of moving away, and we're separating the skin from the body, and that's going to lead to broader performance criteria, which I'm going to talk about in a minute. And you're looking at how it drapes over and differentiates from the body. And then, again, the building itself, middle of Los Angeles, right across from City Hall. And as it moves, it takes pieces of the earth with it. It bends up. It's part of a sign system, which was part of the kind of legacy of Los Angeles \u2014 the two-dimension, three-dimension signing, etc. And then it allows one to penetrate the work itself. It's transparent, and it allows you to understand, I think, what is always the most interesting thing in any building, which is the actual constructional processes that make it.And it's probably the most intense kind of territory of the work, which is not occupied, because architecture is always the most interesting in some mechanism when it's separated from function, and this is an area that allows for that. And then the skin starts transforming into other materials. We're using light as a building material in this case. We're working with Keith Sonnier in New York, and we're making this large outside room, which is possible in Los Angeles, and which is very much reflective of the urban, the contemporary urban environments that you would find in Shibuya or you'd find in Mexico City or Sao Paulo, etc., that have to do with activating the city over a longer span of time. And that was very much part of the notion of the urban objective of this project in Los Angeles.And, again, all of it promoting transparency. And an image which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium, that light becomes literally a building material. Well, that immediately turned into something much broader, and as a scope. And again, we're looking at an early sketch where I'm understanding now that the skin can be a transition between the ground and the tower. This is a building in San Francisco which is under construction. And now it turned into something much, much broader as a problem, and it has to do with performance. This will be the first building in the United States that took \u2014 well, I can't say it took the air conditioning out. It's a hybrid. I wanted a pure thing, and I can't get it. It's a wrong attitude, actually, because the hybrid is probably more interesting.But we took the air conditioning out of the tower. There's some air conditioning left in the base, but the skin now moves on hydraulics. It forces air through a Venturi force if there's no wind. It adjusts continually. And we removed the air conditioning. Huge, huge thing. Half a million dollars a year delta. 10 of these \u2014 it's just under a million square feet \u2014 800 and some thousand square feet \u2014 10 of these would power Sausalito \u2014 the delta on this. And so now what we're looking at, as the projects get larger in scale, as they interface with broader problems, that they expand the capabilities in terms of their performance. Well, I could also start here. We could talk about the relationship at a more biological sense of the relationship of building and ground.Well, our research \u2014 my generation for sure, people who were going to school in the late '60s \u2014 made very much a shift out of the internal focus of architecture, looking at architecture within its own territory, and we were much more affected by film, by what was going on in the art world, etc. This is, of course, Michael Heizer. And when I saw this, first an image and then visited, it completely changed the way I thought after that point. And I understood that building really could be the augmentation of the Earth's surface, and it completely shifted the notion of building ground in the most basic sense. And then \u2014 well, he was probably looking at this \u2014 this is Nazca; this is 700 years ago \u2014 the most amazing four-kilometer land sculptures. They're just totally incredible. And that led us to then completely rethinking how we draw, how we work.This is the first sketch of a high school in Pomona \u2014 well, whatever it is, a model, a conceptual, kind of idea. And it's the reshaping of the Earth to make it occupiable. So it puts 200,000 square feet of stuff that make a high school work in the surface of that Earth. There it is modeled as it was developing into a piece of work. And there it is, again, as it's starting to get resolved tectonically, and then there's the school. And, of course, we're interested in participating with education. I have absolutely no interest in producing a building that just accommodates X, Y and Z function. What I'm interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people. It demands some sort of notion of inquiry because it's a system that's developed not sculpturally.It's an idea that started from my first discussion. It has to do with a broad, consistent logic, and that logic could be understood as one occupies the building. And there's an overt \u2014 at least, there's an attempt to make a very overt notion of a building that connects to the land in a very different way because I was interested in a very didactic approach to the problem, as one would understand that. And the second project that was just finished in Los Angeles that uses some of the same ideas. It uses landscape as a major idea. Then, again, we're doing the headquarters for NOAA \u2014 National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency \u2014 outside of Washington in Maryland. And this is how they see the world. They have 22 satellites zipping around at plus or minus 100 miles, and the site's in red.And what we really want to do \u2014 well, the architects, if there are architects out there, this is the Laugier Hut; this is the primitive hut that's been around for so long \u2014 and what we wanted to do is really build this, because they see themselves as the caretakers of the world, and we wanted them to look down at their satellite, how they see their own site, that eight-acre site, and we wanted nothing left. We wanted it to stay green. There's actually three baseball fields on it right now, and they're going to stay there. We put one piece directly north-south, and it holds the dishes at the ears, right? And then right below that the processing, and the mission lift, and the mission control room, and all the other spaces are underground. And what you look at is an aircraft carrier that's performance-driven by the cone vision of these satellite dishes. And that the building itself is occupied in the lower portion, broken up by a series of courts, and it's five acres of uninterrupted, horizontal space for their administrative offices. And then that, in turn, propelled us to look at larger-scale projects where this notion of landscape building interface becomes a connective tissue.The new capital competition for Berlin, four years ago. And again we just finished the ECB \u2014 actually Coop Himmelblau in Vienna just won this project, where the building was separated into a series of landscape elements that became part of a connective tissue of a park, which is parallel to the river, and develops ideas of the buildings themselves and becomes part of the connective fabric \u2014 the social, cultural and the landscape, recreational fabric of the city. And the building is no longer seen as an autonomous thing, but something that's only inextricably connected to this city and this place at this time.And a project that was realized in Austria, the Hooper Bank, which again used this idea of connecting typology, the traditional buildings, and morphology, or the relationship of the development of land as an idea, into a complex, which is a piece of a city where we can see part of it is literally just this augmenting, this movement of the land that's a very simple idea of just lifting it up and occupying it, and other parts are much more energetic and intense. And talk about that intensity in terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make that have to do with putting a series of systems together, and then where part of it is in the ground, part of it is oppositional lifts. One enters the building as it lifts off the ground, and it becomes part of the idea. And then the skin \u2014 the edges of this \u2014 all promote the dynamic, the movement of the building as a series of seismic shifts, geologic shifts. Right?And it makes for event space and then it breaks in places that allow you to peer into the interior, and those interiors, again, are promoting transparency for the workplace, which has been a continual interest of ours. And then, again, in a more, kind of traditional setting, this is a graduate student housing in Toronto, and it's very much about the relationship of a building as it makes a connective tissue to the city. The main idea was the gateway, where it breaks the site, and the building occupies both the public space and the private space. And it's that territory of \u2014 it's this thing. I visited the site many times, and everybody, kind of \u2014 you can see this from two kilometers away; it's an exact center of the street, and the whole notion is to engage the public, to engage buildings as part of the public tissue of the city.And finally, one of the most interesting projects \u2014 it's a courthouse. And what I want to talk about \u2014 this is the Supreme Court, of course \u2014 and, well, I'm dealing with Michael Hogan, the Chief Justice of Oregon. You could not proceed without making this negotiation between one's own values and the relationship of the character you're working with and how he understands the court, because I'm showing him, of course, Corbusier at Savoy, which is 1928, which is the beginning of modern architecture. Well, then we get to this image. And this is where the project started. Because I'm going, I'm interested in the phenomenon that's taking place in here. And really what we're talking about is constructing reality.And I'm a character that's extremely interested in understanding the nature of that constructed reality because there's no such thing as nature any more. Nature is gone. Nature in the 19th-century sense, alright? Nature is only a cultural edifice today, right? We construct it and we construct those ideas. And then of course, this one, our governor at the moment. And we spent some time with Conan, believe it or not, and then that led us to, kind of, the very differences of our worlds from a legal and an artistic, architectural. And it forced us to talk about notions of how we work, and the dynamics of that, and what other sources of the work is. And it led us to the project, the courthouse, which is absolutely a part of a negotiation between tradition and pieces of the traditional courthouse. You'll find a stair that's the same length as the Supreme Court. Here's a piano nobile, which is a device used in the Renaissance. The courts were made of that. The skin is this series of layers that reflect even rusticated stonework, but which were embedded with fragments of the Constitution, which were part of the little process, all set on a plinth that defined it from the community. Thank you so much.(Applause)", "id": 31, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nI don't know your name. Audience Member: Howard. Howard.\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nThom Mayne: Howard? I'm sitting next to Howard. I don't know Howard, obviously,\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nand he's going, I hope you're not next.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:28.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nAmazing. Amazing performance.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nI kind of erased everything in my brain to follow that.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nLet me start some place. I'm interested --\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nI kind of do the same thing, but I don't move my body. (Laughter)\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nAnd instead of using human figures to develop ideas of time and space,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nI work in the mineral world. I work with more or less inert matter.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nAnd I organize it. And, well, it's also a bit different\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nbecause an architect versus, let's say, a dance company\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nfinally is a negotiation between one's private world,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:17.958\none's conceptual world, the world of ideas, the world of aspirations,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nof inventions, with the relationship of the exterior world\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nand all the limitations, the naysayers.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nBecause I have to say, for my whole career,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nif there's anything that's been consistent, it's been that you can't do it.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nNo matter what I've done, what I've tried to do,\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\neverybody says it can't be done.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nAnd it's continuous across the complete spectrum of the various\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nkind of realities that you confront with your ideas.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nAnd to be an architect, somehow you have to negotiate between left and right,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nand you have to negotiate between this very private place where ideas take place\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nand the outside world, and then make it understood.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nI can start any number of places, because this process is also --\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nI think -- very different from some of the morning sessions,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nwhich you had such a kind of very clear, such a lineal idea,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nlike the last one, say, with Howard,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nthat I think the creative process in architecture,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nthe design process, is extremely circuitous. It's labyrinthine.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nIt's Calvino's idea of the quickest way between two points\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nis the circuitous line, not the straight line.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nAnd definitely my life has been part of that.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nI'm going to start with some simple kind of\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nnotions of how we organize things.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nBut basically, what we do is, we try to give coherence to the world.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nWe make physical things, buildings\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nthat become a part in an accretional process; they make cities.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nAnd those things are the reflection of the processes,\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nand the time that they are made.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nAnd what I'm doing is attempting to synthesize the way one sees the world\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nand the territories which are useful as generative material.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nBecause, really, all I'm interested in, always, as an architect,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nis the way things are produced because that's what I do. Right?\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nAnd it's not based on an a priori notion.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nI have no interest at all in conceiving something in my brain\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nand saying, \"This is what it looks like.\" In fact, somebody mentioned --\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nEwan, maybe it was you in your introduction --\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nabout this is what architects --\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\ndid somebody say it's what business people come to,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nit's what the corporate world comes to\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nwhen they want to make it look like something at the end of the line? Huh. Wow.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nIt doesn't work that way for me at all.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nI have no interest in that whatsoever.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nArchitecture is the beginning of something, because it's --\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nif you're not involved in first principles,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nif you're not involved in the absolute,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nthe beginning of that generative process, it's cake decoration.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nAnd I've nothing wrong with cake decoration and cake decorators,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nif anybody's involved in cake decorations --\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nit's not what I'm interested in doing. (Laughter)\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nAnd so, in the formation of things, in giving it form,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nin concretizing these things,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nit starts with some notion of how one organizes.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nAnd I've had for 30 years an interest in a series of complexities\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nwhere a series of forces are brought to bear,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nand to understand the nature of the final result of that,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nrepresenting the building itself.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nThere's been a continual relationship between inventions,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nwhich are private, and reality, which has been important to me.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nA project which is part of an exhibition in Copenhagen 10 years ago,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nwhich was the modeling of a hippocampus --\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nthe territory of the brain that records short-term memory --\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nand the documentation of that, the imaginative and documentation of that\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nthrough a series of drawings which literally attempt to organize that experience.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nAnd it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nobserving every kilometer a particular object of desire,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nand then placing that within this.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nAnd the notion was that I could make an organization\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nnot built on normal coherencies, but built on non-sequiturs, built on randomness.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nAnd I'd been extremely interested in this notion of randomness\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nas it produces architectural work\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nand as it definitely connects to the notion of the city,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nan accretional notion of the city,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nand that led to various ideas of organization.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nAnd then this led to broader ideas of buildings\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nthat come together through the multiplicity of systems.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nAnd it's not any single system that makes the work.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nIt's the relationship -- it's the dynamics between the systems --\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nwhich have the power to transform and invent\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nand produce an architecture that is -- that would otherwise not exist.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nAnd those systems could be identified,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nand they could be grouped together.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nAnd of course, today, with the technology of the computer\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nand with the rapid prototyping, etc., we have the mechanisms\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nto understand and to respond to these systems,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nand to allow them to adjust to the various accommodations of functionalities\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nbecause that's all we do.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nWe're producing spaces that accommodate human activity.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nAnd what I'm interested in is not the styling of that,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nbut the relationship of that as it enhances that activity.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nAnd that directly connects to ideas of city-making.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nThis is a project that we just finished in Penang\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nfor a very, very large city project that came directly out of this process,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nwhich is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nAnd the project -- again, enormous, enormous competition --\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\non the Hudson River and in New York\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nthat we were asked to do three years ago, which uses these processes.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nAnd what you're looking at are possibilities that have to do\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nwith the generation of the city as one applies a methodology\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nthat uses notions of these multiple forces,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nthat deals with the enormity of the problem, the complexity of the problem,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nwhen we're designing cities at larger and larger aggregates.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nBecause one of the issues today is\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nthat the economic aggregate is driving the development aggregate,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nand as the aggregates get larger we require\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nmore and more complex investigation processes to solve these problems.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd that led us directly to the Olympic Village.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nI was in New York on Monday presenting it to the IOC.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nWe won the competition -- what was it, nine months ago?\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nAgain, a direct reflection from using these processes\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nto develop extremely complicated, very large-scale organisms.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nAnd then, also, was working with broad strategies.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nIn this case, we only used 15 of the 60 acres of land,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nand the 45 acres was a park and would become the legacy of the Olympic Village.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAnd it would become the second largest park in the boroughs, etc.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nIts position, of course, in the middle of Manhattan -- it's on Hunter's Point.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nAnd then the broader ideas of city-making\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nstart having direct influences on architecture,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\non the elements that make up the broader scheme,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nthe buildings themselves, and start guiding us.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nArchitecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nthat could come from literally any place.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nAnd so I can start this discussion in any number of places,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nand I've chosen three or four to talk about.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nAnd it has also to do with an interest in\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nthe vast kind of territory that architecture touches.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nIt literally is connected to anything in terms of knowledge base.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nThere's just no place that it doesn't somehow\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nhave a connective tissue to.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nThis is Jim Dine, and it's the absence of presence, etc.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nIt's the clothing, the skin, without the presence of the character.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nIt became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand it was used in a project where we could unravel that surface,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nand it was a figurative idea that was going to be folded\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nand made into a very, kind of complex space.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nAnd the idea was the relationship of the space,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nwhich was made up of the fold of the image,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nand the dialectic or the conflict between the figuration,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nand the clarity of the image\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nand the complexity of the space, which were in dialog.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nAnd it made us rethink the whole notion of how we work\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nand how we make things,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nand it led us to ideas that were closer to fashion design as we flattened out surfaces,\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nand then brought them back together as they could make spatial combinations.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nAnd this was the first prototype in Korea,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nas we're dealing with a dynamic envelope,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nand then the same characteristic of the fabric.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nIt has a material identity and it's translucent and it's porous,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nand it allows us for a very different notion of what a skin of a building is.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nAnd that turned right away into another project.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nThis is the Caltrans building in Los Angeles.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nAnd now we're seeing as the skin and the body is differentiated.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nAgain, it's a very, very simple notion.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nIf you look at most buildings,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nwhat you look at is the building, the facade, and it is the building.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nAnd all of a sudden we're kind of moving away,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nand we're separating the skin from the body,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nand that's going to lead to broader performance criteria,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nwhich I'm going to talk about in a minute.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nAnd you're looking at how it drapes over\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nand differentiates from the body.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nAnd then, again, the building itself,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nmiddle of Los Angeles, right across from City Hall.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nAnd as it moves, it takes pieces of the earth with it. It bends up.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nIt's part of a sign system,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nwhich was part of the kind of legacy of Los Angeles --\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nthe two-dimension, three-dimension signing, etc.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nAnd then it allows one to penetrate the work itself.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nIt's transparent, and it allows you to understand, I think,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nwhat is always the most interesting thing in any building,\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nwhich is the actual constructional processes that make it.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nAnd it's probably the most intense kind of territory\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nof the work, which is not occupied,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nbecause architecture is always the most interesting in some mechanism\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nwhen it's separated from function,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nand this is an area that allows for that.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nAnd then the skin starts transforming into other materials.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nWe're using light as a building material in this case.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nWe're working with Keith Sonnier in New York,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nand we're making this large outside room,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nwhich is possible in Los Angeles, and which is very much reflective\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nof the urban, the contemporary urban environments\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nthat you would find in Shibuya or you'd find in Mexico City\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nor Sao Paulo, etc.,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nthat have to do with activating the city over a longer span of time.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nAnd that was very much part of the notion\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nof the urban objective of this project in Los Angeles.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nAnd, again, all of it promoting transparency.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nAnd an image which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nthat light becomes literally a building material.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nWell, that immediately turned into something much broader, and as a scope.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nAnd again, we're looking at an early sketch\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nwhere I'm understanding now\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nthat the skin can be a transition between the ground and the tower.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nThis is a building in San Francisco which is under construction.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nAnd now it turned into something much, much broader as a problem,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nand it has to do with performance.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nThis will be the first building in the United States that took --\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nwell, I can't say it took the air conditioning out. It's a hybrid.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nI wanted a pure thing, and I can't get it.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nIt's a wrong attitude, actually, because the hybrid is probably more interesting.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nBut we took the air conditioning out of the tower.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nThere's some air conditioning left in the base,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nbut the skin now moves on hydraulics.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nIt forces air through a Venturi force if there's no wind.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nIt adjusts continually. And we removed the air conditioning.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nHuge, huge thing. Half a million dollars a year delta.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\n10 of these -- it's just under a million square feet --\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\n800 and some thousand square feet --\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\n10 of these would power Sausalito -- the delta on this.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nAnd so now what we're looking at, as the projects get larger in scale,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nas they interface with broader problems,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nthat they expand the capabilities\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nin terms of their performance.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nWell, I could also start here.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nWe could talk about the relationship\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nat a more biological sense of the relationship of building and ground.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nWell, our research -- my generation for sure,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\npeople who were going to school in the late '60s --\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nmade very much a shift out of the internal focus of architecture,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nlooking at architecture within its own territory,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nand we were much more affected by film,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nby what was going on in the art world, etc.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nThis is, of course, Michael Heizer.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nAnd when I saw this, first an image and then visited,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nit completely changed the way I thought after that point.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nAnd I understood that building really could be\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nthe augmentation of the Earth's surface,\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nand it completely shifted the notion of building ground in the most basic sense.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd then -- well, he was probably looking at this -- this is Nazca;\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nthis is 700 years ago -- the most amazing four-kilometer land sculptures.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nThey're just totally incredible.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nAnd that led us to then completely rethinking how we draw, how we work.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nThis is the first sketch of a high school in Pomona --\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nwell, whatever it is, a model, a conceptual, kind of idea.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nAnd it's the reshaping of the Earth to make it occupiable.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nSo it puts 200,000 square feet of stuff that make a high school work\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nin the surface of that Earth.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nThere it is modeled as it was developing into a piece of work.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nAnd there it is, again, as it's starting to get resolved tectonically,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nand then there's the school.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nAnd, of course,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nwe're interested in participating with education.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nI have absolutely no interest in producing a building\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nthat just accommodates X, Y and Z function.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nWhat I'm interested in are how these ideas\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nparticipate in the educational process of young people.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nIt demands some sort of notion of inquiry\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nbecause it's a system that's developed not sculpturally.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nIt's an idea that started from my first discussion.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nIt has to do with a broad, consistent logic,\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nand that logic could be understood as one occupies the building.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nAnd there's an overt -- at least,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nthere's an attempt to make a very overt notion of a building\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nthat connects to the land in a very different way\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nbecause I was interested in a very didactic approach to the problem,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nas one would understand that.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nAnd the second project that was just finished in Los Angeles\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nthat uses some of the same ideas. It uses landscape as a major idea.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nThen, again, we're doing the headquarters for NOAA --\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nNational Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency --\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\noutside of Washington in Maryland.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nAnd this is how they see the world.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nThey have 22 satellites zipping around at plus or minus 100 miles,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nand the site's in red.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nAnd what we really want to do -- well, the architects,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nif there are architects out there, this is the Laugier Hut;\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nthis is the primitive hut that's been around for so long --\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nand what we wanted to do is really build this,\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nbecause they see themselves as the caretakers of the world,\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nand we wanted them to look down at their satellite,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nhow they see their own site, that eight-acre site,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nand we wanted nothing left. We wanted it to stay green.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nThere's actually three baseball fields on it right now,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nand they're going to stay there.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nWe put one piece directly north-south,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nand it holds the dishes at the ears, right?\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nAnd then right below that the processing, and the mission lift,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nand the mission control room, and all the other spaces are underground.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nAnd what you look at is an aircraft carrier\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nthat's performance-driven by the cone vision of these satellite dishes.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nAnd that the building itself is occupied in the lower portion,\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nbroken up by a series of courts,\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nand it's five acres of uninterrupted, horizontal space\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nfor their administrative offices.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nAnd then that, in turn, propelled us to look at\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nlarger-scale projects where this notion of landscape building interface\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nbecomes a connective tissue.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nThe new capital competition for Berlin, four years ago.\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nAnd again we just finished the ECB --\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nactually Coop Himmelblau in Vienna just won this project,\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nwhere the building was separated into a series of landscape elements\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nthat became part of a connective tissue of a park,\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nwhich is parallel to the river, and develops ideas of the buildings themselves\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nand becomes part of the connective fabric --\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nthe social, cultural and the landscape, recreational fabric of the city.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nAnd the building is no longer seen as an autonomous thing,\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nbut something that's only inextricably connected\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nto this city and this place at this time.\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nAnd a project that was realized in Austria, the Hooper Bank,\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nwhich again used this idea of connecting typology,\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nthe traditional buildings, and morphology,\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nor the relationship of the development of land as an idea,\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:09.958\ninto a complex, which is a piece of a city where we can see part of it\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nis literally just this augmenting,\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nthis movement of the land that's a very simple idea of\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:15.958\njust lifting it up and occupying it,\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nand other parts are much more energetic and intense.\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nAnd talk about that intensity\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nin terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nthat have to do with putting a series of systems together,\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:30.958\nand then where part of it is in the ground, part of it is oppositional lifts.\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nOne enters the building as it lifts off the ground,\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nand it becomes part of the idea.\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nAnd then the skin -- the edges of this --\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nall promote the dynamic, the movement of the building\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nas a series of seismic shifts, geologic shifts. Right?\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nAnd it makes for event space and then it breaks in places\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nthat allow you to peer into the interior, and those interiors, again,\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nare promoting transparency for the workplace,\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nwhich has been a continual interest of ours.\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nAnd then, again, in a more, kind of traditional setting,\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nthis is a graduate student housing in Toronto,\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nand it's very much about the relationship of a building\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nas it makes a connective tissue to the city.\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nThe main idea was the gateway, where it breaks the site,\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nand the building occupies both the public space and the private space.\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nAnd it's that territory of -- it's this thing.\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:25.958\nI visited the site many times, and everybody, kind of --\n\n00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nyou can see this from two kilometers away; it's an exact center of the street,\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:31.958\nand the whole notion is to engage the public,\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nto engage buildings as part of the public tissue of the city.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nAnd finally, one of the most interesting projects -- it's a courthouse.\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:44.958\nAnd what I want to talk about -- this is the Supreme Court, of course --\n\n00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:48.958\nand, well, I'm dealing with Michael Hogan, the Chief Justice of Oregon.\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:52.958\nYou could not proceed without making this negotiation\n\n00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nbetween one's own values and the relationship\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nof the character you're working with and how he understands the court,\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:03.958\nbecause I'm showing him, of course, Corbusier at Savoy,\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nwhich is 1928, which is the beginning of modern architecture.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nWell, then we get to this image.\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:13.958\nAnd this is where the project started. Because I'm going,\n\n00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nI'm interested in the phenomenon that's taking place in here.\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:22.958\nAnd really what we're talking about is constructing reality.\n\n00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nAnd I'm a character that's extremely interested\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:27.958\nin understanding the nature of that constructed reality\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:31.958\nbecause there's no such thing as nature any more. Nature is gone.\n\n00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:33.958\nNature in the 19th-century sense, alright?\n\n00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:36.958\nNature is only a cultural edifice today, right?\n\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:39.958\nWe construct it and we construct those ideas.\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:42.958\nAnd then of course, this one, our governor at the moment.\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:47.958\nAnd we spent some time with Conan, believe it or not,\n\n00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:51.958\nand then that led us to, kind of, the very differences of our worlds\n\n00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:53.958\nfrom a legal and an artistic, architectural.\n\n00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:57.958\nAnd it forced us to talk about notions of how we work,\n\n00:19:57.958 --> 00:20:00.958\nand the dynamics of that, and what other sources of the work is.\n\n00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:03.958\nAnd it led us to the project, the courthouse,\n\n00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:06.958\nwhich is absolutely a part of a negotiation\n\n00:20:06.958 --> 00:20:09.958\nbetween tradition and pieces of the traditional courthouse.\n\n00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:11.958\nYou'll find a stair that's the same length as the Supreme Court.\n\n00:20:11.958 --> 00:20:14.958\nHere's a piano nobile, which is a device used in the Renaissance.\n\n00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:18.958\nThe courts were made of that. The skin is this series of layers\n\n00:20:18.958 --> 00:20:21.958\nthat reflect even rusticated stonework,\n\n00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:25.958\nbut which were embedded with fragments of the Constitution,\n\n00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:27.958\nwhich were part of the little process,\n\n00:20:27.958 --> 00:20:29.958\nall set on a plinth that defined it from the community.\n\n00:20:29.958 --> 00:20:31.958\nThank you so much.\n\n00:20:31.958 --> 00:20:34.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Great cars are great art", "duration": "1204", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/chris_bangle_says_great_cars_are_art", "transcript": "What I want to talk about is, as background, is the idea that cars are art. This is actually quite meaningful to me, because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole \u2014 we don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it \u2014 and cars are thought so much as a product that it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art. And so cars, as art, brings it into an emotional plane \u2014 if you accept that \u2014 that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A.Now at this point you're going to see a picture of Michelangelo. This is completely different than automobiles. Automobiles are self-moving things, right? Elevators are automobiles. And they're not very emotional; they solve a purpose; and certainly automobiles have been around for 100 years and have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways; they've also been a real pain in the ass, because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve. We have to solve the pollution, we have to solve the congestion \u2014 but that's not what interests me in this speech.What interests me in this speech is cars. Automobiles may be what you use, but cars are what we are, in many ways. And as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles, and I believe we can, with fuel cells or hydrogen, like BMW is really hip on, and lots of other things, then I think we can look past that and try and understand why this hook is in many of us \u2014 of this car-y-ness \u2014 and what that means, what we can learn from it. That's what I want to get to. Cars are not a suit of clothes; cars are an avatar. Cars are an expansion of yourself: they take your thoughts, your ideas, your emotions, and they multiply it \u2014 your anger, whatever. It's an avatar. It's a super-waldo that you happen to be inside of, and if you feel sexy, the car is sexy. And if you're full of road rage, you've got a \"Chevy: Like a Rock,\" right?Cars are a sculpture \u2014 did you know this? That every car you see out there is sculpted by hand. Many people think, \"Well, it's computers, and it's done by machines and stuff like that.\" Well, they reproduce it, but the originals are all done by hand. It's done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft. And they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum. That tension between the need to express, the need to discover, then you put something new into it, and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship. Rules that say, this is how you handle surfaces; this is what control is all about; this is how you show you're a master of your craft. And that tension, that discovery, that push for something new \u2014 and at the same time, that sense of obligation to the regards of craftsmanship \u2014 that's as strong in cars as it is in anything. We work in clay, which hasn't changed much since Michelangelo started screwing around with it, and there's a very interesting analogy to that too. Real quickly \u2014 Michelangelo once said he's there to \"discover the figure within,\" OK? There we go, the automobile. That was 100 years right there \u2014 did you catch that? Between that one there, and that one there, it changed a lot didn't it? OK, it's not marketing; there's a very interesting car concept here, but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here. I want to talk about this. Why it means you have to wash a car, what is it, that sensuality you have to touch about it? That's the sculpture that goes into it. That sensuality. And it's done by men and women working just like this, making cars.Now this little quote about sculpture from Henry Moore, I believe that that \"pressure within\" that Moore's talking about \u2014 at least when it comes to cars \u2014 comes right back to this idea of the mean. It's that will to live, that need to survive, to express itself, that comes in a car, and takes over people like me. And we tell other people, \"Do this, do this, do this,\" until this thing comes alive. We are completely infected. And beauty can be the result of this infectiousness; it's quite wonderful. This sculpture is, of course, at the heart of all of it, and it's really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars. And it's not a whole lot different, really, when they're working like this, or when somebody works like this. It's that same kind of commitment, that same kind of beauty.Now, now I get to the point. I want to talk about cars as art. Art, in the Platonic sense, is truth; it's beauty, and love. Now this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers. We don't really have a problem talking about love. We don't have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense. That's what we're searching for \u2014 when we're working our craft, we are really trying to find that truth out there. We're not trying to find vanity and beauty. We're trying to find the beauty in the truth. However, engineers tend to look at things a little bit more Newtonian, instead of this quantum approach. We're dealing with irrationalisms, and we're dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist, and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like two and two is four, and if you get 4.0 it's better, and 4.000 is even better. And that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence in why we're doing what we're doing. We've pretty much accepted the fact, though, that we are the women in the organization at BMW \u2014 BMW is a very manly type business, \u2014 men, men, men; it's engineers. And we're kind of the female side to that. That's OK, that's cool. You go off and be manly. We're going to be a little bit more female. Because what we're interested in is finding form that's more than just a function.We're interested in finding beauty that's more than just an aesthetic; it's really a truth. And I think this idea of soul, as being at the heart of great cars, is very applicable. You all know it. You know a car when you've seen it, with soul. You know how strong this is. Well, this experience of love, and the experience of design, to me, are interchangeable. And now I'm coming to my story.I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue. And first of all, you have to go with me for a second, and say, you know, you could take the word \"love\" out of a lot of things in our society, put the word \"design\" in, and it still works, like this quote here, you know. It kind of works, you know? You can understand that. It works in truisms. \"All is fair in design and war.\" Certainly we live in a competitive society. I think this one here, there's a pop song that really describes Philippe Starck for me, you know, this is like you know, this is like puppy love, you know, this is cool right? Toothbrush, cool. It really only gets serious when you look at something like this. OK?(Laughter)This is one substitution that I believe all of us, in design management, are guilty of. And this idea that there is more to love, more to design, when it gets down to your neighbor, your other, it can be physical like this, and maybe in the future it will be. But right now it's in dealing with our own people, our own teams who are doing the creating. So, to my story. The idea of people-work is what we work with here, and I have to make a bond with my designers when we're creating BMWs. We have to have a shared intimacy, a shared vision \u2014 that means we have to work as one family; we have to understand ourselves that way. There's good times; there's interesting times; and there's some stress times too. You want to do cars, you've got to go outside. You've got to do cars in the rain; you've got to do cars in the snow. That's, by the way, is a presentation we made to our board of directors. We haul their butts out in the snow, too. You want to know cars outside? Well, you've got to stand outside to do this. And because these are artists, they have very artistic temperaments. All right? Now one thing about art is, art is discovery, and art is discovering yourself through your art. Right? And one thing about cars is we're all a little bit like Pygmalion, we are completely in love with our own creations. This is one of my favorite paintings, it really describes our relationship with cars. This is sick beyond belief.(Laughter)But because of this, the intimacy with which we work together as a team takes on a new dimension, a new meaning. We have a shared center; we have a shared focus \u2014 that car stays at the middle of all our relationships. And it's my job, in the competitive process, to narrow this down. I heard today about Joseph's death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction. You know, that's what I have to do sometimes. We start out with 10 cars; we narrow it down to five cars, down to three cars, down to two cars, down to one car, and I'm in the middle of that killing, basically. Someone's love, someone's baby. This is very difficult, and you have to have a bond with your team that permits you to do this, because their life is wrapped up in that too. They've got that gene infected in them as well, and they want that to live, more than anything else.Well, this project, Deep Blue, put me in contact with my team in a way that I never expected, and I want to pass it on to you, because I want you to reflect on this, perhaps in your own relationships. We wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for BMW. We wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we'd done it, that I only had a phone number that connected me to them. So, what we did was: instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist, we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers to find out what's the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America. This is 1996 we did this project. And so we sent them off with this team name, Deep Blue. Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM \u2014 we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers. It turned out it was quite clever because Deep Blue, in a company like BMW, has a hook \u2014 \"Deep Blue,\" wow, cool name. So people get wrapped up in it. And we took a team of designers, and we sent them off to America. And we gave them a budget, what we thought was a set of deliverables, a timetable, and nothing else. Like I said, I just had a phone number that connected me to them.And a group of engineers worked in Germany, and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of what's the successor to the SUV. They would come together, compare notes. Then they would work apart, come together, and they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinions that didn't pollute each other's ideas \u2014 but at the same time came together and resolved the problems. Hopefully, really understand the customer at its heart, where the customer is, live with them in America. So \u2014 sent the team off, and actually something different happened. They went other places.(Laughter)They disappeared, quite honestly, and all I got was postcards. Now, I got some postcards of these guys in Las Vegas, and I got some postcards of these guys in the Grand Canyon, and I got these postcards of Niagara Falls, and pretty soon they're in New York, and I don't know where else. And I'm telling myself, \"This is going to be a great car, they're doing research that I've never even thought about before.\" Right? And they decided that instead of, like, having a studio, and six or seven apartments, it was cheaper to rent Elizabeth Taylor's ex-house in Malibu. And \u2014 at least they told me it was her house, I guess it was at one time, she had a party there or something. But anyway, this was the house, and they all lived there. Now this is 24/7 living, half-a-dozen people who'd left their \u2014 some had left their wives behind and families behind, and they literally lived in this house for the entire six months the project was in America, but the first three months were the most intensive. And one of the young women in the project, she was a fantastic lady, she actually built her room in the bathroom. The bathroom was so big, she built the bed over the bathtub \u2014 it's quite fascinating.On the other hand, I didn't know anything about this. OK? Nothing. This is all going on, and all I'm getting is postcards of these guys in Las Vegas, or whatever, saying, \"Don't worry Chris, this is really going to be good.\" OK? So my concept of what a design studio was probably \u2014 I wasn't up to speed on where these guys were.However, the engineers back in Munich had taken on this kind of Newtonian solution, and they were trying to find how many cup holders can dance on the head of a pin, and, you know, these really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer. And one was hoping that these two teams would get together, and this collusion of incredible creativity, under these incredible surroundings, and these incredibly stressed-out engineers, would create some incredible solutions. Well, what I didn't know was, and what we found out was \u2014 these guys, they can't even like talk to each other under those conditions. You get a divergence of Newtonian and quantum thinking at that point, you have a split in your dialog that is so deep, and so far, that they cannot bring this together at all.And so we had our first meeting, after three months, in Tiburon, which is just up the road from here \u2014 you know Tiburon? And the idea was after the first three months of this independent research they would present it all to Dr. Goschel \u2014 who is now my boss, and at that time he was co-mentor on the project \u2014 and they would present their results. We would see where we were going, we would see the first indication of what could be the successive phenomenon to the SUV in America. And so I had these ideas in my head, that this is going to be great. I mean, I'm going to see so much work, it's so intense \u2014 I know probably Las Vegas meant a lot about it, and I'm not really sure where the Grand Canyon came in either \u2014 but somehow all this is going to come together, and I'm going to see some really great product. So we went to Tiburon, after three months, and the team had gotten together the week before, many days ahead of time. The engineers flew over, and designers got together with them, and they put their presentation together.Well, it turns out that the engineers hadn't done anything. And they hadn't done anything because \u2014 kind of, like in car business, engineers are there to solve problems, and we were asking them to create a problem. And the engineers were waiting for the designers to say, \"This is the problem that we've created, now help us solve it.\" And they couldn't talk about it. So what happened was, the engineers showed up with nothing. And the engineers told the designers, \"If you go in with all your stuff, we'll walk out, we'll walk right out of the project.\"So I didn't know any of this, and we got a presentation that had an agenda, looked like this. There was a whole lot of dialog. We spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers. And here I'm expecting at any moment, \"OK, they're going to turn the page, and I'm going to see the cars, I'm going to see the sketches, I'm going to see maybe some idea of where it's going.\" Dialog kept on going, with mental maps of words, and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance, I was seriously being baffled with bullshit. And if you can imagine what this is like, to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working, and they're out there spending all this money, and they're learning, and they're doing all this stuff. I went fucking ballistic, right? I went nuts. You can probably remember Tiburon, it used to look like this.After four hours of this, I stood up, and I took this team apart. I screamed at them, I yelled at them, \"What the hell are you doing? You're letting me down, you're my designers, you're supposed to be the creative ones, what the hell is going on around here?\" It was probably one of my better tirades, I have some good ones, but this was probably one of my better ones. And I went into these people; how could they take BMW's money, how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing, nothing? Because of course they didn't tell us that they had three station wagons full of drawings, model concepts, pictures \u2014 everything I wanted, they'd locked up in the cars, because they had shown solidarity with the engineers \u2014 and they'd decided not to show me anything, in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start, because they hadn't realized, of course, that they couldn't do problem creating. So we went to lunch \u2014(Laughter)And I've got to tell you, this was one seriously quiet lunch. The engineers all sat at one end of the table, the designers and I sat at the other end of the table, really quiet. And I was just fucking furious, furious. OK? Probably because they had all the fun and I didn't, you know. That's what you get furious about right? And somebody asked me about Catherine, my wife, you know, did she fly out with me or something? I said, \"No,\" and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife. And I recalled that when Catherine and I were married, the priest gave a very nice sermon, and he said something very important. He said, \"Love is not selfish,\" he said, \"Love does not mean counting how many times I say, 'I love you.' It doesn't mean you had sex this many times this month, and it's two times less than last month, so that means you don't love me as much. Love is not selfish.\" And I thought about this, and I thought, \"You know, I'm not showing love here. I'm seriously not showing love. I'm in the air, I'm in the air without trust. This cannot be. This cannot be that I'm expecting a certain number of sketches, and to me that's my quantification method for qualifying a team. This cannot be.\"So I told them this story. I said, \"Guys, I'm thinking about something here, this isn't right. I can't have a relationship with you guys based on a premise that is a quantifiable one. Based on a dictate premise that says, 'I'm a boss, you do what I say, without trust.'\" I said \"This can't be.\" Actually, we all broke down into tears, to be quite honest about it, because they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built up inside of them, not being able to show me what I wanted, and merely having to ask me to trust them that it would come. And I think we felt much closer that day, we cut a lot of strings that didn't need to be there, and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about. We put the car back at the center of our thoughts, and we put love, I think, truly back into the center of the process.By the way, that team went on to create six different concepts for the next model of what would be the proposal for the next generation after SUVs in America. One of those was the idea of a crossover coupes \u2014 you see it downstairs, the X Coupe \u2014 they had a lot of fun with that. It was the rendition of our motorcycle, the GS, as Carl Magnusson says, \"brute-iful,\" as the idea of what could be a motorcycle, if you add two more wheels. And so, in conclusion, my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you, was this one here. I'm also going to steal a little quote out of \"Little Prince.\" There's a lot to be said about trust and love, if you know that those two words are synonymous for design. I had a very, very meaningful relationship with my team that day, and it's stayed that way ever since. And I hope that you too find that there's more to design, and more towards the art of the design, than doing it yourself. It's true that the trust and the love, that makes it worthwhile.Thanks so much.(Applause)", "id": 5, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nWhat I want to talk about is, as background,\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nis the idea that cars are art.\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nThis is actually quite meaningful to me,\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nbecause car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole --\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nwe don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it --\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nand cars are thought so much as a product\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nthat it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nunder the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nAnd so cars, as art, brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that --\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nthat you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nNow at this point you're going to see a picture of Michelangelo.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nThis is completely different than automobiles.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nAutomobiles are self-moving things, right? Elevators are automobiles.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nAnd they're not very emotional; they solve a purpose;\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nand certainly automobiles have been around for 100 years\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nand have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways;\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nthey've also been a real pain in the ass,\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nbecause automobiles are really the thing we have to solve.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nWe have to solve the pollution, we have to solve the congestion --\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nbut that's not what interests me in this speech.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nWhat interests me in this speech is cars. Automobiles may be what you use,\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nbut cars are what we are, in many ways.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nAnd as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nand I believe we can, with fuel cells or hydrogen, like BMW is really hip on,\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nand lots of other things, then I think we can look past that\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nand try and understand why this hook is in many of us --\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nof this car-y-ness -- and what that means, what we can learn from it.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nThat's what I want to get to. Cars are not a suit of clothes;\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.958\ncars are an avatar. Cars are an expansion of yourself:\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nthey take your thoughts, your ideas, your emotions, and they multiply it --\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nyour anger, whatever. It's an avatar.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nIt's a super-waldo that you happen to be inside of, and if you feel sexy,\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nthe car is sexy. And if you're full of road rage,\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nyou've got a \"Chevy: Like a Rock,\" right?\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nCars are a sculpture -- did you know this?\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nThat every car you see out there is sculpted by hand.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nMany people think, \"Well, it's computers,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nand it's done by machines and stuff like that.\"\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nWell, they reproduce it, but the originals are all done by hand.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nIt's done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nAnd they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nthat you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nThat tension between the need to express, the need to discover,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nthen you put something new into it,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nand at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nRules that say, this is how you handle surfaces;\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nthis is what control is all about; this is how you show you're a master of your craft.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nAnd that tension, that discovery, that push for something new --\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nand at the same time, that sense of obligation\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nto the regards of craftsmanship --\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nthat's as strong in cars as it is in anything.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nWe work in clay, which hasn't changed much\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nsince Michelangelo started screwing around with it,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nand there's a very interesting analogy to that too.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nReal quickly -- Michelangelo once said he's there to \"discover the figure within,\" OK?\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nThere we go, the automobile.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nThat was 100 years right there -- did you catch that?\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nBetween that one there, and that one there, it changed a lot didn't it?\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nOK, it's not marketing; there's a very interesting car concept here,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nbut the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nI want to talk about this.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nWhy it means you have to wash a car, what is it, that sensuality\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nyou have to touch about it? That's the sculpture that goes into it. That sensuality.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nAnd it's done by men and women working just like this, making cars.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nNow this little quote about sculpture from Henry Moore,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nI believe that that \"pressure within\" that Moore's talking about --\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nat least when it comes to cars --\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\ncomes right back to this idea of the mean.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nIt's that will to live, that need to survive, to express itself,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nthat comes in a car, and takes over people like me.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nAnd we tell other people, \"Do this, do this, do this,\" until this thing comes alive.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nWe are completely infected. And beauty can be the result\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nof this infectiousness; it's quite wonderful.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nThis sculpture is, of course, at the heart of all of it,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nand it's really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nAnd it's not a whole lot different, really, when they're working like this,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nor when somebody works like this.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nIt's that same kind of commitment, that same kind of beauty.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nNow, now I get to the point. I want to talk about cars as art.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nArt, in the Platonic sense, is truth; it's beauty, and love.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nNow this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nWe don't really have a problem talking about love.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nWe don't have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nThat's what we're searching for --\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nwhen we're working our craft, we are really trying to find that truth out there.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nWe're not trying to find vanity and beauty.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nWe're trying to find the beauty in the truth.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nHowever, engineers tend to look at things a little bit more Newtonian,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\ninstead of this quantum approach.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nWe're dealing with irrationalisms,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nand we're dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nand the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:59.958\ntwo and two is four, and if you get 4.0 it's better, and 4.000 is even better.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nAnd that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nin why we're doing what we're doing.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nWe've pretty much accepted the fact, though,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nthat we are the women in the organization at BMW --\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nBMW is a very manly type business, -- men, men, men; it's engineers.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nAnd we're kind of the female side to that. That's OK,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nthat's cool. You go off and be manly. We're going to be a little bit more female.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nBecause what we're interested in is finding form that's more than just a function.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nWe're interested in finding beauty that's more than just an aesthetic;\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nit's really a truth.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nAnd I think this idea of soul, as being at the heart of great cars,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nis very applicable. You all know it. You know a car when you've seen it,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nwith soul. You know how strong this is.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nWell, this experience of love, and the experience of design, to me,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nare interchangeable. And now I'm coming to my story.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nI discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nAnd first of all, you have to go with me for a second, and say,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nyou know, you could take the word \"love\" out of a lot of things in our society,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nput the word \"design\" in, and it still works,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nlike this quote here, you know. It kind of works, you know?\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nYou can understand that. It works in truisms.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\n\"All is fair in design and war.\"\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nCertainly we live in a competitive society.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nI think this one here, there's a pop song\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nthat really describes Philippe Starck for me, you know, this is like\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nyou know, this is like puppy love, you know, this is cool right?\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nToothbrush, cool.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nIt really only gets serious when you look at something like this. OK?\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nThis is one substitution that I believe\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nall of us, in design management, are guilty of.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nAnd this idea that there is more to love,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nmore to design, when it gets down to your neighbor, your other,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nit can be physical like this, and maybe in the future it will be.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nBut right now it's in dealing with our own people,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nour own teams who are doing the creating. So, to my story.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nThe idea of people-work is what we work with here,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nand I have to make a bond with my designers when we're creating BMWs.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nWe have to have a shared intimacy, a shared vision --\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nthat means we have to work as one family;\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nwe have to understand ourselves that way.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nThere's good times; there's interesting times;\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nand there's some stress times too.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nYou want to do cars, you've got to go outside.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nYou've got to do cars in the rain; you've got to do cars in the snow.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nThat's, by the way, is a presentation we made to our board of directors.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nWe haul their butts out in the snow, too. You want to know cars outside?\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nWell, you've got to stand outside to do this.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nAnd because these are artists, they have very artistic temperaments.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nAll right? Now one thing about art is, art is discovery,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nand art is discovering yourself through your art. Right?\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nAnd one thing about cars is we're all a little bit like Pygmalion,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nwe are completely in love with our own creations.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nThis is one of my favorite paintings, it really describes our relationship with cars.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nThis is sick beyond belief.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nBut because of this, the intimacy with which we work together as a team\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\ntakes on a new dimension, a new meaning.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nWe have a shared center; we have a shared focus --\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nthat car stays at the middle of all our relationships.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nAnd it's my job, in the competitive process, to narrow this down.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nI heard today about Joseph's death genes\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nthat have to go in and kill cell reproduction.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nYou know, that's what I have to do sometimes.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nWe start out with 10 cars; we narrow it down to five cars,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\ndown to three cars, down to two cars, down to one car,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nand I'm in the middle of that killing, basically.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nSomeone's love, someone's baby.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nThis is very difficult, and you have to have a bond with your team\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nthat permits you to do this, because their life is wrapped up in that too.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nThey've got that gene infected in them as well,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nand they want that to live, more than anything else.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nWell, this project, Deep Blue, put me in contact with my team\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nin a way that I never expected, and I want to pass it on to you,\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nbecause I want you to reflect on this, perhaps in your own relationships.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nWe wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for BMW.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nWe wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we'd done it,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nthat I only had a phone number that connected me to them.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nSo, what we did was: instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist,\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nwe decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nto find out what's the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nThis is 1996 we did this project. And so we sent them off with this team name,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nDeep Blue. Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM --\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nwe actually stole it from them because we figured\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nif anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nIt turned out it was quite clever because Deep Blue,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nin a company like BMW, has a hook -- \"Deep Blue,\" wow, cool name.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nSo people get wrapped up in it. And we took a team of designers,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nand we sent them off to America. And we gave them a budget,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nwhat we thought was a set of deliverables,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\na timetable, and nothing else.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nLike I said, I just had a phone number that connected me to them.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nAnd a group of engineers worked in Germany,\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nand the idea was they would work separately\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\non this problem of what's the successor to the SUV.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nThey would come together, compare notes. Then they would work apart,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\ncome together, and they would produce together\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:07.958\na monumental set of diverse opinions that didn't pollute each other's ideas --\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nbut at the same time came together and resolved the problems.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nHopefully, really understand the customer at its heart,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nwhere the customer is, live with them in America. So -- sent the team off,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nand actually something different happened. They went other places.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nThey disappeared, quite honestly, and all I got was postcards.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nNow, I got some postcards of these guys in Las Vegas,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nand I got some postcards of these guys in the Grand Canyon,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nand I got these postcards of Niagara Falls,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nand pretty soon they're in New York, and I don't know where else.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nAnd I'm telling myself, \"This is going to be a great car,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nthey're doing research that I've never even thought about before.\"\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nRight? And they decided that instead of, like, having a studio,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nand six or seven apartments,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nit was cheaper to rent Elizabeth Taylor's ex-house in Malibu.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nAnd -- at least they told me it was her house,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nI guess it was at one time, she had a party there or something.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nBut anyway, this was the house, and they all lived there.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nNow this is 24/7 living, half-a-dozen people who'd left their --\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nsome had left their wives behind and families behind,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nand they literally lived in this house\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nfor the entire six months the project was in America,\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nbut the first three months were the most intensive.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nAnd one of the young women in the project,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nshe was a fantastic lady, she actually built her room in the bathroom.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nThe bathroom was so big, she built the bed over the bathtub --\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nit's quite fascinating.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nOn the other hand, I didn't know anything about this. OK?\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nNothing. This is all going on, and all I'm getting is postcards\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nof these guys in Las Vegas, or whatever,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nsaying, \"Don't worry Chris, this is really going to be good.\" OK?\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nSo my concept of what a design studio was probably --\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nI wasn't up to speed on where these guys were.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nHowever, the engineers back in Munich\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nhad taken on this kind of Newtonian solution,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nand they were trying to find how many cup holders\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\ncan dance on the head of a pin, and, you know,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nthese really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nAnd one was hoping that these two teams would get together,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand this collusion of incredible creativity,\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nunder these incredible surroundings,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nand these incredibly stressed-out engineers,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nwould create some incredible solutions.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nWell, what I didn't know was, and what we found out was --\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nthese guys, they can't even like talk to each other under those conditions.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nYou get a divergence of Newtonian and quantum thinking at that point,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nyou have a split in your dialog that is so deep, and so far,\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nthat they cannot bring this together at all.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nAnd so we had our first meeting, after three months, in Tiburon,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nwhich is just up the road from here -- you know Tiburon?\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nAnd the idea was after the first three months of this independent research\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nthey would present it all to Dr. Goschel --\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nwho is now my boss, and at that time he was co-mentor on the project --\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nand they would present their results.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nWe would see where we were going,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nwe would see the first indication of what could be\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nthe successive phenomenon to the SUV in America.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nAnd so I had these ideas in my head, that this is going to be great.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nI mean, I'm going to see so much work, it's so intense --\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nI know probably Las Vegas meant a lot about it,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nand I'm not really sure where the Grand Canyon came in either --\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nbut somehow all this is going to come together,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nand I'm going to see some really great product.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nSo we went to Tiburon, after three months,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nand the team had gotten together the week before,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nmany days ahead of time.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nThe engineers flew over, and designers got together with them,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nand they put their presentation together.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nWell, it turns out that the engineers hadn't done anything.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nAnd they hadn't done anything because --\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nkind of, like in car business, engineers are there to solve problems,\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nand we were asking them to create a problem.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nAnd the engineers were waiting for the designers to say,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:12.958\n\"This is the problem that we've created, now help us solve it.\"\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nAnd they couldn't talk about it. So what happened was,\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nthe engineers showed up with nothing.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nAnd the engineers told the designers,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:25.958\n\"If you go in with all your stuff, we'll walk out,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nwe'll walk right out of the project.\"\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nSo I didn't know any of this,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nand we got a presentation that had an agenda, looked like this.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nThere was a whole lot of dialog.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nWe spent four hours being told all about vocabulary\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nthat needs to be built between engineers and designers.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nAnd here I'm expecting at any moment, \"OK, they're going to turn the page,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nand I'm going to see the cars, I'm going to see the sketches,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nI'm going to see maybe some idea of where it's going.\"\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nDialog kept on going, with mental maps of words, and pretty soon\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nit was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nI was seriously being baffled with bullshit.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nAnd if you can imagine what this is like,\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nto have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nand they're out there spending all this money, and they're learning,\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nand they're doing all this stuff.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nI went fucking ballistic, right? I went nuts.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nYou can probably remember Tiburon, it used to look like this.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nAfter four hours of this, I stood up, and I took this team apart.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nI screamed at them, I yelled at them, \"What the hell are you doing?\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nYou're letting me down, you're my designers,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nyou're supposed to be the creative ones,\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nwhat the hell is going on around here?\"\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nIt was probably one of my better tirades, I have some good ones,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nbut this was probably one of my better ones. And I went into these people;\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nhow could they take BMW's money,\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nhow could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing, nothing?\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nBecause of course they didn't tell us that they had three station wagons\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nfull of drawings, model concepts, pictures -- everything I wanted,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nthey'd locked up in the cars, because they had shown solidarity with the engineers --\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nand they'd decided not to show me anything,\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nin order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start,\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nbecause they hadn't realized, of course,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nthat they couldn't do problem creating.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nSo we went to lunch --\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:27.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nAnd I've got to tell you, this was one seriously quiet lunch.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nThe engineers all sat at one end of the table,\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nthe designers and I sat at the other end of the table, really quiet.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nAnd I was just fucking furious, furious. OK?\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nProbably because they had all the fun and I didn't, you know.\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nThat's what you get furious about right?\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nAnd somebody asked me about Catherine, my wife, you know,\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.958\ndid she fly out with me or something?\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nI said, \"No,\" and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nAnd I recalled that when Catherine and I were married,\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nthe priest gave a very nice sermon, and he said something very important.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nHe said, \"Love is not selfish,\" he said,\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:10.958\n\"Love does not mean counting how many times I say, 'I love you.'\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nIt doesn't mean you had sex this many times this month,\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nand it's two times less than last month,\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nso that means you don't love me as much.\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nLove is not selfish.\" And I thought about this, and I thought,\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:30.958\n\"You know, I'm not showing love here. I'm seriously not showing love.\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nI'm in the air, I'm in the air without trust.\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nThis cannot be. This cannot be that I'm expecting a certain number of sketches,\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nand to me that's my quantification method for qualifying a team.\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nThis cannot be.\"\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nSo I told them this story. I said, \"Guys, I'm thinking about something here,\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nthis isn't right. I can't have a relationship with you guys\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nbased on a premise that is a quantifiable one.\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nBased on a dictate premise that says, 'I'm a boss, you do what I say, without trust.'\"\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nI said \"This can't be.\"\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:12.958\nActually, we all broke down into tears, to be quite honest about it,\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nbecause they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built up\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:21.958\ninside of them, not being able to show me what I wanted,\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nand merely having to ask me to trust them that it would come.\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nAnd I think we felt much closer that day,\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nwe cut a lot of strings that didn't need to be there,\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nand we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nWe put the car back at the center of our thoughts, and we put love,\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nI think, truly back into the center of the process.\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.958\nBy the way, that team went on to create six different concepts\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nfor the next model of what would be the proposal\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nfor the next generation after SUVs in America.\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nOne of those was the idea of a crossover coupes --\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:03.958\nyou see it downstairs, the X Coupe -- they had a lot of fun with that.\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nIt was the rendition of our motorcycle,\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:10.958\nthe GS, as Carl Magnusson says, \"brute-iful,\"\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:15.958\nas the idea of what could be a motorcycle, if you add two more wheels.\n\n00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:19.958\nAnd so, in conclusion, my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you,\n\n00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:23.958\nwas this one here. I'm also going to steal a little quote out of \"Little Prince.\"\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nThere's a lot to be said about trust and love,\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:29.958\nif you know that those two words are synonymous for design.\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:33.958\nI had a very, very meaningful relationship with my team that day,\n\n00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:35.958\nand it's stayed that way ever since.\n\n00:19:35.958 --> 00:19:39.958\nAnd I hope that you too find that there's more to design,\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:43.958\nand more towards the art of the design, than doing it yourself.\n\n00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:47.958\nIt's true that the trust and the love, that makes it worthwhile.\n\n00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:49.958\nThanks so much.\n\n00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:51.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Singing \"What I Want\"", "duration": "276", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/nora_york_sings_what_i_want", "transcript": "I'd like to begin this song I wrote

Actually, that's \"hello\" in Bauer Bodoni for the typographically hysterical amongst us. One of the threads that seems to have come through loud and clear in the last couple of days is this need to reconcile what the Big wants \u2014 the \"Big\" being the organization, the system, the country \u2014 and what the \"Small\" wants \u2014 the individual, the person. And how do you bring those two things together? Charlie Ledbetter, yesterday, I thought, talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers, to bring people into the process of creating things. And that's what I want to talk about today. So, bringing together the Small to help facilitate and create the Big, I think, is something that we believe in \u2014 something I believe in, and something that we kind of bring to life through what we do at Ideo.I call this first chapter \u2014 for the Brits in the room \u2014 the \"Blinding Glimpse of the Bleeding Obvious.\" Often, the good ideas are so staring-at-you-right-in-the-face that you kind of miss them. And I think, a lot of times, what we do is just, sort of, hold the mirror up to our clients, and sort of go, \"Duh! You know, look what's really going on.\" And rather than talk about it in the theory, I think I'm just going to show you an example. We were asked by a large healthcare system in Minnesota to describe to them what their patient experience was. And I think they were expecting \u2014 they'd worked with lots of consultants before \u2014 I think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart with thousands of bubbles and systemic this, that and the other, and all kinds of mappy stuff. Or even worse, some kind of ghastly death-by-Powerpoint thing with WowCharts and all kinds of, you know, God knows, whatever.The first thing we actually shared with them was this. I'll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve. This is 59 seconds into the film. This is a minute 59. 3:19. I think something happens. I think a head may appear in a second. 5:10. 5:58. 6:20. We showed them the whole cut, and they were all completely, what is this? And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day, all you do is look at the roof, and it's a really shitty experience. And just putting yourself in the position of the patient \u2014this is Christian, who works with us at Ideo. He just lay in the hospital bed, and, kind of, stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles for a really long time. That's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital. And they were sort, you know, blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious. Oh, my goodness. So, looking at the situation from the point of view of the person out \u2014 as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in \u2014 was, for these guys, quite a revelation. And so, that was a really catalytic thing for them. So they snapped into action. They said, OK, it's not about systemic change. It's not about huge, ridiculous things that we need to do. It's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference.So we started with them prototyping some really little things that we could do to have a huge amount of impact. The first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror and we Band-Aided it here, onto a gurney, a hospital trolley, so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor, you could actually have a conversation with them. You could, kind of, see them in your rear-view mirror, so it created a tiny human interaction. Very small example of something that they could do. Interestingly, the nurses themselves, sort of, snapped into action \u2014 said, OK, we embrace this. What can we do? The first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling. Which I thought was really \u2014 I showed this to my mother recently. I think my mother now thinks that I'm some sort of interior decorator. It's what I do for a living, sort of Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen. Not particularly the world's best design solution for those of us who are real, sort of, hard-core designers, but nonetheless, a fabulous empathic solution for people. Things that they started doing themselves \u2014 like changing the floor going into the patient's room so that it signified, \"This is my room. This is my personal space\" \u2014 was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem.So you went from public space to private space. And another idea, again, that came from one of the nurses \u2014 which I love \u2014 was they took traditional, sort of, corporate white boards, then they put them on one wall of the patient's room, and they put this sticker there. So that what you could actually do was go into the room and write messages to the person who was sick in that room, which was lovely. So, tiny, tiny, tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact. I thought that was a really, really nice example.So this is not particularly a new idea, kind of, seeing opportunities in things that are around you and snapping and turning them into a solution. It's a history of invention based around this. I'm going to read this because I want to get these names right. Joan Ganz Cooney saw her daughter \u2014 came down on a Saturday morning, saw her daughter watching the test card, waiting for programs to come on one morning and from that came Sesame Street. Malcolm McLean was moving from one country to another and was wondering why it took these guys so long to get the boxes onto the ship. And he invented the shipping container. George de Mestral \u2014 this is not bugs all over a Birkenstock \u2014 was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs, sort of little prickly things, and from that came Velcro.And finally, for the Brits, Percy Shaw \u2014 this is a big British invention \u2014 saw the cat's eyes at the side of the road, when he was driving home one night and from that came the Catseye. So there's a whole series of just using your eyes, seeing things for the first time, seeing things afresh and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities. Second one, without sounding overly Zen, and this is a quote from the Buddha: \"Finding yourself in the margins, looking to the edges of things, is often a really interesting place to start.\" Blinkered vision tends to produce, I think, blinkered solutions. So, looking wide, using your peripheral vision, is a really interesting place to look for opportunity.Again, another medical example here. We were asked by a device producer \u2014 we did the Palm Pilot and the Treo. We did a lot of sexy tech at Ideo \u2014 they'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology for medical diagnostics. This was a device that a nurse uses when they're doing a spinal procedure in hospital. They'll ask the nurses to input data. And they had this vision of the nurse, kind of, clicking away on this aluminum device and it all being incredibly, sort of, gadget-lustish. When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place \u2014 and I'll explain this in a second \u2014 it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really weren't recognizing. When you're having a four-inch needle inserted into your spine \u2014 which was the procedure that this device's data was about; it was for pain management \u2014 you're shit scared; you're freaking out. And so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did, was hold the patient's hand to comfort them. Human gesture \u2014 which made the fabulous two-handed data input completely impossible.So, the thing that we designed, much less sexy but much more human and practical, was this. So, it's not a Palm Pilot by any stretch of the imagination, but it has a thumb-scroll so you can do everything with one hand. So, again, going back to this \u2014 the idea that a tiny human gesture dictated the design of this product. And I think that's really, really important. So, again, this idea of workarounds. We use this phrase \"workarounds\" a lot, sort of, looking around us. I was actually looking around the TED and just watching all of these kind of things happen while I've been here. This idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life \u2014 and the things we kind of do in our environment that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential \u2014 is something that we look at a lot.We wrote a book recently, I think you might have received it, called \"Thoughtless Acts?\" It's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do, which have huge intention and huge opportunity. Why do we all follow the line in the street? This is a picture in a Japanese subway. People consciously follow things even though, why, we don't know. Why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence? Because we kind of have to \u2014 we're just compelled to. We don't know why, but we do. Why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle? Again, we're sort of using the world around us to create our own design solutions. And we're always saying to our clients: \"You should look at this stuff. This stuff is really important. This stuff is really vital.\" This is people designing their own experiences. You can draw from this. We sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street, that it's okay to use it, so we park our shopping cart there. It's there for our use, on some level.So, again, we sort of co-opt our environment to do all these different things. We co-opt other experiences \u2014 we take one item and transfer it to another. And this is my favorite one. My mother used to say to me, \"Just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn't mean you have to.\" But, of course, we all do. We all follow each other every day. So somebody assumes that because somebody else has done something, that's permission for them to do the same thing. And there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time. I mean, shopping bag equals \"parking meter out of order.\" And we all, kind of, know how to read these signals now. We all talk to one another in this highly visual way without realizing what we're doing. Third section is this idea of not knowing, of consciously putting yourself backwards. I talk about unthinking situations all the time. Sort of having beginner's mind, scraping your mind clean and looking at things afresh.A friend of mine was a designer at IKEA, and he was asked by his boss to help design a storage system for children. This is the Billy bookcase \u2014 it's IKEA's biggest selling product. Hammer it together. Hammer it together with a shoe, if you're me, because they're impossible to assemble. But big selling bookcase. How do we replicate this for children? The reality is when you actually watch children, children don't think about things like storage in linear terms. Children assume permission in a very different way. Children live on things. They live under things. They live around things, and so their spatial awareness relationship, and their thinking around storage is totally different. So the first thing you have to do \u2014 this is Graham, the designer \u2014 is, sort of, put yourself in their shoes. And so, here he is sitting under the table. So, what came out of this? This is the storage system that he designed. So what is this? I hear you all ask. No, I don't.(Laughter)It's this, and I think this is a particularly lovely solution. So, you know, it's a totally different way of looking at the situation. It's a completely empathic solution \u2014 apart from the fact that teddy's probably not loving it.(Laughter)But a really nice way of re-framing the ordinary, and I think that's one of the things. And putting yourself in the position of the person, and I think that's one of the threads that I've heard again from this conference is how do we put ourselves in other peoples' shoes and really feel what they feel? And then use that information to fuel solutions? And I think that's what this is very much about. Last section: green armband. We've all got them. It's about this really. I mean, it's about picking battles big enough to matter but small enough to win. Again, that's one of the themes that I think has come through loud and clear in this conference is: Where do we start? How do we start? What do we do to start? So, again, we were asked to design a water pump for a company called ApproTEC, in Kenya. They're now called KickStart.And, again, as designers, we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form. And that was completely irrelevant. When you put yourself in the position of these people, things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up and fit on a bicycle, become much more relevant than the form of it. The way it's produced, it has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods and indigenous materials. So it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user. We had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world. So what seems like a very clunky product is, in fact, incredibly useful. It's powered a bit like a Stairmaster \u2014 you pump up and down on it. Children can use it. Adults can use it. Everybody uses it. It's turning these guys \u2014 again, one of the themes \u2014 it's turning them into entrepreneurs.These guys are using this very successfully. And for us, it's been great because it's won loads of design awards. So we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company, the needs of the individuals in the company, to feel good about a product we were actually designing, and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for. There it is, pumping water from 30 feet. So as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets to all of you this morning. We've made a donation on everybody's behalf here to kick start, no pun intended, their next project. Because, again, I think, sort of, putting our money where our mouth is, here. We feel that this is an important gesture. So we've handed out bracelets. Small is the new big. I hope you'll all wear them. So that's it. Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 43, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nHello.

And I think, a lot of times,\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nwhat we do is just, sort of, hold the mirror up to our clients, and sort of go,\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\n\"Duh! You know, look what's really going on.\"\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nAnd rather than talk about it in the theory,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nI think I'm just going to show you an example.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nWe were asked by a large healthcare system in Minnesota\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nto describe to them what their patient experience was.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nAnd I think they were expecting --\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nthey'd worked with lots of consultants before --\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nI think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nwith thousands of bubbles and systemic this, that and the other,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nand all kinds of mappy stuff.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nOr even worse, some kind of ghastly death-by-Powerpoint thing\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nwith WowCharts and all kinds of, you know, God knows, whatever.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nThe first thing we actually shared with them was this.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nI'll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nThis is 59 seconds into the film.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nThis is a minute 59.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:16.958\n3:19.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nI think something happens. I think a head may appear in a second.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\n5:10.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\n5:58.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\n6:20.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nWe showed them the whole cut,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nand they were all completely, what is this?\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nAnd the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nall you do is look at the roof, and it's a really shitty experience.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nAnd just putting yourself in the position of the patient --\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nthis is Christian, who works with us at Ideo.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nHe just lay in the hospital bed,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nand, kind of, stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nfor a really long time.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nThat's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nAnd they were sort, you know, blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nOh, my goodness. So, looking at the situation\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nfrom the point of view of the person out --\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nas opposed to the traditional position of the organization in --\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nwas, for these guys, quite a revelation.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nAnd so, that was a really catalytic thing for them.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nSo they snapped into action.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nThey said, OK, it's not about systemic change.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nIt's not about huge, ridiculous things that we need to do.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nIt's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nSo we started with them prototyping some really little things\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nthat we could do to have a huge amount of impact.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nThe first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nand we Band-Aided it here, onto a gurney, a hospital trolley,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nso that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nyou could actually have a conversation with them.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nYou could, kind of, see them in your rear-view mirror,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nso it created a tiny human interaction.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nVery small example of something that they could do.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nInterestingly, the nurses themselves, sort of, snapped into action --\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nsaid, OK, we embrace this. What can we do?\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nThe first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nWhich I thought was really -- I showed this to my mother recently.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nI think my mother now thinks that I'm some sort of interior decorator.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nIt's what I do for a living, sort of Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nNot particularly the world's best design solution\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nfor those of us who are real, sort of, hard-core designers,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nbut nonetheless, a fabulous empathic solution for people.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nThings that they started doing themselves --\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nlike changing the floor going into the patient's room\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nso that it signified, \"This is my room. This is my personal space\" --\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nwas a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nSo you went from public space to private space.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nAnd another idea, again, that came from one of the nurses -- which I love --\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nwas they took traditional, sort of, corporate white boards,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nthen they put them on one wall of the patient's room,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nand they put this sticker there.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nSo that what you could actually do was go into the room\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nand write messages to the person who was sick in that room,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nwhich was lovely.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nSo, tiny, tiny, tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nI thought that was a really, really nice example.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nSo this is not particularly a new idea,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nkind of, seeing opportunities in things that are around you\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nand snapping and turning them into a solution.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nIt's a history of invention based around this.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nI'm going to read this because I want to get these names right.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nJoan Ganz Cooney saw her daughter -- came down on a Saturday morning,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nsaw her daughter watching the test card,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nwaiting for programs to come on one morning\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nand from that came Sesame Street.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nMalcolm McLean was moving from one country to another\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nand was wondering why it took these guys so long\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nto get the boxes onto the ship.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nAnd he invented the shipping container.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nGeorge de Mestral -- this is not bugs all over a Birkenstock --\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nwas walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nsort of little prickly things, and from that came Velcro.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nAnd finally, for the Brits, Percy Shaw -- this is a big British invention --\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nsaw the cat's eyes at the side of the road,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nwhen he was driving home one night and from that came the Catseye.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nSo there's a whole series of just using your eyes,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nseeing things for the first time, seeing things afresh\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nand using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nSecond one, without sounding overly Zen,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nand this is a quote from the Buddha:\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:24.958\n\"Finding yourself in the margins, looking to the edges of things,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nis often a really interesting place to start.\"\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nBlinkered vision tends to produce, I think, blinkered solutions.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nSo, looking wide, using your peripheral vision,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nis a really interesting place to look for opportunity.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nAgain, another medical example here.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nWe were asked by a device producer --\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nwe did the Palm Pilot and the Treo.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nWe did a lot of sexy tech at Ideo --\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nthey'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nfor medical diagnostics.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nThis was a device that a nurse uses\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nwhen they're doing a spinal procedure in hospital.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nThey'll ask the nurses to input data.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nAnd they had this vision of the nurse, kind of, clicking away\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:01.958\non this aluminum device\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nand it all being incredibly, sort of, gadget-lustish.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nWhen we actually went and watched this procedure taking place --\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nand I'll explain this in a second --\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nit became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nthat they really weren't recognizing.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nWhen you're having a four-inch needle inserted into your spine --\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nwhich was the procedure that this device's data was about;\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nit was for pain management -- you're shit scared; you're freaking out.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nAnd so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nwas hold the patient's hand to comfort them. Human gesture --\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nwhich made the fabulous two-handed data input completely impossible.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nSo, the thing that we designed, much less sexy\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nbut much more human and practical, was this.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nSo, it's not a Palm Pilot by any stretch of the imagination,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nbut it has a thumb-scroll so you can do everything with one hand.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nSo, again, going back to this -- the idea that a tiny human gesture\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\ndictated the design of this product.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nAnd I think that's really, really important.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nSo, again, this idea of workarounds.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nWe use this phrase \"workarounds\" a lot,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nsort of, looking around us. I was actually looking around the TED\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nand just watching all of these kind of things happen\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nwhile I've been here.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nThis idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life --\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nand the things we kind of do in our environment\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nthat are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential --\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nis something that we look at a lot.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nWe wrote a book recently, I think you might have received it,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:35.958\ncalled \"Thoughtless Acts?\"\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nIt's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nwhich have huge intention and huge opportunity.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nWhy do we all follow the line in the street?\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nThis is a picture in a Japanese subway.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nPeople consciously follow things even though, why, we don't know.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nWhy do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence?\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nBecause we kind of have to -- we're just compelled to.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nWe don't know why, but we do.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nWhy do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle?\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nAgain, we're sort of using the world around us\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nto create our own design solutions.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nAnd we're always saying to our clients: \"You should look at this stuff.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nThis stuff is really important. This stuff is really vital.\"\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nThis is people designing their own experiences.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nYou can draw from this.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nWe sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nthat it's okay to use it, so we park our shopping cart there.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nIt's there for our use, on some level.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nSo, again, we sort of co-opt our environment\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nto do all these different things.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nWe co-opt other experiences --\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nwe take one item and transfer it to another.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nAnd this is my favorite one. My mother used to say to me,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\n\"Just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn't mean you have to.\"\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nBut, of course, we all do. We all follow each other every day.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nSo somebody assumes\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nthat because somebody else has done something,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nthat's permission for them to do the same thing.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nAnd there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nI mean, shopping bag equals \"parking meter out of order.\"\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nAnd we all, kind of, know how to read these signals now.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nWe all talk to one another in this highly visual way\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nwithout realizing what we're doing.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nThird section is this idea of not knowing,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nof consciously putting yourself backwards.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nI talk about unthinking situations all the time.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nSort of having beginner's mind, scraping your mind clean\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nand looking at things afresh.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nA friend of mine was a designer at IKEA,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nand he was asked by his boss\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nto help design a storage system for children.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nThis is the Billy bookcase -- it's IKEA's biggest selling product.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nHammer it together. Hammer it together with a shoe, if you're me,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nbecause they're impossible to assemble.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nBut big selling bookcase. How do we replicate this for children?\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nThe reality is when you actually watch children,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nchildren don't think about things like storage in linear terms.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nChildren assume permission in a very different way.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nChildren live on things. They live under things.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nThey live around things,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nand so their spatial awareness relationship,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nand their thinking around storage is totally different.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nSo the first thing you have to do -- this is Graham, the designer --\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nis, sort of, put yourself in their shoes. And so, here he is\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nsitting under the table.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nSo, what came out of this?\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nThis is the storage system that he designed.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nSo what is this? I hear you all ask. No, I don't.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nIt's this, and I think this is a particularly lovely solution.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nSo, you know, it's a totally different way of looking at the situation.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nIt's a completely empathic solution --\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\napart from the fact that teddy's probably not loving it.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nBut a really nice way of re-framing the ordinary,\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nand I think that's one of the things.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nAnd putting yourself in the position of the person,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nand I think that's one of the threads that I've heard again\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nfrom this conference is how do we put ourselves\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nin other peoples' shoes and really feel what they feel?\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nAnd then use that information to fuel solutions?\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nAnd I think that's what this is very much about.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nLast section: green armband. We've all got them.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nIt's about this really.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nI mean, it's about picking battles big enough to matter\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nbut small enough to win.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nAgain, that's one of the themes\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nthat I think has come through loud and clear in this conference\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nis: Where do we start? How do we start? What do we do to start?\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nSo, again, we were asked to design a water pump\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nfor a company called ApproTEC, in Kenya.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nThey're now called KickStart.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nAnd, again, as designers,\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nwe wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nand spend a lot of time thinking of the form.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nAnd that was completely irrelevant.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nWhen you put yourself in the position of these people,\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nthings like the fact that this has to be able to fold up\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nand fit on a bicycle, become much more relevant\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nthan the form of it. The way it's produced,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nit has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nand indigenous materials.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nSo it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nWe had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nSo what seems like a very clunky product\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nis, in fact, incredibly useful.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nIt's powered a bit like a Stairmaster -- you pump up and down on it.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nChildren can use it. Adults can use it. Everybody uses it.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nIt's turning these guys -- again, one of the themes --\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nit's turning them into entrepreneurs.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nThese guys are using this very successfully.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nAnd for us, it's been great\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nbecause it's won loads of design awards.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nSo we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company,\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nthe needs of the individuals in the company,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nto feel good about a product we were actually designing,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nand the needs of the individuals we were designing it for.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nThere it is, pumping water from 30 feet.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nSo as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nto all of you this morning.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nWe've made a donation on everybody's behalf here\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nto kick start, no pun intended, their next project.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nBecause, again, I think, sort of, putting our money where our mouth is, here.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nWe feel that this is an important gesture.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nSo we've handed out bracelets. Small is the new big.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nI hope you'll all wear them.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nSo that's it. Thank you.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Art with wire, sugar, chocolate and string", "duration": "891", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/vik_muniz_makes_art_with_wire_sugar", "transcript": "I was asked to come here and speak about creation. And I only have 15 minutes, and I see they're counting already. And I can \u2014 in 15 minutes, I think I can touch only a very rather janitorial branch of creation, which I call \"creativity.\" Creativity is how we cope with creation. While creation sometimes seems a bit un-graspable, or even pointless, creativity is always meaningful. See, for instance, in this picture. You know, creation is what put that dog in that picture, and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters.When you think about \u2014 you know, creativity has a lot to do with causality too. You know, when I was a teenager, I was a creator. I just did things. Then I became an adult and started knowing who I was, and tried to maintain that persona \u2014 I became creative. It wasn't until I actually did a book and a retrospective exhibition, that I could track exactly \u2014 looks like all the craziest things that I had done, all my drinking, all my parties \u2014 they followed a straight line that brings me to the point that actually I'm talking to you at this moment. Though it's actually true, you know, the reason I'm talking to you right now is because I was born in Brazil. If I was born in Monterey, probably would be in Brazil.You know, I was born in Brazil and grew up in the '70s under a climate of political distress, and I was forced to learn to communicate in a very specific way \u2014 in a sort of a semiotic black market. You couldn't really say what you wanted to say; you had to invent ways of doing it. You didn't trust information very much. That led me to another step of why I'm here today, is because I really liked media of all kinds. I was a media junkie, and eventually got involved with advertising. My first job in Brazil was actually to develop a way to improve the readability of billboards, and based on speed, angle of approach and actually blocks of text. It was very \u2014 actually, it was a very good study, and got me a job in an ad agency. And they also decided that I had to \u2014 to give me a very ugly Plexiglas trophy for it.And another point \u2014 why I'm here \u2014 is that the day I went to pick up the Plexiglas trophy, I rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life, picked the thing \u2014 didn't have any friends. On my way out, I had to break a fight apart. Somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles. They were in tuxedos, and fighting. It was very ugly. And also \u2014 advertising people do that all the time \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 and I \u2014 well, what happened is when I went back, it was on the way back to my car, the guy who got hit decided to grab a gun \u2014 I don't know why he had a gun \u2014 and shoot the first person he decided to be his aggressor. The first person was wearing a black tie, a tuxedo. It was me. Luckily, it wasn't fatal, as you can all see. And, even more luckily, the guy said that he was sorry and I bribed him for compensation money, otherwise I press charges. And that's how \u2014 with this money I paid for a ticket to come to the United States in 1983, and that's very \u2014 the basic reason I'm talking to you here today: because I got shot. (Laughter) (Applause)Well, when I started working with my own work, I decided that I shouldn't do images. You know, I became \u2014 I took this very iconoclastic approach. Because when I decided to go into advertising, I wanted to do \u2014 I wanted to airbrush naked people on ice, for whiskey commercials, that's what I really wanted to do. (Laughter) But I \u2014 they didn't let me do it, so I just \u2014 you know, they would only let me do other things. But I wasn't into selling whiskey; I was into selling ice. The first works were actually objects. It was kind of a mixture of found object, product design and advertising. And I called them relics. They were displayed first at Stux Gallery in 1983.This is the clown skull. Is a remnant of a race of \u2014 a very evolved race of entertainers. They lived in Brazil, long time ago. (Laughter) This is the Ashanti joystick. Unfortunately, it has become obsolete because it was designed for Atari platform. A Playstation II is in the works, maybe for the next TED I'll bring it. The rocking podium. (Laughter) This is the pre-Columbian coffeemaker. (Laughter) Actually, the idea came out of an argument that I had at Starbucks, that I insisted that I wasn't having Colombian coffee; the coffee was actually pre-Columbian. The Bonsai table. The entire Encyclopedia Britannica bound in a single volume, for travel purposes. And the half tombstone, for people who are not dead yet.I wanted to take that into the realm of images, and I decided to make things that had the same identity conflicts. So I decided to do work with clouds. Because clouds can mean anything you want. But now I wanted to work in a very low-tech way, so something that would mean at the same time a lump of cotton, a cloud and Durer's praying hands \u2014 although this looks a lot more like Mickey Mouse's praying hands. But I was still, you know \u2014 this is a kitty cloud. They're called \"Equivalents,\" after Alfred Stieglitz's work. \"The Snail.\" But I was still working with sculpture, and I was really trying to go flatter and flatter. \"The Teapot.\"I had a chance to go to Florence, in \u2014 I think it was '94, and I saw Ghiberti's \"Door of Paradise.\" And he did something that was very tricky. He put together two different media from different periods of time. First, he got an age-old way of making it, which was relief, and he worked this with three-point perspective, which was brand-new technology at the time. And it's totally overkill. And your eye doesn't know which level to read. And you become trapped into this kind of representation. So I decided to make these very simple renderings, that at first they are taken as a line drawing \u2014 you know, something that's very \u2014 and then I did it with wire. The idea was to \u2014 because everybody overlooks white \u2014 like pencil drawings, you know? And they would look at it \u2014 \"Ah, it's a pencil drawing.\" Then you have this double take and see that it's actually something that existed in time. It had a physicality, and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative that goes this way, towards the image. So this is \"Monkey with Leica.\" \"Relaxation.\" \"Fiat Lux.\"And the same way the history of representation evolved from line drawings to shaded drawings. And I wanted to deal with other subjects. I started taking that into the realm of landscape, which is something that's almost a picture of nothing. I made these pictures called \"Pictures of Thread,\" and I named them after the amount of yards that I used to represent each picture. These always end up being a photograph at the end, or more like an etching in this case. So this is a lighthouse. This is \"6,500 Yards,\" after Corot. \"9,000 Yards,\" after Gerhard Richter. And I don't know how many yards, after John Constable.Departing from the lines, I decided to tackle the idea of points, like which is more similar to the type of representation that we find in photographs themselves. I had met a group of children in the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts, and I did work and play with them. I got some photographs from them. Upon my arrival in New York, I decided \u2014 they were children of sugar plantation workers. And by manipulating sugar over a black paper, I made portraits of them. These are \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 Thank you. This is \"Valentina, the Fastest.\" It was just the name of the child, with the little thing you get to know of somebody that you meet very briefly. \"Valicia.\" \"Jacynthe.\"But another layer of representation was still introduced. Because I was doing this while I was making these pictures, I realized that I could add still another thing I was trying to make a subject \u2014 something that would interfere with the themes, so chocolate is very good, because it has \u2014 it brings to mind ideas that go from scatology to romance. And so I decided to make these pictures, and they were very large, so you had to walk away from it to be able to see them. So they're called \"Pictures of Chocolate.\" Freud probably could explain chocolate better than I. He was the first subject. And Jackson Pollock also.Pictures of crowds are particularly interesting, because, you know, you go to that \u2014 you try to figure out the threshold with something you can define very easily, like a face, goes into becoming just a texture. \"Paparazzi.\" I used the dust at the Whitney Museum to render some pieces of their collection. And I picked minimalist pieces because they're about specificity. And you render this with the most non-specific material, which is dust itself. Like, you know, you have the skin particles of every single museum visitor. They do a DNA scan of this, they will come up with a great mailing list. This is Richard Serra.I bought a computer, and [they] told me it had millions of colors in it. You know an artist's first response to this is, who counted it? You know? And I realized that I never worked with color, because I had a hard time controlling the idea of single colors. But once they're applied to numeric structure, then you can feel more comfortable. So the first time I worked with colors was by making these mosaics of Pantone swatches. They end up being very large pictures, and I photographed with a very large camera \u2014 an 8x10 camera. So you can see the surface of every single swatch \u2014 like in this picture of Chuck Close. And you have to walk very far to be able to see it. Also, the reference to Gerhard Richter's use of color charts \u2014 and the idea also entering another realm of representation that's very common to us today, which is the bit map. I ended up narrowing the subject to Monet's \"Haystacks.\"This is something I used to do as a joke \u2014 you know, make \u2014 the same like \u2014 Robert Smithson's \"Spiral Jetty\" \u2014 and then leaving traces, as if it was done on a tabletop. I tried to prove that he didn't do that thing in the Salt Lake. But then, just doing the models, I was trying to explore the relationship between the model and the original. And I felt that I would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself. I opt for very simple line drawings \u2014 kind of stupid looking.And at the same time, I was doing these very large constructions, being 150 meters away. Now I would do very small ones, which would be like \u2014 but under the same light, and I would show them together, so the viewer would have to really figure it out what one he was looking. I wasn't interested in the very large things, or in the small things. I was more interested in the things in between, you know, because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there. This is like you see \u2014 the size of a person over there. This is a pipe. A hanger.And this is another thing that I did \u2014 you know working \u2014 everybody loves to watch somebody draw, but not many people have a chance to watch somebody draw in \u2014 a lot of people at the same time, to evidence a single drawing. And I love this work, because I did these cartoonish clouds over Manhattan for a period of two months. And it was quite wonderful, because I had an interest \u2014 an early interest \u2014 in theater, that's justified on this thing. In theater, you have the character and the actor in the same place, trying to negotiate each other in front of an audience. And in this, you'd have like a \u2014 something that looks like a cloud, and it is a cloud at the same time. So they're like perfect actors.My interest in acting, especially bad acting, goes a long way. Actually, I once paid like 60 dollars to see a very great actor to do a version of \"King Lear,\" and I felt really robbed, because by the time the actor started being King Lear, he stopped being the great actor that I had paid money to see. On the other hand, you know, I paid like three dollars, I think \u2014 and I went to a warehouse in Queens to see a version of \"Othello\" by an amateur group. And it was quite fascinating, because you know the guy \u2014 his name was Joey Grimaldi \u2014 he impersonated the Moorish general \u2014 you know, for the first three minutes he was really that general, and then he went back into plumber, he worked as a plumber, so \u2014 plumber, general, plumber, general \u2014 so for three dollars, I saw two tragedies for the price of one.See, I think it's not really about impression, making people fall for a really perfect illusion, as much as it is to make \u2014 I usually work at the lowest threshold of visual illusion. Because it's not about fooling somebody, it's actually giving somebody a measure of their own belief: how much you want to be fooled. That's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that. Well, I think that's it. My time is nearly up.

So this is \"Monkey with Leica.\"\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\n\"Relaxation.\"\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:20.958\n\"Fiat Lux.\"\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nAnd the same way the history of representation\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nevolved from line drawings to shaded drawings.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAnd I wanted to deal with other subjects.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nI started taking that into the realm of landscape,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nwhich is something that's almost a picture of nothing.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nI made these pictures called \"Pictures of Thread,\"\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nand I named them after the amount of yards that I used to represent each picture.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nThese always end up being a photograph at the end,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nor more like an etching in this case.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nSo this is a lighthouse.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nThis is \"6,500 Yards,\" after Corot. \"9,000 Yards,\" after Gerhard Richter.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nAnd I don't know how many yards, after John Constable.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nDeparting from the lines, I decided to tackle the idea of points,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nlike which is more similar to the type of representation that we find in photographs themselves.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nI had met a group of children in the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nand I did work and play with them.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nI got some photographs from them.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nUpon my arrival in New York, I decided --\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nthey were children of sugar plantation workers.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nAnd by manipulating sugar over a black paper, I made portraits of them.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nThese are -- (Applause) --\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nThank you. This is \"Valentina, the Fastest.\"\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nIt was just the name of the child,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nwith the little thing you get to know of somebody that you meet very briefly.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\n\"Valicia.\"\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\n\"Jacynthe.\"\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nBut another layer of representation was still introduced.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nBecause I was doing this while I was making these pictures,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nI realized that I could add still another thing\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nI was trying to make a subject --\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nsomething that would interfere with the themes,\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nso chocolate is very good, because it has --\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nit brings to mind ideas that go from scatology to romance.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nAnd so I decided to make these pictures,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nand they were very large, so you had to walk away from it to be able to see them.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nSo they're called \"Pictures of Chocolate.\"\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nFreud probably could explain chocolate better than I. He was the first subject.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nAnd Jackson Pollock also.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nPictures of crowds are particularly interesting,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nbecause, you know, you go to that --\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nyou try to figure out the threshold with something you can define very easily,\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nlike a face, goes into becoming just a texture.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:50.958\n\"Paparazzi.\"\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nI used the dust at the Whitney Museum to render some pieces of their collection.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nAnd I picked minimalist pieces because they're about specificity.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nAnd you render this with the most non-specific material,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nwhich is dust itself.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nLike, you know, you have the skin particles of every single museum visitor.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nThey do a DNA scan of this, they will come up with a great mailing list.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nThis is Richard Serra.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nI bought a computer, and [they] told me it had millions of colors in it.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nYou know an artist's first response to this is, who counted it? You know?\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nAnd I realized that I never worked with color,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nbecause I had a hard time controlling the idea of single colors.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nBut once they're applied to numeric structure,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nthen you can feel more comfortable.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nSo the first time I worked with colors was by making these mosaics of Pantone swatches.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nThey end up being very large pictures,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nand I photographed with a very large camera --\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nan 8x10 camera.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nSo you can see the surface of every single swatch --\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nlike in this picture of Chuck Close.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nAnd you have to walk very far to be able to see it.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nAlso, the reference to Gerhard Richter's use of color charts --\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nand the idea also entering another realm of representation that's very common to us today,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nwhich is the bit map.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nI ended up narrowing the subject to Monet's \"Haystacks.\"\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nThis is something I used to do as a joke --\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nyou know, make -- the same like -- Robert Smithson's \"Spiral Jetty\" --\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nand then leaving traces, as if it was done on a tabletop.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nI tried to prove that he didn't do that thing in the Salt Lake.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nBut then, just doing the models, I was trying to explore the relationship\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nbetween the model and the original.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nAnd I felt that I would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nI opt for very simple line drawings -- kind of stupid looking.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nAnd at the same time, I was doing these very large constructions,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nbeing 150 meters away.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nNow I would do very small ones, which would be like --\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nbut under the same light, and I would show them together,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nso the viewer would have to really figure it out what one he was looking.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nI wasn't interested in the very large things, or in the small things.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nI was more interested in the things in between,\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nyou know, because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nThis is like you see -- the size of a person over there.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nThis is a pipe.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nA hanger.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nAnd this is another thing that I did -- you know working\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\n-- everybody loves to watch somebody draw,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nbut not many people have a chance to watch somebody draw in --\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:48.958\na lot of people at the same time, to evidence a single drawing.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nAnd I love this work,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nbecause I did these cartoonish clouds over Manhattan for a period of two months.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nAnd it was quite wonderful, because I had an interest -- an early interest -- in theater,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nthat's justified on this thing.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nIn theater, you have the character and the actor in the same place,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\ntrying to negotiate each other in front of an audience.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nAnd in this, you'd have like a --\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nsomething that looks like a cloud, and it is a cloud at the same time.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nSo they're like perfect actors.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nMy interest in acting, especially bad acting, goes a long way.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nActually, I once paid like 60 dollars\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nto see a very great actor to do a version of \"King Lear,\"\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nand I felt really robbed, because by the time the actor started being King Lear,\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nhe stopped being the great actor that I had paid money to see.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nOn the other hand, you know, I paid like three dollars, I think --\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nand I went to a warehouse in Queens\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nto see a version of \"Othello\" by an amateur group.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nAnd it was quite fascinating, because you know the guy --\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nhis name was Joey Grimaldi --\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nhe impersonated the Moorish general\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\n-- you know, for the first three minutes he was really that general,\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nand then he went back into plumber, he worked as a plumber, so --\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nplumber, general, plumber, general --\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nso for three dollars, I saw two tragedies for the price of one.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nSee, I think it's not really about impression,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nmaking people fall for a really perfect illusion,\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nas much as it is to make -- I usually work at the lowest threshold of visual illusion.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nBecause it's not about fooling somebody,\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nit's actually giving somebody a measure of their own belief:\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nhow much you want to be fooled.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nThat's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nWell, I think that's it.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nMy time is nearly up.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nThank you very much."}, {"title": "A philosophical quest for our biggest problems", "duration": "1012", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_bostrom_on_our_biggest_problems", "transcript": "I want to talk today about \u2014 I've been asked to take the long view, and I'm going to tell you what I think are the three biggest problems for humanity from this long point of view. Some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers, which is encouraging. It seems that there's not just one person who thinks that these problems are important.The first is \u2014 death is a big problem. If you look at the statistics, the odds are not very favorable to us. So far, most people who have lived have also died. Roughly 90 percent of everybody who has been alive has died by now. So the annual death rate adds up to 150,000 \u2014 sorry, the daily death rate \u2014 150,000 people per day, which is a huge number by any standard. The annual death rate, then, becomes 56 million. If we just look at the single, biggest cause of death \u2014 aging \u2014 it accounts for roughly two-thirds of all human people who die. That adds up to an annual death toll of greater than the population of Canada. Sometimes, we don't see a problem because either it's too familiar or it's too big. Can't see it because it's too big. I think death might be both too familiar and too big for most people to see it as a problem.Once you think about it, you see this is not statistical points; these are \u2014 let's see, how far have I talked? I've talked for three minutes. So that would be, roughly, 324 people have died since I've begun speaking. People like \u2014 it's roughly the population in this room has just died. Now, the human cost of that is obvious, once you start to think about it \u2014 the suffering, the loss \u2014 it's also, economically, enormously wasteful. I just look at the information, and knowledge, and experience that is lost due to natural causes of death in general, and aging, in particular.Suppose we approximated one person with one book? Now, of course, this is an underestimation. A person's lifetime of learning and experience is a lot more than you could put into a single book. But let's suppose we did this. 52 million people die of natural causes each year corresponds, then, to 52 million volumes destroyed. Library of Congress holds 18 million volumes. We are upset about the burning of the Library of Alexandria. It's one of the great cultural tragedies that we remember, even today. But this is the equivalent of three Libraries of Congress \u2014 burnt down, forever lost \u2014 each year.So that's the first big problem. And I wish Godspeed to Aubrey de Grey, and other people like him, to try to do something about this as soon as possible. Existential risk \u2014 the second big problem. Existential risk is a threat to human survival, or to the long-term potential of our species. Now, why do I say that this is a big problem? Well, let's first look at the probability \u2014 and this is very, very difficult to estimate \u2014 but there have been only four studies on this in recent years, which is surprising. You would think that it would be of some interest to try to find out more about this given that the stakes are so big, but it's a very neglected area.But there have been four studies \u2014 one by John Lesley, wrote a book on this. He estimated a probability that we will fail to survive the current century: 50 percent. Similarly, the Astronomer Royal, whom we heard speak yesterday, also has a 50 percent probability estimate. Another author doesn't give any numerical estimate, but says the probability is significant that it will fail. I wrote a long paper on this. I said assigning a less than 20 percent probability would be a mistake in light of the current evidence we have. Now, the exact figures here, we should take with a big grain of salt, but there seems to be a consensus that the risk is substantial. Everybody who has looked at this and studied it agrees.Now, if we think about what just reducing the probability of human extinction by just one percentage point \u2014 not very much \u2014 so that's equivalent to 60 million lives saved, if we just count the currently living people, the current generation. Now one percent of six billion people is equivalent to 60 million. So that's a large number. If we were to take into account future generations that will never come into existence if we blow ourselves up, then the figure becomes astronomical. If we could eventually colonize a chunk of the universe \u2014 the Virgo supercluster \u2014 maybe it will take us 100 million years to get there, but if we go extinct we never will. Then, even a one percentage point reduction in the extinction risk could be equivalent to this astronomical number \u2014 10 to the power of 32.So if you take into account future generations as much as our own, every other moral imperative of philanthropic cost just becomes irrelevant. The only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve. And even if you just look at the current people, and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct, it should still have a high priority. Now, let me spend the rest of my time on the third big problem, because it's more subtle and perhaps difficult to grasp. Think about some time in your life \u2014 some people might never have experienced it \u2014 but some people, there are just those moments that you have experienced where life was fantastic.It might have been at the moment of some great, creative inspiration you might have had when you just entered this flow stage. Or when you understood something you had never done before. Or perhaps in the ecstasy of romantic love. Or an aesthetic experience \u2014 a sunset or a great piece of art. Every once in a while we have these moments, and we realize just how good life can be when it's at its best. And you wonder, why can't it be like that all the time? You just want to cling onto this. And then, of course, it drifts back into ordinary life and the memory fades. And it's really difficult to recall, in a normal frame of mind, just how good life can be at its best. Or how bad it can be at its worst.The third big problem is that life isn't usually as wonderful as it could be. I think that's a big, big problem. It's easy to say what we don't want. Here are a number of things that we don't want \u2014 illness, involuntary death, unnecessary suffering, cruelty, stunted growth, memory loss, ignorance, absence of creativity. Suppose we fixed these things \u2014 we did something about all of these. We were very successful. We got rid of all of these things. We might end up with something like this, which is \u2014 I mean, it's a heck of a lot better than that. But is this really the best we can dream of? Is this the best we can do?Or is it possible to find something a little bit more inspiring to work towards? And if we think about this, I think it's very clear that there are ways in which we could change things, not just by eliminating negatives, but adding positives. On my wish list, at least, would be: much longer, healthier lives, greater subjective well-being, enhanced cognitive capacities, more knowledge and understanding, unlimited opportunity for personal growth beyond our current biological limits, better relationships, an unbounded potential for spiritual, moral and intellectual development.If we want to achieve this, what, in the world, would have to change? And this is the answer \u2014 we would have to change. Not just the world around us, but we, ourselves. Not just the way we think about the world, but the way we are \u2014 our very biology. Human nature would have to change. Now, when we think about changing human nature, the first thing that comes to mind are these human modification technologies \u2014 growth hormone therapy, cosmetic surgery, stimulants like Ritalin, Adderall, anti-depressants, anabolic steroids, artificial hearts. It's a pretty pathetic list. They do great things for a few people who suffer from some specific condition, but for most people, they don't really transform what it is to be human. And they also all seem a little bit \u2014 most people have this instinct that, well, sure, there needs to be anti-depressants for the really depressed people. But there's a kind of queasiness that these are unnatural in some way.It's worth recalling that there are a lot of other modification technologies and enhancement technologies that we use. We have skin enhancements, clothing. As far as I can see, all of you are users of this enhancement technology in this room, so that's a great thing. Mood modifiers have been used from time immemorial \u2014 caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, immune system enhancement, vision enhancement, anesthetics \u2014 we take that very much for granted, but just think about how great progress that is \u2014 like, having an operation before anesthetics was not fun. Contraceptives, cosmetics and brain reprogramming techniques \u2014 that sounds ominous,but the distinction between what is a technology \u2014 a gadget would be the archetype \u2014 and other ways of changing and rewriting human nature is quite subtle. So if you think about what it means to learn arithmetic or to learn to read, you're actually, literally rewriting your own brain. You're changing the microstructure of your brain as you go along. So in a broad sense, we don't need to think about technology as only little gadgets, like these things here, but even institutions and techniques, psychological methods and so forth. Forms of organization can have a profound impact on human nature.Looking ahead, there is a range of technologies that are almost certain to be developed sooner or later. We are very ignorant about what the time scale for these things are, but they all are consistent with everything we know about physical laws, laws of chemistry, etc. It's possible to assume, setting aside a possibility of catastrophe, that sooner or later we will develop all of these. And even just a couple of these would be enough to transform the human condition.So let's look at some of the dimensions of human nature that seem to leave room for improvement. Health span is a big and urgent thing, because if you're not alive, then all the other things will be to little avail. Intellectual capacity \u2014 let's take that box, which falls into a lot of different sub-categories: memory, concentration, mental energy, intelligence, empathy. These are really great things. Part of the reason why we value these traits is that they make us better at competing with other people \u2014 they're positional goods. But part of the reason \u2014 and that's the reason why we have ethical ground for pursuing these \u2014 is that they're also intrinsically valuable. It's just better to be able to understand more of the world around you and the people that you are communicating with, and to remember what you have learned. Modalities and special faculties. Now, the human mind is not a single unitary information processor, but it has a lot of different, special, evolved modules that do specific things for us. If you think about what we normally take as giving life a lot of its meaning \u2014 music, humor, eroticism, spirituality, aesthetics, nurturing and caring, gossip, chatting with people \u2014all of these, very likely, are enabled by a special circuitry that we humans have, but that you could have another intelligent life form that lacks these. We're just lucky that we have the requisite neural machinery to process music and to appreciate it and enjoy it. All of these would enable, in principle \u2014 be amenable to enhancement. Some people have a better musical ability and ability to appreciate music than others have. It's also interesting to think about what other things are \u2014 so if these all enabled great values, why should we think that evolution has happened to provide us with all the modalities we would need to engage with other values that there might be?Imagine a species that just didn't have this neural machinery for processing music. And they would just stare at us with bafflement when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance, like the one we just heard \u2014 because of people making stupid movements, and they would be really irritated and wouldn't see what we were up to. But maybe they have another faculty, something else that would seem equally irrational to us, but they actually tap into some great possible value there. But we are just literally deaf to that kind of value. So we could think of adding on different, new sensory capacities and mental faculties. Bodily functionality and morphology and affective self-control. Greater subjective well-being. Be able to switch between relaxation and activity \u2014 being able to go slow when you need to do that, and to speed up. Able to switch back and forth more easily would be a neat thing to be able to do \u2014 easier to achieve the flow state, when you're totally immersed in something you are doing. Conscientiousness and sympathy. The ability to \u2014 it's another interesting application that would have large social ramification, perhaps. If you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person, undiminished through time, so that wouldn't have to \u2014 love would never have to fade if you didn't want it to. That's probably not all that difficult. It might just be a simple hormone or something that could do this.It's been done in voles. You can engineer a prairie vole to become monogamous when it's naturally polygamous. It's just a single gene. Might be more complicated in humans, but perhaps not that much. This is the last picture that I want to \u2014 now we've got to use the laser pointer. A possible mode of being here would be a way of life \u2014 a way of being, experiencing, thinking, seeing, interacting with the world. Down here in this little corner, here, we have the little sub-space of this larger space that is accessible to human beings \u2014 beings with our biological capacities. It's a part of the space that's accessible to animals; since we are animals, we are a subset of that.And then you can imagine some enhancements of human capacities. There would be different modes of being you could experience if you were able to stay alive for, say, 200 years. Then you could live sorts of lives and accumulate wisdoms that are just not possible for humans as we currently are. So then, you move off to this larger sphere of \"human +,\" and you could continue that process and eventually explore a lot of this larger space of possible modes of being.Now, why is that a good thing to do? Well, we know already that in this little human circle there, there are these enormously wonderful and worthwhile modes of being \u2014 human life at its best is wonderful. We have no reason to believe that within this much, much larger space there would not also be extremely worthwhile modes of being, perhaps ones that would be way beyond our wildest ability even to imagine or dream about. And so, to fix this third problem, I think we need \u2014 slowly, carefully, with ethical wisdom and constraint \u2014 develop the means that enable us to go out in this larger space and explore it and find the great values that might hide there.

asked to take the long view, and I'm going to tell you what\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nI think are the three biggest problems for humanity\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nfrom this long point of view.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nSome of these have already been touched upon by other speakers,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nwhich is encouraging.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nIt seems that there's not just one person\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nwho thinks that these problems are important.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nThe first is -- death is a big problem.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nIf you look at the statistics,\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nthe odds are not very favorable to us.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nSo far, most people who have lived have also died.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nRoughly 90 percent of everybody who has been alive has died by now.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nSo the annual death rate adds up to 150,000 --\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nsorry, the daily death rate -- 150,000 people per day,\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nwhich is a huge number by any standard.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nThe annual death rate, then, becomes 56 million.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nIf we just look at the single, biggest cause of death -- aging --\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nit accounts for roughly two-thirds of all human people who die.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nThat adds up to an annual death toll\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nof greater than the population of Canada.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nSometimes, we don't see a problem\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nbecause either it's too familiar or it's too big.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nCan't see it because it's too big.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nI think death might be both too familiar and too big\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nfor most people to see it as a problem.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nOnce you think about it, you see this is not statistical points;\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nthese are -- let's see, how far have I talked?\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nI've talked for three minutes.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nSo that would be, roughly, 324 people have died since I've begun speaking.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nPeople like -- it's roughly the population in this room has just died.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nNow, the human cost of that is obvious,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nonce you start to think about it -- the suffering, the loss --\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nit's also, economically, enormously wasteful.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nI just look at the information, and knowledge, and experience\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nthat is lost due to natural causes of death in general,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nand aging, in particular.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nSuppose we approximated one person with one book?\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nNow, of course, this is an underestimation.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nA person's lifetime of learning and experience\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nis a lot more than you could put into a single book.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nBut let's suppose we did this.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:36.958\n52 million people die of natural causes each year\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:40.958\ncorresponds, then, to 52 million volumes destroyed.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nLibrary of Congress holds 18 million volumes.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nWe are upset about the burning of the Library of Alexandria.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nIt's one of the great cultural tragedies\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nthat we remember, even today.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nBut this is the equivalent of three Libraries of Congress --\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nburnt down, forever lost -- each year.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nSo that's the first big problem.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nAnd I wish Godspeed to Aubrey de Grey,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nand other people like him,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nto try to do something about this as soon as possible.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nExistential risk -- the second big problem.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nExistential risk is a threat to human survival, or to the long-term potential of our species.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nNow, why do I say that this is a big problem?\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nWell, let's first look at the probability --\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nand this is very, very difficult to estimate --\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nbut there have been only four studies on this in recent years,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nwhich is surprising.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nYou would think that it would be of some interest\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nto try to find out more about this given that the stakes are so big,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nbut it's a very neglected area.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nBut there have been four studies --\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\none by John Lesley, wrote a book on this.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nHe estimated a probability that we will fail\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nto survive the current century: 50 percent.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nSimilarly, the Astronomer Royal, whom we heard speak yesterday,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nalso has a 50 percent probability estimate.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nAnother author doesn't give any numerical estimate,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nbut says the probability is significant that it will fail.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nI wrote a long paper on this.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nI said assigning a less than 20 percent probability would be a mistake\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nin light of the current evidence we have.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nNow, the exact figures here,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nwe should take with a big grain of salt,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nbut there seems to be a consensus that the risk is substantial.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nEverybody who has looked at this and studied it agrees.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nNow, if we think about what just reducing\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nthe probability of human extinction by just one percentage point --\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nnot very much -- so that's equivalent to 60 million lives saved,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nif we just count the currently living people, the current generation.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nNow one percent of six billion people is equivalent to 60 million.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nSo that's a large number.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nIf we were to take into account future generations\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nthat will never come into existence if we blow ourselves up,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nthen the figure becomes astronomical.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nIf we could eventually colonize a chunk of the universe --\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nthe Virgo supercluster --\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nmaybe it will take us 100 million years to get there,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nbut if we go extinct we never will.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nThen, even a one percentage point reduction\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nin the extinction risk could be equivalent\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nto this astronomical number -- 10 to the power of 32.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nSo if you take into account future generations as much as our own,\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nevery other moral imperative of philanthropic cost just becomes irrelevant.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nThe only thing you should focus on\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nwould be to reduce existential risk\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nbecause even the tiniest decrease in existential risk\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nwould just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nAnd even if you just look at the current people,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nand ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nit should still have a high priority.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nNow, let me spend the rest of my time on the third big problem,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nbecause it's more subtle and perhaps difficult to grasp.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nThink about some time in your life --\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nsome people might never have experienced it -- but some people,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthere are just those moments that you have experienced\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nwhere life was fantastic.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nIt might have been at the moment of some great, creative inspiration\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nyou might have had when you just entered this flow stage.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nOr when you understood something you had never done before.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nOr perhaps in the ecstasy of romantic love.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nOr an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a great piece of art.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nEvery once in a while we have these moments,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nand we realize just how good life can be when it's at its best.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAnd you wonder, why can't it be like that all the time?\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nYou just want to cling onto this.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd then, of course, it drifts back into ordinary life and the memory fades.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nAnd it's really difficult to recall, in a normal frame of mind,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\njust how good life can be at its best.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nOr how bad it can be at its worst.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nThe third big problem is that life isn't usually\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nas wonderful as it could be.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nI think that's a big, big problem.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nIt's easy to say what we don't want.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nHere are a number of things that we don't want --\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nillness, involuntary death, unnecessary suffering, cruelty,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nstunted growth, memory loss, ignorance, absence of creativity.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nSuppose we fixed these things -- we did something about all of these.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nWe were very successful.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nWe got rid of all of these things.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nWe might end up with something like this,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nwhich is -- I mean, it's a heck of a lot better than that.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nBut is this really the best we can dream of?\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nIs this the best we can do?\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nOr is it possible to find something a little bit more inspiring to work towards?\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nAnd if we think about this,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nI think it's very clear that there are ways\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nin which we could change things, not just by eliminating negatives,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nbut adding positives.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nOn my wish list, at least, would be:\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nmuch longer, healthier lives, greater subjective well-being,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nenhanced cognitive capacities, more knowledge and understanding,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nunlimited opportunity for personal growth\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nbeyond our current biological limits, better relationships,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nan unbounded potential for spiritual, moral\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nand intellectual development.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nIf we want to achieve this, what, in the world, would have to change?\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nAnd this is the answer -- we would have to change.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nNot just the world around us, but we, ourselves.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nNot just the way we think about the world, but the way we are -- our very biology.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nHuman nature would have to change.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nNow, when we think about changing human nature,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nthe first thing that comes to mind\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nare these human modification technologies --\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\ngrowth hormone therapy, cosmetic surgery,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nstimulants like Ritalin, Adderall, anti-depressants,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nanabolic steroids, artificial hearts.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nIt's a pretty pathetic list.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nThey do great things for a few people\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nwho suffer from some specific condition,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nbut for most people, they don't really transform\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nwhat it is to be human.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nAnd they also all seem a little bit --\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nmost people have this instinct that, well, sure,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nthere needs to be anti-depressants for the really depressed people.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nBut there's a kind of queasiness\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nthat these are unnatural in some way.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nIt's worth recalling that there are a lot of other\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nmodification technologies and enhancement technologies that we use.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nWe have skin enhancements, clothing.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nAs far as I can see, all of you are users of this\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nenhancement technology in this room, so that's a great thing.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nMood modifiers have been used from time immemorial --\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:51.958\ncaffeine, alcohol, nicotine, immune system enhancement,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nvision enhancement, anesthetics --\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nwe take that very much for granted,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nbut just think about how great progress that is --\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nlike, having an operation before anesthetics was not fun.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nContraceptives, cosmetics and brain reprogramming techniques --\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nthat sounds ominous,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nbut the distinction between what is a technology --\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\na gadget would be the archetype --\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nand other ways of changing and rewriting human nature is quite subtle.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nSo if you think about what it means to learn arithmetic or to learn to read,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nyou're actually, literally rewriting your own brain.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nYou're changing the microstructure of your brain as you go along.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nSo in a broad sense, we don't need to think about technology\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nas only little gadgets, like these things here,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nbut even institutions and techniques,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\npsychological methods and so forth.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nForms of organization can have a profound impact on human nature.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nLooking ahead, there is a range of technologies\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nthat are almost certain to be developed sooner or later.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nWe are very ignorant about what the time scale for these things are,\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nbut they all are consistent with everything we know\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nabout physical laws, laws of chemistry, etc.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nIt's possible to assume,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nsetting aside a possibility of catastrophe,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nthat sooner or later we will develop all of these.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nAnd even just a couple of these would be enough\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nto transform the human condition.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nSo let's look at some of the dimensions of human nature\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nthat seem to leave room for improvement.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nHealth span is a big and urgent thing,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nbecause if you're not alive,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nthen all the other things will be to little avail.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nIntellectual capacity -- let's take that box,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nwhich falls into a lot of different sub-categories:\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nmemory, concentration, mental energy, intelligence, empathy.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nThese are really great things.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nPart of the reason why we value these traits\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nis that they make us better at competing with other people --\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nthey're positional goods.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nBut part of the reason --\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nand that's the reason why we have ethical ground for pursuing these --\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nis that they're also intrinsically valuable.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nIt's just better to be able to understand more of the world around you\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nand the people that you are communicating with,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nand to remember what you have learned.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nModalities and special faculties.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nNow, the human mind is not a single unitary information processor,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nbut it has a lot of different, special, evolved modules\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nthat do specific things for us.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nIf you think about what we normally take as giving life a lot of its meaning --\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nmusic, humor, eroticism, spirituality, aesthetics,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nnurturing and caring, gossip, chatting with people --\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nall of these, very likely, are enabled by a special circuitry\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nthat we humans have,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nbut that you could have another intelligent life form that lacks these.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nWe're just lucky that we have the requisite neural machinery\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nto process music and to appreciate it and enjoy it.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nAll of these would enable, in principle -- be amenable to enhancement.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nSome people have a better musical ability\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nand ability to appreciate music than others have.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nIt's also interesting to think about what other things are --\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nso if these all enabled great values,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nwhy should we think that evolution has happened to provide us\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nwith all the modalities we would need to engage\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nwith other values that there might be?\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nImagine a species\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nthat just didn't have this neural machinery for processing music.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nAnd they would just stare at us with bafflement\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nwhen we spend time listening to a beautiful performance,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nlike the one we just heard -- because of people making stupid movements,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nand they would be really irritated and wouldn't see what we were up to.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nBut maybe they have another faculty, something else\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nthat would seem equally irrational to us,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nbut they actually tap into some great possible value there.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nBut we are just literally deaf to that kind of value.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nSo we could think of adding on different,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nnew sensory capacities and mental faculties.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nBodily functionality and morphology and affective self-control.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nGreater subjective well-being.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nBe able to switch between relaxation and activity --\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nbeing able to go slow when you need to do that, and to speed up.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nAble to switch back and forth more easily\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nwould be a neat thing to be able to do --\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\neasier to achieve the flow state,\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nwhen you're totally immersed in something you are doing.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nConscientiousness and sympathy.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nThe ability to -- it's another interesting application\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nthat would have large social ramification, perhaps.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nIf you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nundiminished through time,\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nso that wouldn't have to -- love would never have to fade if you didn't want it to.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nThat's probably not all that difficult.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nIt might just be a simple hormone or something that could do this.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nIt's been done in voles.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nYou can engineer a prairie vole to become monogamous\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nwhen it's naturally polygamous.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nIt's just a single gene.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nMight be more complicated in humans, but perhaps not that much.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nThis is the last picture that I want to --\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nnow we've got to use the laser pointer.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nA possible mode of being here would be a way of life --\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:10.958\na way of being, experiencing, thinking, seeing,\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\ninteracting with the world.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nDown here in this little corner, here, we have the little sub-space\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nof this larger space that is accessible to human beings --\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nbeings with our biological capacities.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nIt's a part of the space that's accessible to animals;\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nsince we are animals, we are a subset of that.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nAnd then you can imagine some enhancements of human capacities.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nThere would be different modes of being you could experience\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nif you were able to stay alive for, say, 200 years.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nThen you could live sorts of lives and accumulate wisdoms\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nthat are just not possible for humans as we currently are.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nSo then, you move off to this larger sphere of \"human +,\"\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nand you could continue that process and eventually\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nexplore a lot of this larger space of possible modes of being.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nNow, why is that a good thing to do?\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nWell, we know already that in this little human circle there,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nthere are these enormously wonderful and worthwhile modes of being --\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nhuman life at its best is wonderful.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nWe have no reason to believe that within this much, much larger space\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nthere would not also be extremely worthwhile modes of being,\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nperhaps ones that would be way beyond our wildest ability\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\neven to imagine or dream about.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nAnd so, to fix this third problem,\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nI think we need -- slowly, carefully, with ethical wisdom and constraint --\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:41.958\ndevelop the means that enable us to go out in this larger space and explore it\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nand find the great values that might hide there.\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nThanks."}]

[{"title": "Adventures in Twitter fiction", "duration": "715", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_fitzgerald_adventures_in_twitter_fiction", "transcript": "So in my free time outside of Twitter I experiment a little bit with telling stories online, experimenting with what we can do with new digital tools. And in my job at Twitter, I actually spent a little bit of time working with authors and storytellers as well, helping to expand out the bounds of what people are experimenting with. And I want to talk through some examples today of things that people have done that I think are really fascinating using flexible identity and anonymity on the web and blurring the lines between fact and fiction.But I want to start and go back to the 1930s. Long before a little thing called Twitter, radio brought us broadcasts and connected millions of people to single points of broadcast. And from those single points emanated stories. Some of them were familiar stories. Some of them were new stories. And for a while they were familiar formats, but then radio began to evolve its own unique formats specific to that medium. Think about episodes that happened live on radio.Combining the live play and the serialization of written fiction, you get this new format. And the reason why I bring up radio is that I think radio is a great example of how a new medium defines new formats which then define new stories.And of course, today, we have an entirely new medium to play with, which is this online world. This is the map of verified users on Twitter and the connections between them. There are thousands upon thousands of them. Every single one of these points is its own broadcaster. We've gone to this world of many to many, where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting. And I think that we should start to see wildly new formats emerge as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium. I actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation, if you will, that we've explored and begun to settle this wild land of the Internet and are now just getting ready to start to build structures on it, and those structures are the new formats of storytelling that the Internet will allow us to create.I believe this starts with an evolution of existing methods. The short story, for example, people are saying that the short story is experiencing a renaissance of sorts thanks to e-readers, digital marketplaces. One writer, Hugh Howey, experimented with short stories on Amazon by releasing one very short story called \"Wool.\" And he actually says that he didn't intend for \"Wool\" to become a series, but that the audience loved the first story so much they demanded more, and so he gave them more. He gave them \"Wool 2,\" which was a little bit longer than the first one, \"Wool 3,\" which was even longer, culminating in \"Wool 5,\" which was a 60,000-word novel. I think Howey was able to do all of this because he had the quick feedback system of e-books. He was able to write and publish in relatively short order. There was no mediator between him and the audience. It was just him directly connected with his audience and building on the feedback and enthusiasm that they were giving him. So this whole project was an experiment. It started with the one short story, and I think the experimentation actually became a part of Howey's format. And that's something that this medium enabled, was experimentation being a part of the format itself.This is a short story by the author Jennifer Egan called \"Black Box.\" It was originally written specifically with Twitter in mind. Egan convinced The New Yorker to start a New Yorker fiction account from which they could tweet all of these lines that she created. Now Twitter, of course, has a 140-character limit. Egan mocked that up just writing manually in this storyboard sketchbook, used the physical space constraints of those storyboard squares to write each individual tweet, and those tweets ended up becoming over 600 of them that were serialized by The New Yorker. Every night, at 8 p.m., you could tune in to a short story from The New Yorker's fiction account. I think that's pretty exciting: tune-in literary fiction. The experience of Egan's story, of course, like anything on Twitter, there were multiple ways to experience it. You could scroll back through it, but interestingly, if you were watching it live, there was this suspense that built because the actual tweets, you had no control over when you would read them. They were coming at a pretty regular clip, but as the story was building, normally, as a reader, you control how fast you move through a text, but in this case, The New Yorker did, and they were sending you bit by bit by bit, and you had this suspense of waiting for the next line.Another great example of fiction and the short story on Twitter, Elliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called \"Evidence.\" It began with this tweet: \"On November 28 at 10:13 p.m., a woman identified as Miranda Brown, 44, of Brooklyn, fell to her death from the roof of a Manhattan hotel.\" It begins in Elliott's voice, but then Elliott's voice recedes, and we hear the voices of Elsa, Margot and Simon, characters that Elliott created on Twitter specifically to tell this story, a story from multiple perspectives leading up to this moment at 10:13 p.m. when this woman falls to her death. These three characters brought an authentic vision from multiple perspectives. One reviewer called Elliott's story \"Twitter fiction done right,\" because she did. She captured that voice and she had multiple characters and it happened in real time. Interestingly, though, it wasn't just Twitter as a distribution mechanism. It was also Twitter as a production mechanism. Elliott told me later she wrote the whole thing with her thumbs. She laid on the couch and just went back and forth between different characters tweeting out each line, line by line. I think that this kind of spontaneous creation of what was coming out of the characters' voices really lent an authenticity to the characters themselves, but also to this format that she had created of multiple perspectives in a single story on Twitter.As you begin to play with flexible identity online, it gets even more interesting as you start to interact with the real world. Things like Invisible Obama or the famous \"binders full of women\" that came up during the 2012 election cycle, or even the fan fiction universe of \"West Wing\" Twitter in which you have all of these accounts for every single one of the characters in \"The West Wing,\" including the bird that taps at Josh Lyman's window in one single episode. (Laughter)All of these are rapid iterations on a theme. They are creative people experimenting with the bounds of what is possible in this medium. You look at something like \"West Wing\" Twitter, in which you have these fictional characters that engage with the real world. They comment on politics, they cry out against the evils of Congress. Keep in mind, they're all Democrats. And they engage with the real world. They respond to it. So once you take flexible identity, anonymity, engagement with the real world, and you move beyond simple homage or parody and you put these tools to work in telling a story, that's when things get really interesting.So during the Chicago mayoral election there was a parody account. It was Mayor Emanuel. It gave you everything you wanted from Rahm Emanuel, particularly in the expletive department. This foul-mouthed account followed the daily activities of the race, providing commentary as it went. It followed all of the natural tropes of a good, solid Twitter parody account, but then started to get weird. And as it progressed, it moved from this commentary to a multi-week, real-time science fiction epic in which your protagonist, Rahm Emanuel, engages in multi-dimensional travel on election day, which is \u2014 it didn't actually happen. I double checked the newspapers.And then, very interestingly, it came to an end. This is something that doesn't usually happen with a Twitter parody account. It ended, a true narrative conclusion. And so the author, Dan Sinker, who was a journalist, who was completely anonymous this whole time, I think Dan \u2014 it made a lot of sense for him to turn this into a book, because it was a narrative format in the end, and I think that turning it into a book is representative of this idea that he had created something new that needed to be translated into previous formats.One of my favorite examples of something that's happening on Twitter right now, actually, is the very absurdist Crimer Show. Crimer Show tells the story of a supercriminal and a hapless detective that face off in this exceptionally strange lingo, with all of the tropes of a television show. Crimer Show's creator has said that it is a parody of a popular type of show in the U.K., but, man, is it weird. And there are all these times where Crimer, the supercriminal, does all of these TV things. He's always taking off his sunglasses or turning to the camera, but these things just happen in text. I think borrowing all of these tropes from television and additionally presenting each Crimer Show as an episode, spelled E-P-P-A-S-O-D, \"eppasod,\" presenting them as episodes really, it creates something new. There is a new \"eppasod\" of Crimer Show on Twitter pretty much every day, and they're archived that way. And I think this is an interesting experiment in format. Something totally new has been created here out of parodying something on television.I think in nonfiction real-time storytelling, there are a lot of really excellent examples as well. RealTimeWWII is an account that documents what was happening on this day 60 years ago in exceptional detail, as if you were reading the news reports from that day. And the author Teju Cole has done a lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist on events of the news. In this particular case, he's talking about drone strikes. I think that in both of these examples, you're beginning to see ways in which people are telling stories with nonfiction content that can be built into new types of fictional storytelling.So with real-time storytelling, blurring the lines between fact and fiction, the real world and the digital world, flexible identity, anonymity, these are all tools that we have accessible to us, and I think that they're just the building blocks. They are the bits that we use to create the structures, the frames, that then become our settlements on this wide open frontier for creative experimentation.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1841,

he actually says that he didn't intend\n\n00:02:55.183 --> 00:02:56.528\nfor \"Wool\" to become a series,\n\n00:02:56.528 --> 00:02:59.154\nbut that the audience loved the first story so much\n\n00:02:59.154 --> 00:03:01.565\nthey demanded more, and so he gave them more.\n\n00:03:01.565 --> 00:03:05.069\nHe gave them \"Wool 2,\" which was a little bit longer than the first one,\n\n00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.063\n\"Wool 3,\" which was even longer,\n\n00:03:07.063 --> 00:03:08.853\nculminating in \"Wool 5,\"\n\n00:03:08.853 --> 00:03:11.694\nwhich was a 60,000-word novel.\n\n00:03:11.694 --> 00:03:15.679\nI think Howey was able to do all of this because\n\n00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:18.622\nhe had the quick feedback system of e-books.\n\n00:03:18.622 --> 00:03:20.424\nHe was able to write and publish\n\n00:03:20.424 --> 00:03:22.013\nin relatively short order.\n\n00:03:22.013 --> 00:03:25.110\nThere was no mediator between him and the audience.\n\n00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.916\nIt was just him directly connected with his audience\n\n00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:30.065\nand building on the feedback and enthusiasm\n\n00:03:30.065 --> 00:03:31.886\nthat they were giving him.\n\n00:03:31.886 --> 00:03:33.771\nSo this whole project was an experiment.\n\n00:03:33.771 --> 00:03:35.878\nIt started with the one short story,\n\n00:03:35.878 --> 00:03:38.007\nand I think the experimentation actually became\n\n00:03:38.007 --> 00:03:40.335\na part of Howey's format.\n\n00:03:40.335 --> 00:03:43.574\nAnd that's something that this medium enabled,\n\n00:03:43.574 --> 00:03:47.751\nwas experimentation being a part of the format itself.\n\n00:03:47.751 --> 00:03:50.922\nThis is a short story by the author Jennifer Egan\n\n00:03:50.922 --> 00:03:52.370\ncalled \"Black Box.\"\n\n00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.877\nIt was originally written\n\n00:03:53.877 --> 00:03:55.558\nspecifically with Twitter in mind.\n\n00:03:55.558 --> 00:03:57.867\nEgan convinced The New Yorker\n\n00:03:57.867 --> 00:04:00.289\nto start a New Yorker fiction account\n\n00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:02.106\nfrom which they could tweet\n\n00:04:02.106 --> 00:04:03.910\nall of these lines that she created.\n\n00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.357\nNow Twitter, of course, has a 140-character limit.\n\n00:04:07.357 --> 00:04:10.198\nEgan mocked that up just writing manually\n\n00:04:10.198 --> 00:04:13.114\nin this storyboard sketchbook,\n\n00:04:13.114 --> 00:04:16.101\nused the physical space constraints\n\n00:04:16.101 --> 00:04:17.610\nof those storyboard squares\n\n00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.411\nto write each individual tweet,\n\n00:04:19.411 --> 00:04:22.350\nand those tweets ended up becoming\n\n00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.038\nover 600 of them that were serialized by The New Yorker.\n\n00:04:26.038 --> 00:04:29.808\nEvery night, at 8 p.m., you could tune in\n\n00:04:29.808 --> 00:04:33.376\nto a short story from The New Yorker's fiction account.\n\n00:04:33.376 --> 00:04:34.920\nI think that's pretty exciting:\n\n00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.426\ntune-in literary fiction.\n\n00:04:37.426 --> 00:04:40.487\nThe experience of Egan's story, of course,\n\n00:04:40.487 --> 00:04:43.536\nlike anything on Twitter, there were multiple ways to experience it.\n\n00:04:43.536 --> 00:04:45.075\nYou could scroll back through it,\n\n00:04:45.075 --> 00:04:47.958\nbut interestingly, if you were watching it live,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.589\nthere was this suspense that built\n\n00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:53.106\nbecause the actual tweets,\n\n00:04:53.106 --> 00:04:55.409\nyou had no control over when you would read them.\n\n00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:57.849\nThey were coming at a pretty regular clip,\n\n00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.227\nbut as the story was building,\n\n00:05:00.227 --> 00:05:03.470\nnormally, as a reader, you control how fast you move through a text,\n\n00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.781\nbut in this case, The New Yorker did,\n\n00:05:05.781 --> 00:05:08.951\nand they were sending you bit by bit by bit,\n\n00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:12.233\nand you had this suspense of waiting for the next line.\n\n00:05:12.233 --> 00:05:15.304\nAnother great example of fiction\n\n00:05:15.304 --> 00:05:17.348\nand the short story on Twitter,\n\n00:05:17.348 --> 00:05:20.771\nElliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called \"Evidence.\"\n\n00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:23.401\nIt began with this tweet: \"On November 28\n\n00:05:23.401 --> 00:05:25.552\nat 10:13 p.m.,\n\n00:05:25.552 --> 00:05:27.627\na woman identified as Miranda Brown,\n\n00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:30.457\n44, of Brooklyn, fell to her death\n\n00:05:30.457 --> 00:05:32.823\nfrom the roof of a Manhattan hotel.\"\n\n00:05:32.823 --> 00:05:34.553\nIt begins in Elliott's voice,\n\n00:05:34.553 --> 00:05:36.294\nbut then Elliott's voice recedes,\n\n00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:39.676\nand we hear the voices of Elsa, Margot and Simon,\n\n00:05:39.676 --> 00:05:42.775\ncharacters that Elliott created on Twitter\n\n00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:44.504\nspecifically to tell this story,\n\n00:05:44.504 --> 00:05:47.118\na story from multiple perspectives\n\n00:05:47.118 --> 00:05:50.243\nleading up to this moment at 10:13 p.m.\n\n00:05:50.243 --> 00:05:52.521\nwhen this woman falls to her death.\n\n00:05:52.521 --> 00:05:55.625\nThese three characters brought an authentic vision\n\n00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:57.347\nfrom multiple perspectives.\n\n00:05:57.347 --> 00:05:59.673\nOne reviewer called Elliott's story\n\n00:05:59.673 --> 00:06:02.563\n\"Twitter fiction done right,\" because she did.\n\n00:06:02.563 --> 00:06:04.291\nShe captured that voice\n\n00:06:04.291 --> 00:06:07.479\nand she had multiple characters and it happened in real time.\n\n00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.178\nInterestingly, though, it wasn't just\n\n00:06:10.178 --> 00:06:12.342\nTwitter as a distribution mechanism.\n\n00:06:12.342 --> 00:06:14.486\nIt was also Twitter as a production mechanism.\n\n00:06:14.486 --> 00:06:15.730\nElliott told me later\n\n00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.777\nshe wrote the whole thing with her thumbs.\n\n00:06:19.777 --> 00:06:23.580\nShe laid on the couch and just went back and forth\n\n00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.429\nbetween different characters\n\n00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:28.042\ntweeting out each line, line by line.\n\n00:06:28.042 --> 00:06:30.795\nI think that this kind of spontaneous creation\n\n00:06:30.795 --> 00:06:33.311\nof what was coming out of the characters' voices\n\n00:06:33.311 --> 00:06:36.420\nreally lent an authenticity to the characters themselves,\n\n00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.098\nbut also to this format that she had created\n\n00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:43.711\nof multiple perspectives in a single story on Twitter.\n\n00:06:43.711 --> 00:06:46.438\nAs you begin to play with flexible identity online,\n\n00:06:46.438 --> 00:06:47.735\nit gets even more interesting\n\n00:06:47.735 --> 00:06:49.680\nas you start to interact with the real world.\n\n00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.584\nThings like Invisible Obama\n\n00:06:51.584 --> 00:06:53.825\nor the famous \"binders full of women\"\n\n00:06:53.825 --> 00:06:56.371\nthat came up during the 2012 election cycle,\n\n00:06:56.371 --> 00:07:00.542\nor even the fan fiction universe of \"West Wing\" Twitter\n\n00:07:00.542 --> 00:07:02.652\nin which you have all of these accounts\n\n00:07:02.652 --> 00:07:05.628\nfor every single one of the characters in \"The West Wing,\"\n\n00:07:05.628 --> 00:07:09.531\nincluding the bird that taps at Josh Lyman's window\n\n00:07:09.531 --> 00:07:13.667\nin one single episode. (Laughter)\n\n00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:16.803\nAll of these are rapid iterations on a theme.\n\n00:07:16.803 --> 00:07:19.119\nThey are creative people experimenting\n\n00:07:19.119 --> 00:07:22.175\nwith the bounds of what is possible in this medium.\n\n00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:23.928\nYou look at something like \"West Wing\" Twitter,\n\n00:07:23.928 --> 00:07:26.328\nin which you have these fictional characters\n\n00:07:26.328 --> 00:07:28.286\nthat engage with the real world.\n\n00:07:28.286 --> 00:07:30.078\nThey comment on politics,\n\n00:07:30.078 --> 00:07:34.612\nthey cry out against the evils of Congress.\n\n00:07:34.612 --> 00:07:36.396\nKeep in mind, they're all Democrats.\n\n00:07:36.396 --> 00:07:39.716\nAnd they engage with the real world.\n\n00:07:39.716 --> 00:07:41.574\nThey respond to it.\n\n00:07:41.574 --> 00:07:43.719\nSo once you take flexible identity,\n\n00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:46.418\nanonymity, engagement with the real world,\n\n00:07:46.418 --> 00:07:49.589\nand you move beyond simple homage or parody\n\n00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:53.178\nand you put these tools to work in telling a story,\n\n00:07:53.178 --> 00:07:55.061\nthat's when things get really interesting.\n\n00:07:55.061 --> 00:07:57.870\nSo during the Chicago mayoral election\n\n00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.438\nthere was a parody account.\n\n00:07:59.438 --> 00:08:00.852\nIt was Mayor Emanuel.\n\n00:08:00.852 --> 00:08:04.318\nIt gave you everything you wanted from Rahm Emanuel,\n\n00:08:04.318 --> 00:08:07.638\nparticularly in the expletive department.\n\n00:08:07.638 --> 00:08:09.717\nThis foul-mouthed account\n\n00:08:09.717 --> 00:08:13.604\nfollowed the daily activities of the race,\n\n00:08:13.604 --> 00:08:15.284\nproviding commentary as it went.\n\n00:08:15.284 --> 00:08:17.765\nIt followed all of the natural tropes\n\n00:08:17.765 --> 00:08:20.147\nof a good, solid Twitter parody account,\n\n00:08:20.147 --> 00:08:23.829\nbut then started to get weird.\n\n00:08:23.829 --> 00:08:27.202\nAnd as it progressed, it moved from this commentary\n\n00:08:27.202 --> 00:08:32.470\nto a multi-week, real-time science fiction epic\n\n00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.558\nin which your protagonist, Rahm Emanuel,\n\n00:08:35.558 --> 00:08:39.715\nengages in multi-dimensional travel on election day,\n\n00:08:39.715 --> 00:08:42.328\nwhich is -- it didn't actually happen.\n\n00:08:42.328 --> 00:08:45.746\nI double checked the newspapers.\n\n00:08:45.746 --> 00:08:49.289\nAnd then, very interestingly, it came to an end.\n\n00:08:49.289 --> 00:08:51.288\nThis is something that doesn't usually happen\n\n00:08:51.288 --> 00:08:52.749\nwith a Twitter parody account.\n\n00:08:52.749 --> 00:08:56.478\nIt ended, a true narrative conclusion.\n\n00:08:56.478 --> 00:08:59.700\nAnd so the author, Dan Sinker, who was a journalist,\n\n00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.035\nwho was completely anonymous this whole time,\n\n00:09:02.035 --> 00:09:05.733\nI think Dan -- it made a lot of sense for him\n\n00:09:05.733 --> 00:09:07.317\nto turn this into a book,\n\n00:09:07.317 --> 00:09:10.690\nbecause it was a narrative format in the end,\n\n00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.251\nand I think that turning it into a book\n\n00:09:13.251 --> 00:09:16.949\nis representative of this idea that he had created something new\n\n00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:20.575\nthat needed to be translated into previous formats.\n\n00:09:20.575 --> 00:09:22.668\nOne of my favorite examples\n\n00:09:22.668 --> 00:09:24.664\nof something that's happening on Twitter right now,\n\n00:09:24.664 --> 00:09:29.440\nactually, is the very absurdist Crimer Show.\n\n00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.872\nCrimer Show tells the story\n\n00:09:31.872 --> 00:09:34.613\nof a supercriminal and a hapless detective\n\n00:09:34.613 --> 00:09:38.298\nthat face off in this exceptionally strange lingo,\n\n00:09:38.298 --> 00:09:40.720\nwith all of the tropes of a television show.\n\n00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.257\nCrimer Show's creator has said that\n\n00:09:42.257 --> 00:09:47.249\nit is a parody of a popular type of show in the U.K.,\n\n00:09:47.249 --> 00:09:50.107\nbut, man, is it weird.\n\n00:09:50.107 --> 00:09:52.078\nAnd there are all these times where Crimer,\n\n00:09:52.078 --> 00:09:54.507\nthe supercriminal, does all of these TV things.\n\n00:09:54.507 --> 00:09:56.759\nHe's always taking off his sunglasses\n\n00:09:56.759 --> 00:09:59.727\nor turning to the camera,\n\n00:09:59.727 --> 00:10:02.167\nbut these things just happen in text.\n\n00:10:02.167 --> 00:10:05.001\nI think borrowing all of these tropes from television\n\n00:10:05.001 --> 00:10:08.753\nand additionally presenting each Crimer Show\n\n00:10:08.753 --> 00:10:13.986\nas an episode, spelled E-P-P-A-S-O-D, \"eppasod,\"\n\n00:10:13.986 --> 00:10:16.035\npresenting them as episodes\n\n00:10:16.035 --> 00:10:19.065\nreally, it creates something new.\n\n00:10:19.065 --> 00:10:22.654\nThere is a new \"eppasod\" of Crimer Show\n\n00:10:22.654 --> 00:10:24.778\non Twitter pretty much every day,\n\n00:10:24.778 --> 00:10:26.390\nand they're archived that way.\n\n00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:29.171\nAnd I think this is an interesting experiment in format.\n\n00:10:29.171 --> 00:10:31.455\nSomething totally new has been created here\n\n00:10:31.455 --> 00:10:34.991\nout of parodying something on television.\n\n00:10:34.991 --> 00:10:37.831\nI think in nonfiction real-time storytelling,\n\n00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:40.598\nthere are a lot of really excellent examples as well.\n\n00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:42.547\nRealTimeWWII is an account\n\n00:10:42.547 --> 00:10:46.610\nthat documents what was happening on this day 60 years ago\n\n00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:48.979\nin exceptional detail, as if\n\n00:10:48.979 --> 00:10:51.708\nyou were reading the news reports from that day.\n\n00:10:51.708 --> 00:10:53.463\nAnd the author Teju Cole has done\n\n00:10:53.463 --> 00:10:56.874\na lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist\n\n00:10:56.874 --> 00:10:58.502\non events of the news.\n\n00:10:58.502 --> 00:11:02.945\nIn this particular case, he's talking about drone strikes.\n\n00:11:02.945 --> 00:11:05.545\nI think that in both of these examples,\n\n00:11:05.545 --> 00:11:07.186\nyou're beginning to see ways in which\n\n00:11:07.186 --> 00:11:10.010\npeople are telling stories with nonfiction content\n\n00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.919\nthat can be built into new types\n\n00:11:12.919 --> 00:11:15.480\nof fictional storytelling.\n\n00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.042\nSo with real-time storytelling,\n\n00:11:18.042 --> 00:11:20.571\nblurring the lines between fact and fiction,\n\n00:11:20.571 --> 00:11:22.648\nthe real world and the digital world,\n\n00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:26.430\nflexible identity, anonymity,\n\n00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:29.951\nthese are all tools that we have accessible to us,\n\n00:11:29.951 --> 00:11:31.843\nand I think that they're just the building blocks.\n\n00:11:31.843 --> 00:11:34.481\nThey are the bits that we use\n\n00:11:34.481 --> 00:11:37.118\nto create the structures, the frames,\n\n00:11:37.118 --> 00:11:40.216\nthat then become our settlements on this\n\n00:11:40.216 --> 00:11:42.976\nwide open frontier for creative experimentation.\n\n00:11:42.976 --> 00:11:44.427\nThank you.\n\n00:11:44.427 --> 00:11:49.181\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The walkable city", "duration": "1016", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_speck_the_walkable_city", "transcript": "So I'm a city planner, an urban designer, former arts advocate, trained in architecture and art history, and I want to talk to you today not about design but about America and how America can be more economically resilient, how America can be healthier, and how America can be more environmentally sustainable. And I realize this is a global forum, but I think I need to talk about America because there is a history, in some places, not all, of American ideas being appropriated, being emulated, for better or for worse, around the world.And the worst idea we've ever had is suburban sprawl. It's being emulated in many places as we speak. By suburban sprawl, I refer to the reorganization of the landscape and the creation of the landscape around the requirement of automobile use, and that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom has become a gas-belching, time-wasting and life-threatening prosthetic device that many of us need just to, most Americans, in fact, need, just to live their daily lives. And there's an alternative. You know, we say, half the world is living in cities. Well, in America, that living in cities, for many of them, they're living in cities still where they're dependent on that automobile. And what I work for, and to do, is to make our cities more walkable. But I can't give design arguments for that that will have as much impact as the arguments that I've learned from the economists, the epidemiologists and the environmentalists. So these are the three arguments that I'm going to give you quickly today.When I was growing up in the '70s, the typical American spent one tenth of their income, American family, on transportation. Since then, we've doubled the number of roads in America, and we now spend one fifth of our income on transportation. Working families, which are defined as earning between 20,000 and 50,000 dollars a year in America are spending more now on transportation than on housing, slightly more, because of this phenomenon called \"drive till you qualify,\" finding homes further and further and further from the city centers and from their jobs, so that they're locked in this, two, three hours, four hours a day of commuting. And these are the neighborhoods, for example, in the Central Valley of California that weren't hurt when the housing bubble burst and when the price of gas went up; they were decimated. And in fact, these are many of the half-vacant communities that you see today. Imagine putting everything you have into your mortgage, it goes underwater, and you have to pay twice as much for all the driving that you're doing.So we know what it's done to our society and all the extra work we have to do to support our cars. What happens when a city decides it's going to set other priorities? And probably the best example we have here in America is Portland, Oregon. Portland made a bunch of decisions in the 1970s that began to distinguish it from almost every other American city. While most other cities were growing an undifferentiated spare tire of sprawl, they instituted an urban growth boundary. While most cities were reaming out their roads, removing parallel parking and trees in order to flow more traffic, they instituted a skinny streets program. And while most cities were investing in more roads and more highways, they actually invested in bicycling and in walking. And they spent 60 million dollars on bike facilities, which seems like a lot of money, but it was spent over about 30 years, so two million dollars a year \u2014 not that much \u2014 and half the price of the one cloverleaf that they decided to rebuild in that city. These changes and others like them changed the way that Portlanders live, and their vehicle-miles traveled per day, the amount that each person drives, actually peaked in 1996, has been dropping ever since, and they now drive 20 percent less than the rest of the country. The typical Portland citizen drives four miles less, and 11 minutes less per day than they did before. The economist Joe Cortright did the math and he found out that those four miles plus those 11 minutes adds up to fully three and a half percent of all income earned in the region.So if they're not spending that money on driving \u2014 and by the way, 85 percent of the money we spend on driving leaves the local economy \u2014 if they're not spending that money on driving, what are they spending it on? Well, Portland is reputed to have the most roof racks per capita, the most independent bookstores per capita, the most strip clubs per capita. These are all exaggerations, slight exaggerations of a fundamental truth, which is Portlanders spend a lot more on recreation of all kinds than the rest of America. Actually, Oregonians spend more on alcohol than most other states, which may be a good thing or a bad thing, but it makes you glad they're driving less.(Laughter)But actually, they're spending most of it in their homes, and home investment is about as local an investment as you can get. But there's a whole other Portland story, which isn't part of this calculus, which is that young, educated people have been moving to Portland in droves, so that between the last two censuses, they had a 50-percent increase in college-educated millennials, which is five times what you saw anywhere else in the country, or, I should say, of the national average.So on the one hand, a city saves money for its residents by being more walkable and more bikeable, but on the other hand, it also is the cool kind of city that people want to be in these days. So the best economic strategy you can have as a city is not the old way of trying to attract corporations and trying to have a biotech cluster or a medical cluster, or an aerospace cluster, but to become a place where people want to be. And millennials, certainly, these engines of entrepreneurship, 64 percent of whom decide first where they want to live, then they move there, then they look for a job, they will come to your city.The health argument is a scary one, and you've probably heard part of this argument before. Again, back in the '70s, a lot's changed since then, back in the '70s, one in 10 Americans was obese. Now one out of three Americans is obese, and a second third of the population is overweight. Twenty-five percent of young men and 40 percent of young women are too heavy to enlist in our own military forces. According to the Center for Disease Control, fully one third of all children born after 2000 will get diabetes. We have the first generation of children in America who are predicted to live shorter lives than their parents.I believe that this American healthcare crisis that we've all heard about is an urban design crisis, and that the design of our cities lies at the cure. Because we've talked a long time about diet, and we know that diet impacts weight, and weight of course impacts health. But we've only started talking about inactivity, and how inactivity born of our landscape, inactivity that comes from the fact that we live in a place where there is no longer any such thing as a useful walk, is driving our weight up. And we finally have the studies, one in Britain called \"Gluttony versus sloth\" that tracked weight against diet and tracked weight against inactivity, and found a much higher, stronger correlation between the latter two. Dr. James Levine at, in this case, the aptly-named Mayo Clinic put his test subjects in electronic underwear, held their diet steady, and then started pumping the calories in. Some people gained weight, some people didn't gain weight. Expecting some metabolic or DNA factor at work, they were shocked to learn that the only difference between the subjects that they could figure out was the amount they were moving, and that in fact those who gained weight were sitting, on average, two hours more per day than those who didn't.So we have these studies that tie weight to inactivity, but even more, we now have studies that tie weight to where you live. Do you live in a more walkable city or do you live in a less walkable city, or where in your city do you live? In San Diego, they used Walk Score \u2014 Walk Score rates every address in America and soon the world in terms of how walkable it is \u2014 they used Walk Score to designate more walkable neighborhoods and less walkable neighborhoods. Well guess what? If you lived in a more walkable neighborhood, you were 35 percent likely to be overweight. If you lived in a less walkable neighborhood, you were 60 percent likely to be overweight. So we have study after study now that's tying where you live to your health, particularly as in America, the biggest health crisis we have is this one that's stemming from environmental-induced inactivity. And I learned a new word last week. They call these neighborhoods \"obesageneric.\" I may have that wrong, but you get the idea.Now that's one thing, of course. Briefly mentioning, we have an asthma epidemic in this country. You probably haven't thought that much about it. Fourteen Americans die each day from asthma, three times what it was in the '90s, and it's almost all coming from car exhaust. American pollution does not come from factories anymore, it comes from tailpipes, and the amount that people are driving in your city, your urban VMT, is a good prediction of the asthma problems in your city.And then finally, in terms of driving, there's the issue of the single-largest killer of healthy adults, and one of the largest killers of all people, is car crashes. And we take car crashes for granted. We figure it's a natural risk of being on the road. But in fact, here in America, 12 people out of every 100,000 die every year from car crashes. We're pretty safe here. Well, guess what? In England, it's seven per 100,000. It's Japan, it's four per 100,000. Do you know where it's three per 100,000? New York City. San Francisco, the same thing. Portland, the same thing. Oh, so cities make us safer because we're driving less? Tulsa: 14 per 100,000. Orlando: 20 per 100,000. It's not whether you're in the city or not, it's how is your city designed? Was it designed around cars or around people? Because if your city is designed around cars, it's really good at smashing them into each other.That's part of a much larger health argument.Finally, the environmental argument is fascinating, because the environmentalists turned on a dime about 10 years ago. The environmental movement in America has historically been an anti-city movement from Jefferson on.\"Cities are pestilential to the health, to the liberties, to the morals of man. If we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities, as they do in Europe, we shall become as corrupt as they are in Europe and take to eating one another as they do there.\"He apparently had a sense of humor.And then the American environmental movement has been a classically Arcadian movement. To become more environmental, we move into the country, we commune with nature, we build suburbs. But, of course, we've seen what that does.The carbon mapping of America, where is the CO2 being emitted, for many years only hammered this argument in more strongly. If you look at any carbon map, because we map it per square mile, any carbon map of the U.S., it looks like a night sky satellite photo of the U.S., hottest in the cities, cooler in the suburbs, dark, peaceful in the countryside. Until some economists said, you know, is that the right way to measure CO2? There are only so many people in this country at any given time, and we can choose to live where perhaps we would have a lighter impact. And they said, let's measure CO2 per household, and when they did that, the maps just flipped, coolest in the center city, warmer in the suburbs, and red hot in these exurban \"drive till you qualify\" neighborhoods. So a fundamental shift, and now you have environmentalists and economists like Ed Glaeser saying we are a destructive species. If you love nature, the best thing you can do is stay the heck away from it, move to a city, and the denser the better, and the denser cities like Manhattan are the cities that perform the best. So the average Manhattanite is consuming gasoline at the rate the rest of the nation hasn't seen since the '20s, consuming half of the electricity of Dallas. But of course, we can do better. Canadian cities, they consume half the gasoline of American cities. European cities consume half as much again. So obviously, we can do better, and we want to do better, and we're all trying to be green.My final argument in this topic is that I think we're trying to be green the wrong way, and I'm one of many people who believes that this focus on gadgets, on accessorizing \u2014 What can I add to my house, what can I add to what I've already got to make my lifestyle more sustainable? \u2014 has kind of dominated the discussion. So I'm not immune to this. My wife and I built a new house on an abandoned lot in Washington, D.C., and we did our best to clear the shelves of the sustainability store. We've got the solar photovoltaic system, solar hot water heater, dual-flush toilets, bamboo floors. A log burning in my German high-tech stove apparently, supposedly, contributes less carbon to the atmosphere than were it left alone to decompose in the forest. Yet all of these innovations \u2014 That's what they said in the brochure. (Laughter) All of these innovations together contribute a fraction of what we contribute by living in a walkable neighborhood three blocks from a metro in the heart of a city. We've changed all our light bulbs to energy-savers, and you should do the same thing, but changing all your light bulbs to energy-savers saves as much energy in a year as moving to a walkable city does in a week.And we don't want to have this argument. Politicians and marketers are afraid of marketing green as a \"lifestyle choice.\" You don't want to tell Americans, God forbid, that they have to change their lifestyle. But what if lifestyle was really about quality of life and about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more, something that would be better than what we have right now?Well, the gold standard of quality of life rankings, it's called the Mercer Survey. You may have heard of it. They rank hundreds of nations worldwide according to 10 criteria that they believe add up to quality of life: health, economics, education, housing, you name it. There's six more. Short talk.(Laughter)And it's very interesting to see that the highest-ranking American city, Honolulu, number 28, is followed by kind of the usual suspects of Seattle and Boston and all walkable cities. The driving cities in the Sun Belt, the Dallases and the Phoenixes and, sorry, Atlanta, these cities are not appearing on the list. But who's doing even better? The Canadian cities like Vancouver, where again, they're burning half the fuel. And then it's usually won by cities where they speak German, like Dusseldorf or Vienna, where they're burning, again, half as much fuel. And you see this alignment, this strange alignment.Is being more sustainble what gives you a higher quality of life? I would argue the same thing that makes you more sustainble is what gives you a higher quality of life, and that's living in a walkable neighborhood. So sustainability, which includes our wealth and our health may not be a direct function of our sustainability. But particularly here in America, we are polluting so much because we're throwing away our time and our money and our lives on the highway, then these two problems would seem to share the same solution, which is to make our cities more walkable.Doing so isn't easy, but it can be done, it has been done, and it's being done now in more than a few cities, around the globe and in our country. I take some solace from Winston Churchill, who put it this way: \"The Americans can be counted on to do the right thing once they have exhausted the alternatives.\" (Laughter)Thank you.(Applause)",

arts advocate,\n\n00:00:19.548 --> 00:00:23.341\ntrained in architecture and art history,\n\n00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:26.475\nand I want to talk to you today not about design\n\n00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:28.911\nbut about America\n\n00:00:28.911 --> 00:00:33.116\nand how America can be more economically resilient,\n\n00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:35.441\nhow America can be healthier,\n\n00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:37.094\nand how America can be\n\n00:00:37.094 --> 00:00:39.712\nmore environmentally sustainable.\n\n00:00:39.712 --> 00:00:42.130\nAnd I realize this is a global forum,\n\n00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.199\nbut I think I need to talk about America\n\n00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:45.782\nbecause there is a history,\n\n00:00:45.782 --> 00:00:47.469\nin some places, not all,\n\n00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.919\nof American ideas being appropriated,\n\n00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:52.451\nbeing emulated, for better or for worse,\n\n00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:53.792\naround the world.\n\n00:00:53.792 --> 00:00:55.943\nAnd the worst idea we've ever had\n\n00:00:55.943 --> 00:00:58.310\nis suburban sprawl.\n\n00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.681\nIt's being emulated in many places as we speak.\n\n00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:04.344\nBy suburban sprawl, I refer to the reorganization\n\n00:01:04.344 --> 00:01:06.748\nof the landscape and the creation of the landscape\n\n00:01:06.748 --> 00:01:11.084\naround the requirement of automobile use,\n\n00:01:11.084 --> 00:01:13.727\nand that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom\n\n00:01:13.727 --> 00:01:17.478\nhas become a gas-belching,\n\n00:01:17.478 --> 00:01:20.078\ntime-wasting and life-threatening\n\n00:01:20.078 --> 00:01:21.511\nprosthetic device\n\n00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:23.147\nthat many of us need just to,\n\n00:01:23.147 --> 00:01:24.735\nmost Americans, in fact, need,\n\n00:01:24.735 --> 00:01:27.055\njust to live their daily lives.\n\n00:01:27.055 --> 00:01:28.639\nAnd there's an alternative.\n\n00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:30.227\nYou know, we say, half the world is living in cities.\n\n00:01:30.227 --> 00:01:32.168\nWell, in America, that living in cities,\n\n00:01:32.168 --> 00:01:33.826\nfor many of them, they're living in cities still\n\n00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:36.092\nwhere they're dependent on that automobile.\n\n00:01:36.092 --> 00:01:39.071\nAnd what I work for, and to do,\n\n00:01:39.071 --> 00:01:41.757\nis to make our cities more walkable.\n\n00:01:41.757 --> 00:01:44.280\nBut I can't give design arguments for that\n\n00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.969\nthat will have as much impact\n\n00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:47.885\nas the arguments that I've learned\n\n00:01:47.885 --> 00:01:51.402\nfrom the economists, the epidemiologists\n\n00:01:51.402 --> 00:01:53.118\nand the environmentalists.\n\n00:01:53.118 --> 00:01:54.379\nSo these are the three arguments that I'm going\n\n00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:57.490\nto give you quickly today.\n\n00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.974\nWhen I was growing up in the '70s,\n\n00:01:58.974 --> 00:02:02.609\nthe typical American spent one tenth of their income,\n\n00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:05.848\nAmerican family, on transportation.\n\n00:02:05.848 --> 00:02:08.433\nSince then, we've doubled the number of roads\n\n00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:11.210\nin America, and we now spend one fifth\n\n00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.871\nof our income on transportation.\n\n00:02:13.871 --> 00:02:15.932\nWorking families, which are defined as\n\n00:02:15.932 --> 00:02:17.856\nearning between 20,000 and 50,000 dollars\n\n00:02:17.856 --> 00:02:19.815\na year in America\n\n00:02:19.815 --> 00:02:22.319\nare spending more now on transportation\n\n00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.557\nthan on housing, slightly more,\n\n00:02:24.557 --> 00:02:27.790\nbecause of this phenomenon called \"drive till you qualify,\"\n\n00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.208\nfinding homes further and further and further\n\n00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:33.135\nfrom the city centers and from their jobs,\n\n00:02:33.135 --> 00:02:35.660\nso that they're locked in this, two, three hours,\n\n00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.857\nfour hours a day of commuting.\n\n00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:39.331\nAnd these are the neighborhoods, for example,\n\n00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:41.753\nin the Central Valley of California\n\n00:02:41.753 --> 00:02:44.860\nthat weren't hurt when the housing bubble burst\n\n00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.082\nand when the price of gas went up;\n\n00:02:47.082 --> 00:02:49.350\nthey were decimated.\n\n00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.616\nAnd in fact, these are many\n\n00:02:50.616 --> 00:02:53.219\nof the half-vacant communities that you see today.\n\n00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:56.400\nImagine putting everything you have into your mortgage,\n\n00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.473\nit goes underwater, and you have to pay\n\n00:02:58.473 --> 00:03:02.338\ntwice as much for all the driving that you're doing.\n\n00:03:02.338 --> 00:03:05.058\nSo we know what it's done to our society\n\n00:03:05.058 --> 00:03:07.389\nand all the extra work we have to do\n\n00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.158\nto support our cars.\n\n00:03:09.158 --> 00:03:10.890\nWhat happens when a city decides\n\n00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.164\nit's going to set other priorities?\n\n00:03:13.164 --> 00:03:15.136\nAnd probably the best example we have here\n\n00:03:15.136 --> 00:03:17.547\nin America is Portland, Oregon.\n\n00:03:17.547 --> 00:03:20.886\nPortland made a bunch of decisions in the 1970s\n\n00:03:20.886 --> 00:03:22.584\nthat began to distinguish it\n\n00:03:22.584 --> 00:03:25.120\nfrom almost every other American city.\n\n00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.238\nWhile most other cities were growing\n\n00:03:27.238 --> 00:03:30.373\nan undifferentiated spare tire of sprawl,\n\n00:03:30.373 --> 00:03:33.048\nthey instituted an urban growth boundary.\n\n00:03:33.048 --> 00:03:35.218\nWhile most cities were reaming out their roads,\n\n00:03:35.218 --> 00:03:37.463\nremoving parallel parking and trees\n\n00:03:37.463 --> 00:03:39.664\nin order to flow more traffic,\n\n00:03:39.664 --> 00:03:43.397\nthey instituted a skinny streets program.\n\n00:03:43.397 --> 00:03:47.311\nAnd while most cities were investing in more roads\n\n00:03:47.311 --> 00:03:50.220\nand more highways, they actually invested\n\n00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.697\nin bicycling and in walking.\n\n00:03:52.697 --> 00:03:56.762\nAnd they spent 60 million dollars on bike facilities,\n\n00:03:56.762 --> 00:03:58.195\nwhich seems like a lot of money,\n\n00:03:58.195 --> 00:04:00.711\nbut it was spent over about 30 years,\n\n00:04:00.711 --> 00:04:03.080\nso two million dollars a year -- not that much --\n\n00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.405\nand half the price of the one cloverleaf\n\n00:04:05.405 --> 00:04:08.224\nthat they decided to rebuild in that city.\n\n00:04:08.224 --> 00:04:10.193\nThese changes and others like them changed\n\n00:04:10.193 --> 00:04:12.155\nthe way that Portlanders live,\n\n00:04:12.155 --> 00:04:14.316\nand their vehicle-miles traveled per day,\n\n00:04:14.316 --> 00:04:15.875\nthe amount that each person drives,\n\n00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:18.188\nactually peaked in 1996,\n\n00:04:18.188 --> 00:04:20.289\nhas been dropping ever since,\n\n00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.353\nand they now drive 20 percent less\n\n00:04:22.353 --> 00:04:23.786\nthan the rest of the country.\n\n00:04:23.786 --> 00:04:26.542\nThe typical Portland citizen drives\n\n00:04:26.542 --> 00:04:30.510\nfour miles less, and 11 minutes less per day\n\n00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.832\nthan they did before.\n\n00:04:32.832 --> 00:04:34.819\nThe economist Joe Cortright did the math\n\n00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:36.337\nand he found out that those four miles\n\n00:04:36.337 --> 00:04:37.769\nplus those 11 minutes\n\n00:04:37.769 --> 00:04:39.691\nadds up to fully three and a half percent\n\n00:04:39.691 --> 00:04:42.221\nof all income earned in the region.\n\n00:04:42.221 --> 00:04:44.097\nSo if they're not spending that money on driving --\n\n00:04:44.097 --> 00:04:45.710\nand by the way, 85 percent of the money\n\n00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.304\nwe spend on driving leaves the local economy --\n\n00:04:48.304 --> 00:04:50.179\nif they're not spending that money on driving,\n\n00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:51.950\nwhat are they spending it on?\n\n00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.627\nWell, Portland is reputed to have\n\n00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:56.549\nthe most roof racks per capita,\n\n00:04:56.549 --> 00:04:59.389\nthe most independent bookstores per capita,\n\n00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.633\nthe most strip clubs per capita.\n\n00:05:02.633 --> 00:05:05.269\nThese are all exaggerations, slight exaggerations\n\n00:05:05.269 --> 00:05:06.908\nof a fundamental truth, which is Portlanders\n\n00:05:06.908 --> 00:05:10.106\nspend a lot more on recreation of all kinds\n\n00:05:10.106 --> 00:05:12.132\nthan the rest of America.\n\n00:05:12.132 --> 00:05:14.447\nActually, Oregonians spend more on alcohol\n\n00:05:14.447 --> 00:05:15.787\nthan most other states,\n\n00:05:15.787 --> 00:05:17.352\nwhich may be a good thing or a bad thing,\n\n00:05:17.352 --> 00:05:19.351\nbut it makes you glad they're driving less.\n\n00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:21.724\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:21.724 --> 00:05:25.060\nBut actually, they're spending most of it in their homes,\n\n00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.603\nand home investment is about as local\n\n00:05:27.618 --> 00:05:29.741\nan investment as you can get.\n\n00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:31.152\nBut there's a whole other Portland story,\n\n00:05:31.152 --> 00:05:32.697\nwhich isn't part of this calculus,\n\n00:05:32.697 --> 00:05:35.584\nwhich is that young, educated people\n\n00:05:35.584 --> 00:05:38.036\nhave been moving to Portland in droves,\n\n00:05:38.036 --> 00:05:40.554\nso that between the last two censuses,\n\n00:05:40.554 --> 00:05:42.836\nthey had a 50-percent increase\n\n00:05:42.836 --> 00:05:44.700\nin college-educated millennials,\n\n00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.884\nwhich is five times what you saw anywhere else\n\n00:05:46.884 --> 00:05:50.160\nin the country, or, I should say, of the national average.\n\n00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.473\nSo on the one hand, a city saves money for its residents\n\n00:05:54.473 --> 00:05:57.053\nby being more walkable and more bikeable,\n\n00:05:57.053 --> 00:05:59.888\nbut on the other hand, it also is the cool kind of city\n\n00:05:59.888 --> 00:06:02.706\nthat people want to be in these days.\n\n00:06:02.706 --> 00:06:04.099\nSo the best economic strategy\n\n00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:05.502\nyou can have as a city\n\n00:06:05.502 --> 00:06:09.216\nis not the old way of trying to attract corporations\n\n00:06:09.216 --> 00:06:11.548\nand trying to have a biotech cluster\n\n00:06:11.548 --> 00:06:13.642\nor a medical cluster,\n\n00:06:13.642 --> 00:06:15.051\nor an aerospace cluster,\n\n00:06:15.051 --> 00:06:18.151\nbut to become a place where people want to be.\n\n00:06:18.151 --> 00:06:21.629\nAnd millennials, certainly, these engines of entrepreneurship,\n\n00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:24.470\n64 percent of whom decide first\n\n00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.749\nwhere they want to live,\n\n00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:27.765\nthen they move there, then they look for a job,\n\n00:06:27.765 --> 00:06:30.710\nthey will come to your city.\n\n00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.571\nThe health argument is a scary one,\n\n00:06:33.571 --> 00:06:36.065\nand you've probably heard part of this argument before.\n\n00:06:36.065 --> 00:06:39.032\nAgain, back in the '70s, a lot's changed since then,\n\n00:06:39.032 --> 00:06:42.142\nback in the '70s, one in 10 Americans was obese.\n\n00:06:42.142 --> 00:06:45.741\nNow one out of three Americans is obese,\n\n00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:49.608\nand a second third of the population is overweight.\n\n00:06:49.608 --> 00:06:51.487\nTwenty-five percent of young men\n\n00:06:51.487 --> 00:06:53.408\nand 40 percent of young women are too heavy\n\n00:06:53.408 --> 00:06:57.059\nto enlist in our own military forces.\n\n00:06:57.059 --> 00:06:59.437\nAccording to the Center for Disease Control,\n\n00:06:59.437 --> 00:07:03.234\nfully one third of all children born after 2000\n\n00:07:03.234 --> 00:07:04.934\nwill get diabetes.\n\n00:07:04.934 --> 00:07:06.907\nWe have the first generation of children in America\n\n00:07:06.907 --> 00:07:10.777\nwho are predicted to live shorter lives than their parents.\n\n00:07:10.777 --> 00:07:12.988\nI believe that this American healthcare crisis\n\n00:07:12.988 --> 00:07:14.426\nthat we've all heard about\n\n00:07:14.426 --> 00:07:17.042\nis an urban design crisis,\n\n00:07:17.042 --> 00:07:19.854\nand that the design of our cities lies at the cure.\n\n00:07:19.854 --> 00:07:22.419\nBecause we've talked a long time about diet,\n\n00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:25.173\nand we know that diet impacts weight,\n\n00:07:25.173 --> 00:07:27.485\nand weight of course impacts health.\n\n00:07:27.485 --> 00:07:30.256\nBut we've only started talking about inactivity,\n\n00:07:30.256 --> 00:07:33.448\nand how inactivity born of our landscape,\n\n00:07:33.448 --> 00:07:35.778\ninactivity that comes from the fact that we live\n\n00:07:35.778 --> 00:07:37.647\nin a place where there is no longer any such thing\n\n00:07:37.647 --> 00:07:41.243\nas a useful walk, is driving our weight up.\n\n00:07:41.243 --> 00:07:42.817\nAnd we finally have the studies,\n\n00:07:42.817 --> 00:07:45.503\none in Britain called \"Gluttony versus sloth\"\n\n00:07:45.503 --> 00:07:48.204\nthat tracked weight against diet\n\n00:07:48.204 --> 00:07:50.109\nand tracked weight against inactivity,\n\n00:07:50.109 --> 00:07:52.812\nand found a much higher, stronger correlation\n\n00:07:52.812 --> 00:07:54.860\nbetween the latter two.\n\n00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.877\nDr. James Levine at, in this case,\n\n00:07:56.877 --> 00:07:59.070\nthe aptly-named Mayo Clinic\n\n00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:03.609\nput his test subjects in electronic underwear,\n\n00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:05.602\nheld their diet steady,\n\n00:08:05.602 --> 00:08:07.606\nand then started pumping the calories in.\n\n00:08:07.606 --> 00:08:09.103\nSome people gained weight,\n\n00:08:09.103 --> 00:08:10.480\nsome people didn't gain weight.\n\n00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.946\nExpecting some metabolic or DNA factor at work,\n\n00:08:13.946 --> 00:08:15.650\nthey were shocked to learn that the only difference\n\n00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.532\nbetween the subjects that they could figure out\n\n00:08:17.532 --> 00:08:19.416\nwas the amount they were moving,\n\n00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:21.056\nand that in fact those who gained weight\n\n00:08:21.056 --> 00:08:24.808\nwere sitting, on average, two hours more per day\n\n00:08:24.808 --> 00:08:26.124\nthan those who didn't.\n\n00:08:26.124 --> 00:08:28.067\nSo we have these studies that tie\n\n00:08:28.067 --> 00:08:30.381\nweight to inactivity, but even more,\n\n00:08:30.381 --> 00:08:32.896\nwe now have studies that tie weight to where you live.\n\n00:08:32.896 --> 00:08:34.529\nDo you live in a more walkable city\n\n00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:35.965\nor do you live in a less walkable city,\n\n00:08:35.965 --> 00:08:37.889\nor where in your city do you live?\n\n00:08:37.889 --> 00:08:40.554\nIn San Diego, they used Walk Score --\n\n00:08:40.554 --> 00:08:42.911\nWalk Score rates every address in America\n\n00:08:42.911 --> 00:08:44.550\nand soon the world\n\n00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.939\nin terms of how walkable it is --\n\n00:08:46.939 --> 00:08:49.822\nthey used Walk Score to designate more walkable neighborhoods\n\n00:08:49.822 --> 00:08:51.515\nand less walkable neighborhoods.\n\n00:08:51.515 --> 00:08:54.317\nWell guess what? If you lived in a more walkable neighborhood,\n\n00:08:54.317 --> 00:08:56.588\nyou were 35 percent likely to be overweight.\n\n00:08:56.588 --> 00:08:58.911\nIf you lived in a less walkable neighborhood,\n\n00:08:58.911 --> 00:09:01.118\nyou were 60 percent likely to be overweight.\n\n00:09:01.118 --> 00:09:02.956\nSo we have study after study now\n\n00:09:02.956 --> 00:09:05.011\nthat's tying where you live\n\n00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:07.398\nto your health, particularly as in America,\n\n00:09:07.398 --> 00:09:09.528\nthe biggest health crisis we have is this one\n\n00:09:09.528 --> 00:09:14.252\nthat's stemming from environmental-induced inactivity.\n\n00:09:14.252 --> 00:09:15.975\nAnd I learned a new word last week.\n\n00:09:15.975 --> 00:09:19.605\nThey call these neighborhoods \"obesageneric.\"\n\n00:09:19.605 --> 00:09:22.836\nI may have that wrong, but you get the idea.\n\n00:09:22.836 --> 00:09:24.603\nNow that's one thing, of course.\n\n00:09:24.603 --> 00:09:27.078\nBriefly mentioning, we have an asthma epidemic\n\n00:09:27.078 --> 00:09:28.205\nin this country.\n\n00:09:28.205 --> 00:09:29.863\nYou probably haven't thought that much about it.\n\n00:09:29.863 --> 00:09:32.584\nFourteen Americans die each day from asthma,\n\n00:09:32.584 --> 00:09:35.489\nthree times what it was in the '90s,\n\n00:09:35.489 --> 00:09:38.380\nand it's almost all coming from car exhaust.\n\n00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.392\nAmerican pollution does not come\n\n00:09:40.392 --> 00:09:42.700\nfrom factories anymore, it comes from tailpipes,\n\n00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.957\nand the amount that people are driving in your city,\n\n00:09:44.957 --> 00:09:47.405\nyour urban VMT, is a good prediction\n\n00:09:47.405 --> 00:09:49.907\nof the asthma problems in your city.\n\n00:09:49.907 --> 00:09:52.122\nAnd then finally, in terms of driving,\n\n00:09:52.122 --> 00:09:55.028\nthere's the issue of the single-largest killer\n\n00:09:55.028 --> 00:09:57.670\nof healthy adults, and one of the largest killers\n\n00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.764\nof all people, is car crashes.\n\n00:09:59.764 --> 00:10:01.266\nAnd we take car crashes for granted.\n\n00:10:01.266 --> 00:10:03.101\nWe figure it's a natural risk\n\n00:10:03.101 --> 00:10:04.683\nof being on the road.\n\n00:10:04.683 --> 00:10:07.856\nBut in fact, here in America, 12 people\n\n00:10:07.856 --> 00:10:09.212\nout of every 100,000\n\n00:10:09.212 --> 00:10:11.310\ndie every year from car crashes.\n\n00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.779\nWe're pretty safe here.\n\n00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:15.165\nWell, guess what? In England, it's seven per 100,000.\n\n00:10:15.165 --> 00:10:17.003\nIt's Japan, it's four per 100,000.\n\n00:10:17.003 --> 00:10:19.572\nDo you know where it's three per 100,000?\n\n00:10:19.572 --> 00:10:21.297\nNew York City.\n\n00:10:21.297 --> 00:10:23.953\nSan Francisco, the same thing. Portland, the same thing.\n\n00:10:23.953 --> 00:10:26.013\nOh, so cities make us safer\n\n00:10:26.013 --> 00:10:28.182\nbecause we're driving less?\n\n00:10:28.182 --> 00:10:30.601\nTulsa: 14 per 100,000.\n\n00:10:30.601 --> 00:10:33.842\nOrlando: 20 per 100,000.\n\n00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:35.559\nIt's not whether you're in the city or not,\n\n00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:37.245\nit's how is your city designed?\n\n00:10:37.245 --> 00:10:41.077\nWas it designed around cars or around people?\n\n00:10:41.077 --> 00:10:42.847\nBecause if your city is designed around cars,\n\n00:10:42.847 --> 00:10:47.706\nit's really good at smashing them into each other.\n\n00:10:47.706 --> 00:10:51.441\nThat's part of a much larger health argument.\n\n00:10:51.441 --> 00:10:53.710\nFinally, the environmental argument is fascinating,\n\n00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.951\nbecause the environmentalists turned on a dime\n\n00:10:55.951 --> 00:10:57.470\nabout 10 years ago.\n\n00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.946\nThe environmental movement in America\n\n00:10:58.946 --> 00:11:01.974\nhas historically been an anti-city movement\n\n00:11:01.974 --> 00:11:03.485\nfrom Jefferson on.\n\n00:11:03.485 --> 00:11:05.840\n\"Cities are pestilential to the health,\n\n00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.831\nto the liberties, to the morals of man.\n\n00:11:07.831 --> 00:11:09.941\nIf we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities,\n\n00:11:09.941 --> 00:11:11.857\nas they do in Europe, we shall become as corrupt\n\n00:11:11.857 --> 00:11:13.272\nas they are in Europe\n\n00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:15.934\nand take to eating one another as they do there.\"\n\n00:11:15.934 --> 00:11:18.665\nHe apparently had a sense of humor.\n\n00:11:18.665 --> 00:11:20.718\nAnd then the American environmental movement\n\n00:11:20.718 --> 00:11:22.828\nhas been a classically Arcadian movement.\n\n00:11:22.828 --> 00:11:24.941\nTo become more environmental, we move into the country,\n\n00:11:24.941 --> 00:11:27.609\nwe commune with nature, we build suburbs.\n\n00:11:27.609 --> 00:11:31.632\nBut, of course, we've seen what that does.\n\n00:11:31.632 --> 00:11:33.838\nThe carbon mapping of America,\n\n00:11:33.838 --> 00:11:35.725\nwhere is the CO2 being emitted,\n\n00:11:35.725 --> 00:11:37.654\nfor many years only\n\n00:11:37.654 --> 00:11:40.181\nhammered this argument in more strongly.\n\n00:11:40.181 --> 00:11:43.022\nIf you look at any carbon map, because we map it per square mile,\n\n00:11:43.022 --> 00:11:44.537\nany carbon map of the U.S.,\n\n00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:47.680\nit looks like a night sky satellite photo of the U.S.,\n\n00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.136\nhottest in the cities, cooler in the suburbs,\n\n00:11:50.136 --> 00:11:53.704\ndark, peaceful in the countryside.\n\n00:11:53.704 --> 00:11:55.643\nUntil some economists said, you know,\n\n00:11:55.643 --> 00:11:58.089\nis that the right way to measure CO2?\n\n00:11:58.089 --> 00:12:00.075\nThere are only so many people in this country at any given time,\n\n00:12:00.075 --> 00:12:02.162\nand we can choose to live where perhaps\n\n00:12:02.162 --> 00:12:03.801\nwe would have a lighter impact.\n\n00:12:03.801 --> 00:12:06.594\nAnd they said, let's measure CO2 per household,\n\n00:12:06.594 --> 00:12:09.198\nand when they did that, the maps just flipped,\n\n00:12:09.198 --> 00:12:12.217\ncoolest in the center city, warmer in the suburbs,\n\n00:12:12.217 --> 00:12:14.893\nand red hot in these exurban\n\n00:12:14.893 --> 00:12:17.665\n\"drive till you qualify\" neighborhoods.\n\n00:12:17.665 --> 00:12:19.618\nSo a fundamental shift, and now you have\n\n00:12:19.618 --> 00:12:22.382\nenvironmentalists and economists like Ed Glaeser\n\n00:12:22.382 --> 00:12:24.949\nsaying we are a destructive species.\n\n00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:27.115\nIf you love nature, the best thing you can do\n\n00:12:27.115 --> 00:12:29.383\nis stay the heck away from it,\n\n00:12:29.383 --> 00:12:31.937\nmove to a city, and the denser the better,\n\n00:12:31.937 --> 00:12:34.441\nand the denser cities like Manhattan\n\n00:12:34.441 --> 00:12:36.777\nare the cities that perform the best.\n\n00:12:36.777 --> 00:12:40.926\nSo the average Manhattanite is consuming gasoline\n\n00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:45.242\nat the rate the rest of the nation hasn't seen since the '20s,\n\n00:12:45.242 --> 00:12:48.716\nconsuming half of the electricity of Dallas.\n\n00:12:48.716 --> 00:12:50.718\nBut of course, we can do better.\n\n00:12:50.718 --> 00:12:53.830\nCanadian cities, they consume half the gasoline of American cities.\n\n00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:57.924\nEuropean cities consume half as much again.\n\n00:12:57.924 --> 00:13:00.120\nSo obviously, we can do better,\n\n00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.489\nand we want to do better, and we're all trying to be green.\n\n00:13:03.489 --> 00:13:05.935\nMy final argument in this topic is that\n\n00:13:05.935 --> 00:13:09.589\nI think we're trying to be green the wrong way,\n\n00:13:09.589 --> 00:13:11.765\nand I'm one of many people who believes that\n\n00:13:11.765 --> 00:13:14.837\nthis focus on gadgets,\n\n00:13:14.837 --> 00:13:17.528\non accessorizing --\n\n00:13:17.528 --> 00:13:19.547\nWhat can I add to my house,\n\n00:13:19.547 --> 00:13:21.659\nwhat can I add to what I've already got\n\n00:13:21.659 --> 00:13:24.122\nto make my lifestyle more sustainable? --\n\n00:13:24.122 --> 00:13:26.063\nhas kind of dominated the discussion.\n\n00:13:26.063 --> 00:13:27.917\nSo I'm not immune to this.\n\n00:13:27.917 --> 00:13:29.452\nMy wife and I built a new house\n\n00:13:29.452 --> 00:13:32.451\non an abandoned lot in Washington, D.C.,\n\n00:13:32.451 --> 00:13:34.553\nand we did our best to clear the shelves\n\n00:13:34.553 --> 00:13:36.608\nof the sustainability store.\n\n00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:38.843\nWe've got the solar photovoltaic system,\n\n00:13:38.843 --> 00:13:41.292\nsolar hot water heater, dual-flush toilets,\n\n00:13:41.292 --> 00:13:43.200\nbamboo floors.\n\n00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.572\nA log burning in my German high-tech stove\n\n00:13:46.572 --> 00:13:49.261\napparently, supposedly, contributes less carbon\n\n00:13:49.261 --> 00:13:50.942\nto the atmosphere than were it left alone\n\n00:13:50.942 --> 00:13:53.054\nto decompose in the forest.\n\n00:13:53.054 --> 00:13:55.834\nYet all of these innovations --\n\n00:13:55.834 --> 00:13:57.721\nThat's what they said in the brochure.\n\n00:13:57.721 --> 00:13:58.949\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:58.949 --> 00:14:01.089\nAll of these innovations together\n\n00:14:01.089 --> 00:14:04.173\ncontribute a fraction of what we contribute\n\n00:14:04.173 --> 00:14:06.078\nby living in a walkable neighborhood\n\n00:14:06.078 --> 00:14:09.849\nthree blocks from a metro in the heart of a city.\n\n00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:12.048\nWe've changed all our light bulbs to energy-savers,\n\n00:14:12.048 --> 00:14:13.398\nand you should do the same thing,\n\n00:14:13.398 --> 00:14:15.778\nbut changing all your light bulbs to energy-savers\n\n00:14:15.778 --> 00:14:17.410\nsaves as much energy in a year\n\n00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.344\nas moving to a walkable city does in a week.\n\n00:14:20.344 --> 00:14:21.693\nAnd we don't want to have this argument.\n\n00:14:21.693 --> 00:14:23.901\nPoliticians and marketers are afraid\n\n00:14:23.901 --> 00:14:27.634\nof marketing green as a \"lifestyle choice.\"\n\n00:14:27.634 --> 00:14:30.551\nYou don't want to tell Americans, God forbid,\n\n00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:32.412\nthat they have to change their lifestyle.\n\n00:14:32.412 --> 00:14:35.576\nBut what if lifestyle was really about quality of life\n\n00:14:35.576 --> 00:14:38.093\nand about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more,\n\n00:14:38.093 --> 00:14:41.424\nsomething that would be better than what we have right now?\n\n00:14:41.424 --> 00:14:43.935\nWell, the gold standard of quality of life rankings,\n\n00:14:43.935 --> 00:14:45.924\nit's called the Mercer Survey.\n\n00:14:45.924 --> 00:14:47.124\nYou may

It was a city so long ago that it was still called Peking.So I went to a party. I sat down next to a stout, middle-aged man with owl glasses and a bow tie, and he turned out to be a Fulbright scholar, there in China specifically to study Sino-Soviet relations. What a gift it was to the eager, young foreign correspondent that I was then. I'd pump him for information, I'm mentally scribbling notes for the stories I plan to write. I talk to him for hours.Only months later, I discover who he really was. He was the China representative for the American Soybean Association.\"I don't understand. Soybeans? You told me you were a Fulbright scholar.\"\"Well, how long would you have talked to me if I told you we're in soybeans?\"(Laughter)I said, \"You jerk.\" Only jerk wasn't the word I used. I said, \"You could've gotten me fired.\"And he said, \"Let's get married.\" (Laughter) \"Travel the world and have lots of kids.\" So we did.(Laughter)(Applause)And what an alive man Terence Bryan Foley turned out to be. He was a Chinese scholar who later, in his 60s, got a Ph.D. in Chinese history. He spoke six languages, he played 15 musical instruments, he was a licensed pilot, he had once been a San Francisco cable car operator, he was an expert in swine nutrition, dairy cattle, Dixieland jazz, film noir, and we did travel the country, and the world, and we did have a lot of kids. We followed my job, and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn't do.So when we found the cancer, it doesn't seem strange to us at all that without saying a word to each other, we believed that, if we were smart enough and strong enough and brave enough, and we worked hard enough, we could keep him from dying ever.And for years, it seemed like we were succeeding. The surgeon emerged from the surgery. What'd he say? He said what surgeons always say: \"We got it all.\" Then there was a setback when the pathologists looked at the kidney cancer closely. It turned out to be a rare, exceedingly aggressive type, with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal in several weeks at most. And yet, he did not die. Mysteriously, he lived on. He coached Little League for our son. He built a playhouse for our daughter. And meanwhile, I'm burying myself in the Internet looking for specialists. I'm looking for a cure.So a year goes by before the cancer, as cancers do, reappears, and with it comes another death sentence, this time nine months. So we try another treatment, aggressive, nasty. It makes him so sick, he has to quit it, yet still he lives on. Then another year goes by. Two years go by. More specialists. We take the kids to Italy. We take the kids to Australia.And then more years pass, and the cancer begins to grow. This time, there's new treatments on the horizon. They're exotic. They're experimental. They're going to attack the cancer in new ways. So he enters a clinical trial, and it works. The cancer begins to shrink, and for the third time, we've dodged death.So now I ask you, how do I feel when the time finally comes and there's another dark night, sometime between midnight and 2 a.m.? This time it's on the intensive care ward when a twentysomething resident that I've never met before tells me that Terence is dying, perhaps tonight.So what do I say when he says, \"What do you want me to do?\"There's another drug out there. It's newer. It's more powerful. He started it just two weeks ago. Perhaps there's still hope ahead.So what do I say?I say, \"Keep him alive if you can.\"And Terence died six days later.So we fought, we struggled, we triumphed. It was an exhilarating fight, and I'd repeat the fight today without a moment's hesitation. We fought together, we lived together. It turned what could have been seven of the grimmest years of our life into seven of the most glorious. It was also an expensive fight. It was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end-of-life care, and of healthcare for all of us.And for me, for us, we pushed the fight right over the edge, and I never got the chance to say to him what I say to him now almost every day: \"Hey, buddy, it was a hell of a ride.\" We never got the chance to say goodbye. We never thought it was the end. We always had hope.So what do we make of all of this?Being a journalist, after Terence died, I wrote a book, \"The Cost Of Hope.\" I wrote it because I wanted to know why I did what I did, why he did what he did, why everyone around us did what they did.And what did I discover? Well, one of the things I discovered is that experts think that one answer to what I did at the end was a piece of paper, the advance directive, to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices. Yet I had that piece of paper. We both did. And they were readily available. I had them right at hand. Both of them said the same thing: Do nothing if there is no further hope. I knew Terence's wishes as clearly and as surely as I knew my own.Yet we never got to no further hope. Even with that clear-cut paper in our hands, we just kept redefining hope. I believed I could keep him from dying, and I'd be embarrassed to say that if I hadn't seen so many people and have talked to so many people who have felt exactly the same way. Right up until days before his death, I felt strongly and powerfully, and, you might say, irrationally, that I could keep him from dying ever.Now, what do the experts call this? They say it's denial. It's a strong word, isn't it? Yet I will tell you that denial isn't even close to a strong enough word to describe what those of us facing the death of our loved ones go through.And I hear the medical professionals say, \"Well, we'd like to do such-and-such, but the family's in denial. The family won't listen to reason. They're in denial. How can they insist on this treatment at the end? It's so clear, yet they're in denial.\"Now, I think this maybe isn't a very useful way of thinking. It's not just families either. The medical professionals too, you out there, you're in denial too. You want to help. You want to fix. You want to do. You've succeeded in everything you've done, and having a patient die, well, that must feel like failure.I saw it firsthand. Just days before Terence died, his oncologist said, \"Tell Terence that better days are just ahead.\" Days before he died.Yet Ira Byock, the director of palliative medicine at Dartmouth said, \"You know, the best doctor in the world has never succeeded in making anyone immortal.\"So what the experts call \"denial,\" I call \"hope,\" and I'd like to borrow a phrase from my friends in software design. You just redefine denial and hope, and it becomes a feature of being human. It's not a bug. It's a feature.(Laughter)So we need to think more constructively about this very common, very profound and very powerful human emotion. It's part of the human condition, and yet our system and our thinking isn't built to accommodate it.So Terence told me a story on that long-ago night, and I believed it. Maybe I wanted to believe it. And during Terence's illness, I, we, we wanted to believe the story of our fight together too. Giving up the fight \u2014 for that's how it felt, it felt like giving up \u2014 meant giving up not only his life but also our story, our story of us as fighters, the story of us as invincible, and for the doctors, the story of themselves as healers.So what do we need?Maybe we don't need a new piece of paper. Maybe we need a new story, not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness, but rather a story of victory and triumph, of a valiant battle and, eventually, a graceful retreat, a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe, that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal, and that no wife, no matter how hard she tried, has ever stopped even the bravest, wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go.People did mention hospice, but I wouldn't listen. Hospice was for people who were dying, and Terence wasn't dying. As a result, he spent just four days in hospice, which I'm sure, as you all know, is a pretty typical outcome, and we never said goodbye because we were unprepared for the end.We have a noble path to curing the disease, patients and doctors alike, but there doesn't seem to be a noble path to dying. Dying is seen as failing, and we had a heroic narrative for fighting together, but we didn't have a heroic narrative for letting go.So maybe we need a narrative for acknowledging the end, and for saying goodbye, and maybe our new story will be about a hero's fight, and a hero's goodbye. Terence loved poetry, and the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy is one of my favorite poets. So I'll give you a couple lines from him. This is a poem about Mark Antony. You know Mark Antony, the conquering hero, Cleopatra's guy? Actually, one of Cleopatra's guys. And he's been a pretty good general. He's won all the fights, he's eluded all the people that are out to get him, and yet this time, finally, he's come to the city of Alexandria and realized he's lost. The people are leaving. They're playing instruments. They're singing. And suddenly he knows he's been defeated. And he suddenly knows he's been deserted by the gods, and it's time to let go. And the poet tells him what to do. He tells him how to say a noble goodbye, a goodbye that's fit for a hero.\"As if long-prepared, as if courageous, as it becomes you who were worthy of such a city, approach the window with a firm step, and with emotion, but not with the entreaties or the complaints of a coward, as a last enjoyment, listen to the sounds, the exquisite instruments of the musical troops, and bid her farewell, the Alexandria you are losing.\"That's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life, a goodbye for a man for whom anything, well, almost anything, was possible, a goodbye for a man who kept hope alive.And isn't that what we're missing? How can we learn that people's decisions about their loved ones are often based strongly, powerfully, many times irrationally, on the slimmest of hopes? The overwhelming presence of hope isn't denial. It's part of our DNA as humans, and maybe it's time our healthcare system \u2014 doctors, patients, insurance companies, us, started accounting for the power of that hope. Hope isn't a bug.

He said what surgeons always say:\n\n00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:09.377\n\"We got it all.\"\n\n00:03:09.377 --> 00:03:12.420\nThen there was a setback when the pathologists\n\n00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.793\nlooked at the kidney cancer closely.\n\n00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:16.422\nIt turned out to be a rare,\n\n00:03:16.422 --> 00:03:18.231\nexceedingly aggressive type,\n\n00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:21.313\nwith a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal\n\n00:03:21.313 --> 00:03:23.704\nin several weeks at most.\n\n00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:27.414\nAnd yet, he did not die.\n\n00:03:27.414 --> 00:03:30.924\nMysteriously, he lived on.\n\n00:03:30.924 --> 00:03:33.008\nHe coached Little League for our son.\n\n00:03:33.008 --> 00:03:35.560\nHe built a playhouse for our daughter.\n\n00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.634\nAnd meanwhile, I'm burying myself in the Internet\n\n00:03:38.634 --> 00:03:40.308\nlooking for specialists.\n\n00:03:40.308 --> 00:03:42.869\nI'm looking for a cure.\n\n00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:44.946\nSo a year goes by\n\n00:03:44.946 --> 00:03:48.152\nbefore the cancer, as cancers do,\n\n00:03:48.152 --> 00:03:50.152\nreappears,\n\n00:03:50.152 --> 00:03:52.228\nand with it comes another death sentence,\n\n00:03:52.228 --> 00:03:54.421\nthis time nine months.\n\n00:03:54.421 --> 00:03:58.435\nSo we try another treatment, aggressive, nasty.\n\n00:03:58.435 --> 00:04:00.255\nIt makes him so sick, he has to quit it,\n\n00:04:00.255 --> 00:04:03.272\nyet still he lives on.\n\n00:04:03.272 --> 00:04:05.168\nThen another year goes by.\n\n00:04:05.168 --> 00:04:06.718\nTwo years go by.\n\n00:04:06.718 --> 00:04:08.207\nMore specialists.\n\n00:04:08.207 --> 00:04:10.127\nWe take the kids to Italy.\n\n00:04:10.127 --> 00:04:12.596\nWe take the kids to Australia.\n\n00:04:12.596 --> 00:04:15.308\nAnd then more years pass,\n\n00:04:15.308 --> 00:04:17.698\nand the cancer begins to grow.\n\n00:04:17.698 --> 00:04:20.233\nThis time, there's new treatments on the horizon.\n\n00:04:20.233 --> 00:04:22.169\nThey're exotic. They're experimental.\n\n00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.377\nThey're going to attack the cancer in new ways.\n\n00:04:25.377 --> 00:04:29.703\nSo he enters a clinical trial, and it works.\n\n00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:31.632\nThe cancer begins to shrink,\n\n00:04:31.632 --> 00:04:33.909\nand for the third time,\n\n00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:37.268\nwe've dodged death.\n\n00:04:37.268 --> 00:04:40.565\nSo now I ask you,\n\n00:04:40.565 --> 00:04:42.954\nhow do I feel\n\n00:04:42.954 --> 00:04:45.468\nwhen the time finally comes\n\n00:04:45.468 --> 00:04:47.974\nand there's another dark night,\n\n00:04:47.974 --> 00:04:50.475\nsometime between midnight and 2 a.m.?\n\n00:04:50.475 --> 00:04:53.449\nThis time it's on the intensive care ward\n\n00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.287\nwhen a twentysomething resident\n\n00:04:55.287 --> 00:04:57.490\nthat I've never met before\n\n00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.083\ntells me that Terence is dying,\n\n00:05:00.083 --> 00:05:02.282\nperhaps tonight.\n\n00:05:02.282 --> 00:05:05.075\nSo what do I say when he says,\n\n00:05:05.075 --> 00:05:07.889\n\"What do you want me to do?\"\n\n00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.901\nThere's another drug out there.\n\n00:05:09.901 --> 00:05:11.589\nIt's newer. It's more powerful.\n\n00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:14.158\nHe started it just two weeks ago.\n\n00:05:14.158 --> 00:05:17.267\nPerhaps there's still hope ahead.\n\n00:05:17.267 --> 00:05:19.222\nSo what do I say?\n\n00:05:19.222 --> 00:05:22.578\nI say, \"Keep him alive if you can.\"\n\n00:05:22.578 --> 00:05:26.093\nAnd Terence died six days later.\n\n00:05:26.093 --> 00:05:30.141\nSo we fought, we struggled, we triumphed.\n\n00:05:30.141 --> 00:05:31.937\nIt was an exhilarating fight,\n\n00:05:31.937 --> 00:05:33.654\nand I'd repeat the fight today\n\n00:05:33.654 --> 00:05:36.303\nwithout a moment's hesitation.\n\n00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:39.254\nWe fought together, we lived together.\n\n00:05:39.254 --> 00:05:41.358\nIt turned what could have been\n\n00:05:41.358 --> 00:05:44.092\nseven of the grimmest years of our life\n\n00:05:44.092 --> 00:05:47.703\ninto seven of the most glorious.\n\n00:05:47.703 --> 00:05:50.478\nIt was also an expensive fight.\n\n00:05:50.478 --> 00:05:52.439\nIt was the kind of fight and the kind of choices\n\n00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:54.073\nthat everyone here agrees\n\n00:05:54.073 --> 00:05:56.478\npump up the cost of end-of-life care,\n\n00:05:56.478 --> 00:05:58.764\nand of healthcare for all of us.\n\n00:05:58.764 --> 00:06:01.846\nAnd for me, for us,\n\n00:06:01.846 --> 00:06:03.928\nwe pushed the fight right over the edge,\n\n00:06:03.928 --> 00:06:07.153\nand I never got the chance to say to him\n\n00:06:07.153 --> 00:06:10.573\nwhat I say to him now almost every day:\n\n00:06:10.573 --> 00:06:13.650\n\"Hey, buddy, it was a hell of a ride.\"\n\n00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.138\nWe never got the chance to say goodbye.\n\n00:06:16.138 --> 00:06:18.417\nWe never thought it was the end.\n\n00:06:18.417 --> 00:06:23.596\nWe always had hope.\n\n00:06:23.596 --> 00:06:27.460\nSo what do we make of all of this?\n\n00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.038\nBeing a journalist, after Terence died,\n\n00:06:31.038 --> 00:06:34.327\nI wrote a book, \"The Cost Of Hope.\"\n\n00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:36.477\nI wrote it because I wanted to know\n\n00:06:36.477 --> 00:06:38.163\nwhy I did what I did,\n\n00:06:38.163 --> 00:06:39.964\nwhy he did what he did,\n\n00:06:39.964 --> 00:06:42.519\nwhy everyone around us did what they did.\n\n00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:44.155\nAnd what did I discover?\n\n00:06:44.155 --> 00:06:45.729\nWell, one of the things I discovered is that\n\n00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:48.806\nexperts think that one answer to\n\n00:06:48.806 --> 00:06:51.556\nwhat I did at the end was a piece of paper,\n\n00:06:51.556 --> 00:06:53.714\nthe advance directive,\n\n00:06:53.714 --> 00:06:58.054\nto help families get past the seemingly irrational choices.\n\n00:06:58.054 --> 00:07:02.168\nYet I had that piece of paper.\n\n00:07:02.168 --> 00:07:04.221\nWe both did.\n\n00:07:04.221 --> 00:07:05.911\nAnd they were readily available.\n\n00:07:05.911 --> 00:07:07.850\nI had them right at hand.\n\n00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.209\nBoth of them said the same thing:\n\n00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:14.710\nDo nothing if there is no further hope.\n\n00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.930\nI knew Terence's wishes\n\n00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.744\nas clearly and as surely as I knew my own.\n\n00:07:20.744 --> 00:07:25.948\nYet we never got to no further hope.\n\n00:07:25.948 --> 00:07:28.705\nEven with that clear-cut paper in our hands,\n\n00:07:28.705 --> 00:07:31.961\nwe just kept redefining hope.\n\n00:07:31.961 --> 00:07:37.253\nI believed I could keep him from dying,\n\n00:07:37.253 --> 00:07:40.067\nand I'd be embarrassed to say that if I hadn't seen\n\n00:07:40.067 --> 00:07:42.278\nso many people and have talked to so many people\n\n00:07:42.278 --> 00:07:44.952\nwho have felt exactly the same way.\n\n00:07:44.952 --> 00:07:48.886\nRight up until days before his death,\n\n00:07:48.886 --> 00:07:52.212\nI felt strongly\n\n00:07:52.212 --> 00:07:56.255\nand powerfully, and, you might say, irrationally,\n\n00:07:56.255 --> 00:08:01.502\nthat I could keep him from dying ever.\n\n00:08:01.502 --> 00:08:04.737\nNow, what do the experts call this?\n\n00:08:04.737 --> 00:08:07.084\nThey say it's denial.\n\n00:08:07.084 --> 00:08:09.275\nIt's a strong word, isn't it?\n\n00:08:09.275 --> 00:08:11.672\nYet I will tell you that denial\n\n00:08:11.672 --> 00:08:16.786\nisn't even close to a strong enough word\n\n00:08:16.786 --> 00:08:19.432\nto describe what those of us\n\n00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:23.070\nfacing the death of our loved ones go through.\n\n00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.411\nAnd I hear the medical professionals say,\n\n00:08:25.411 --> 00:08:27.494\n\"Well, we'd like to do such-and-such,\n\n00:08:27.494 --> 00:08:29.945\nbut the family's in denial.\n\n00:08:29.945 --> 00:08:32.121\nThe family won't listen to reason.\n\n00:08:32.121 --> 00:08:34.143\nThey're in denial.\n\n00:08:34.143 --> 00:08:36.495\nHow can they insist on this treatment at the end?\n\n00:08:36.495 --> 00:08:39.799\nIt's so clear, yet they're in denial.\"\n\n00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:41.806\nNow, I think this maybe isn't\n\n00:08:41.806 --> 00:08:44.810\na very useful way of thinking.\n\n00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.088\nIt's not just families either.\n\n00:08:47.088 --> 00:08:49.213\nThe medical professionals too,\n\n00:08:49.213 --> 00:08:52.573\nyou out there, you're in denial too.\n\n00:08:52.573 --> 00:08:55.426\nYou want to help. You want to fix.\n\n00:08:55.426 --> 00:08:57.252\nYou want to do.\n\n00:08:57.252 --> 00:09:00.060\nYou've succeeded in everything you've done,\n\n00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.102\nand having a patient die,\n\n00:09:02.102 --> 00:09:05.681\nwell, that must feel like failure.\n\n00:09:05.681 --> 00:09:07.525\nI saw it firsthand.\n\n00:09:07.525 --> 00:09:10.227\nJust days before Terence died,\n\n00:09:10.227 --> 00:09:12.245\nhis oncologist said,\n\n00:09:12.245 --> 00:09:15.493\n\"Tell Terence that better days are just ahead.\"\n\n00:09:15.493 --> 00:09:17.875\nDays before he died.\n\n00:09:17.875 --> 00:09:19.308\nYet Ira Byock,\n\n00:09:19.308 --> 00:09:21.656\nthe director of palliative medicine at Dartmouth\n\n00:09:21.656 --> 00:09:24.587\nsaid, \"You know, the best doctor in the world\n\n00:09:24.587 --> 00:09:29.195\nhas never succeeded in making anyone immortal.\"\n\n00:09:29.195 --> 00:09:35.701\nSo what the experts call \"denial,\" I call \"hope,\"\n\n00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:38.035\nand I'd like to borrow a phrase\n\n00:09:38.035 --> 00:09:41.256\nfrom my friends in software design.\n\n00:09:41.256 --> 00:09:44.818\nYou just redefine denial and hope,\n\n00:09:44.818 --> 00:09:48.046\nand it becomes a feature of being human.\n\n00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:49.907\nIt's not a bug.\n\n00:09:49.907 --> 00:09:52.233\nIt's a feature.\n\n00:09:52.233 --> 00:09:55.327\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:55.327 --> 00:09:59.021\nSo we need to think more constructively\n\n00:09:59.021 --> 00:10:03.333\nabout this very common, very profound\n\n00:10:03.333 --> 00:10:07.289\nand very powerful human emotion.\n\n00:10:07.289 --> 00:10:09.913\nIt's part of the human condition,\n\n00:10:09.913 --> 00:10:12.090\nand yet our system and our thinking\n\n00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.259\nisn't built to accommodate it.\n\n00:10:15.259 --> 00:10:18.314\nSo Terence told me a story on that long-ago night,\n\n00:10:18.314 --> 00:10:20.219\nand I believed it.\n\n00:10:20.219 --> 00:10:23.333\nMaybe I wanted to believe it.\n\n00:10:23.333 --> 00:10:28.662\nAnd during Terence's illness, I, we,\n\n00:10:28.662 --> 00:10:30.384\nwe wanted to believe the story\n\n00:10:30.384 --> 00:10:32.979\nof our fight together too.\n\n00:10:32.979 --> 00:10:36.715\nGiving up the fight -- for that's how it felt,\n\n00:10:36.715 --> 00:10:38.654\nit felt like giving up --\n\n00:10:38.654 --> 00:10:41.371\nmeant giving up not only his life\n\n00:10:41.371 --> 00:10:45.078\nbut also our story,\n\n00:10:45.078 --> 00:10:47.288\nour story of us as fighters,\n\n00:10:47.288 --> 00:10:50.218\nthe story of us as invincible,\n\n00:10:50.218 --> 00:10:52.426\nand for the doctors, the story of themselves\n\n00:10:52.426 --> 00:10:54.984\nas healers.\n\n00:10:54.984 --> 00:10:57.668\nSo what do we need?\n\n00:10:57.668 --> 00:11:00.607\nMaybe we don't need a new piece of paper.\n\n00:11:00.607 --> 00:11:03.554\nMaybe we need a new story,\n\n00:11:03.554 --> 00:11:07.563\nnot a story about giving up the fight\n\n00:11:07.563 --> 00:11:09.834\nor of hopelessness,\n\n00:11:09.834 --> 00:11:13.245\nbut rather a story of victory and triumph,\n\n00:11:13.245 --> 00:11:18.088\nof a valiant battle and, eventually,\n\n00:11:18.088 --> 00:11:20.408\na graceful retreat,\n\n00:11:20.408 --> 00:11:23.415\na story that acknowledges\n\n00:11:23.415 --> 00:11:27.178\nthat not even the greatest general defeats every foe,\n\n00:11:27.178 --> 00:11:29.799\nthat no doctor has ever succeeded\n\n00:11:29.799 --> 00:11:32.189\nin making anyone immortal,\n\n00:11:32.189 --> 00:11:38.255\nand that no wife, no matter how hard she tried,\n\n00:11:38.255 --> 00:11:42.940\nhas ever stopped even the bravest,\n\n00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.989\nwittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband\n\n00:11:46.989 --> 00:11:51.182\nfrom dying when it was his time to go.\n\n00:11:51.182 --> 00:11:53.495\nPeople did mention hospice,\n\n00:11:53.495 --> 00:11:56.866\nbut I wouldn't listen.\n\n00:11:56.866 --> 00:12:00.791\nHospice was for people who were dying,\n\n00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:03.564\nand Terence wasn't dying.\n\n00:12:03.564 --> 00:12:06.474\nAs a result, he spent just four days in hospice,\n\n00:12:06.474 --> 00:12:08.291\nwhich I'm sure, as you all know,\n\n00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:10.381\nis a pretty typical outcome,\n\n00:12:10.381 --> 00:12:11.893\nand we never said goodbye\n\n00:12:11.893 --> 00:12:14.948\nbecause we were unprepared for the end.\n\n00:12:14.948 --> 00:12:18.695\nWe have a noble path to curing the disease,\n\n00:12:18.695 --> 00:12:21.025\npatients and doctors alike,\n\n00:12:21.025 --> 00:12:23.148\nbut there doesn't seem to be\n\n00:12:23.148 --> 00:12:25.748\na noble path to dying.\n\n00:12:25.748 --> 00:12:28.806\nDying is seen as failing,\n\n00:12:28.806 --> 00:12:31.458\nand we had a heroic narrative\n\n00:12:31.458 --> 00:12:33.551\nfor fighting together,\n\n00:12:33.551 --> 00:12:38.581\nbut we didn't have a heroic narrative for letting go.\n\n00:12:38.581 --> 00:12:42.699\nSo maybe we need a narrative\n\n00:12:42.699 --> 00:12:46.175\nfor acknowledging the end, and for saying goodbye,\n\n00:12:46.175 --> 00:12:48.737\nand maybe our new story will be\n\n00:12:48.737 --> 00:12:53.343\nabout a hero's fight, and a hero's goodbye.\n\n00:12:53.343 --> 00:12:55.810\nTerence loved poetry,\n\n00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:59.037\nand the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy\n\n00:12:59.037 --> 00:13:01.466\nis one of my favorite poets.\n\n00:13:01.466 --> 00:13:04.350\nSo I'll give you a couple lines from him.\n\n00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.566\nThis is a poem about Mark Antony.\n\n00:13:06.566 --> 00:13:09.259\nYou know Mark Antony, the conquering hero,\n\n00:13:09.259 --> 00:13:11.124\nCleopatra's guy?\n\n00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:13.661\nActually, one of Cleopatra's guys.\n\n00:13:13.661 --> 00:13:16.086\nAnd he's been a pretty good general.\n\n00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:17.146\nHe's won all the fights,\n\n00:13:17.146 --> 00:13:19.601\nhe's eluded all the people that are out to get him,\n\n00:13:19.601 --> 00:13:21.389\nand yet this time, finally,\n\n00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:23.138\nhe's come to the city of Alexandria\n\n00:13:23.138 --> 00:13:24.820\nand realized he's lost.\n\n00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.536\nThe people are leaving. They're playing instruments.\n\n00:13:26.536 --> 00:13:27.859\nThey're singing.\n\n00:13:27.859 --> 00:13:30.459\nAnd suddenly he knows he's been defeated.\n\n00:13:30.459 --> 00:13:32.638\nAnd he suddenly knows\n\n00:13:32.638 --> 00:13:35.163\nhe's been deserted by the gods,\n\n00:13:35.163 --> 00:13:37.103\nand it's time to let go.\n\n00:13:37.103 --> 00:13:39.070\nAnd the poet tells him what to do.\n\n00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:42.336\nHe tells him how to say a noble goodbye,\n\n00:13:42.336 --> 00:13:46.183\na goodbye that's fit for a hero.\n\n00:13:46.183 --> 00:13:48.932\n\"As if long-prepared,\n\n00:13:48.932 --> 00:13:51.611\nas if courageous,\n\n00:13:51.611 --> 00:13:54.208\nas it becomes you\n\n00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:56.380\nwho were worthy of such a city,\n\n00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.783\napproach the window with a firm step,\n\n00:13:58.783 --> 00:14:01.318\nand with emotion,\n\n00:14:01.318 --> 00:14:03.517\nbut not with the entreaties\n\n00:14:03.517 --> 00:14:06.278\nor the complaints of a coward,\n\n00:14:06.278 --> 00:14:08.249\nas a last enjoyment,\n\n00:14:08.249 --> 00:14:10.373\nlisten to the sounds,\n\n00:14:10.373 --> 00:14:13.707\nthe exquisite instruments of the musical troops,\n\n00:14:13.707 --> 00:14:15.988\nand bid her farewell,\n\n00:14:15.988 --> 00:14:20.403\nthe Alexandria you are losing.\"\n\n00:14:20.403 --> 00:14:24.093\nThat's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life,\n\n00:14:24.093 --> 00:14:26.111\na goodbye for a man\n\n00:14:26.111 --> 00:14:28.085\nfor whom anything,\n\n00:14:28.085 --> 00:14:31.193\nwell, almost anything,\n\n00:14:31.193 --> 00:14:33.083\nwas possible,\n\n00:14:33.083 --> 00:14:36.223\na goodbye for a man who kept hope alive.\n\n00:14:36.223 --> 00:14:38.416\nAnd isn't that what we're missing?\n\n00:14:38.416 --> 00:14:40.475\nHow can we learn that people's decisions\n\n00:14:40.475 --> 00:14:41.985\nabout their loved ones\n\n00:14:41.985 --> 00:14:45.914\nare often based strongly, powerfully,\n\n00:14:45.914 --> 00:14:48.766\nmany times irrationally,\n\n00:14:48.766 --> 00:14:51.110\non the slimmest of hopes?\n\n00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.132\nThe overwhelming presence of hope\n\n00:14:54.132 --> 00:14:55.555\nisn't denial.\n\n00:14:55.555 --> 00:14:58.375\nIt's part of our DNA as humans,\n\n00:14:58.375 --> 00:15:00.693\nand maybe it's time our healthcare system --\n\n00:15:00.693 --> 00:15:05.177\ndoctors, patients, insurance companies, us,\n\n00:15:05.177 --> 00:15:09.151\nstarted accounting for the power of that hope.\n\n00:15:09.151 --> 00:15:11.451\nHope isn't a bug.\n\n00:15:11.451 --> 00:15:13.820\nIt's a feature.\n\n00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.315\nThank you.\n\n00:15:16.315 --> 00:15:19.370\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Ingenious homes in unexpected places", "duration": "1018", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/iwan_baan_ingenious_homes_in_unexpected_places", "transcript": "Throughout my career, I've been fortunate enough to work with many of the great international architects, documenting their work and observing how their designs have the capacity to influence the cities in which they sit. I think of new cities like Dubai or ancient cities like Rome with Zaha Hadid's incredible MAXXI museum, or like right here in New York with the High Line, a city which has been so much influenced by the development of this.But what I find really fascinating is what happens when architects and planners leave and these places become appropriated by people, like here in Chandigarh, India, the city which has been completely designed by the architect Le Corbusier. Now 60 years later, the city has been taken over by people in very different ways from whatever perhaps intended for, like here, where you have the people sitting in the windows of the assembly hall. But over the course of several years, I've been documenting Rem Koolhaas's CCTV building in Beijing and the olympic stadium in the same city by the architects Herzog and de Meuron. At these large-scale construction sites in China, you see a sort of makeshift camp where workers live during the entire building process. As the length of the construction takes years, workers end up forming a rather rough-and-ready informal city, making for quite a juxtaposition against the sophisticated structures that they're building.Over the past seven years, I've been following my fascination with the built environment, and for those of you who know me, you would say that this obsession has led me to live out of a suitcase 365 days a year. Being constantly on the move means that sometimes I am able to catch life's most unpredictable moments, like here in New York the day after the Sandy storm hit the city.Just over three years ago, I was for the first time in Caracas, Venezuela, and while flying over the city, I was just amazed by the extent to which the slums reach into every corner of the city, a place where nearly 70 percent of the population lives in slums, draped literally all over the mountains. During a conversation with local architects Urban-Think Tank, I learned about the Torre David, a 45-story office building which sits right in the center of Caracas. The building was under construction until the collapse of the Venezuelan economy and the death of the developer in the early '90s. About eight years ago, people started moving into the abandoned tower and began to build their homes right in between every column of this unfinished tower. There's only one little entrance to the entire building, and the 3,000 residents come in and out through that single door. Together, the inhabitants created public spaces and designed them to feel more like a home and less like an unfinished tower. In the lobby, they painted the walls and planted trees. They also made a basketball court. But when you look up closely, you see massive holes where elevators and services would have run through.Within the tower, people have come up with all sorts of solutions in response to the various needs which arise from living in an unfinished tower. With no elevators, the tower is like a 45-story walkup. Designed in very specific ways by this group of people who haven't had any education in architecture or design. And with each inhabitant finding their own unique way of coming by, this tower becomes like a living city, a place which is alive with micro-economies and small businesses. The inventive inhabitants, for instance, find opportunities in the most unexpected cases, like the adjacent parking garage, which has been reclaimed as a taxi route to shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps in order to shorten the hike up to the apartments.A walk through the tower reveals how residents have figured out how to create walls, how to make an air flow, how to create transparency, circulation throughout the tower, essentially creating a home that's completely adapted to the conditions of the site. When a new inhabitant moves into the tower, they already have a roof over their head, so they just typically mark their space with a few curtains or sheets. Slowly, from found materials, walls rise, and people create a space out of any found objects or materials.It's remarkable to see the design decisions that they're making, like when everything is made out of red bricks, some residents will cover that red brick with another layer of red brick-patterned wallpaper just to make it a kind of clean finish.The inhabitants literally built up these homes with their own hands, and this labor of love instills a great sense of pride in many families living in this tower. They typically make the best out of their conditions, and try to make their spaces look nice and homey, or at least up until as far as they can reach. Throughout the tower, you come across all kinds of services, like the barber, small factories, and every floor has a little grocery store or shop. And you even find a church. And on the 30th floor, there is a gym where all the weights and barbells are made out of the leftover pulleys from the elevators which were never installed. From the outside, behind this always-changing facade, you see how the fixed concrete beams provide a framework for the inhabitants to create their homes in an organic, intuitive way that responds directly to their needs.Let's go now to Africa, to Nigeria, to a community called Makoko, a slum where 150,000 people live just meters above the Lagos Lagoon. While it may appear to be a completely chaotic place, when you see it from above, there seems to be a whole grid of waterways and canals connecting each and every home. From the main dock, people board long wooden canoes which carry them out to their various homes and shops located in the expansive area. When out on the water, it's clear that life has been completely adapted to this very specific way of living. Even the canoes become variety stores where ladies paddle from house to house, selling anything from toothpaste to fresh fruits. Behind every window and door frame, you'll see a small child peering back at you, and while Makoko seems to be packed with people, what's more shocking is actually the amount of children pouring out of every building. The population growth in Nigeria, and especially in these areas like Makoko, are painful reminders of how out of control things really are.In Makoko, very few systems and infrastructures exist. Electricity is rigged and freshest water comes from self-built wells throughout the area. This entire economic model is designed to meet a specific way of living on the water, so fishing and boat-making are common professions. You'll have a set of entrepreneurs who have set up businesses throughout the area, like barbershops, CD and DVD stores, movie theaters, tailors, everything is there. There is even a photo studio where you see the sort of aspiration to live in a real house or to be associated with a faraway place, like that hotel in Sweden.On this particular evening, I came across this live band dressed to the T in their coordinating outfits. They were floating through the canals in a large canoe with a fitted-out generator for all of the community to enjoy.By nightfall, the area becomes almost pitch black, save for a small lightbulb or a fire.What originally brought me to Makoko was this project from a friend of mine, Kunl\u00e9 Adeyemi, who recently finished building this three-story floating school for the kids in Makoko. With this entire village existing on the water, public space is very limited, so now that the school is finished, the ground floor is a playground for the kids, but when classes are out, the platform is just like a town square, where the fishermen mend their nets and floating shopkeepers dock their boats.Another place I'd like to share with you is the Zabbaleen in Cairo. They're descendants of farmers who began migrating from the upper Egypt in the '40s, and today they make their living by collecting and recycling waste from homes from all over Cairo. For years, the Zabbaleen would live in makeshift villages where they would move around trying to avoid the local authorities, but in the early 1980s, they settled on the Mokattam rocks just at the eastern edge of the city. Today, they live in this area, approximately 50,000 to 70,000 people, who live in this community of self-built multi-story houses where up to three generations live in one structure. While these apartments that they built for themselves appear to lack any planning or formal grid, each family specializing in a certain form of recycling means that the ground floor of each apartment is reserved for garbage-related activities and the upper floor is dedicated to living space. I find it incredible to see how these piles and piles of garbage are invisible to the people who live there, like this very distinguished man who is posing while all this garbage is sort of streaming out behind him, or like these two young men who are sitting and chatting amongst these tons of garbage. While to most of us, living amongst these piles and piles of garbage may seem totally uninhabitable, to those in the Zabbaleen, this is just a different type of normal. In all these places I've talked about today, what I do find fascinating is that there's really no such thing as normal, and it proves that people are able to adapt to any kind of situation. Throughout the day, it's quite common to come across a small party taking place in the streets, just like this engagement party. In this tradition, the bride-to-be displays all of their belongings, which they soon bring to their new husband. A gathering like this one offers such a juxtaposition where all the new stuff is displayed and all the garbage is used as props to display all their new home accessories. Like Makoko and the Torre David, throughout the Zabbaleen you'll find all the same facilities as in any typical neighborhood. There are the retail shops, the cafes and the restaurants, and the community is this community of Coptic Christians, so you'll also find a church, along with the scores of religious iconographies throughout the area, and also all the everyday services like the electronic repair shops, the barbers, everything.Visiting the homes of the Zabbaleen is also full of surprises. While from the outside, these homes look like any other informal structure in the city, when you step inside, you are met with all manner of design decisions and interior decoration. Despite having limited access to space and money, the homes in the area are designed with care and detail. Every apartment is unique, and this individuality tells a story about each family's circumstances and values. Many of these people take their homes and interior spaces very seriously, putting a lot of work and care into the details. The shared spaces are also treated in the same manner, where walls are decorated in faux marble patterns.But despite this elaborate decor, sometimes these apartments are used in very unexpected ways, like this home which caught my attention while all the mud and the grass was literally seeping out under the front door. When I was let in, it appeared that this fifth-floor apartment was being transformed into a complete animal farm, where six or seven cows stood grazing in what otherwise would be the living room. But then in the apartment across the hall from this cow shed lives a newly married couple in what locals describe as one of the nicest apartments in the area.The attention to this detail astonished me, and as the owner of the home so proudly led me around this apartment, from floor to ceiling, every part was decorated. But if it weren't for the strangely familiar stomach-churning odor that constantly passes through the apartment, it would be easy to forget that you are standing next to a cow shed and on top of a landfill. What moved me the most was that despite these seemingly inhospitable conditions, I was welcomed with open arms into a home that was made with love, care, and unreserved passion.Let's move across the map to China, to an area called Shanxi, Henan and Gansu. In a region famous for the soft, porous Loess Plateau soil, there lived until recently an estimated 40 million people in these houses underground. These dwellings are called the yaodongs. Through this architecture by subtraction, these yaodongs are built literally inside of the soil. In these villages, you see an entirely altered landscape, and hidden behind these mounds of dirt are these square, rectangular houses which sit seven meters below the ground. When I asked people why they were digging their houses from the ground, they simply replied that they are poor wheat and apple farmers who didn't have the money to buy materials, and this digging out was their most logical form of living.From Makoko to Zabbaleen, these communities have approached the tasks of planning, design and management of their communities and neighborhoods in ways that respond specifically to their environment and circumstances. Created by these very people who live, work and play in these particular spaces, these neighborhoods are intuitively designed to make the most of their circumstances. In most of these places, the government is completely absent, leaving inhabitants with no choice but to reappropriate found materials, and while these communities are highly disadvantaged, they do present examples of brilliant forms of ingenuity, and prove that indeed we have the ability to adapt to all manner of circumstances. What makes places like the Torre David particularly remarkable is this sort of skeleton framework where people can have a foundation where they can tap into. Now imagine what these already ingenious communities could create themselves, and how highly particular their solutions would be, if they were given the basic infrastructures that they could tap into.Today, you see these large residential development projects which offer cookie-cutter housing solutions to massive amounts of people. From China to Brazil, these projects attempt to provide as many houses as possible, but they're completely generic and simply do not work as an answer to the individual needs of the people.I would like to end with a quote from a friend of mine and a source of inspiration, Zita Cobb, the founder of the wonderful Shorefast Foundation, based out of Fogo Island, Newfoundland. She says that \"there's this plague of sameness which is killing the human joy,\" and I couldn't agree with her more.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1846, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.243 --> 00:00:15.318\nThroughout my career, I've been fortunate enough\n\n00:00:15.318 --> 00:00:16.677\nto work with many of the great\n\n00:00:16.677 --> 00:00:18.403\ninternational architects,\n\n00:00:18.403 --> 00:00:20.827\ndocumenting their work and observing\n\n00:00:20.827 --> 00:00:22.786\nhow their designs have the capacity\n\n00:00:22.786 --> 00:00:25.755\nto influence the cities in which they sit.\n\n00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:28.598\nI think of new cities like Dubai\n\n00:00:28.598 --> 00:00:31.075\nor ancient cities like Rome\n\n00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:34.437\nwith Zaha Hadid's incredible MAXXI museum,\n\n00:00:34.437 --> 00:00:37.254\nor like right here in New York with the High Line,\n\n00:00:37.254 --> 00:00:39.825\na city which has been so much influenced\n\n00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:41.528\nby the development of this.\n\n00:00:41.528 --> 00:00:43.603\nBut what I find really fascinating\n\n00:00:43.603 --> 00:00:46.699\nis what happens when architects and planners leave\n\n00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.818\nand these places become appropriated by people,\n\n00:00:49.818 --> 00:00:52.158\nlike here in Chandigarh, India,\n\n00:00:52.158 --> 00:00:54.478\nthe city which has been completely designed\n\n00:00:54.478 --> 00:00:56.617\nby the architect Le Corbusier.\n\n00:00:56.617 --> 00:00:59.597\nNow 60 years later, the city has been taken over\n\n00:00:59.597 --> 00:01:01.218\nby people in very different ways\n\n00:01:01.218 --> 00:01:04.540\nfrom whatever perhaps intended for,\n\n00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.846\nlike here, where you have the people\n\n00:01:06.846 --> 00:01:09.809\nsitting in the windows of the assembly hall.\n\n00:01:09.809 --> 00:01:11.896\nBut over the course of several years,\n\n00:01:11.896 --> 00:01:14.314\nI've been documenting Rem Koolhaas's\n\n00:01:14.314 --> 00:01:16.360\nCCTV building in Beijing\n\n00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.198\nand the olympic stadium in the same city\n\n00:01:19.198 --> 00:01:22.342\nby the architects Herzog and de Meuron.\n\n00:01:22.342 --> 00:01:25.787\nAt these large-scale construction sites in China,\n\n00:01:25.787 --> 00:01:27.910\nyou see a sort of makeshift camp\n\n00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.100\nwhere workers live during the entire building process.\n\n00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.582\nAs the length of the construction takes years,\n\n00:01:34.582 --> 00:01:37.340\nworkers end up forming a rather rough-and-ready\n\n00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.606\ninformal city, making for quite a juxtaposition\n\n00:01:40.606 --> 00:01:44.049\nagainst the sophisticated structures that they're building.\n\n00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.258\nOver the past seven years, I've been following\n\n00:01:46.258 --> 00:01:48.929\nmy fascination with the built environment,\n\n00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.632\nand for those of you who know me, you would say\n\n00:01:51.632 --> 00:01:53.618\nthat this obsession has led me to live\n\n00:01:53.618 --> 00:01:57.040\nout of a suitcase 365 days a year.\n\n00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.537\nBeing constantly on the move\n\n00:01:59.537 --> 00:02:01.352\nmeans that sometimes I am able\n\n00:02:01.352 --> 00:02:04.528\nto catch life's most unpredictable moments,\n\n00:02:04.528 --> 00:02:06.509\nlike here in New York\n\n00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.902\nthe day after the Sandy storm hit the city.\n\n00:02:10.902 --> 00:02:12.966\nJust over three years ago,\n\n00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.652\nI was for the first time in Caracas, Venezuela,\n\n00:02:15.652 --> 00:02:18.448\nand while flying over the city, I was just amazed\n\n00:02:18.448 --> 00:02:20.488\nby the extent to which the slums\n\n00:02:20.488 --> 00:02:22.937\nreach into every corner of the city,\n\n00:02:22.937 --> 00:02:25.674\na place where nearly 70 percent of the population\n\n00:02:25.674 --> 00:02:27.015\nlives in slums,\n\n00:02:27.015 --> 00:02:30.308\ndraped literally all over the mountains.\n\n00:02:30.308 --> 00:02:33.735\nDuring a conversation with local architects Urban-Think Tank,\n\n00:02:33.735 --> 00:02:36.088\nI learned about the Torre David,\n\n00:02:36.088 --> 00:02:38.631\na 45-story office building which sits\n\n00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:40.684\nright in the center of Caracas.\n\n00:02:40.684 --> 00:02:42.287\nThe building was under construction\n\n00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:44.813\nuntil the collapse of the Venezuelan economy\n\n00:02:44.813 --> 00:02:48.179\nand the death of the developer in the early '90s.\n\n00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:51.141\nAbout eight years ago, people started moving\n\n00:02:51.141 --> 00:02:53.154\ninto the abandoned tower\n\n00:02:53.154 --> 00:02:55.173\nand began to build their homes right in between\n\n00:02:55.173 --> 00:02:58.372\nevery column of this unfinished tower.\n\n00:02:58.372 --> 00:03:01.169\nThere's only one little entrance to the entire building,\n\n00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:04.107\nand the 3,000 residents come in and out\n\n00:03:04.107 --> 00:03:06.175\nthrough that single door.\n\n00:03:06.175 --> 00:03:09.064\nTogether, the inhabitants created public spaces\n\n00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:11.337\nand designed them to feel more like a home\n\n00:03:11.337 --> 00:03:13.932\nand less like an unfinished tower.\n\n00:03:13.932 --> 00:03:17.447\nIn the lobby, they painted the walls and planted trees.\n\n00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:20.457\nThey also made a basketball court.\n\n00:03:20.457 --> 00:03:22.157\nBut when you look up closely,\n\n00:03:22.157 --> 00:03:24.638\nyou see massive holes where elevators\n\n00:03:24.638 --> 00:03:27.218\nand services would have run through.\n\n00:03:27.218 --> 00:03:29.207\nWithin the tower, people have come up\n\n00:03:29.207 --> 00:03:31.473\nwith all sorts of solutions\n\n00:03:31.473 --> 00:03:33.454\nin response to the various needs\n\n00:03:33.454 --> 00:03:36.941\nwhich arise from living in an unfinished tower.\n\n00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:38.140\nWith no elevators,\n\n00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.468\nthe tower is like a 45-story walkup.\n\n00:03:41.468 --> 00:03:43.718\nDesigned in very specific ways\n\n00:03:43.718 --> 00:03:45.194\nby this group of people\n\n00:03:45.194 --> 00:03:49.090\nwho haven't had any education in architecture or design.\n\n00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.371\nAnd with each inhabitant finding their own\n\n00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:53.338\nunique way of coming by,\n\n00:03:53.338 --> 00:03:56.140\nthis tower becomes like a living city,\n\n00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.352\na place which is alive with micro-economies\n\n00:03:59.352 --> 00:04:01.269\nand small businesses.\n\n00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.883\nThe inventive inhabitants, for instance,\n\n00:04:03.883 --> 00:04:06.614\nfind opportunities in the most unexpected cases,\n\n00:04:06.614 --> 00:04:08.739\nlike the adjacent parking garage,\n\n00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.816\nwhich has been reclaimed as a taxi route\n\n00:04:10.816 --> 00:04:13.114\nto shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps\n\n00:04:13.114 --> 00:04:14.561\nin order to shorten the hike\n\n00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:18.579\nup to the apartments.\n\n00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.489\nA walk through the tower\n\n00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.599\nreveals how residents have figured out\n\n00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.125\nhow to create walls, how to make an air flow,\n\n00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:28.088\nhow to create transparency,\n\n00:04:28.088 --> 00:04:30.512\ncirculation throughout the tower,\n\n00:04:30.512 --> 00:04:32.331\nessentially creating a home\n\n00:04:32.331 --> 00:04:33.979\nthat's completely adapted\n\n00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.257\nto the conditions of the site.\n\n00:04:37.257 --> 00:04:39.382\nWhen a new inhabitant moves into the tower,\n\n00:04:39.382 --> 00:04:41.290\nthey already have a roof over their head,\n\n00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.329\nso they just typically mark their space\n\n00:04:43.329 --> 00:04:46.245\nwith a few curtains or sheets.\n\n00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:49.417\nSlowly, from found materials, walls rise,\n\n00:04:49.417 --> 00:04:52.340\nand people create a space out of any found objects\n\n00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.229\nor materials.\n\n00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.729\nIt's remarkable to see the design decisions\n\n00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.405\nthat they're making,\n\n00:04:58.405 --> 00:05:01.040\nlike when everything is made out of red bricks,\n\n00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.305\nsome residents will cover that red brick\n\n00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:07.166\nwith another layer of red brick-patterned wallpaper\n\n00:05:07.166 --> 00:05:12.218\njust to make it a kind of clean finish.\n\n00:05:12.218 --> 00:05:14.677\nThe inhabitants literally built up these homes\n\n00:05:14.677 --> 00:05:16.834\nwith their own hands, and this labor of love\n\n00:05:16.834 --> 00:05:18.587\ninstills a great sense of pride\n\n00:05:18.587 --> 00:05:21.839\nin many families living in this tower.\n\n00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:24.773\nThey typically make the best out of their conditions,\n\n00:05:24.773 --> 00:05:27.581\nand try to make their spaces look nice and homey,\n\n00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:31.128\nor at least up until as far as they can reach.\n\n00:05:31.128 --> 00:05:34.140\nThroughout the tower, you come across\n\n00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.306\nall kinds of services, like the barber,\n\n00:05:36.306 --> 00:05:40.119\nsmall factories, and every floor has\n\n00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:43.543\na little grocery store or shop.\n\n00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:46.053\nAnd you even find a church.\n\n00:05:46.053 --> 00:05:48.417\nAnd on the 30th floor, there is a gym\n\n00:05:48.417 --> 00:05:50.171\nwhere all the weights and barbells\n\n00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:51.967\nare made out of the leftover pulleys\n\n00:05:51.967 --> 00:05:55.377\nfrom the elevators which were never installed.\n\n00:05:55.377 --> 00:05:58.012\nFrom the outside, behind this always-changing facade,\n\n00:05:58.012 --> 00:05:59.631\nyou see how the fixed concrete beams\n\n00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:01.496\nprovide a framework for the inhabitants\n\n00:06:01.496 --> 00:06:02.963\nto create their homes\n\n00:06:02.963 --> 00:06:04.839\nin an organic, intuitive way\n\n00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:07.556\nthat responds directly to their needs.\n\n00:06:07.556 --> 00:06:10.211\nLet's go now to Africa, to Nigeria,\n\n00:06:10.211 --> 00:06:12.782\nto a community called Makoko,\n\n00:06:12.782 --> 00:06:15.341\na slum where 150,000 people\n\n00:06:15.341 --> 00:06:18.523\nlive just meters above the Lagos Lagoon.\n\n00:06:18.523 --> 00:06:22.237\nWhile it may appear to be a completely chaotic place,\n\n00:06:22.237 --> 00:06:24.643\nwhen you see it from above, there seems to be\n\n00:06:24.643 --> 00:06:27.808\na whole grid of waterways and canals\n\n00:06:27.808 --> 00:06:30.322\nconnecting each and every home.\n\n00:06:30.322 --> 00:06:34.536\nFrom the main dock, people board long wooden canoes\n\n00:06:34.536 --> 00:06:37.206\nwhich carry them out to their various homes and shops\n\n00:06:37.206 --> 00:06:39.881\nlocated in the expansive area.\n\n00:06:39.881 --> 00:06:41.828\nWhen out on the water, it's clear\n\n00:06:41.828 --> 00:06:43.717\nthat life has been completely adapted\n\n00:06:43.717 --> 00:06:46.356\nto this very specific way of living.\n\n00:06:46.356 --> 00:06:49.003\nEven the canoes become variety stores\n\n00:06:49.003 --> 00:06:50.943\nwhere ladies paddle from house to house,\n\n00:06:50.943 --> 00:06:55.059\nselling anything from toothpaste to fresh fruits.\n\n00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:57.078\nBehind every window and door frame,\n\n00:06:57.078 --> 00:06:59.781\nyou'll see a small child peering back at you,\n\n00:06:59.781 --> 00:07:02.765\nand while Makoko seems to be packed with people,\n\n00:07:02.765 --> 00:07:04.600\nwhat's more shocking is actually\n\n00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.085\nthe amount of children pouring out of every building.\n\n00:07:08.085 --> 00:07:10.065\nThe population growth in Nigeria,\n\n00:07:10.065 --> 00:07:12.534\nand especially in these areas like Makoko,\n\n00:07:12.534 --> 00:07:14.686\nare painful reminders\n\n00:07:14.686 --> 00:07:18.925\nof how out of control things really are.\n\n00:07:18.925 --> 00:07:21.204\nIn Makoko, very few systems\n\n00:07:21.204 --> 00:07:23.070\nand infrastructures exist.\n\n00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.002\nElectricity is rigged and freshest water\n\n00:07:26.002 --> 00:07:29.367\ncomes from self-built wells throughout the area.\n\n00:07:29.367 --> 00:07:31.771\nThis entire economic model\n\n00:07:31.771 --> 00:07:34.563\nis designed to meet a specific way of living\n\n00:07:34.563 --> 00:07:37.678\non the water, so fishing and boat-making\n\n00:07:37.678 --> 00:07:39.453\nare common professions.\n\n00:07:39.453 --> 00:07:41.420\nYou'll have a set of entrepreneurs\n\n00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.444\nwho have set up businesses throughout the area,\n\n00:07:44.444 --> 00:07:49.244\nlike barbershops, CD and DVD stores,\n\n00:07:49.244 --> 00:07:54.607\nmovie theaters, tailors, everything is there.\n\n00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:56.402\nThere is even a photo studio\n\n00:07:56.402 --> 00:07:58.159\nwhere you see the sort of aspiration\n\n00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:01.459\nto live in a real house or to be associated\n\n00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:05.758\nwith a faraway place, like that hotel in Sweden.\n\n00:08:05.758 --> 00:08:07.382\nOn this particular evening,\n\n00:08:07.382 --> 00:08:09.486\nI came across this live band\n\n00:08:09.486 --> 00:08:12.637\ndressed to the T in their coordinating outfits.\n\n00:08:12.637 --> 00:08:14.667\nThey were floating through the canals\n\n00:08:14.667 --> 00:08:17.591\nin a large canoe with a fitted-out generator\n\n00:08:17.591 --> 00:08:21.927\nfor all of the community to enjoy.\n\n00:08:21.927 --> 00:08:24.918\nBy nightfall, the area becomes almost pitch black,\n\n00:08:24.918 --> 00:08:26.746\nsave for a small lightbulb\n\n00:08:26.746 --> 00:08:29.480\nor a fire.\n\n00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.095\nWhat originally brought me to Makoko\n\n00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:33.902\nwas this project from a friend of mine,\n\n00:08:33.902 --> 00:08:36.703\nKunl\u00e9 Adeyemi, who recently finished building\n\n00:08:36.703 --> 00:08:38.749\nthis three-story floating school\n\n00:08:38.749 --> 00:08:40.770\nfor the kids in Makoko.\n\n00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.799\nWith this entire village existing on the water,\n\n00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:46.222\npublic space is very limited,\n\n00:08:46.222 --> 00:08:47.886\nso now that the school is finished,\n\n00:08:47.886 --> 00:08:51.260\nthe ground floor is a playground for the kids,\n\n00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.127\nbut when classes are out, the platform\n\n00:08:53.127 --> 00:08:54.698\nis just like a town square,\n\n00:08:54.698 --> 00:08:57.093\nwhere the fishermen mend their nets\n\n00:08:57.093 --> 00:09:01.258\nand floating shopkeepers dock their boats.\n\n00:09:01.258 --> 00:09:03.788\nAnother place I'd like to share with you\n\n00:09:03.788 --> 00:09:05.836\nis the Zabbaleen in Cairo.\n\n00:09:05.836 --> 00:09:08.595\nThey're descendants of farmers who began migrating\n\n00:09:08.595 --> 00:09:11.065\nfrom the upper Egypt in the '40s,\n\n00:09:11.065 --> 00:09:12.491\nand today they make their living\n\n00:09:12.491 --> 00:09:15.681\nby collecting and recycling waste from homes\n\n00:09:15.681 --> 00:09:17.932\nfrom all over Cairo.\n\n00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:21.054\nFor years, the Zabbaleen would live in makeshift villages\n\n00:09:21.054 --> 00:09:22.723\nwhere they would move around\n\n00:09:22.723 --> 00:09:25.242\ntrying to avoid the local authorities,\n\n00:09:25.242 --> 00:09:27.561\nbut in the early 1980s, they settled\n\n00:09:27.561 --> 00:09:29.278\non the Mokattam rocks\n\n00:09:29.278 --> 00:09:31.927\njust at the eastern edge of the city.\n\n00:09:31.927 --> 00:09:33.958\nToday, they live in this area,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.762\napproximately 50,000 to 70,000 people,\n\n00:09:36.762 --> 00:09:38.895\nwho live in this community of self-built\n\n00:09:38.895 --> 00:09:41.075\nmulti-story houses\n\n00:09:41.075 --> 00:09:45.368\nwhere up to three generations live in one structure.\n\n00:09:45.368 --> 00:09:47.846\nWhile these apartments that they built for themselves\n\n00:09:47.846 --> 00:09:50.831\nappear to lack any planning or formal grid,\n\n00:09:50.831 --> 00:09:54.237\neach family specializing in a certain form of recycling\n\n00:09:54.237 --> 00:09:56.470\nmeans that the ground floor of each apartment\n\n00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:00.127\nis reserved for garbage-related activities\n\n00:10:00.127 --> 00:10:04.150\nand the upper floor is dedicated to living space.\n\n00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.021\nI find it incredible to see\n\n00:10:06.021 --> 00:10:07.957\nhow these piles and piles of garbage\n\n00:10:07.957 --> 00:10:10.468\nare invisible to the people who live there,\n\n00:10:10.468 --> 00:10:13.868\nlike this very distinguished man who is posing\n\n00:10:13.868 --> 00:10:18.077\nwhile all this garbage is sort of streaming out behind him,\n\n00:10:18.077 --> 00:10:20.717\nor like these two young men who are sitting\n\n00:10:20.717 --> 00:10:25.569\nand chatting amongst these tons of garbage.\n\n00:10:25.569 --> 00:10:27.302\nWhile to most of us, living amongst\n\n00:10:27.302 --> 00:10:29.390\nthese piles and piles of garbage\n\n00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.741\nmay seem totally uninhabitable,\n\n00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:33.831\nto those in the Zabbaleen, this is just\n\n00:10:33.831 --> 00:10:36.310\na different type of normal.\n\n00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.947\nIn all these places I've talked about today,\n\n00:10:38.947 --> 00:10:41.068\nwhat I do find fascinating is that there's really\n\n00:10:41.068 --> 00:10:42.666\nno such thing as normal,\n\n00:10:42.666 --> 00:10:44.871\nand it proves that people are able to adapt\n\n00:10:44.871 --> 00:10:47.246\nto any kind of situation.\n\n00:10:47.246 --> 00:10:48.762\nThroughout the day, it's quite common\n\n00:10:48.762 --> 00:10:52.110\nto come across a small party taking place\n\n00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.954\nin the streets, just like this engagement party.\n\n00:10:55.954 --> 00:10:57.941\nIn this tradition, the bride-to-be\n\n00:10:57.941 --> 00:11:00.086\ndisplays all of their belongings,\n\n00:11:00.086 --> 00:11:02.280\nwhich they soon bring to their new husband.\n\n00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.311\nA gathering like this one\n\n00:11:04.311 --> 00:11:06.208\noffers such a juxtaposition\n\n00:11:06.208 --> 00:11:08.986\nwhere all the new stuff is displayed\n\n00:11:08.986 --> 00:11:11.352\nand all the garbage is used\n\n00:11:11.352 --> 00:11:17.989\nas props to display all their new home accessories.\n\n00:11:17.989 --> 00:11:20.155\nLike Makoko and the Torre David,\n\n00:11:20.155 --> 00:11:21.700\nthroughout the Zabbaleen you'll find all\n\n00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.844\nthe same facilities as in any typical neighborhood.\n\n00:11:24.844 --> 00:11:26.924\nThere are the retail shops, the cafes\n\n00:11:26.924 --> 00:11:29.244\nand the restaurants, and the community\n\n00:11:29.244 --> 00:11:32.185\nis this community of Coptic Christians,\n\n00:11:32.185 --> 00:11:34.424\nso you'll also find a church,\n\n00:11:34.424 --> 00:11:37.869\nalong with the scores of religious iconographies\n\n00:11:37.869 --> 00:11:39.627\nthroughout the area,\n\n00:11:39.627 --> 00:11:42.816\nand also all the everyday services\n\n00:11:42.816 --> 00:11:44.615\nlike the electronic repair shops,\n\n00:11:44.615 --> 00:11:47.703\nthe barbers, everything.\n\n00:11:47.703 --> 00:11:49.876\nVisiting the homes of the Zabbaleen\n\n00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:51.565\nis also full of surprises.\n\n00:11:51.565 --> 00:11:53.077\nWhile from the outside,\n\n00:11:53.077 --> 00:11:55.620\nthese homes look like any other informal structure\n\n00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.938\nin the city, when you step inside,\n\n00:11:57.938 --> 00:12:01.801\nyou are met with all manner of design decisions\n\n00:12:01.801 --> 00:12:04.068\nand interior decoration.\n\n00:12:04.068 --> 00:12:07.232\nDespite having limited access to space and money,\n\n00:12:07.232 --> 00:12:09.111\nthe homes in the area are designed\n\n00:12:09.111 --> 00:12:11.097\nwith care and detail.\n\n00:12:11.097 --> 00:12:13.140\nEvery apartment is unique,\n\n00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.933\nand this individuality tells a story\n\n00:12:14.933 --> 00:12:18.059\nabout each family's circumstances and values.\n\n00:12:18.059 --> 00:12:20.205\nMany of these people take their homes\n\n00:12:20.205 --> 00:12:23.373\nand interior spaces very seriously,\n\n00:12:23.373 --> 00:12:24.880\nputting a lot of work and care\n\n00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.206\ninto the details.\n\n00:12:26.206 --> 00:12:29.379\nThe shared spaces are also treated in the same manner,\n\n00:12:29.379 --> 00:12:33.236\nwhere walls are decorated in faux marble patterns.\n\n00:12:33.236 --> 00:12:36.219\nBut despite this elaborate decor,\n\n00:12:36.219 --> 00:12:38.773\nsometimes these apartments are used\n\n00:12:38.773 --> 00:12:40.583\nin very unexpected ways,\n\n00:12:40.583 --> 00:12:42.963\nlike this home which caught my attention\n\n00:12:42.963 --> 00:12:46.445\nwhile all the mud and the grass was literally\n\n00:12:46.445 --> 00:12:48.932\nseeping out under the front door.\n\n00:12:48.932 --> 00:12:52.731\nWhen I was let in, it appeared that this fifth-floor apartment\n\n00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:56.039\nwas being transformed into a complete animal farm,\n\n00:12:56.039 --> 00:12:58.930\nwhere six or seven cows stood grazing\n\n00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:03.602\nin what otherwise would be the living room.\n\n00:13:03.602 --> 00:13:06.970\nBut then in the apartment across the hall\n\n00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:09.493\nfrom this cow shed lives a newly married couple\n\n00:13:09.493 --> 00:13:11.319\nin what locals describe\n\n00:13:11.319 --> 00:13:19.440\nas one of the nicest apartments in the area.\n\n00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.666\nThe attention to this detail astonished me,\n\n00:13:22.666 --> 00:13:25.337\nand as the owner of the home so proudly\n\n00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:27.323\nled me around this apartment,\n\n00:13:27.323 --> 00:13:31.039\nfrom floor to ceiling, every part was decorated.\n\n00:13:31.039 --> 00:13:34.841\nBut if it weren't for the strangely familiar\n\n00:13:34.841 --> 00:13:37.704\nstomach-churning odor that constantly\n\n00:13:37.704 --> 00:13:41.149\npasses through the apartment,\n\n00:13:41.149 --> 00:13:43.742\nit would be easy to forget\n\n00:13:43.742 --> 00:13:46.434\nthat you are standing next to a cow shed\n\n00:13:46.434 --> 00:13:51.931\nand on top of a landfill.\n\n00:13:51.931 --> 00:13:54.610\nWhat moved me the most was that despite\n\n00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:56.644\nthese seemingly inhospitable conditions,\n\n00:13:56.644 --> 00:13:58.437\nI was welcomed with open arms\n\n00:13:58.437 --> 00:14:02.363\ninto a home that was made with love, care,\n\n00:14:02.363 --> 00:14:04.613\nand unreserved passion.\n\n00:14:04.613 --> 00:14:07.997\nLet's move across the map to China,\n\n00:14:07.997 --> 00:14:11.884\nto an area called Shanxi, Henan and Gansu.\n\n00:14:11.884 --> 00:14:15.574\nIn a region famous for the soft, porous Loess Plateau soil,\n\n00:14:15.574 --> 00:14:18.257\nthere lived until recently an estimated\n\n00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:22.126\n40 million people in these houses underground.\n\n00:14:22.126 --> 00:14:24.577\nThese dwellings are called the yaodongs.\n\n00:14:24.577 --> 00:14:26.767\nThrough this architecture by subtraction,\n\n00:14:26.767 --> 00:14:30.354\nthese yaodongs are built literally inside of the soil.\n\n00:14:30.354 --> 00:14:34.228\nIn these villages, you see an entirely altered landscape,\n\n00:14:34.228 --> 00:14:36.974\nand hidden behind these mounds of dirt\n\n00:14:36.974 --> 00:14:39.474\nare these square, rectangular houses\n\n00:14:39.474 --> 00:14:42.065\nwhich sit seven meters below the ground.\n\n00:14:42.065 --> 00:14:44.053\nWhen I asked people why they were digging\n\n00:14:44.053 --> 00:14:45.942\ntheir houses from the ground,\n\n00:14:45.942 --> 00:14:47.965\nthey simply replied that they are poor wheat\n\n00:14:47.965 --> 00:14:50.145\nand apple farmers who didn't have the money\n\n00:14:50.145 --> 00:14:53.546\nto buy materials, and this digging out\n\n00:14:53.546 --> 00:14:58.014\nwas their most logical form of living.\n\n00:14:58.014 --> 00:15:00.912\nFrom Makoko to Zabbaleen, these communities\n\n00:15:00.912 --> 00:15:02.911\nhave approached the tasks of planning,\n\n00:15:02.911 --> 00:15:05.310\ndesign and management of their communities\n\n00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:07.689\nand neighborhoods in ways that respond\n\n00:15:07.689 --> 00:15:11.599\nspecifically to their environment and circumstances.\n\n00:15:11.599 --> 00:15:13.830\nCreated by these very people who live,\n\n00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:17.541\nwork and play in these particular spaces,\n\n00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:20.538\nthese neighborhoods are intuitively designed\n\n00:15:20.538 --> 00:15:23.576\nto make the most of their circumstances.\n\n00:15:23.576 --> 00:15:25.481\nIn most of these places, the government\n\n00:15:25.481 --> 00:15:28.010\nis completely absent, leaving inhabitants\n\n00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.929\nwith no choice but to reappropriate found materials,\n\n00:15:31.929 --> 00:15:34.901\nand while these communities are highly disadvantaged,\n\n00:15:34.901 --> 00:15:36.943\nthey do present examples\n\n00:15:36.943 --> 00:15:39.391\nof brilliant forms of ingenuity,\n\n00:15:39.391 --> 00:15:41.719\nand prove that indeed we have the ability\n\n00:15:41.719 --> 00:15:45.262\nto adapt to all manner of circumstances.\n\n00:15:45.262 --> 00:15:47.455\nWhat makes places like the Torre David\n\n00:15:47.455 --> 00:15:49.252\nparticularly remarkable\n\n00:15:49.252 --> 00:15:51.153\nis this sort of skeleton framework\n\n00:15:51.153 --> 00:15:52.775\nwhere people can have a foundation\n\n00:15:52.775 --> 00:15:54.847\nwhere they can tap into.\n\n00:15:54.847 --> 00:15:57.945\nNow imagine what these already ingenious communities\n\n00:15:57.945 --> 00:16:00.037\ncould create themselves,\n\n00:16:00.037 --> 00:16:02.723\nand how highly particular their solutions would be,\n\n00:16:02.723 --> 00:16:05.265\nif they were given the basic infrastructures\n\n00:16:05.265 --> 00:16:07.244\nthat they could tap into.\n\n00:16:07.244 --> 00:16:10.751\nToday, you see these large residential development projects\n\n00:16:10.751 --> 00:16:13.206\nwhich offer cookie-cutter housing solutions\n\n00:16:13.206 --> 00:16:15.248\nto massive amounts of people.\n\n00:16:15.248 --> 00:16:17.808\nFrom China to Brazil, these projects attempt\n\n00:16:17.808 --> 00:16:20.815\nto provide as many houses as possible,\n\n00:16:20.815 --> 00:16:23.018\nbut they're completely generic\n\n00:16:23.018 --> 00:16:24.923\nand simply do not work as an answer\n\n00:16:24.923 --> 00:16:28.252\nto the individual needs of the people.\n\n00:16:28.252 --> 00:16:30.706\nI would like to end with a quote\n\n00:16:30.706 --> 00:16:33.787\nfrom a friend of mine and a source of inspiration,\n\n00:16:33.787 --> 00:16:36.553\nZita Cobb, the founder of the wonderful\n\n00:16:36.553 --> 00:16:38.229\nShorefast Foundation,\n\n00:16:38.229 -->

joy,\"\n\n00:16:46.082 --> 00:16:48.377\nand I couldn't agree with her more.\n\n00:16:48.377 --> 00:16:49.820\nThank you.\n\n00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.782\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "What will a future

privacy incident involving Adam and Eve, and the remarkable shift in the boundaries between public and private which has occurred in the past 10 years.You know the incident. Adam and Eve one day in the Garden of Eden realize they are naked. They freak out. And the rest is history.Nowadays, Adam and Eve would probably act differently.[@Adam Last nite was a blast! loved dat apple LOL][@Eve yep.. babe, know what happened to my pants tho?]We do reveal so much more information about ourselves online than ever before, and so much information about us is being collected by organizations. Now there is much to gain and benefit from this massive analysis of personal information, or big data, but there are also complex tradeoffs that come from giving away our privacy. And my story is about these tradeoffs.We start with an observation which, in my mind, has become clearer and clearer in the past few years, that any personal information can become sensitive information. Back in the year 2000, about 100 billion photos were shot worldwide, but only a minuscule proportion of them were actually uploaded online. In 2010, only on Facebook, in a single month, 2.5 billion photos were uploaded, most of them identified. In the same span of time, computers' ability to recognize people in photos improved by three orders of magnitude. What happens when you combine these technologies together: increasing availability of facial data; improving facial recognizing ability by computers; but also cloud computing, which gives anyone in this theater the kind of computational power which a few years ago was only the domain of three-letter agencies; and ubiquitous computing, which allows my phone, which is not a supercomputer, to connect to the Internet and do there hundreds of thousands of face metrics in a few seconds? Well, we conjecture that the result of this combination of technologies will be a radical change in our very notions of privacy and anonymity.To test that, we did an experiment on Carnegie Mellon University campus. We asked students who were walking by to participate in a study, and we took a shot with a webcam, and we asked them to fill out a survey on a laptop. While they were filling out the survey, we uploaded their shot to a cloud-computing cluster, and we started using a facial recognizer to match that shot to a database of some hundreds of thousands of images which we had downloaded from Facebook profiles. By the time the subject reached the last page on the survey, the page had been dynamically updated with the 10 best matching photos which the recognizer had found, and we asked the subjects to indicate whether he or she found themselves in the photo.Do you see the subject? Well, the computer did, and in fact did so for one out of three subjects.So essentially, we can start from an anonymous face, offline or online, and we can use facial recognition to give a name to that anonymous face thanks to social media data. But a few years back, we did something else. We started from social media data, we combined it statistically with data from U.S. government social security, and we ended up predicting social security numbers, which in the United States are extremely sensitive information.Do you see where I'm going with this? So if you combine the two studies together, then the question becomes, can you start from a face and, using facial recognition, find a name and publicly available information about that name and that person, and from that publicly available information infer non-publicly available information, much more sensitive ones which you link back to the face? And the answer is, yes, we can, and we did. Of course, the accuracy keeps getting worse. [27% of subjects' first 5 SSN digits identified (with 4 attempts)] But in fact, we even decided to develop an iPhone app which uses the phone's internal camera to take a shot of a subject and then upload it to a cloud and then do what I just described to you in real time: looking for a match, finding public information, trying to infer sensitive information, and then sending back to the phone so that it is overlaid on the face of the subject, an example of augmented reality, probably a creepy example of augmented reality. In fact, we didn't develop the app to make it available, just as a proof of concept.In fact, take these technologies and push them to their logical extreme. Imagine a future in which strangers around you will look at you through their Google Glasses or, one day, their contact lenses, and use seven or eight data points about you to infer anything else which may be known about you. What will this future without secrets look like? And should we care?We may like to believe that the future with so much wealth of data would be a future with no more biases, but in fact, having so much information doesn't mean that we will make decisions which are more objective. In another experiment, we presented to our subjects information about a potential job candidate. We included in this information some references to some funny, absolutely legal, but perhaps slightly embarrassing information that the subject had posted online. Now interestingly, among our subjects, some had posted comparable information, and some had not. Which group do you think was more likely to judge harshly our subject? Paradoxically, it was the group who had posted similar information, an example of moral dissonance.Now you may be thinking, this does not apply to me, because I have nothing to hide. But in fact, privacy is not about having something negative to hide. Imagine that you are the H.R. director of a certain organization, and you receive r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, and you decide to find more information about the candidates. Therefore, you Google their names and in a certain universe, you find this information. Or in a parallel universe, you find this information. Do you think that you would be equally likely to call either candidate for an interview? If you think so, then you are not like the U.S. employers who are, in fact, part of our experiment, meaning we did exactly that. We created Facebook profiles, manipulating traits, then we started sending out r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to companies in the U.S., and we detected, we monitored, whether they were searching for our candidates, and whether they were acting on the information they found on social media. And they were. Discrimination was happening through social media for equally skilled candidates.Now marketers like us to believe that all information about us will always be used in a manner which is in our favor. But think again. Why should that be always the case? In a movie which came out a few years ago, \"Minority Report,\" a famous scene had Tom Cruise walk in a mall and holographic personalized advertising would appear around him. Now, that movie is set in 2054, about 40 years from now, and as exciting as that technology looks, it already vastly underestimates the amount of information that organizations can gather about you, and how they can use it to influence you in a way that you will not even detect.So as an example, this is another experiment actually we are running, not yet completed. Imagine that an organization has access to your list of Facebook friends, and through some kind of algorithm they can detect the two friends that you like the most. And then they create, in real time, a facial composite of these two friends. Now studies prior to ours have shown that people don't recognize any longer even themselves in facial composites, but they react to those composites in a positive manner. So next time you are looking for a certain product, and there is an ad suggesting you to buy it, it will not be just a standard spokesperson. It will be one of your friends, and you will not even know that this is happening.Now the problem is that the current policy mechanisms we have to protect ourselves from the abuses of personal information are like bringing a knife to a gunfight. One of these mechanisms is transparency, telling people what you are going to do with their data. And in principle, that's a very good thing. It's necessary, but it is not sufficient. Transparency can be misdirected. You can tell people what you are going to do, and then you still nudge them to disclose arbitrary amounts of personal information.So in yet another experiment, this one with students, we asked them to provide information about their campus behavior, including pretty sensitive questions, such as this one. [Have you ever cheated in an exam?] Now to one group of subjects, we told them, \"Only other students will see your answers.\" To another group of subjects, we told them, \"Students and faculty will see your answers.\" Transparency. Notification. And sure enough, this worked, in the sense that the first group of subjects were much more likely to disclose than the second. It makes sense, right? But then we added the misdirection. We repeated the experiment with the same two groups, this time adding a delay between the time we told subjects how we would use their data and the time we actually started answering the questions.How long a delay do you think we had to add in order to nullify the inhibitory effect of knowing that faculty would see your answers? Ten minutes? Five minutes? One minute? How about 15 seconds? Fifteen seconds were sufficient to have the two groups disclose the same amount of information, as if the second group now no longer cares for faculty reading their answers.Now I have to admit that this talk so far may sound exceedingly gloomy, but that is not my point. In fact, I want to share with you the fact that there are alternatives. The way we are doing things now is not the only way they can done, and certainly not the best way they can be done. When someone tells you, \"People don't care about privacy,\" consider whether the game has been designed and rigged so that they cannot care about privacy, and coming to the realization that these manipulations occur is already halfway through the process of being able to protect yourself. When someone tells you that privacy is incompatible with the benefits of big data, consider that in the last 20 years, researchers have created technologies to allow virtually any electronic transactions to take place in a more privacy-preserving manner. We can browse the Internet anonymously. We can send emails that can only be read by the intended recipient, not even the NSA. We can have even privacy-preserving data mining. In other words, we can have the benefits of big data while protecting privacy. Of course, these technologies imply a shifting of cost and revenues between data holders and data subjects, which is why, perhaps, you don't hear more about them.Which brings me back to the Garden of Eden. There is a second privacy interpretation of the story of the Garden of Eden which doesn't have to do with the issue of Adam and Eve feeling naked and feeling ashamed. You can find echoes of this interpretation in John Milton's \"Paradise Lost.\" In the garden, Adam and Eve are materially content. They're happy. They are satisfied. However, they also lack knowledge and self-awareness. The moment they eat the aptly named fruit of knowledge, that's when they discover themselves. They become aware. They achieve autonomy. The price to pay, however, is leaving the garden. So privacy, in a way, is both the means and the price to pay for freedom.Again, marketers tell us that big data and social media are not just a paradise of profit for them, but a Garden of Eden for the rest of us. We get free content. We get to play Angry Birds. We get targeted apps. But in fact, in a few years, organizations will know so much about us, they will be able to infer our desires before we even form them, and perhaps buy products on our behalf before we even know we need them.Now there was one English author who anticipated this kind of future where we would trade away our autonomy and freedom for comfort. Even more so than George Orwell, the author is, of course, Aldous Huxley. In \"Brave New World,\" he imagines a society where technologies that we created originally for freedom end up coercing us. However, in the book, he also offers us a way out of that society, similar to the path that Adam and Eve had to follow to leave the garden. In the words of the Savage, regaining autonomy and freedom is possible, although the price to pay is steep. So I do believe that one of the defining fights of our times will be the fight for the control over personal information, the fight over whether big data will become a force for freedom, rather than a force which will hiddenly manipulate us.Right now, many of us do not even know that the fight is going on, but it is, whether you like it or not. And at the risk of playing the serpent, I will tell you that the tools for the fight are here, the awareness of what is going on, and in your hands, just a few clicks away.Thank you.(Applause)", "id":

00:01:21.460\nhas become clearer and clearer in the past few years,\n\n00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.557\nthat any personal information\n\n00:01:23.557 --> 00:01:25.842\ncan become sensitive information.\n\n00:01:25.842 --> 00:01:29.967\nBack in the year 2000, about 100 billion photos\n\n00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:31.879\nwere shot worldwide,\n\n00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:34.944\nbut only a minuscule proportion of them\n\n00:01:34.944 --> 00:01:36.827\nwere actually uploaded online.\n\n00:01:36.827 --> 00:01:40.188\nIn 2010, only on Facebook, in a single month,\n\n00:01:40.188 --> 00:01:43.458\n2.5 billion photos were uploaded,\n\n00:01:43.458 --> 00:01:45.340\nmost of them identified.\n\n00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.220\nIn the same span of time,\n\n00:01:47.220 -->

kind of computational power\n\n00:02:11.017 --> 00:02:12.903\nwhich a few years ago was only the domain\n\n00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:14.685\nof three-letter agencies;\n\n00:02:14.685 -->

that the result\n\n00:02:28.227 --> 00:02:30.291\nof this combination of technologies\n\n00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:33.179\nwill be a radical change in our very notions\n\n00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:35.436\nof privacy and anonymity.\n\n00:02:35.436 --> 00:02:37.429\nTo test that, we did an experiment\n\n00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:39.550\non Carnegie Mellon University campus.\n\n00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.649\nWe asked students who were walking by\n\n00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:43.428\nto participate in a study,\n\n00:02:43.428 --> 00:02:45.990\nand we took a shot with a webcam,\n\n00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.772\nand we asked them to fill out a survey on a laptop.\n\n00:02:48.772 --> 00:02:50.751\nWhile they were filling out the survey,\n\n00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:53.548\nwe uploaded their shot to a cloud-computing cluster,\n\n00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:55.275\nand we started using a facial recognizer\n\n00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:57.680\nto match that shot to a database\n\n00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.073\nof some hundreds of thousands of images\n\n00:03:00.073 --> 00:03:03.669\nwhich we had downloaded from Facebook profiles.\n\n00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.928\nBy the time the subject reached the last page\n\n00:03:06.928 --> 00:03:10.275\non the survey, the page had been dynamically updated\n\n00:03:10.275 --> 00:03:12.588\nwith the 10 best matching photos\n\n00:03:12.588 --> 00:03:14.873\nwhich the recognizer had found,\n\n00:03:14.873 --> 00:03:16.611\nand we asked the subjects to indicate\n\n00:03:16.611 --> 00:03:20.731\nwhether he or she found themselves in the photo.\n\n00:03:20.731 --> 00:03:24.430\nDo you see the subject?\n\n00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.275\nWell, the computer did, and in fact did so\n\n00:03:27.275 --> 00:03:29.424\nfor one out of three subjects.\n\n00:03:29.424 --> 00:03:32.608\nSo essentially, we can start from an anonymous face,\n\n00:03:32.608 --> 00:03:36.092\noffline or online, and we can use facial recognition\n\n00:03:36.092 --> 00:03:38.452\nto give a name to that anonymous face\n\n00:03:38.452 --> 00:03:40.560\nthanks to social media data.\n\n00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.432\nBut a few years back, we did something else.\n\n00:03:42.432 --> 00:03:44.255\nWe started from social media data,\n\n00:03:44.255 --> 00:03:47.306\nwe combined it statistically with data\n\n00:03:47.306 --> 00:03:49.408\nfrom U.S. government social security,\n\n00:03:49.408 --> 00:03:52.732\nand we ended up predicting social security numbers,\n\n00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.244\nwhich in the United States\n\n00:03:54.244 --> 00:03:56.284\nare extremely sensitive information.\n\n00:03:56.284 --> 00:03:58.377\nDo you see where I'm going with this?\n\n00:03:58.377 --> 00:04:01.299\nSo if you combine the two studies together,\n\n00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:02.811\nthen the question becomes,\n\n00:04:02.811 --> 00:04:05.531\ncan you start from a face and,\n\n00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:07.842\nusing facial recognition, find a name\n\n00:04:07.842 --> 00:04:10.511\nand publicly available information\n\n00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:12.443\nabout that name and that person,\n\n00:04:12.443 --> 00:04:14.691\nand from that publicly available information\n\n00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:16.733\ninfer non-publicly available information,\n\n00:04:16.733 --> 00:04:18.339\nmuch more sensitive ones\n\n00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:19.831\nwhich you link back to the face?\n\n00:04:19.831 --> 00:04:21.747\nAnd the answer is, yes, we can, and we did.\n\n00:04:21.747 --> 00:04:24.315\nOf course, the accuracy keeps getting worse.\n\n00:04:24.315 --> 00:04:25.259\n[27% of subjects' first 5 SSN digits identified (with 4 attempts)]\n\n00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:29.086\nBut in fact, we even decided to develop an iPhone app\n\n00:04:29.086 -->

00:04:37.550\nand then do what I just described to you in real time:\n\n00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.638\nlooking for a match, finding public information,\n\n00:04:39.638 --> 00:04:41.368\ntrying to infer sensitive information,\n\n00:04:41.368 --> 00:04:43.959\nand then sending back to the phone\n\n00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:47.568\nso that it is overlaid on the face of the subject,\n\n00:04:47.568

should we care?\n\n00:05:24.631 --> 00:05:26.522\nWe may like to believe\n\n00:05:26.522 --> 00:05:29.562\nthat the future with so much wealth of data\n\n00:05:29.562 --> 00:05:32.076\nwould be a

00:05:39.556\nwhich are more objective.\n\n00:05:39.556 --> 00:05:42.116\nIn another experiment, we presented to our subjects\n\n00:05:42.116 --> 00:05:44.362\ninformation about a potential job candidate.\n\n00:05:44.362 --> 00:05:47.540\nWe included in this information some references\n\n00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.186\nto some funny, absolutely legal,\n\n00:05:50.186 --> 00:05:52.651\nbut perhaps slightly embarrassing information\n\n00:05:52.651 --> 00:05:54.671\nthat the subject had posted online.\n\n00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:57.037\nNow interestingly, among our subjects,\n\n00:05:57.037

00:06:08.983\nwas more likely to judge harshly our subject?\n\n00:06:08.983 --> 00:06:10.940\nParadoxically, it was the group\n\n00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.673\nwho had posted similar

What makes us who we are anyway?HP: (In Chinese)YR: I used to read Spider-Man comics, watch kung fu movies, take philosophy lessons from Bruce Lee. He would say things like \u2014HP: Empty your mind. (Laughter) Be formless, shapeless, like water. Now you put water into a cup. It becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. Put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend. (Applause)YR: This year, I am 32 years old, the same age Bruce Lee was when he died. I have been wondering recently, if he were alive today, what advice he would give me about making this TED Talk.HP: Don't imitate my voice. It offends me.(Laughter)YR: Good advice, but I still think that we learn who we are by copying others. Who here hasn't imitated their childhood hero in the playground, or mum or father? I have.HP: A few years ago, in order to make this video for my artwork, I shaved off all my hair so that I could grow it back as my father had it when he first emigrated from India to the U.K. in the 1960s. He had a side parting and a neat mustache.At first, it was going very well. I even started to get discounts in Indian shops.(Laughter)But then very quickly, I started to underestimate my mustache growing ability, and it got way too big. It didn't look Indian anymore. Instead, people from across the road, they would shout things like \u2014HP and YR: Arriba! Arriba! \u00c1ndale! \u00c1ndale!(Laughter)HP: Actually, I don't know why I am even talking like this. My dad doesn't even have an Indian accent anymore. He talks like this now.So it's not just my father that I've imitated. A few years ago I went to China for a few months, and I couldn't speak Chinese, and this frustrated me, so I wrote about this and had it translated into Chinese, and then I learned this by heart, like music, I guess.YR: This phrase is now etched into my mind clearer than the pin number to my bank card, so I can pretend I speak Chinese fluently. When I had learned this phrase, I had an artist over there hear me out to see how accurate it sounded.I spoke the phrase, and then he laughed and told me, \"Oh yeah, that's great, only it kind of sounds like a woman.\"I said, \"What?\"He said, \"Yeah, you learned from a woman?\"I said, \"Yes. So?\"He then explained the tonal differences between male and female voices are very different and distinct, and that I had learned it very well, but in a woman's voice.(Laughter)(Applause)HP: Okay. So this imitation business does come with risk. It doesn't always go as you plan it, even with a talented translator. But I am going to stick with it, because contrary to what we might usually assume, imitating somebody can reveal something unique. So every time I fail to become more like my father, I become more like myself. Every time I fail to become Bruce Lee, I become more authentically me.This is my art. I strive for authenticity, even if it comes in a shape that we might not usually expect. It's only recently that I've started to understand that I didn't learn to sit like this through being Indian. I learned this from Spider-Man.(Laughter)Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1849, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.864 --> 00:00:23.261\nHetain Patel: (In Chinese)\n\n00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:26.564\nYuyu Rau: Hi, I'm Hetain.

I set up a climate change NGO called The Climate Group. I worked on forestry issues in WWF. I worked on development and agriculture issues in the U.N. system. About 25 years in total, and then three years ago, I found myself talking to IKEA's CEO about joining his team. Like many people here, well, I want to maximize my personal impact in the world, so I'm going to explain why I joined the team there.But first, let's just take three numbers.The first number is three: three billion people. This is the number of people joining the global middle class by 2030, coming out of poverty. It's fantastic for them and their families, but we've got two billion people in the global middle class today, and this swells that number to five, a big challenge when we already have resource scarcity.The second number is six: This is six degrees centigrade, what we're heading towards in terms of global warming. We're not heading towards one degree or three degrees or four degrees, we're heading toward six degrees. And if you think about it, all of the weird weather we've been having the last few years, much of that is due to just one degree warming, and we need CO2 emissions to peak by the end of this decade globally and then come down. It's not inevitable, but we need to act decisively.The third number is 12: That's the number of cities in the world that had a million or more people when my grandmother was born. You can see my grandmother there. That was in the beginning of the last century. So just 12 cities. She was born in Manchester, England, the ninth largest city in the world. Now there are 500 cities, nearly, with a million people or more in them. And if you look at the century from 1950 to 2050, that's the century when we build all the world's cities, the century that we're in the middle of right now. Every other century was kind of practice, and this lays down a blueprint for how we live.So think about it. We're building cities like never before, bringing people out of poverty like never before, and changing the climate like never before. Sustainability has gone from a nice-to-do to a must-do. it's about what we do right here, right now, and for the rest of our working lives.So I'm going to talk a little bit about what business can do and what a business like IKEA can do, and we have a sustainability strategy called \"people and planet positive\" to help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world. Why would we not want to have a positive impact on the world as a business? Other companies have sustainability strategies. I'm going to refer to some of those as well, and I'm just going to mention a few of the commitments as illustrations that we've got.But first, let's think of customers. We know from asking people from China to the U.S. that the vast majority of people care about sustainability after the day-to-day issues, the day-to-day issues of, how do I get my kids to school? Can I pay the bills at the end of the month? Then they care about big issues like climate change. But they want it to be easy, affordable and attractive, and they expect business to help, and they're a little bit disappointed today.So take your mind back and think of the first sustainable products. We had detergents that could wash your whites grayer. We had the early energy-efficient light bulbs that took five minutes to warm up and then you were left looking a kind of sickly color. And we had the rough, recycled toilet paper. So every time you pulled on a t-shirt, or switched the light on, or went to the bathroom, or sometimes all three together, you were reminded sustainability was about compromise. It wasn't a great start.Today we have choices. We can make products that are beautiful or ugly, sustainable or unsustainable, affordable or expensive, functional or useless. So let's make beautiful, functional, affordable, sustainable products.Let's take the LED. The LED is the next best thing to daylight. The old-fashioned lightbulbs, the incandescent bulbs \u2014 I'm not going to ask for a show of hands of how many of you still have them in your homes, wasting energy every time you switch them on \u2014 change them after this \u2014 or whether we have them on the stage here at TED or not \u2014 but those old incandescent light bulbs really should have been sold as heaters. They were mis-sold for more than a hundred years. They produced heat and a little bit of light on the side. Now we have lights that produce light and a little bit of heat on the side. You save 85 percent of the electricity with an LED that you would have done in an old incandescent. And the best thing is, they'll also last for more than 20 years. So think about that. You'll change your smartphone seven or eight times, probably more if you're in this audience. You'll change your car, if you have one, three or four times. Your kids could go to school, go to college, go away and have kids of their own, come back, bring the grandkids, you'll have the same lightbulb saving you energy. So LEDs are fantastic. What we decided to do was not to sell LEDs on the side marked up high and continue to push all the old bulbs, the halogens and the CFLs. We decided, over the next two years, we will ban the halogens and the CFLs ourselves. We will go all in. And this is what business needs to do: go all-in, go 100 percent, because then you stop investing in the old stuff, you invest in the new stuff, you lower costs, you use your supply chain and your creativity and you get the prices down so everybody can afford the best lights so they can save energy.(Applause)It's not just about products in people's homes. We've got to think about the raw materials that produce our products. Obviously there's fantastic opportunities with recycled materials, and we can and will go zero waste. And there's opportunities in a circular economy. But we're still dependent on natural, raw materials. Let's take cotton. Cotton's brilliant. Probably many people are wearing cotton right now. It's a brilliant textile in use. It's really dirty in production. It uses lots of pesticides, lots of fertilizer, lots of water. So we've worked with others, with other businesses and NGOs, on the Better Cotton Initiative, working right back down to the farm, and there you can halve the amount of water and halve the chemical inputs, the yields increase, and 60 percent of the costs of running many of these farms with farmers with low incomes can be chemical imports. Yields increase, and you halve the input costs. Farmers are coming out of poverty. They love it. Already hundreds of thousands of farmers have been reached, and now we've got 60 percent better cotton in our business. Again, we're going all-in. By 2015, we'll be 100 percent Better Cotton.Take the topic of 100 percent targets, actually. People sometimes think that 100 percent's going to be hard, and we've had the conversation in the business. Actually, we found 100 percent is easier to do than 90 percent or 50 percent. If you have a 90 percent target, everyone in the business finds a reason to be in the 10 percent. When it's 100 percent, it's kind of clear, and businesspeople like clarity, because then you just get the job done.So, wood. We know with forestry, it's a choice. You've got illegal logging and deforestation still on a very large scale, or you can have fantastic, responsible forestry that we can be proud of. It's a simple choice, so we've worked for many years with the Forest Stewardship Council, with literally hundreds of other organizations, and there's a point here about collaboration. So hundreds of others, of NGOs, of forest workers' unions, and of businesses, have helped create the Forest Stewardship Council, which sets standards for forestry and then checks the forestry's good on the ground. Now together, through our supply chain, with partners, we've managed to certify 35 million hectares of forestry. That's about the size of Germany. And we've decided in the next three years, we will double the volume of certified material we put through our business. So be decisive on these issues. Use your supply chain to drive good.But then it comes to your operations. Some things are certain, I think. We know we'll use electricity in 20 or 30 years' time. We know the sun will be shining somewhere, and the wind will still be blowing in 20 or 30 years' time. So why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind? And why not take control of it ourselves? So we're going 100 percent renewable. By 2020, we'll produce more renewable energy than the energy we consume as a business. For all of our stores, our own factories, our distribution centers, we've installed 300,000 solar panels so far, and we've got 14 wind farms we own and operate in six countries, and we're not done yet. But think of a solar panel. A solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years. The electricity is free. Every time the sun comes out after that, the electricity is free. So this is a good thing for the CFO, not just the sustainability guy. Every business can do things like this.But then we've got to look beyond our operations, and I think everybody would agree that now business has to take full responsibility for the impacts of your supply chain. Many businesses now, fortunately, have codes of conduct and audit their supply chains, but not every business. Far from it. And this came in IKEA actually in the '90s. We found there was a risk of child labor in the supply chain, and people in the business were shocked. And it was clearly totally unacceptable, so then you have to act. So a code of conduct was developed, and now we have 80 auditors out in the world every day making sure all our factories secure good working conditions and protect human rights and make sure there is no child labor.But it's not just as simple as making sure there's no child labor. You've got to say that's not enough today. I think we'd all agree that children are the most important people in the world and the most vulnerable. So what can a business do today to actually use your total value chain to support a better quality of life and protect child rights? We've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children on developing some new business principles with children's rights. Increasing numbers of businesses are signing up to these, but actually in a survey, many business leaders said they thought their business had nothing to do with children. So what we decided to do was, we will look and ask ourselves the tough questions with partners who know more than us, what can we do to go beyond our business to help improve the lives of children? We also have a foundation that's committed to work through partners and help improve the lives and protect the rights of 100 million children by 2015.You know the phrase, you can manage what you measure? Well, you should measure what you care about. If you're not measuring things, you don't care and you don't know. So let's take an example, measure the things that are important in your business. Isn't it about time that businesses were led equally by men and women?(Applause)So we know for our 17,000 managers across IKEA that 47 percent are women today, but it's not enough, and we want to close the gap and follow it all the way through to senior management. And we do not want to wait another hundred years. So we've launched a women's open network this week in IKEA, and we'll do whatever it takes to lead the change. So the message here is, measure what you care about and lead the change, and don't wait a hundred years.So we've gone from sustainability being a nice-to-do to a must-do. It's a must-do. It's still nice to do, but it's a must-do. And everybody can do something on this as an individual. Be a discerning consumer. Vote with your wallets. Search out the companies that are acting on this. But also, there are other businesses already acting. I mentioned renewable energy. You go to Google or Lego, they're going 100 percent renewable too, in the same way that we are. On having really good sustainability strategies, there are companies like Nike, Patagonia, Timberland, Marks & Spencer. But I don't think any of those businesses would say they're perfect. We certainly wouldn't. We'll make mistakes going forward, but it's about setting a clear direction, being transparent, having a dialogue with the right partners, and choosing to lead on the issues that really count.So if you're a business leader, if you're not already weaving sustainability right into the heart of your business model, I'd urge you to do so. And together, we can help create a sustainable world, and, if we get it right, we can make sustainability affordable for the many people, not a luxury for the few.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1850, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.252 --> 00:00:15.005\nI've spent my life working on sustainability.\n\n00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:17.060\nI set up a climate change NGO\n\n00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.380\ncalled The Climate Group.\n\n00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.771\nI worked on forestry issues in WWF.\n\n00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:23.847\nI worked on development and agriculture issues\n\n00:00:23.847 --> 00:00:25.582\nin the U.N. system.\n\n00:00:25.582 --> 00:00:27.506\nAbout 25 years in total,\n\n00:00:27.506 --> 00:00:30.229\nand then three years ago, I found myself talking to\n\n00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:33.514\nIKEA's CEO about joining his team.\n\n00:00:33.514 --> 00:00:35.540\nLike many people here, well,\n\n00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.475\nI want to maximize my personal impact in the world,\n\n00:00:39.475 --> 00:00:44.161\nso I'm going to explain why I joined the team there.\n\n00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:46.968\nBut first, let's just take three numbers.\n\n00:00:46.968 --> 00:00:49.039\nThe first number is three:\n\n00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.599\nthree billion people.\n\n00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:52.410\nThis is the number of people joining\n\n00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.462\nthe global middle class by 2030,\n\n00:00:54.462 --> 00:00:55.771\ncoming out of poverty.\n\n00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:58.012\nIt's fantastic for them and their families,\n\n00:00:58.012 --> 00:01:01.055\nbut we've got two billion people in the global middle class today,\n\n00:01:01.055 --> 00:01:03.352\nand this swells that number to five,\n\n00:01:03.352 --> 00:01:06.682\na big challenge when we already have resource scarcity.\n\n00:01:06.682 --> 00:01:08.559\nThe second number is six:\n\n00:01:08.559 --> 00:01:10.704\nThis is six degrees centigrade,\n\n00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:13.268\nwhat we're heading towards in terms of global warming.\n\n00:01:13.268 --> 00:01:15.319\nWe're not heading towards one degree or three degrees\n\n00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:17.667\nor four degrees, we're heading toward six degrees.\n\n00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:20.356\nAnd if you think about it, all of the weird weather\n\n00:01:20.356 --> 00:01:22.199\nwe've been having the last few years,\n\n00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:24.781\nmuch of that is due to just one degree warming,\n\n00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:27.076\nand we need CO2 emissions to peak\n\n00:01:27.076 --> 00:01:29.308\nby the end of this decade globally\n\n00:01:29.308 --> 00:01:31.036\nand then come down.\n\n00:01:31.036 --> 00:01:35.107\nIt's not inevitable, but we need to act decisively.\n\n00:01:35.107 --> 00:01:36.868\nThe third number is 12:\n\n00:01:36.868 --> 00:01:38.361\nThat's the number of cities in the world\n\n00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:40.152\nthat had a million or more people\n\n00:01:40.152 --> 00:01:41.585\nwhen my grandmother was born.\n\n00:01:41.585 --> 00:01:43.205\nYou can see my grandmother there.\n\n00:01:43.205 --> 00:01:45.248\nThat was in the beginning of the last century.\n\n00:01:45.248 --> 00:01:47.264\nSo just 12 cities. She was born in Manchester, England,\n\n00:01:47.264 --> 00:01:49.285\nthe ninth largest city in the world.\n\n00:01:49.285 --> 00:01:51.990\nNow there are 500 cities, nearly,\n\n00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.421\nwith a million people or more in them.\n\n00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:57.765\nAnd if you look at the century from 1950 to 2050,\n\n00:01:57.765 --> 00:02:01.509\nthat's the century when we build all the world's cities,\n\n00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.919\nthe century that we're in the middle of right now.\n\n00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:06.765\nEvery other century was kind of practice,\n\n00:02:06.765 --> 00:02:11.583\nand this lays down a blueprint for how we live.\n\n00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:13.338\nSo think about it.\n\n00:02:13.338 --> 00:02:16.108\nWe're building cities like never before,\n\n00:02:16.108 --> 00:02:18.634\nbringing people out of poverty like never before,\n\n00:02:18.634 --> 00:02:21.009\nand changing the climate like never before.\n\n00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.069\nSustainability has gone from a nice-to-do\n\n00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.734\nto a must-do.\n\n00:02:25.734 --> 00:02:28.567\nit's about what we do right here, right now,\n\n00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:32.248\nand for the rest of our working lives.\n\n00:02:32.248 --> 00:02:34.280\nSo I'm going to talk a little bit about\n\n00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.653\nwhat business can do\n\n00:02:35.653 --> 00:02:37.955\nand what a business like IKEA can do,\n\n00:02:37.955 --> 00:02:40.622\nand we have a sustainability strategy\n\n00:02:40.622 --> 00:02:42.619\ncalled \"people and planet positive\"\n\n00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:46.266\nto help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world.\n\n00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.401\nWhy would we not want to have a positive impact\n\n00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:50.989\non the world as a business?\n\n00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.477\nOther companies have sustainability strategies.\n\n00:02:53.477 --> 00:02:55.315\nI'm going to refer to some of those as well,\n\n00:02:55.315 --> 00:02:56.852\nand I'm just going to mention a few\n\n00:02:56.852 --> 00:02:59.448\nof the commitments as illustrations that we've got.\n\n00:02:59.448 --> 00:03:01.464\nBut first, let's think of customers.\n\n00:03:01.464 --> 00:03:05.289\nWe know from asking people from China to the U.S.\n\n00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.617\nthat the vast majority of people care about sustainability\n\n00:03:08.617 --> 00:03:10.499\nafter the day-to-day issues,\n\n00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:13.076\nthe day-to-day issues of, how do I get my kids to school?\n\n00:03:13.076 --> 00:03:15.055\nCan I pay the bills at the end of the month?\n\n00:03:15.055 --> 00:03:18.517\nThen they care about big issues like climate change.\n\n00:03:18.517 --> 00:03:22.949\nBut they want it to be easy, affordable and attractive,\n\n00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:24.941\nand they expect business to help,\n\n00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:27.735\nand they're a little bit disappointed today.\n\n00:03:27.735 --> 00:03:30.369\nSo take your mind back and think\n\n00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:31.956\nof the first sustainable products.\n\n00:03:31.956 --> 00:03:35.869\nWe had detergents that could wash your whites grayer.\n\n00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:38.923\nWe had the early energy-efficient light bulbs\n\n00:03:38.923 --> 00:03:40.770\nthat took five minutes to warm up\n\n00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.841\nand then you were left looking a kind of sickly color.\n\n00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:47.209\nAnd we had the rough, recycled toilet paper.\n\n00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.941\nSo every time you pulled on a t-shirt,\n\n00:03:49.941 --> 00:03:52.047\nor switched the light on, or went to the bathroom,\n\n00:03:52.047 --> 00:03:53.716\nor sometimes all three together,\n\n00:03:53.716 --> 00:03:57.161\nyou were reminded sustainability was about compromise.\n\n00:03:57.161 --> 00:04:00.059\nIt wasn't a great start.\n\n00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:02.347\nToday we have choices.\n\n00:04:02.347 --> 00:04:05.644\nWe can make products that are beautiful or ugly,\n\n00:04:05.644 --> 00:04:10.445\nsustainable or unsustainable, affordable or expensive,\n\n00:04:10.445 --> 00:04:12.308\nfunctional or useless.\n\n00:04:12.308 --> 00:04:15.173\nSo let's make beautiful, functional, affordable,\n\n00:04:15.173 --> 00:04:17.493\nsustainable products.\n\n00:04:17.493 --> 00:04:19.789\nLet's take the LED.\n\n00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.203\nThe LED is the next best thing to daylight.\n\n00:04:23.203 --> 00:04:26.384\nThe old-fashioned lightbulbs, the incandescent bulbs --\n\n00:04:26.384 --> 00:04:27.892\nI'm not going to ask for a show of hands\n\n00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:30.181\nof how many of you still have them in your homes,\n\n00:04:30.181 --> 00:04:33.003\nwasting energy every time you switch them on --\n\n00:04:33.003 --> 00:04:34.440\nchange them after this --\n\n00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.133\nor whether we have them on the stage here at TED or not --\n\n00:04:38.133 --> 00:04:41.924\nbut those old incandescent light bulbs\n\n00:04:41.924 --> 00:04:44.946\nreally should have been sold as heaters.\n\n00:04:44.946 --> 00:04:46.923\nThey were mis-sold for more than a hundred years.\n\n00:04:46.923 --> 00:04:49.365\nThey produced heat and a little bit of light on the side.\n\n00:04:49.365 --> 00:04:51.437\nNow we have lights that produce light\n\n00:04:51.437 --> 00:04:53.129\nand a little bit of heat on the side.\n\n00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:55.955\nYou save 85 percent of the electricity with an LED\n\n00:04:55.955 --> 00:04:57.998\nthat you would have done in an old incandescent.\n\n00:04:57.998 --> 00:04:59.733\nAnd the best thing is, they'll also last\n\n00:04:59.733 --> 00:05:01.312\nfor more than 20 years.\n\n00:05:01.312 --> 00:05:02.568\nSo think about that.\n\n00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:05.064\nYou'll change your smartphone seven or eight times,\n\n00:05:05.064 --> 00:05:07.140\nprobably more if you're in this audience.\n\n00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.750\nYou'll change your car, if you have one, three or four times.\n\n00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.302\nYour kids could go to school, go to college,\n\n00:05:12.302 --> 00:05:14.257\ngo away and have kids of their own, come back,\n\n00:05:14.257 --> 00:05:15.683\nbring the grandkids,\n\n00:05:15.683 --> 00:05:19.569\nyou'll have the same lightbulb saving you energy.\n\n00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.408\nSo LEDs are fantastic.\n\n00:05:22.408 --> 00:05:23.934\nWhat we decided to do\n\n00:05:23.934 --> 00:05:26.887\nwas not to sell LEDs on the side marked up high\n\n00:05:26.887 --> 00:05:29.113\nand continue to push all the old bulbs,\n\n00:05:29.113 --> 00:05:31.104\nthe halogens and the CFLs.\n\n00:05:31.104 --> 00:05:34.034\nWe decided, over the next two years,\n\n00:05:34.034 --> 00:05:36.549\nwe will ban the halogens and the CFLs ourselves.\n\n00:05:36.549 --> 00:05:37.917\nWe will go all in.\n\n00:05:37.917 --> 00:05:39.626\nAnd this is what business needs to do: go all-in,\n\n00:05:39.626 --> 00:05:41.070\ngo 100 percent,\n\n00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.661\nbecause then you stop investing in the old stuff,\n\n00:05:42.661 --> 00:05:44.815\nyou invest in the new stuff, you lower costs,\n\n00:05:44.815 --> 00:05:47.144\nyou use your supply chain and your creativity\n\n00:05:47.144 --> 00:05:49.901\nand you get the prices down so everybody can afford\n\n00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:52.852\nthe best lights so they can save energy.\n\n00:05:52.852 -->

--> 00:06:03.957\nthat produce our products.\n\n00:06:03.957 --> 00:06:05.784\nObviously there's fantastic opportunities\n\n00:06:05.784 --> 00:06:07.278\nwith recycled materials,\n\n00:06:07.278 --> 00:06:10.121\nand we can and will go zero waste.\n\n00:06:10.121 --> 00:06:12.109\nAnd there's opportunities in a circular economy.\n\n00:06:12.109 --> 00:06:15.551\nBut we're still dependent on natural, raw materials.\n\n00:06:15.551 --> 00:06:17.341\nLet's take cotton.\n\n00:06:17.341 --> 00:06:19.070\nCotton's brilliant. Probably many people\n\n00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.481\nare wearing cotton right now.\n\n00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:22.015\nIt's a brilliant textile in use.\n\n00:06:22.015 --> 00:06:23.582\nIt's really dirty in production.\n\n00:06:23.582 --> 00:06:27.716\nIt uses lots of pesticides, lots of fertilizer, lots of water.\n\n00:06:27.716 --> 00:06:29.336\nSo we've worked with others,\n\n00:06:29.336 --> 00:06:30.938\nwith other businesses and NGOs,\n\n00:06:30.938 --> 00:06:32.794\non the Better Cotton Initiative,\n\n00:06:32.794 --> 00:06:34.963\nworking right back down to the farm,\n\n00:06:34.963 --> 00:06:36.798\nand there you can halve the amount of water\n\n00:06:36.798 --> 00:06:38.629\nand halve the chemical inputs,\n\n00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:41.525\nthe yields increase, and 60 percent of the costs\n\n00:06:41.525 --> 00:06:43.194\nof running many of these farms\n\n00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:45.238\nwith farmers with low incomes\n\n00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.941\ncan be chemical imports.\n\n00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:49.086\nYields increase, and you halve the input costs.\n\n00:06:49.086 --> 00:06:51.961\nFarmers are coming out of poverty. They love it.\n\n00:06:51.961 --> 00:06:53.688\nAlready hundreds of thousands of farmers\n\n00:06:53.688 --> 00:06:55.278\nhave been reached,\n\n00:06:55.278 --> 00:06:57.942\nand now we've got 60 percent better cotton in our business.\n\n00:06:57.942 --> 00:06:59.284\nAgain, we're going all-in.\n\n00:06:59.284 --> 00:07:02.434\nBy 2015, we'll be 100 percent Better Cotton.\n\n00:07:02.434 --> 00:07:05.420\nTake the topic of 100 percent targets, actually.\n\n00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.092\nPeople sometimes think that\n\n00:07:07.092 --> 00:07:08.557\n100 percent's going to be hard,\n\n00:07:08.557 --> 00:07:10.328\nand we've had the conversation in the business.\n\n00:07:10.328 --> 00:07:12.170\nActually, we found 100 percent is easier to do\n\n00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.157\nthan 90 percent or 50 percent.\n\n00:07:14.157 --> 00:07:15.589\nIf you have a 90 percent target,\n\n00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:17.010\neveryone in the business finds a reason\n\n00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.815\nto be in the 10 percent.\n\n00:07:18.815 --> 00:07:22.385\nWhen it's 100 percent, it's kind of clear,\n\n00:07:22.385 --> 00:07:25.275\nand businesspeople like clarity,\n\n00:07:25.275 --> 00:07:27.940\nbecause then you just get the job done.\n\n00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.688\nSo, wood. We know with forestry, it's a choice.\n\n00:07:30.688 --> 00:07:32.282\nYou've got illegal logging\n\n00:07:32.282 --> 00:07:35.107\nand deforestation still on a very large scale,\n\n00:07:35.107 --> 00:07:37.807\nor you can have fantastic, responsible forestry\n\n00:07:37.807 --> 00:07:39.942\nthat we can be proud of.\n\n00:07:39.942 --> 00:07:42.024\nIt's a simple choice, so we've worked\n\n00:07:42.024 --> 00:07:44.568\nfor many years with the Forest Stewardship Council,\n\n00:07:44.568 --> 00:07:46.938\nwith literally hundreds of other organizations,\n\n00:07:46.938 --> 00:07:49.378\nand there's a point here about collaboration.\n\n00:07:49.378 --> 00:07:51.273\nSo hundreds of others, of NGOs,\n\n00:07:51.273 --> 00:07:53.855\nof forest workers' unions, and of businesses,\n\n00:07:53.855 --> 00:07:55.527\nhave helped create the Forest Stewardship Council,\n\n00:07:55.527 --> 00:07:57.309\nwhich sets standards for forestry\n\n00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:59.831\nand then checks the forestry's good on the ground.\n\n00:07:59.831 --> 00:08:02.074\nNow together, through our supply chain,\n\n00:08:02.074 --> 00:08:03.941\nwith partners, we've managed to certify\n\n00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:06.818\n35 million hectares of forestry.\n\n00:08:06.818 --> 00:08:09.355\nThat's about the size of Germany.\n\n00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:11.143\nAnd we've decided in the next three years,\n\n00:08:11.143 --> 00:08:13.178\nwe will double the volume of certified material\n\n00:08:13.178 --> 00:08:15.316\nwe put through our business.\n\n00:08:15.316 --> 00:08:17.956\nSo be decisive on these issues.\n\n00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:19.927\nUse your supply chain to drive good.\n\n00:08:19.927 --> 00:08:21.953\nBut then it comes to your operations.\n\n00:08:21.953 --> 00:08:24.603\nSome things are certain, I think.\n\n00:08:24.603 --> 00:08:27.618\nWe know we'll use electricity in 20 or 30 years' time.\n\n00:08:27.618 --> 00:08:30.541\nWe know the sun will be shining somewhere,\n\n00:08:30.541 --> 00:08:33.633\nand the wind will still be blowing in 20 or 30 years' time.\n\n00:08:33.633 --> 00:08:36.285\nSo why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind?\n\n00:08:36.285 --> 00:08:38.513\nAnd why not take control of it ourselves?\n\n00:08:38.513 --> 00:08:40.873\nSo we're going 100 percent renewable.\n\n00:08:40.873 --> 00:08:43.629\nBy 2020, we'll produce more renewable energy\n\n00:08:43.629 --> 00:08:45.649\nthan the energy we consume as a business.\n\n00:08:45.649 --> 00:08:47.625\nFor all of our stores, our own factories,\n\n00:08:47.625 --> 00:08:49.003\nour distribution centers,\n\n00:08:49.003 --> 00:08:51.457\nwe've installed 300,000 solar panels so far,\n\n00:08:51.457 --> 00:08:54.831\nand we've got 14 wind farms we own and operate\n\n00:08:54.831 --> 00:08:57.458\nin six countries, and we're not done yet.\n\n00:08:57.458 --> 00:08:59.242\nBut think of a solar panel.\n\n00:08:59.242 --> 00:09:01.421\nA solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years.\n\n00:09:01.421 --> 00:09:02.914\nThe electricity is free.\n\n00:09:02.914 --> 00:09:04.719\nEvery time the sun comes out after that,\n\n00:09:04.719 --> 00:09:06.154\nthe electricity is free.\n\n00:09:06.154 --> 00:09:08.171\nSo this is a good thing for the CFO,\n\n00:09:08.171 --> 00:09:10.114\nnot just the sustainability guy.\n\n00:09:10.114 --> 00:09:13.148\nEvery business can do things like this.\n\n00:09:13.148 --> 00:09:16.127\nBut then we've got to look beyond our operations,\n\n00:09:16.127 --> 00:09:17.876\nand I think everybody would agree\n\n00:09:17.876 --> 00:09:20.248\nthat now business has to take full responsibility\n\n00:09:20.248 --> 00:09:22.452\nfor the impacts of your supply chain.\n\n00:09:22.452 --> 00:09:24.768\nMany businesses now, fortunately,\n\n00:09:24.768 --> 00:09:26.775\nhave codes of conduct and audit their supply chains,\n\n00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:28.821\nbut not every business. Far from it.\n\n00:09:28.821 --> 00:09:31.335\nAnd this came in IKEA actually in the '90s.\n\n00:09:31.335 --> 00:09:33.076\nWe found there was a risk\n\n00:09:33.076 --> 00:09:35.078\nof child labor in the supply chain,\n\n00:09:35.078 --> 00:09:37.588\nand people in the business were shocked.\n\n00:09:37.588 --> 00:09:40.912\nAnd it was clearly totally unacceptable, so then you have to act.\n\n00:09:40.912 --> 00:09:43.056\nSo a code of conduct was developed,\n\n00:09:43.056 --> 00:09:46.007\nand now we have 80 auditors out in the world\n\n00:09:46.007 --> 00:09:48.038\nevery day making sure all our factories\n\n00:09:48.038 --> 00:09:50.322\nsecure good working conditions\n\n00:09:50.322 --> 00:09:51.871\nand protect human rights\n\n00:09:51.871 --> 00:09:54.132\nand make sure there is no child labor.\n\n00:09:54.132 --> 00:09:56.292\nBut it's not just as simple as making sure\n\n00:09:56.292 --> 00:09:58.324\nthere's no child labor.\n\n00:09:58.324 --> 00:10:00.524\nYou've got to say that's not enough today.\n\n00:10:00.524 --> 00:10:02.572\nI think we'd all agree that children\n\n00:10:02.572 --> 00:10:04.768\nare the most important people in the world\n\n00:10:04.768 --> 00:10:06.665\nand the most vulnerable.\n\n00:10:06.665 --> 00:10:08.913\nSo what can a business do today\n\n00:10:08.913 --> 00:10:10.797\nto actually use your total value chain\n\n00:10:10.797 --> 00:10:13.076\nto support a better quality of life\n\n00:10:13.076 --> 00:10:14.664\nand protect child rights?\n\n00:10:14.664 --> 00:10:16.961\nWe've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children\n\n00:10:16.961 --> 00:10:19.436\non developing some new business principles\n\n00:10:19.436 --> 00:10:20.901\nwith children's rights.\n\n00:10:20.901 --> 00:10:22.718\nIncreasing numbers of businesses\n\n00:10:22.718 --> 00:10:24.238\nare signing up to these,\n\n00:10:24.238 --> 00:10:26.701\nbut actually in a survey, many business leaders\n\n00:10:26.701 --> 00:10:29.568\nsaid they thought their business had nothing to do with children.\n\n00:10:29.568 --> 00:10:33.067\nSo what we decided to do was, we will look\n\n00:10:33.067 --> 00:10:34.628\nand ask ourselves the tough questions\n\n00:10:34.628 --> 00:10:36.692\nwith partners who know more than us,\n\n00:10:36.692 --> 00:10:39.649\nwhat can we do to go beyond our business\n\n00:10:39.649 --> 00:10:41.491\nto help improve the lives of children?\n\n00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:43.310\nWe also have a foundation\n\n00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.205\nthat's committed to work through partners\n\n00:10:45.205 --> 00:10:47.828\nand help improve the lives and protect the rights\n\n00:10:47.828 --> 00:10:50.695\nof 100 million children by 2015.\n\n00:10:50.695 --> 00:10:52.371\nYou know the phrase,\n\n00:10:52.371 --> 00:10:55.749\nyou can manage what you measure?\n\n00:10:55.749 --> 00:11:00.399\nWell, you should measure what you care about.\n\n00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:01.948\nIf you're not measuring things,\n\n00:11:01.948 --> 00:11:04.692\nyou don't care and you don't know.\n\n00:11:04.692 --> 00:11:06.861\nSo let's take an example, measure the things\n\n00:11:06.861 --> 00:11:09.018\nthat are important in your business.\n\n00:11:09.018 --> 00:11:11.301\nIsn't it about time that businesses\n\n00:11:11.301 --> 00:11:14.279\nwere led equally by men and women?\n\n00:11:14.279 --> 00:11:17.262\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:17.262 --> 00:11:22.404\nSo we know for our 17,000 managers across IKEA\n\n00:11:22.404 --> 00:11:25.368\nthat 47 percent are women today,\n\n00:11:25.368 --> 00:11:27.764\nbut it's not enough, and we want to close the gap\n\n00:11:27.764 --> 00:11:30.051\nand follow it all the way through to senior management.\n\n00:11:30.051 --> 00:11:32.897\nAnd we do not want to wait another hundred years.\n\n00:11:32.897 --> 00:11:35.856\nSo we've launched a women's open network\n\n00:11:35.856 --> 00:11:37.381\nthis week in IKEA,\n\n00:11:37.381 --> 00:11:39.557\nand we'll do whatever it takes to lead the change.\n\n00:11:39.557 --> 00:11:40.972\nSo the message here is,\n\n00:11:40.972 --> 00:11:43.356\nmeasure what you care about and lead the change,\n\n00:11:43.356 --> 00:11:46.359\nand don't wait a hundred years.\n\n00:11:46.359 --> 00:11:48.796\nSo we've gone from sustainability\n\n00:11:48.796 --> 00:11:54.032\nbeing a nice-to-do to a must-do.

Per capita incomes since the year 2000 have doubled, and this boom is impacting on everyone. Life expectancy has increased by one year every three years for the last decade. That means if an African child is born today, rather than three days ago, they will get an extra day of life at the end of their lifespan. It's that quick. And HIV infection rates are down 27 percent: 600,000 less people a year are getting HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. The battle against malaria is being won, with deaths from malaria down 27 percent, according to the latest World Bank data. And malaria nets actually are playing a role in that. This shouldn't surprise us, because actually, everybody grows. If you go back to Imperial Rome in the Year 1 A.D., there was admittedly about 1,800 years where there wasn't an awful lot of growth. But then the people that the Romans would have called Scottish barbarians, my ancestors, were actually part of the Industrial Revolution, and in the 19th century, growth began to accelerate, and you saw that get quicker and quicker, and it's been impacting everyone. It doesn't matter if this is the jungles of Singapore or the tundra of northern Finland. Everybody gets involved. It's just a matter of when the inevitable happens.Among the reasons I think it's happening right now is the quality of the leadership across Africa. I think most of us would agree that in the 1990s, the greatest politician in the world was African, but I'm meeting brilliant people across the continent the entire time, and they're doing the reforms which have transformed the economic situation for their countries.And the West is engaging with that. The West has given debt forgiveness programs which have halved sub-Saharan debt from about 70 percent of GDP down to about 40. At the same time, our debt level's gone up to 120 and we're all feeling slightly miserable as a result. Politics gets weaker when debt is high. When public sector debt is low, governments don't have to choose between investing in education and health and paying interest on that debt you owe. And it's not just the public sector which is looking so good. The private sector as well. Again, in the West, we have private sector debt of 200 percent of GDP in Spain, the U.K., and the U.S. That's an awful lot of debt. Africa, many African countries, are sitting at 10 to 30 percent of GDP. If there's any continent that can do what China has done \u2014 China's at about 130 percent of GDP on that chart \u2014 if anyone can do what China has done in the last 30 years, it'll be Africa in the next 30.So they've got great government finances, great private sector debt. Does anyone recognize this? In fact, they do. Foreign direct investment has poured into Africa in the last 15 years. Back in the '70s, no one touched the continent with a barge pole. And this investment is actually Western-led. We hear a lot about China, and they do lend a lot of money, but 60 percent of the FDI in the last couple of years has come from Europe, America, Australia, Canada. Ten percent's come from India. And they're investing in energy. Africa produces 10 million barrels a day of oil now. It's the same as Saudi Arabia or Russia. And they're investing in telecoms, shopping malls. And this very encouraging story, I think, is partly demographic-led. And it's not just about African demographics. I'm showing you the number of 15- to 24-year-olds in various parts of the world, and the blue line is the one I want you to focus on for a second. Ten years ago, say you're Foxconn setting up an iPhone factory, by chance. You might choose China, which is the bulk of that East Asian blue line, where there's 200 million young people, and every year until 2010 that's getting bigger. Which means you're going to have new guys knocking on the door saying, \"Give us a job,\" and, \"I don't need a big pay rise, just please give me a job.\" Now, that's completely changed now. This decade, we're going to see a 20- to 30-percent fall in the number of 15- to 24-year-olds in China. So where do you set up your new factory? You look at South Asia, and people are. They're looking at Pakistan and Bangladesh, and they're also looking at Africa. And they're looking at Africa because that yellow line is showing you that the number of young Africans is going to continue to get bigger decade after decade after decade out to 2050.Now, there's a problem with lots of young people coming into any market, particularly when they're young men. A bit dangerous, sometimes. I think one of the crucial factors is how educated is that demographic? If you look at the red line here, what you're going to see is that in 1975, just nine percent of kids were in secondary school education in sub-Saharan Africa. Would you set up a factory in sub-Sahara in the mid-1970s? Nobody else did. They chose instead Turkey and Mexico to set up the textiles factories, because their education levels were 25 to 30 percent. Today, sub-Sahara is at the levels that Turkey and Mexico were at in 1975. They will get the textiles jobs that will take people out of rural poverty and put them on the road to industrialization and wealth.So what's Africa looking like today? This is how I look at Africa. It's a bit odd, because I'm an economist. Each little box is about a billion dollars, and you see that I pay an awful lot of attention to Nigeria sitting there in the middle. South Africa is playing a role. But when I'm thinking about the future, I'm actually most interested in Central, Western and Southern Africa. If I look at Africa by population, East Africa stands out as so much potential.And I'm showing you something else with these maps. I'm showing you democracy versus autocracy. Fragile democracies is the beige color. Strong democracies are the orange color. And what you'll see here is that most Africans are now living in democracies. Why does that matter? Because what people want is what politicians try, they don't always succeed, but they try and deliver. And what you've got is a reinforcing positive circle going on. In Ghana in the elections, in December 2012, the battle between the two candidates was over education. One guy offered free secondary school education to all, not just 30 percent. The other guy had to say, I'm going to build 50 new schools. He won by a margin. So democracy is encouraging governments to invest in education. Education is helping growth and investment, and that's giving budget revenues, which is giving governments more money, which is helping growth through education. It's a positive, virtuous circle.But I get asked this question, and this particular question makes me quite sad: It's, \"But what about corruption? How can you invest in Africa when there's corruption?\" And what makes me sad about it is that this graph here is showing you that the biggest correlation with corruption is wealth. When you're poor, corruption is not your biggest priority. And the countries on the right hand side, you'll see the per capita GDP, basically every country with a per capita GDP of, say, less than 5,000 dollars, has got a corruption score of roughly, what's that, about three? Three out of 10. That's not good. Every poor country is corrupt. Every rich country is relatively uncorrupt. How do you get from poverty and corruption to wealth and less corruption? You see the middle class grow. And the way to do that is to invest, not to say I'm not investing in that continent because there's too much corruption.Now, I don't want to be an apologist for corruption. I've been arrested because I refused to pay a bribe \u2014 not in Africa, actually. But what I'm saying here is that we can make a difference and we can do that by investing.Now I'm going to let you in on a little not-so-secret. Economists aren't great at forecasting. Because the question really is, what happens next? And if you go back to the year 2000, what you'll find is The Economist had a very famous cover, \"The Hopeless Continent,\" and what they'd done is they'd looked at growth in Africa over the previous 10 years \u2014 two percent \u2014 and they said, what's going to happen in the next 10 years? They assumed two percent, and that made it a pretty hopeless story, because population growth was two and a half. People got poorer in Africa in the 1990s. Now 2012, The Economist has a new cover, and what does that new cover show? That new cover shows, well, Africa rising, because the growth over the last 10 years has been about five and a half percent.I would like to see if you can all now become economists, because if growth for the last 10 years has been five and a half percent, what do you think the IMF is forecasting for the next five years of growth in Africa? Very good. I think you're secretly saying to your head, probably five and a half percent. You're all economists, and I think, like most economists, wrong. No offense.What I like to do is try and find the countries that are doing exactly what Africa has already done, and it means that jump from 1,800 years of nothing to whoof, suddenly shooting through the roof. India is one of those examples. This is Indian growth from 1960 to 2010. Ignore the scale on the bottom for a second. Actually, for the first 20 years, the '60s and '70s, India didn't really grow. It grew at two percent when population growth was about two and a half. If that's familiar, that's exactly what happened in sub-Sahara in the '80s and the '90s. And then something happened in 1980. Boom! India began to explode. It wasn't a \"Hindu rate of growth,\" \"democracies can't grow.\" Actually India could. And if I lay sub-Saharan growth on top of the Indian growth story, it's remarkably similar. Twenty years of not much growth and a trend line which is actually telling you that sub-Saharan African growth is slightly better than India. And if I then lay developing Asia on top of this, I'm saying India is 20 years ahead of Africa, I'm saying developing Asia is 10 years ahead of India, I can draw out some forecasts for the next 30 to 40 years which I think are better than the ones where you're looking backwards. And that tells me this: that Africa is going to go from a $2 trillion economy today to a $29 trillion economy by 2050. Now that's bigger than Europe and America put together in today's money. Life expectancy is going to go up by 13 years. The population's going to double from one billion to two billion, so household incomes are going to go up sevenfold in the next 35 years. And when I present this in Africa \u2014 Nairobi, Lagos, Accra \u2014 I get one question. \"Charlie, why are you so pessimistic?\"And you know what? Actually, I think they've got a point. Am I really saying that there can be nothing learned, yes from the positives in Asia and India, but also the negatives? Perhaps Africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made. Surely, the technologies that we're talking about here this last week, surely some of these can perhaps help Africa grow even faster? And I think here we can play a role. Because technology does let you help. You can go and download some of the great African literature from the Internet now. No, not right now, just 30 seconds. You can go and buy some of the great tunes. My iPod's full of them. Buy African products. Go on holiday and see for yourself the change that's happening. Invest. Perhaps hire people, give them the skills that they can take back to Africa, and their companies will grow an awful lot faster than most of ours here in the West. And then you and I can help make sure that for Africa, the 21st century is their century.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1851, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.532 --> 00:00:14.319\nAfrica is booming.\n\n00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:16.824\nPer capita incomes since the year 2000\n\n00:00:16.824 --> 00:00:18.424\nhave doubled,\n\n00:00:18.424 --> 00:00:21.799\nand this boom is impacting on everyone.\n\n00:00:21.799 --> 00:00:24.625\nLife expectancy has increased by one year\n\n00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:27.375\nevery three years for the last decade.\n\n00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:30.860\nThat means if an African child is born today,\n\n00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.648\nrather than three days ago,\n\n00:00:32.648 --> 00:00:34.535\nthey will get an extra day of life\n\n00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:36.558\nat the end of their lifespan.\n\n00:00:36.558 --> 00:00:38.349\nIt's that quick.\n\n00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:42.461\nAnd HIV infection rates are down 27 percent:\n\n00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:46.711\n600,000 less people a year are getting HIV\n\n00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:49.175\nin sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:52.237\nThe battle against malaria is being won,\n\n00:00:52.237 --> 00:00:55.037\nwith deaths from malaria down 27 percent,\n\n00:00:55.037 --> 00:00:56.799\naccording to the latest World Bank data.\n\n00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:59.896\nAnd malaria nets actually are playing a role in that.\n\n00:00:59.896 --> 00:01:02.068\nThis shouldn't surprise us,\n\n00:01:02.068 --> 00:01:04.817\nbecause actually, everybody grows.\n\n00:01:04.817 --> 00:01:06.793\nIf you go back to Imperial Rome\n\n00:01:06.793 --> 00:01:08.998\nin the Year 1 A.D.,\n\n00:01:08.998 --> 00:01:11.296\nthere was admittedly about 1,800 years\n\n00:01:11.296 --> 00:01:13.543\nwhere there wasn't an awful lot of growth.\n\n00:01:13.543 --> 00:01:15.535\nBut then the people that the Romans\n\n00:01:15.535 --> 00:01:19.350\nwould have called Scottish barbarians, my ancestors,\n\n00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.470\nwere actually part of the Industrial Revolution,\n\n00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.158\nand in the 19th century, growth began to accelerate,\n\n00:01:24.158 --> 00:01:27.198\nand you saw that get quicker and quicker,\n\n00:01:27.198 --> 00:01:29.958\nand it's been impacting everyone.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.573\nIt doesn't matter if this is the jungles of Singapore\n\n00:01:32.573 --> 00:01:34.823\nor the tundra of northern Finland.\n\n00:01:34.823 --> 00:01:37.744\nEverybody gets involved.

is that demographic?\n\n00:05:16.853 --> 00:05:18.785\nIf you look at the red line here,\n\n00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:20.461\nwhat you're going to see is that in 1975,\n\n00:05:20.461 --> 00:05:22.550\njust nine percent of kids\n\n00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.950\nwere in secondary school education\n\n00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.608\nin sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n00:05:27.608 --> 00:05:29.375\nWould you set up a factory\n\n00:05:29.375 --> 00:05:31.265\nin sub-Sahara in the mid-1970s?\n\n00:05:31.265 --> 00:05:32.585\nNobody else did.\n\n00:05:32.585 --> 00:05:35.238\nThey

00:05:42.093\nwere 25 to 30 percent.\n\n00:05:42.093 --> 00:05:45.554\nToday, sub-Sahara is at the levels\n\n00:05:45.554 --> 00:05:49.290\nthat Turkey and Mexico were at in 1975.\n\n00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.469\nThey will get the textiles jobs\n\n00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:55.149\nthat will take people out of rural poverty\n\n00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:59.813\nand put them on the road to industrialization and wealth.\n\n00:05:59.813 --> 00:06:02.872\nSo what's Africa looking like today?\n\n00:06:02.872 --> 00:06:04.533\nThis is how I look at Africa.\n\n00:06:04.533 --> 00:06:06.357\nIt's a bit odd, because I'm an economist.\n\n00:06:06.357 --> 00:06:08.268\nEach little box is about a billion dollars,\n\n00:06:08.268 --> 00:06:09.985\nand you see that I pay an awful lot of attention\n\n00:06:09.985 --> 00:06:12.277\nto Nigeria sitting there in the middle.\n\n00:06:12.277 --> 00:06:14.442\nSouth Africa is playing a role.\n\n00:06:14.442 --> 00:06:16.521\nBut when I'm thinking about the future,\n\n00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:19.072\nI'm actually most interested\n\n00:06:19.072 --> 00:06:21.837\nin Central, Western and Southern Africa.\n\n00:06:21.837 --> 00:06:24.399\nIf I look at Africa by population,\n\n00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:25.768\nEast Africa stands out\n\n00:06:25.768 --> 00:06:27.752\nas so much potential.\n\n00:06:27.752 --> 00:06:30.784\nAnd I'm showing you something else with these maps.\n\n00:06:30.784 --> 00:06:33.526\nI'm showing you democracy versus autocracy.\n\n00:06:33.526 --> 00:06:36.779\nFragile democracies is the beige color.\n\n00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:39.422\nStrong democracies are the orange color.\n\n00:06:39.422 --> 00:06:42.152\nAnd what you'll see here is that most Africans\n\n00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:45.971\nare now living in democracies.\n\n00:06:45.971 --> 00:06:48.147\nWhy does that matter?\n\n00:06:48.147 --> 00:06:50.581\nBecause what people want\n\n00:06:50.581 --> 00:06:52.716\nis what politicians try,\n\n00:06:52.716 --> 00:06:55.807\nthey don't always succeed, but they try and deliver.\n\n00:06:55.807 --> 00:06:58.454\nAnd what you've got is a reinforcing positive circle going on.\n\n00:06:58.454 --> 00:07:01.330\nIn Ghana in the elections, in December 2012,\n\n00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.560\nthe battle between the two candidates\n\n00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.833\nwas over education.\n\n00:07:06.833 --> 00:07:08.826\nOne guy offered free secondary school education\n\n00:07:08.826 --> 00:07:11.174\nto all, not just 30 percent.\n\n00:07:11.174 --> 00:07:12.493\nThe other guy had to say,\n\n00:07:12.493 --> 00:07:14.620\nI'm going to build 50 new schools.\n\n00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.479\nHe won by a margin.\n\n00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:20.529\nSo democracy is encouraging governments\n\n00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:22.129\nto invest in education.\n\n00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:24.214\nEducation is helping growth and investment,\n\n00:07:24.214 --> 00:07:25.626\nand that's giving budget revenues,\n\n00:07:25.626 --> 00:07:27.465\nwhich is giving governments more money,\n\n00:07:27.465 --> 00:07:30.671\nwhich is helping growth through education.\n\n00:07:30.671 --> 00:07:33.206\nIt's a positive, virtuous circle.\n\n00:07:33.206 --> 00:07:35.767\nBut I get asked this question,\n\n00:07:35.767 --> 00:07:38.853\nand this particular question makes me quite sad:\n\n00:07:38.853 --> 00:07:41.384\nIt's, \"But what about corruption?\n\n00:07:41.384 --> 00:07:45.488\nHow can you invest in Africa when there's corruption?\"\n\n00:07:45.488 --> 00:07:47.129\nAnd what makes me sad about it\n\n00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:49.154\nis that this graph here is showing you\n\n00:07:49.154 --> 00:07:53.119\nthat the biggest correlation with corruption is wealth.\n\n00:07:53.119 --> 00:07:57.665\nWhen you're poor, corruption is not your biggest priority.\n\n00:07:57.665 --> 00:07:59.778\nAnd the countries on the right hand side,\n\n00:07:59.778 --> 00:08:01.501\nyou'll see the per capita GDP,\n\n00:08:01.501 --> 00:08:03.326\nbasically every country\n\n00:08:03.326 --> 00:08:06.821\nwith a per capita GDP of, say, less than 5,000 dollars,\n\n00:08:06.821 --> 00:08:09.041\nhas got a corruption score\n\n00:08:09.041 --> 00:08:12.076\nof roughly, what's that, about three?\n\n00:08:12.076 --> 00:08:14.359\nThree out of 10. That's not good.\n\n00:08:14.359 --> 00:08:16.707\nEvery poor country is corrupt.\n\n00:08:16.723 --> 00:08:20.849\nEvery rich country is relatively uncorrupt.\n\n00:08:20.849 --> 00:08:24.852\nHow do you get from poverty and corruption\n\n00:08:24.852 --> 00:08:27.121\nto wealth and less corruption?\n\n00:08:27.121 --> 00:08:29.313\nYou see the middle class grow.\n\n00:08:29.313 --> 00:08:32.800\nAnd the way to do that is to invest,\n\n00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.180\nnot to say I'm not investing in that continent\n\n00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.457\nbecause there's too much corruption.\n\n00:08:38.457 --> 00:08:41.134\nNow, I don't want to be an apologist for corruption.\n\n00:08:41.134 --> 00:08:44.073\nI've been arrested because I refused to pay a bribe --\n\n00:08:44.073 --> 00:08:46.185\nnot in Africa, actually.\n\n00:08:46.185 --> 00:08:47.883\nBut what I'm saying here is that\n\n00:08:47.883 --> 00:08:49.673\nwe can make a difference\n\n00:08:49.673 --> 00:08:52.579\nand we can do that by investing.\n\n00:08:52.579 --> 00:08:56.086\nNow I'm going to let you in on a little not-so-secret.\n\n00:08:56.086 --> 00:08:58.953\nEconomists aren't great at forecasting.\n\n00:08:58.953 --> 00:09:01.065\nBecause the question really is, what happens next?\n\n00:09:01.065 --> 00:09:03.589\nAnd if you go back to the year 2000,\n\n00:09:03.589 --> 00:09:05.352\nwhat you'll find is The Economist\n\n00:09:05.352 --> 00:09:08.520\nhad a very famous cover, \"The Hopeless Continent,\"\n\n00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.702\nand what they'd done is they'd looked at growth\n\n00:09:10.702 --> 00:09:14.832\nin Africa over the previous 10 years -- two percent --\n\n00:09:14.832 --> 00:09:16.936\nand they said,\n\n00:09:16.936 --> 00:09:19.469\nwhat's going to happen in the next 10 years?\n\n00:09:19.469 --> 00:09:21.848\nThey assumed two percent,\n\n00:09:21.848 --> 00:09:23.741\nand that made it a pretty hopeless story,\n\n00:09:23.741 --> 00:09:26.891\nbecause population growth was two and a half.\n\n00:09:26.891 --> 00:09:29.671\nPeople got poorer in Africa in the 1990s.\n\n00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:33.109\nNow 2012, The Economist has a new cover,\n\n00:09:33.109 --> 00:09:34.955\nand what does that new cover show?\n\n00:09:34.955 --> 00:09:37.938\nThat new cover shows, well, Africa rising,\n\n00:09:37.938 --> 00:09:39.665\nbecause the growth over the last 10 years\n\n00:09:39.665 --> 00:09:42.285\nhas been about five and a half percent.\n\n00:09:42.285 --> 00:09:45.811\nI would like to see if you can all now become economists,\n\n00:09:45.811 --> 00:09:48.326\nbecause if growth for the last 10 years\n\n00:09:48.326 --> 00:09:50.446\nhas been five and a half percent,\n\n00:09:50.446 --> 00:09:52.149\nwhat do you think the IMF is forecasting\n\n00:09:52.149 --> 00:09:55.169\nfor the next five years of growth in Africa?\n\n00:09:55.169 --> 00:09:57.944\nVery good. I think you're secretly saying\n\n00:09:57.944 --> 00:10:00.126\nto your head, probably five and a half percent.\n\n00:10:00.126 --> 00:10:02.068\nYou're all economists, and I think,\n\n00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:04.550\nlike most economists, wrong.\n\n00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.646\nNo offense.\n\n00:10:06.646 --> 00:10:09.527\nWhat I like to do is try and find the countries\n\n00:10:09.527 --> 00:10:13.688\nthat are doing exactly what Africa has already done,\n\n00:10:13.688 --> 00:10:17.086\nand it means that jump from 1,800 years of nothing\n\n00:10:17.086 --> 00:10:20.133\nto whoof, suddenly shooting through the roof.\n\n00:10:20.133 --> 00:10:22.787\nIndia is one of those examples.\n\n00:10:22.787 --> 00:10:26.906\nThis is Indian growth from 1960 to 2010.\n\n00:10:26.906 --> 00:10:29.820\nIgnore the scale on the bottom for a second.\n\n00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.190\nActually, for the first 20 years,\n\n00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:35.233\nthe '60s and '70s, India didn't really grow.\n\n00:10:35.233 --> 00:10:37.294\nIt grew at two percent\n\n00:10:37.294 --> 00:10:40.374\nwhen population growth was about two and a half.\n\n00:10:40.374 --> 00:10:42.554\nIf that's familiar, that's exactly what happened\n\n00:10:42.554 --> 00:10:44.849\nin sub-Sahara in the '80s and the '90s.\n\n00:10:44.849 --> 00:10:46.623\nAnd then something happened in 1980.\n\n00:10:46.623 --> 00:10:48.846\nBoom! India began to explode.\n\n00:10:48.846 --> 00:10:51.130\nIt wasn't a \"Hindu rate of growth,\"\n\n00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.186\n\"democracies can't grow.\" Actually India could.\n\n00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:56.992\nAnd if I lay sub-Saharan growth\n\n00:10:56.992 --> 00:10:59.260\non top of the Indian growth story,\n\n00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.876\nit's remarkably similar.\n\n00:11:01.876 --> 00:11:04.163\nTwenty years of not much growth\n\n00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:05.717\nand a trend line which is actually telling you\n\n00:11:05.717 --> 00:11:07.707\nthat sub-Saharan African growth is\n\n00:11:07.707 --> 00:11:10.268\nslightly better than India.\n\n00:11:10.268 --> 00:11:13.703\nAnd if I then lay developing Asia on top of this,\n\n00:11:13.703 --> 00:11:16.527\nI'm saying India is 20 years ahead of Africa,\n\n00:11:16.527 --> 00:11:20.633\nI'm saying developing Asia is 10 years ahead of India,\n\n00:11:20.633 --> 00:11:22.810\nI can draw out some forecasts\n\n00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.130\nfor the next 30 to 40 years\n\n00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.200\nwhich I think are better\n\n00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.052\nthan the ones where you're looking backwards.\n\n00:11:30.052 --> 00:11:32.399\nAnd that tells me this:\n\n00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:34.181\nthat Africa is going to go\n\n00:11:34.181 --> 00:11:37.218\nfrom a $2 trillion economy today\n\n00:11:37.218 --> 00:11:41.490\nto a $29 trillion economy by 2050.\n\n00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.498\nNow that's bigger than Europe and America\n\n00:11:43.498 --> 00:11:46.956\nput together in today's money.\n\n00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:50.876\nLife expectancy is going to go up by 13 years.\n\n00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:52.614\nThe population's going to double\n\n00:11:52.614 --> 00:11:54.067\nfrom one billion to two billion,\n\n00:11:54.067 --> 00:11:57.417\nso household incomes are going to go up sevenfold\n\n00:11:57.417 --> 00:12:00.281\nin the next 35 years.\n\n00:12:00.281 --> 00:12:03.398\nAnd when I present this in Africa --\n\n00:12:03.398 --> 00:12:07.202\nNairobi, Lagos, Accra -- I get one question.\n\n00:12:07.202 --> 00:12:12.070\n\"Charlie, why are you so pessimistic?\"\n\n00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.913\nAnd you know what?\n\n00:12:13.913 --> 00:12:16.302\nActually, I think they've got a point.\n\n00:12:16.302 --> 00:12:18.774\nAm I really saying that there can be nothing learned,\n\n00:12:18.774 --> 00:12:22.058\nyes from the positives in Asia and India,\n\n00:12:22.058 --> 00:12:23.436\nbut also the negatives?\n\n00:12:23.436 --> 00:12:25.998\nPerhaps Africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made.\n\n00:12:25.998 --> 00:12:29.393\nSurely, the technologies that we're talking about here\n\n00:12:29.393 --> 00:12:31.002\nthis last week,\n\n00:12:31.002 --> 00:12:32.946\nsurely some of these can perhaps\n\n00:12:32.946 --> 00:12:35.674\nhelp Africa grow even faster?\n\n00:12:35.674 --> 00:12:38.109\nAnd I think here we can play a role.\n\n00:12:38.109 --> 00:12:40.952\nBecause technology does let you help.\n\n00:12:40.952 --> 00:12:43.091\nYou can go and download\n\n00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:45.126\nsome of the great African literature\n\n00:12:45.126 --> 00:12:46.925\nfrom the Internet now.\n\n00:12:46.925 --> 00:12:49.398\nNo, not right now, just 30 seconds.\n\n00:12:49.398 --> 00:12:51.588\nYou can go and buy some of the great tunes.\n\n00:12:51.588 --> 00:12:53.319\nMy iPod's full of them.\n\n00:12:53.319 --> 00:12:55.009\nBuy African products.\n\n00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:56.974\nGo on holiday and see for yourself\n\n00:12:56.974 --> 00:12:58.523\nthe change that's happening.\n\n00:12:58.523 --> 00:12:59.928\nInvest.\n\n00:12:59.928 --> 00:13:02.054\nPerhaps hire people, give them the skills\n\n00:13:02.054 --> 00:13:04.323\nthat they can take back to Africa,\n\n00:13:04.323 --> 00:13:06.588\nand their companies will grow an awful lot faster\n\n00:13:06.588 --> 00:13:09.238\nthan most of ours here in the West.\n\n00:13:09.238 --> 00:13:13.539\nAnd then you and I can help make sure\n\n00:13:13.539 --> 00:13:17.668\nthat for Africa, the 21st century is their century.\n\n00:13:17.668 --> 00:13:19.478\nThank you very much.\n\n00:13:19.478 --> 00:13:23.478\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "An ode to envy", "duration": "791", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/parul_sehgal_an_ode_to_envy", "transcript": "So when I was eight years old, a new girl came to join the class, and she was so impressive, as the new girl always seems to be. She had vast quantities of very shiny hair and a cute little pencil case, super strong on state capitals, just a great speller. And I just curdled with jealousy that year, until I hatched my devious plan. So one day I stayed a little late after school, a little too late, and I lurked in the girls' bathroom. When the coast was clear, I emerged, crept into the classroom, and took from my teacher's desk the grade book. And then I did it. I fiddled with my rival's grades, just a little, just demoted some of those A's. All of those A's. (Laughter) And I got ready to return the book to the drawer, when hang on, some of my other classmates had appallingly good grades too. So, in a frenzy, I corrected everybody's marks, not imaginatively. I gave everybody a row of D's and I gave myself a row of A's, just because I was there, you know, might as well.And I am still baffled by my behavior. I don't understand where the idea came from. I don't understand why I felt so great doing it. I felt great. I don't understand why I was never caught. I mean, it should have been so blatantly obvious. I was never caught. But most of all, I am baffled by, why did it bother me so much that this little girl, this tiny little girl, was so good at spelling? Jealousy baffles me. It's so mysterious, and it's so pervasive. We know babies suffer from jealousy. We know primates do. Bluebirds are actually very prone. We know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the United States. And yet, I have never read a study that can parse to me its loneliness or its longevity or its grim thrill. For that, we have to go to fiction, because the novel is the lab that has studied jealousy in every possible configuration. In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if we didn't have jealousy, would we even have literature? Well no faithless Helen, no \"Odyssey.\" No jealous king, no \"Arabian Nights.\" No Shakespeare. There goes high school reading lists, because we're losing \"Sound and the Fury,\" we're losing \"Gatsby,\" \"Sun Also Rises,\" we're losing \"Madame Bovary,\" \"Anna K.\" No jealousy, no Proust. And now, I mean, I know it's fashionable to say that Proust has the answers to everything, but in the case of jealousy, he kind of does. This year is the centennial of his masterpiece, \"In Search of Lost Time,\" and it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy and just regular competitiveness, my brand, that we can hope to have. (Laughter) And we think about Proust, we think about the sentimental bits, right? We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep. We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea. We forget how harsh his vision was. We forget how pitiless he is. I mean, these are books that Virginia Woolf said were tough as cat gut. I don't know what cat gut is, but let's assume it's formidable.Let's look at why they go so well together, the novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust. Is it something as obvious as that jealousy, which boils down into person, desire, impediment, is such a solid narrative foundation? I don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone, because let's think about what happens when we feel jealous. When we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story. We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives, and these stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel terrible. As the teller of the tale and the audience, we know just what details to include, to dig that knife in. Right? Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists, and this is something Proust understood.In the first volume, Swann's Way, the series of books, Swann, one of the main characters, is thinking very fondly of his mistress and how great she is in bed, and suddenly, in the course of a few sentences, and these are Proustian sentences, so they're long as rivers, but in the course of a few sentences, he suddenly recoils and he realizes, \"Hang on, everything I love about this woman, somebody else would love about this woman. Everything that she does that gives me pleasure could be giving somebody else pleasure, maybe right about now.\" And this is the story he starts to tell himself, and from then on, Proust writes that every fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress, he adds to his \"collection of instruments in his private torture chamber.\"Now Swann and Proust, we have to admit, were notoriously jealous. You know, Proust's boyfriends would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him. But you don't have to be that jealous to concede that it's hard work. Right? Jealousy is exhausting. It's a hungry emotion. It must be fed.And what does jealousy like? Jealousy likes information. Jealousy likes details. Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair, the cute little pencil case. Jealousy likes photos. That's why Instagram is such a hit. (Laughter) Proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy. When Swann is in his jealous throes, and suddenly he's listening at doorways and bribing his mistress' servants, he defends these behaviors. He says, \"You know, look, I know you think this is repugnant, but it is no different from interpreting an ancient text or looking at a monument.\" He says, \"They are scientific investigations with real intellectual value.\" Proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd, but it is, at its crux, a quest for knowledge, a quest for truth, painful truth, and actually, where Proust is concerned, the more painful the truth, the better. Grief, humiliation, loss: These were the avenues to wisdom for Proust. He says, \"A woman whom we need, who makes us suffer, elicits from us a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us.\" Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women? No. I think he's trying to say that jealousy reveals us to ourselves. And does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way? Does any other emotion reveal to us our aggression and our hideous ambition and our entitlement? Does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity?Freud would write about this later. One day, Freud was visited by this very anxious young man who was consumed with the thought of his wife cheating on him. And Freud says, it's something strange about this guy, because he's not looking at what his wife is doing. Because she's blameless; everybody knows it. The poor creature is just under suspicion for no cause. But he's looking for things that his wife is doing without noticing, unintentional behaviors. Is she smiling too brightly here, or did she accidentally brush up against a man there? [Freud] says that the man is becoming the custodian of his wife's unconscious.The novel is very good on this point. The novel is very good at describing how jealousy trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy. In fact, the more intensely jealous we are, the more we become residents of fantasy. And this is why, I think, jealousy doesn't just provoke us to do violent things or illegal things. Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive. Now I'm thinking of myself at eight, I concede, but I'm also thinking of this story I heard on the news. A 52-year-old Michigan woman was caught creating a fake Facebook account from which she sent vile, hideous messages to herself for a year. For a year. A year. And she was trying to frame her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend, and I have to confess when I heard this, I just reacted with admiration. (Laughter) Because, I mean, let's be real. What immense, if misplaced, creativity. Right? This is something from a novel. This is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel.Now Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine. She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters. She's the author of \"Strangers on a Train\" and \"The Talented Mr. Ripley,\" books that are all about how jealousy, it muddles our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in that realm of jealousy, the membrane between what is and what could be can be pierced in an instant. Take Tom Ripley, her most famous character. Now, Tom Ripley goes from wanting you or wanting what you have to being you and having what you once had, and you're under the floorboards, he's answering to your name, he's wearing your rings, emptying your bank account. That's one way to go.But what do we do? We can't go the Tom Ripley route. I can't give the world D's, as much as I would really like to, some days. And it's a pity, because we live in envious times. We live in jealous times. I mean, we're all good citizens of social media, aren't we, where the currency is envy?Does the novel show us a way out? I'm not sure. So let's do what characters always do when they're not sure, when they are in possession of a mystery. Let's go to 221B Baker Street and ask for Sherlock Holmes. When people think of Holmes, they think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty, right, this criminal mastermind. But I've always preferred [Inspector] Lestrade, who is the rat-faced head of Scotland Yard who needs Holmes desperately, needs Holmes' genius, but resents him. Oh, it's so familiar to me. So Lestrade needs his help, resents him, and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries. But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in \"The Adventure of the Six Napoleons,\" once Holmes comes in, dazzles everybody with his solution, Lestrade turns to Holmes and he says, \"We're not jealous of you, Mr. Holmes. We're proud of you.\" And he says that there's not a man at Scotland Yard who wouldn't want to shake Sherlock Holmes' hand.It's one of the few times we see Holmes moved in the mysteries, and I find it very moving, this little scene, but it's also mysterious, right? It seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry, not emotion. You know, one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade. The next minute they're on the same side. Suddenly, Lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he's resented. Could it be so simple though? What if jealousy really is a matter of geometry, just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another? Well, maybe then we wouldn't have to resent somebody's excellence. We could align ourselves with it.But I like contingency plans. So while we wait for that to happen, let us remember that we have fiction for consolation. Fiction alone demystifies jealousy. Fiction alone domesticates it, invites it to the table. And look who it gathers: sweet Lestrade, terrifying Tom Ripley, crazy Swann, Marcel Proust himself. We are in excellent company. Thank you.

And now, I mean,\n\n00:03:08.108 --> 00:03:09.869\nI know it's fashionable to say that Proust\n\n00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:11.476\nhas the answers to everything,\n\n00:03:11.476 --> 00:03:14.182\nbut in the case of jealousy,\n\n00:03:14.182 --> 00:03:16.923\nhe kind of does.\n\n00:03:16.923 --> 00:03:20.909\nThis year is the centennial of his masterpiece, \"In Search of Lost Time,\"\n\n00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.910\nand it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy\n\n00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.062\nand just regular competitiveness, my brand,\n\n00:03:27.062 --> 00:03:29.647\nthat we can hope to have. (Laughter)\n\n00:03:29.647 --> 00:03:32.074\nAnd we think about Proust, we think\n\n00:03:32.074 --> 00:03:33.568\nabout the sentimental bits, right?\n\n00:03:33.568 --> 00:03:35.523\nWe think about a little boy trying to get to sleep.\n\n00:03:35.523 --> 00:03:39.704\nWe think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea.\n\n00:03:39.704 --> 00:03:41.730\nWe forget how harsh his vision was.\n\n00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.570\nWe forget how pitiless he is.\n\n00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.891\nI mean, these are books that Virginia Woolf said\n\n00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:48.227\nwere tough as cat gut.\n\n00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:50.275\nI don't know what cat gut is,\n\n00:03:50.275 --> 00:03:53.176\nbut let's assume it's formidable.\n\n00:03:53.176 --> 00:03:56.394\nLet's look at why they go so well together,\n\n00:03:56.394 --> 00:04:00.072\nthe novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust.\n\n00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:03.303\nIs it something as obvious as that jealousy,\n\n00:04:03.303 --> 00:04:06.686\nwhich boils down into person, desire, impediment,\n\n00:04:06.686 --> 00:04:11.354\nis such a solid narrative foundation?\n\n00:04:11.354 --> 00:04:14.029\nI don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone,\n\n00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:16.078\nbecause let's think about what happens\n\n00:04:16.078 --> 00:04:17.856\nwhen we feel jealous.\n\n00:04:17.856 --> 00:04:21.808\nWhen we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story.\n\n00:04:21.808 --> 00:04:26.091\nWe tell ourselves a story about other people's lives,\n\n00:04:26.091 --> 00:04:28.765\nand these stories make us feel terrible\n\n00:04:28.765 --> 00:04:30.988\nbecause they're designed to make us feel terrible.\n\n00:04:30.988 --> 00:04:33.522\nAs the teller of the tale and the audience,\n\n00:04:33.522 --> 00:04:35.496\nwe know just what details to include,\n\n00:04:35.496 --> 00:04:39.065\nto dig that knife in. Right?\n\n00:04:39.065 --> 00:04:42.420\nJealousy makes us all amateur novelists,\n\n00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.436\nand this is something Proust understood.\n\n00:04:44.436 --> 00:04:47.609\nIn the first volume, Swann's Way,\n\n00:04:47.609 --> 00:04:49.433\nthe series of books,\n\n00:04:49.433 --> 00:04:51.139\nSwann, one of the main characters,\n\n00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.367\nis thinking very fondly of his mistress\n\n00:04:54.367 --> 00:04:56.059\nand how great she is in bed,\n\n00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:59.101\nand suddenly, in the course of a few sentences,\n\n00:04:59.101 --> 00:05:01.142\nand these are Proustian sentences,\n\n00:05:01.142 --> 00:05:02.654\nso they're long as rivers,\n\n00:05:02.654 --> 00:05:04.917\nbut in the course of a few sentences,\n\n00:05:04.917 --> 00:05:07.324\nhe suddenly recoils and he realizes,\n\n00:05:07.324 --> 00:05:10.607\n\"Hang on, everything I love about this woman,\n\n00:05:10.607 --> 00:05:14.378\nsomebody else would love about this woman.\n\n00:05:14.378 --> 00:05:17.469\nEverything that she does that gives me pleasure\n\n00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:19.178\ncould be giving somebody else pleasure,\n\n00:05:19.178 --> 00:05:21.456\nmaybe right about now.\"\n\n00:05:21.456 --> 00:05:24.240\nAnd this is the story he starts to tell himself,\n\n00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.103\nand from then on, Proust writes that\n\n00:05:26.103 --> 00:05:29.150\nevery fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress,\n\n00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.814\nhe adds to his \"collection of instruments\n\n00:05:31.814 --> 00:05:35.436\nin his private torture chamber.\"\n\n00:05:35.436 --> 00:05:37.711\nNow Swann and Proust, we have to admit,\n\n00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:39.387\nwere notoriously jealous.\n\n00:05:39.387 --> 00:05:41.091\nYou know, Proust's boyfriends would have to leave\n\n00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:43.695\nthe country if they wanted to break up with him.\n\n00:05:43.695 --> 00:05:46.598\nBut you don't have to be that jealous\n\n00:05:46.598 --> 00:05:49.509\nto concede that it's hard work.

It was a historical day. There's no doubt that from now on, the Fourth of July will be remembered not as the day of the Declaration of Independence, but as the day of the discovery of the Higgs boson. Well, at least, here at CERN.But for me, the biggest surprise of that day was that there was no big surprise. In the eye of a theoretical physicist, the Higgs boson is a clever explanation of how some elementary particles gain mass, but it seems a fairly unsatisfactory and incomplete solution. Too many questions are left unanswered. The Higgs boson does not share the beauty, the symmetry, the elegance, of the rest of the elementary particle world. For this reason, the majority of theoretical physicists believe that the Higgs boson could not be the full story. We were expecting new particles and new phenomena accompanying the Higgs boson. Instead, so far, the measurements coming from the LHC show no signs of new particles or unexpected phenomena.Of course, the verdict is not definitive. In 2015, the LHC will almost double the energy of the colliding protons, and these more powerful collisions will allow us to explore further the particle world, and we will certainly learn much more.But for the moment, since we have found no evidence for new phenomena, let us suppose that the particles that we know today, including the Higgs boson, are the only elementary particles in nature, even at energies much larger than what we have explored so far. Let's see where this hypothesis is going to lead us. We will find a surprising and intriguing result about our universe, and to explain my point, let me first tell you what the Higgs is about, and to do so, we have to go back to one tenth of a billionth of a second after the Big Bang. And according to the Higgs theory, at that instant, a dramatic event took place in the universe. Space-time underwent a phase transition. It was something very similar to the phase transition that occurs when water turns into ice below zero degrees. But in our case, the phase transition is not a change in the way the molecules are arranged inside the material, but is about a change of the very fabric of space-time.During this phase transition, empty space became filled with a substance that we now call Higgs field. And this substance may seem invisible to us, but it has a physical reality. It surrounds us all the time, just like the air we breathe in this room. And some elementary particles interact with this substance, gaining energy in the process. And this intrinsic energy is what we call the mass of a particle, and by discovering the Higgs boson, the LHC has conclusively proved that this substance is real, because it is the stuff the Higgs bosons are made of. And this, in a nutshell, is the essence of the Higgs story.But this story is far more interesting than that. By studying the Higgs theory, theoretical physicists discovered, not through an experiment but with the power of mathematics, that the Higgs field does not necessarily exist only in the form that we observe today. Just like matter can exist as liquid or solid, so the Higgs field, the substance that fills all space-time, could exist in two states. Besides the known Higgs state, there could be a second state in which the Higgs field is billions and billions times denser than what we observe today, and the mere existence of another state of the Higgs field poses a potential problem. This is because, according to the laws of quantum mechanics, it is possible to have transitions between two states, even in the presence of an energy barrier separating the two states, and the phenomenon is called, quite appropriately, quantum tunneling. Because of quantum tunneling, I could disappear from this room and reappear in the next room, practically penetrating the wall. But don't expect me to actually perform the trick in front of your eyes, because the probability for me to penetrate the wall is ridiculously small. You would have to wait a really long time before it happens, but believe me, quantum tunneling is a real phenomenon, and it has been observed in many systems. For instance, the tunnel diode, a component used in electronics, works thanks to the wonders of quantum tunneling.But let's go back to the Higgs field. If the ultra-dense Higgs state existed, then, because of quantum tunneling, a bubble of this state could suddenly appear in a certain place of the universe at a certain time, and it is analogous to what happens when you boil water. Bubbles of vapor form inside the water, then they expand, turning liquid into gas. In the same way, a bubble of the ultra-dense Higgs state could come into existence because of quantum tunneling. The bubble would then expand at the speed of light, invading all space, and turning the Higgs field from the familiar state into a new state.Is this a problem? Yes, it's a big a problem. We may not realize it in ordinary life, but the intensity of the Higgs field is critical for the structure of matter. If the Higgs field were only a few times more intense, we would see atoms shrinking, neutrons decaying inside atomic nuclei, nuclei disintegrating, and hydrogen would be the only possible chemical element in the universe. And the Higgs field, in the ultra-dense Higgs state, is not just a few times more intense than today, but billions of times, and if space-time were filled by this Higgs state, all atomic matter would collapse. No molecular structures would be possible, no life.So, I wonder, is it possible that in the future, the Higgs field will undergo a phase transition and, through quantum tunneling, will be transformed into this nasty, ultra-dense state? In other words, I ask myself, what is the fate of the Higgs field in our universe? And the crucial ingredient necessary to answer this question is the Higgs boson mass. And experiments at the LHC found that the mass of the Higgs boson is about 126 GeV. This is tiny when expressed in familiar units, because it's equal to something like 10 to the minus 22 grams, but it is large in particle physics units, because it is equal to the weight of an entire molecule of a DNA constituent.So armed with this information from the LHC, together with some colleagues here at CERN, we computed the probability that our universe could quantum tunnel into the ultra-dense Higgs state, and we found a very intriguing result. Our calculations showed that the measured value of the Higgs boson mass is very special. It has just the right value to keep the universe hanging in an unstable situation. The Higgs field is in a wobbly configuration that has lasted so far but that will eventually collapse. So according to these calculations, we are like campers who accidentally set their tent at the edge of a cliff. And eventually, the Higgs field will undergo a phase transition and matter will collapse into itself.So is this how humanity is going to disappear? I don't think so. Our calculation shows that quantum tunneling of the Higgs field is not likely to occur in the next 10 to the 100 years, and this is a very long time. It's even longer than the time it takes for Italy to form a stable government.(Laughter)Even so, we will be long gone by then. In about five billion years, our sun will become a red giant, as large as the Earth's orbit, and our Earth will be kaput, and in a thousand billion years, if dark energy keeps on fueling space expansion at the present rate, you will not even be able to see as far as your toes, because everything around you expands at a rate faster than the speed of light. So it is really unlikely that we will be around to see the Higgs field collapse.But the reason why I am interested in the transition of the Higgs field is because I want to address the question, why is the Higgs boson mass so special? Why is it just right to keep the universe at the edge of a phase transition? Theoretical physicists always ask \"why\" questions. More than how a phenomenon works, theoretical physicists are always interested in why a phenomenon works in the way it works. We think that this these \"why\" questions can give us clues about the fundamental principles of nature. And indeed, a possible answer to my question opens up new universes, literally. It has been speculated that our universe is only a bubble in a soapy multiverse made out of a multitude of bubbles, and each bubble is a different universe with different fundamental constants and different physical laws. And in this context, you can only talk about the probability of finding a certain value of the Higgs mass. Then the key to the mystery could lie in the statistical properties of the multiverse. It would be something like what happens with sand dunes on a beach. In principle, you could imagine to find sand dunes of any slope angle in a beach, and yet, the slope angles of sand dunes are typically around 30, 35 degrees. And the reason is simple: because wind builds up the sand, gravity makes it fall. As a result, the vast majority of sand dunes have slope angles around the critical value, near to collapse. And something similar could happen for the Higgs boson mass in the multiverse. In the majority of bubble universes, the Higgs mass could be around the critical value, near to a cosmic collapse of the Higgs field, because of two competing effects, just as in the case of sand.My story does not have an end, because we still don't know the end of the story. This is science in progress, and to solve the mystery, we need more data, and hopefully, the LHC will soon add new clues to this story. Just one number, the Higgs boson mass, and yet, out of this number we learn so much. I started from a hypothesis, that the known particles are all there is in the universe, even beyond the domain explored so far. From this, we discovered that the Higgs field that permeates space-time may be standing on a knife edge, ready for cosmic collapse, and we discovered that this may be a hint that our universe is only a grain of sand in a giant beach, the multiverse.But I don't know if my hypothesis is right. That's how physics works: A single measurement can put us on the road to a new understanding of the universe or it can send us down a blind alley. But whichever it turns out to be, there is one thing I'm sure of: The journey will be full of surprises.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1853, "subtitle":

Collider\n\n00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.270\ndiscovered the Higgs boson.\n\n00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.238\nIt was a historical day.\n\n00:00:22.238 --> 00:00:24.533\nThere's no doubt that from now on,\n\n00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.367\nthe Fourth of July will be remembered\n\n00:00:26.367 --> 00:00:28.809\nnot as the day of the Declaration of Independence,\n\n00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:32.643\nbut as the day of the discovery of the Higgs boson.\n\n00:00:32.643 --> 00:00:35.075\nWell, at least, here at CERN.\n\n00:00:35.075 --> 00:00:39.230\nBut for me, the biggest surprise of that day\n\n00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.729\nwas that there was no big surprise.\n\n00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:44.328\nIn the eye of a theoretical physicist,\n\n00:00:44.328 --> 00:00:46.221\nthe Higgs boson is a clever explanation\n\n00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:49.744\nof how some elementary particles gain mass,\n\n00:00:49.744 --> 00:00:52.580\nbut it seems a fairly unsatisfactory\n\n00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.786\nand incomplete solution.\n\n00:00:54.786 --> 00:00:57.810\nToo many questions are left unanswered.\n\n00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.645\nThe Higgs boson does not share the beauty,\n\n00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:02.530\nthe symmetry, the elegance,\n\n00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.258\nof the rest of the elementary particle world.\n\n00:01:05.258 --> 00:01:08.880\nFor this reason, the majority of theoretical physicists\n\n00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.822\nbelieve that the Higgs boson could not\n\n00:01:11.822 --> 00:01:14.304\nbe the full story.\n\n00:01:14.304 --> 00:01:17.158\nWe were expecting new particles and new phenomena\n\n00:01:17.158 --> 00:01:19.608\naccompanying the Higgs boson.\n\n00:01:19.608 --> 00:01:21.926\nInstead, so far, the measurements\n\n00:01:21.926 --> 00:01:25.684\ncoming from the LHC show no signs of new particles\n\n00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:27.833\nor unexpected phenomena.\n\n00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:31.486\nOf course, the verdict is not definitive.\n\n00:01:31.486 --> 00:01:35.480\nIn 2015, the LHC will almost double\n\n00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.171\nthe energy of the colliding protons,\n\n00:01:38.171 --> 00:01:40.242\nand these more powerful collisions\n\n00:01:40.242 --> 00:01:44.826\nwill allow us to explore further the particle world,\n\n00:01:44.826 --> 00:01:47.958\nand we will certainly learn much more.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:51.104\nBut for the moment, since we have found\n\n00:01:51.104 --> 00:01:54.253\nno evidence for new phenomena, let us suppose\n\n00:01:54.253 --> 00:01:57.417\nthat the particles that we know today,\n\n00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:59.273\nincluding the Higgs boson,\n\n00:01:59.273 --> 00:02:02.558\nare the only elementary particles in nature,\n\n00:02:02.558 --> 00:02:05.302\neven at energies much larger\n\n00:02:05.302 --> 00:02:08.068\nthan what we have explored so far.\n\n00:02:08.068 --> 00:02:12.700\nLet's see where this hypothesis is going to lead us.\n\n00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.132\nWe will find a surprising and intriguing result\n\n00:02:16.132 --> 00:02:19.931\nabout our universe, and to explain my point,\n\n00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:23.807\nlet me first tell you what the Higgs is about,\n\n00:02:23.807 --> 00:02:26.941\nand to do so, we have to go back\n\n00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:31.298\nto one tenth of a billionth of a second\n\n00:02:31.298 --> 00:02:32.829\nafter the Big Bang.\n\n00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.870\nAnd according to the Higgs theory,\n\n00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.236\nat that instant, a dramatic event took place\n\n00:02:38.236 --> 00:02:39.827\nin the universe.\n\n00:02:39.827 --> 00:02:44.618\nSpace-time underwent a phase transition.\n\n00:02:44.618 --> 00:02:47.695\nIt was something very similar to the phase transition\n\n00:02:47.695 --> 00:02:51.240\nthat occurs when water turns into ice\n\n00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.201\nbelow zero degrees.\n\n00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:56.141\nBut in our case, the phase transition\n\n00:02:56.141 --> 00:02:58.672\nis not a change in the way the molecules\n\n00:02:58.672 --> 00:03:00.958\nare arranged inside the material,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.846\nbut is about a change\n\n00:03:02.846 --> 00:03:06.472\nof the very fabric of space-time.\n\n00:03:06.472 --> 00:03:09.098\nDuring this phase transition, empty space\n\n00:03:09.098 --> 00:03:11.770\nbecame filled with a substance\n\n00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.802\nthat we now call Higgs field.\n\n00:03:14.802 --> 00:03:17.131\nAnd this substance may seem invisible to us,\n\n00:03:17.131 --> 00:03:19.809\nbut it has a physical reality.\n\n00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:21.867\nIt surrounds us all the time,\n\n00:03:21.867 --> 00:03:25.568\njust like the air we breathe in this room.\n\n00:03:25.568 --> 00:03:27.886\nAnd some elementary particles interact\n\n00:03:27.886 --> 00:03:31.714\nwith this substance, gaining energy in the process.\n\n00:03:31.714 --> 00:03:34.789\nAnd this intrinsic energy is what we call\n\n00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:36.922\nthe mass of a particle,\n\n00:03:36.922 --> 00:03:40.175\nand by discovering the Higgs boson, the LHC\n\n00:03:40.175 --> 00:03:44.707\nhas conclusively proved that this substance is real,\n\n00:03:44.707 --> 00:03:48.626\nbecause it is the stuff the Higgs bosons are made of.\n\n00:03:48.626 --> 00:03:52.070\nAnd this, in a nutshell, is the essence of the Higgs story.\n\n00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.813\nBut this story is far more interesting than that.\n\n00:03:56.813 --> 00:03:59.124\nBy studying the Higgs theory,\n\n00:03:59.124 --> 00:04:01.484\ntheoretical physicists discovered,\n\n00:04:01.484 --> 00:04:03.388\nnot through an experiment\n\n00:04:03.388 --> 00:04:05.864\nbut with the power of mathematics,\n\n00:04:05.864 --> 00:04:09.576\nthat the Higgs field does not necessarily exist\n\n00:04:09.576 --> 00:04:12.913\nonly in the form that we observe today.\n\n00:04:12.913 --> 00:04:17.958\nJust like matter can exist as liquid or solid,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:22.530\nso the Higgs field, the substance that fills all space-time,\n\n00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.884\ncould exist in two states.\n\n00:04:25.884 --> 00:04:28.194\nBesides the known Higgs state,\n\n00:04:28.194 --> 00:04:31.341\nthere could be a second state in which the Higgs field\n\n00:04:31.341 --> 00:04:34.877\nis billions and billions times denser\n\n00:04:34.877 --> 00:04:36.922\nthan what we observe today,\n\n00:04:36.922 --> 00:04:40.409\nand the mere existence of another state\n\n00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:44.654\nof the Higgs field poses a potential problem.\n\n00:04:44.654 --> 00:04:47.892\nThis is because, according to the laws\n\n00:04:47.892 --> 00:04:50.585\nof quantum mechanics, it is possible\n\n00:04:50.585 --> 00:04:53.417\nto have transitions between two states,\n\n00:04:53.417 --> 00:04:56.366\neven in the presence of an energy barrier\n\n00:04:56.366 --> 00:04:58.994\nseparating the two states,\n\n00:04:58.994 --> 00:05:01.203\nand the phenomenon is called,\n\n00:05:01.203 --> 00:05:05.345\nquite appropriately, quantum tunneling.\n\n00:05:05.345 --> 00:05:07.236\nBecause of quantum tunneling,\n\n00:05:07.236 --> 00:05:09.769\nI could disappear from this room\n\n00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:13.091\nand reappear in the next room,\n\n00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:16.486\npractically penetrating the wall.\n\n00:05:16.486 --> 00:05:19.301\nBut don't expect me to actually perform the trick\n\n00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:21.879\nin front of your eyes, because the probability\n\n00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:26.267\nfor me to penetrate the wall is ridiculously small.\n\n00:05:26.267 --> 00:05:28.865\nYou would have to wait a really long time\n\n00:05:28.865 --> 00:05:30.997\nbefore it happens, but believe me,\n\n00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:34.174\nquantum tunneling is a real phenomenon,\n\n00:05:34.174 --> 00:05:37.369\nand it has been observed in many systems.\n\n00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:39.931\nFor instance, the tunnel diode,\n\n00:05:39.931 --> 00:05:42.128\na component used in electronics,\n\n00:05:42.128 --> 00:05:44.550\nworks thanks to the wonders\n\n00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.870\nof quantum tunneling.\n\n00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.162\nBut let's go back to the Higgs field.\n\n00:05:49.162 --> 00:05:53.725\nIf the ultra-dense Higgs state existed,\n\n00:05:53.725 --> 00:05:56.079\nthen, because of quantum tunneling,\n\n00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:59.792\na bubble of this state could suddenly appear\n\n00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:03.034\nin a certain place of the universe at a certain time,\n\n00:06:03.034 --> 00:06:06.799\nand it is analogous to what happens when you boil water.\n\n00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:09.888\nBubbles of vapor form inside the water,\n\n00:06:09.888 --> 00:06:13.744\nthen they expand, turning liquid into gas.\n\n00:06:13.744 --> 00:06:18.548\nIn the same way, a bubble of the ultra-dense Higgs state\n\n00:06:18.548 --> 00:06:21.975\ncould come into existence because of quantum tunneling.\n\n00:06:21.975 --> 00:06:24.812\nThe bubble would then expand at the speed of light,\n\n00:06:24.812 --> 00:06:28.298\ninvading all space, and turning the Higgs field\n\n00:06:28.298 --> 00:06:31.947\nfrom the familiar state into a new state.\n\n00:06:31.947 --> 00:06:36.108\nIs this a problem? Yes, it's a big a problem.\n\n00:06:36.108 --> 00:06:38.853\nWe may not realize it in ordinary life,\n\n00:06:38.853 --> 00:06:42.058\nbut the intensity of the Higgs field is critical\n\n00:06:42.058 --> 00:06:44.703\nfor the structure of matter.\n\n00:06:44.703 --> 00:06:48.776\nIf the Higgs field were only a few times more intense,\n\n00:06:48.776 --> 00:06:51.720\nwe would see atoms shrinking, neutrons decaying\n\n00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.406\ninside atomic nuclei, nuclei disintegrating,\n\n00:06:55.406 --> 00:06:57.746\nand hydrogen would be\n\n00:06:57.746 --> 00:07:02.098\nthe only possible chemical element in the universe.\n\n00:07:02.098 --> 00:07:05.109\nAnd the Higgs field, in the ultra-dense Higgs state,\n\n00:07:05.109 --> 00:07:08.923\nis not just a few times more intense than today,\n\n00:07:08.923 --> 00:07:11.118\nbut billions of times,\n\n00:07:11.118 --> 00:07:14.320\nand if space-time were filled by this Higgs state,\n\n00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.473\nall atomic matter would collapse.\n\n00:07:17.473 --> 00:07:21.963\nNo molecular structures would be possible, no life.\n\n00:07:21.963 --> 00:07:25.301\nSo, I wonder, is it possible\n\n00:07:25.301 --> 00:07:27.887\nthat in the future, the Higgs field\n\n00:07:27.887 --> 00:07:30.452\nwill undergo a phase transition and,\n\n00:07:30.452 --> 00:07:33.581\nthrough quantum tunneling, will be transformed\n\n00:07:33.581 --> 00:07:38.268\ninto this nasty, ultra-dense state?\n\n00:07:38.268 --> 00:07:41.793\nIn other words, I ask myself, what is the fate\n\n00:07:41.793 --> 00:07:44.876\nof the Higgs field in our universe?\n\n00:07:44.876 --> 00:07:47.127\nAnd the crucial ingredient necessary\n\n00:07:47.127 --> 00:07:51.513\nto answer this question is the Higgs boson mass.\n\n00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:55.624\nAnd experiments at the LHC found that the mass\n\n00:07:55.624 --> 00:07:59.898\nof the Higgs boson is about 126 GeV.\n\n00:07:59.898 --> 00:08:02.934\nThis is tiny when expressed in familiar units,\n\n00:08:02.934 --> 00:08:04.254\nbecause it's equal to something like\n\n00:08:04.254 --> 00:08:06.461\n10 to the minus 22 grams,\n\n00:08:06.461 --> 00:08:10.431\nbut it is large in particle physics units,\n\n00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:12.535\nbecause it is equal to the weight\n\n00:08:12.535 --> 00:08:14.781\nof an entire molecule\n\n00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:17.201\nof a DNA constituent.\n\n00:08:17.201 --> 00:08:20.588\nSo armed with this information from the LHC,\n\n00:08:20.588 --> 00:08:22.532\ntogether with some colleagues here at CERN,\n\n00:08:22.532 --> 00:08:24.441\nwe computed the probability\n\n00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:27.456\nthat our universe could quantum tunnel\n\n00:08:27.456 --> 00:08:30.574\ninto the ultra-dense Higgs state,\n\n00:08:30.574 --> 00:08:34.251\nand we found a very intriguing result.\n\n00:08:34.251 --> 00:08:36.400\nOur calculations showed\n\n00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.572\nthat the measured value of the Higgs boson mass\n\n00:08:39.572 --> 00:08:41.417\nis very special.\n\n00:08:41.417 --> 00:08:44.336\nIt has just the right value\n\n00:08:44.336 --> 00:08:47.029\nto keep the universe hanging\n\n00:08:47.029 --> 00:08:49.599\nin an unstable situation.\n\n00:08:49.599 --> 00:08:52.855\nThe Higgs field is in a wobbly configuration\n\n00:08:52.855 --> 00:08:54.904\nthat has lasted so far\n\n00:08:54.904 --> 00:08:57.949\nbut that will eventually collapse.\n\n00:08:57.949 --> 00:09:01.128\nSo according to these calculations,\n\n00:09:01.128 --> 00:09:03.158\nwe are like campers\n\n00:09:03.158 --> 00:09:05.610\nwho accidentally set their tent\n\n00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.404\nat the edge of a cliff.\n\n00:09:07.404 --> 00:09:09.194\nAnd eventually, the Higgs field\n\n00:09:09.194 --> 00:09:11.130\nwill undergo a phase transition\n\n00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.174\nand matter will collapse into itself.\n\n00:09:14.174 --> 00:09:17.618\nSo is this how humanity is going to disappear?\n\n00:09:17.618 --> 00:09:19.373\nI don't think so.\n\n00:09:19.373 --> 00:09:22.726\nOur calculation shows that quantum tunneling\n\n00:09:22.726 --> 00:09:26.382\nof the Higgs field is not likely to occur\n\n00:09:26.382 --> 00:09:29.886\nin the next 10 to the 100 years,\n\n00:09:29.886 --> 00:09:32.928\nand this is a very long time.\n\n00:09:32.928 --> 00:09:34.696\nIt's even longer than\n\n00:09:34.696 --> 00:09:38.365\nthe time it takes for Italy to form a stable government.\n\n00:09:38.365 --> 00:09:40.772\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:40.772 --> 00:09:44.563\nEven so, we will be long gone by then.\n\n00:09:44.563 --> 00:09:47.171\nIn about five billion years,\n\n00:09:47.171 --> 00:09:49.628\nour sun will become a red giant,\n\n00:09:49.628 --> 00:09:52.141\nas large as the Earth's orbit,\n\n00:09:52.141 --> 00:09:55.418\nand our Earth will be kaput,\n\n00:09:55.418 --> 00:09:57.775\nand in a thousand billion years,\n\n00:09:57.775 --> 00:10:00.061\nif dark energy keeps on fueling\n\n00:10:00.061 --> 00:10:02.896\nspace expansion at the present rate,\n\n00:10:02.896 --> 00:10:07.073\nyou will not even be able to see as far as your toes,\n\n00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:08.770\nbecause everything around you\n\n00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.471\nexpands at a rate faster than the speed of light.\n\n00:10:12.471 --> 00:10:14.456\nSo it is really unlikely\n\n00:10:14.456 --> 00:10:18.326\nthat we will be around to see the Higgs field collapse.\n\n00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:21.905\nBut the reason why I am interested\n\n00:10:21.905 --> 00:10:23.917\nin the transition of the Higgs field\n\n00:10:23.917 --> 00:10:27.202\nis because I want to address the question,\n\n00:10:27.202 --> 00:10:32.167\nwhy is the Higgs boson mass so special?\n\n00:10:32.167 --> 00:10:35.141\nWhy is it just right to keep the universe\n\n00:10:35.141 --> 00:10:38.631\nat the edge of a phase transition?\n\n00:10:38.631 --> 00:10:42.493\nTheoretical physicists always ask \"why\" questions.\n\n00:10:42.493 --> 00:10:45.168\nMore than how a phenomenon works,\n\n00:10:45.168 --> 00:10:47.640\ntheoretical physicists are always interested in\n\n00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.872\nwhy a phenomenon works in the way it works.\n\n00:10:50.872 --> 00:10:54.234\nWe think that this these \"why\" questions\n\n00:10:54.234 --> 00:10:55.957\ncan give us clues\n\n00:10:55.957 --> 00:10:59.495\nabout the fundamental principles of nature.\n\n00:10:59.495 --> 00:11:03.400\nAnd indeed, a possible answer to my question\n\n00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.764\nopens up new universes, literally.\n\n00:11:07.764 --> 00:11:11.205\nIt has been speculated that our universe\n\n00:11:11.205 --> 00:11:15.338\nis only a bubble in a soapy multiverse\n\n00:11:15.338 --> 00:11:17.901\nmade out of a multitude of bubbles,\n\n00:11:17.901 --> 00:11:20.117\nand each bubble is a different universe\n\n00:11:20.117 --> 00:11:22.011\nwith different fundamental constants\n\n00:11:22.011 --> 00:11:23.876\nand different physical laws.\n\n00:11:23.876 --> 00:11:25.882\nAnd in this context, you can only talk about\n\n00:11:25.882 --> 00:11:30.593\nthe probability of finding a certain value of the Higgs mass.\n\n00:11:30.593 --> 00:11:32.936\nThen the key to the mystery\n\n00:11:32.936 --> 00:11:36.199\ncould lie in the statistical properties\n\n00:11:36.199 --> 00:11:38.427\nof the multiverse.\n\n00:11:38.427 --> 00:11:40.841\nIt would be something like what happens\n\n00:11:40.841 --> 00:11:43.078\nwith sand dunes on a beach.\n\n00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:45.950\nIn principle, you could imagine to find sand dunes\n\n00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:48.380\nof any slope angle in a beach,\n\n00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:52.541\nand yet, the slope angles of sand dunes\n\n00:11:52.541 --> 00:11:56.011\nare typically around 30, 35 degrees.\n\n00:11:56.011 --> 00:11:57.679\nAnd the reason is simple:\n\n00:11:57.679 --> 00:12:01.357\nbecause wind builds up the sand, gravity makes it fall.\n\n00:12:01.357 --> 00:12:04.241\nAs a result, the vast majority of sand dunes\n\n00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:08.160\nhave slope angles around the critical value,\n\n00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.144\nnear to collapse.\n\n00:12:10.144 --> 00:12:13.141\nAnd something similar could happen\n\n00:12:13.141 --> 00:12:17.678\nfor the Higgs boson mass in the multiverse.\n\n00:12:17.678 --> 00:12:20.550\nIn the majority of bubble universes,\n\n00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.607\nthe Higgs mass could be around the critical value,\n\n00:12:23.607 --> 00:12:27.203\nnear to a cosmic collapse of the Higgs field,\n\n00:12:27.203 --> 00:12:29.150\nbecause of two competing effects,\n\n00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:32.736\njust as in the case of sand.\n\n00:12:32.736 --> 00:12:35.881\nMy story does not have an end,\n\n00:12:35.881 --> 00:12:39.616\nbecause we still don't know the end of the story.\n\n00:12:39.616 --> 00:12:42.904\nThis is science in progress,\n\n00:12:42.904 --> 00:12:46.738\nand to solve the mystery, we need more data,\n\n00:12:46.738 --> 00:12:51.354\nand hopefully, the LHC will soon add new clues\n\n00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:53.975\nto this story.\n\n00:12:53.975 --> 00:12:57.805\nJust one number, the Higgs boson mass,\n\n00:12:57.805 --> 00:13:03.134\nand yet, out of this number we learn so much.\n\n00:13:03.134 --> 00:13:06.181\nI started from a hypothesis, that the known particles\n\n00:13:06.181 --> 00:13:08.217\nare all there is in the universe,\n\n00:13:08.217 --> 00:13:10.923\neven beyond the domain explored so far.\n\n00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:14.691\nFrom this, we discovered that the Higgs field\n\n00:13:14.691 --> 00:13:18.134\nthat permeates space-time may be standing\n\n00:13:18.134 --> 00:13:22.691\non a knife edge, ready for cosmic collapse,\n\n00:13:22.691 --> 00:13:26.241\nand we discovered that this may be a hint\n\n00:13:26.241 --> 00:13:30.274\nthat our universe is only a grain of sand\n\n00:13:30.274 --> 00:13:33.887\nin a giant beach, the multiverse.\n\n00:13:33.887 --> 00:13:37.138\nBut I don't know if my hypothesis is right.\n\n00:13:37.138 --> 00:13:40.821\nThat's how physics works: A single measurement\n\n00:13:40.821 --> 00:13:43.685\ncan put us on the road to a new understanding\n\n00:13:43.685 --> 00:13:45.348\nof the universe\n\n00:13:45.348 --> 00:13:48.367\nor it can send us down a blind alley.\n\n00:13:48.367 --> 00:13:50.931\nBut whichever it turns out to be,\n\n00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:54.123\nthere is one thing I'm sure of:\n\n00:13:54.123 --> 00:13:57.472\nThe journey will be full of surprises.\n\n00:13:57.472 --> 00:13:58.845\nThank you.\n\n00:13:58.845 -->

"My work focuses on the connection of both thinking about our community life being part of the environment where architecture grows from the natural local conditions and traditions.Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this. Both projects are in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia. And also they have in common that the different analyses from different perspectives becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture.The first example started with an invitation to design a multistory shopping mall in Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa. And this is the type of building we were shown as an example, to my team and myself, of what we had to design. At first, the first thing I thought was, I want to run away.(Laughter)After seeing a few of these buildings \u2014 there are many in the city \u2014 we realized that they have three very big points. First, these buildings, they are almost empty because they have very large shops where people cannot afford to buy things. Second, they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside, and then you need a lot of cooling. In a city where this shouldn't happen because they have really mild weather that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year. And third is that their image has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia. It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions.Also during our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really captivated by the old merkato that is this open-air structure where thousands of people, they go and buy things every day from small vendors. And also it has this idea of the public space that uses the outdoors to create activity. So I thought, this is what I really want to design, not a shopping mall. But the question was how we could do a multistory, contemporary building with these principles.The next challenge was when we looked at the site, that is, in a really growing area of the city, where most of these buildings that you see in the image, they were not there. And it's also between two parallel streets that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters.So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entrances of the building. And this extends with an inclined atrium that creates an open-air space in the building that self-protects itself with its own shape from the sun and the rain. And around this void we placed this idea of the market with small shops, that change in each floor because of the shape of the void.I also thought, how to close the building? And I really wanted to find a solution that would respond to the local climate conditions. And I started thinking about the textile like a shell made of concrete with perforations that would let the air in, and also the light, but in a filtered way. And then the inspiration came from these beautiful  patterns of the Ethiopian women's dresses. That they have fractal geometry properties and this helped me to shape the whole facade. And we are building that with these small prefabricated pieces that are the windows that let the air and the light in a controlled way inside the building. And this is complemented by these small colored glasses that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at night.With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers because they were like, \"This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that.\" But then we all realized that this idea of the market happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall because basically they had more shops to sell. And also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper, not only because of the material compared with the glass, but also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore. So we created some budget savings that we used to implement the project.And the first implementation was to think about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day. So we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof. And then under those panels we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars that would create this urban oasis. And these porches on the roof, all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside. Hopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction.The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis. And for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever designed, I really needed to understand the city of Tunis, but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture.During that analysis I paid special attention to the medina that is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall, opened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines. When I went to the site, the first design operation we did was to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these courtyards. On top of that, we selected some strategic points reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines, and this modified this initial pattern.And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell of the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan. And for that I thought, what would be the best orientation in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment? And it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and then a natural ventilation. So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction.And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city. It has these blocks with courtyards, and then on the ground floor you have all these connections for the pedestrians. And also it responds to the local regulations that establish a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor. And it also reinforces this idea of the gates.The volume has this connecting shape that shades itself with three different types of apartments and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood And in the courtyards there are the different facilities, such as a gym and a kindergarten and close by, a series of commercial [spaces] that bring activity to the ground floor. The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction. And it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize, and do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning, jumping from one building to another.These two examples, they have a common approach in the design process. And also, they are in emerging countries where you can see the cities literally growing. In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow. For this reason, I see even more importance to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment and that aim to connect nature and people.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1854, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:15.012\nMy work focuses on the

textile\n\n00:03:04.681 --> 00:03:06.562\nlike a shell made of concrete\n\n00:03:06.562 --> 00:03:10.133\nwith perforations that would let the air in,\n\n00:03:10.133 --> 00:03:12.757\nand also the light, but in a filtered way.\n\n00:03:12.757 --> 00:03:18.561\nAnd then the inspiration came from these beautiful \npatterns of the Ethiopian women's dresses.\n\n00:03:18.561 --> 00:03:20.736\nThat they have fractal geometry properties\n\n00:03:20.736 --> 00:03:22.867\nand this helped me to shape the whole facade.\n\n00:03:22.867 --> 00:03:24.472\nAnd we are building that\n\n00:03:24.472 --> 00:03:26.613\nwith these small prefabricated pieces\n\n00:03:26.613 --> 00:03:30.051\nthat are the windows that let the air and the light\n\n00:03:30.051 --> 00:03:32.033\nin a controlled way inside the building.\n\n00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:34.415\nAnd this is complemented by these small colored glasses\n\n00:03:34.415 --> 00:03:37.018\nthat use the light from the inside of the building\n\n00:03:37.018 --> 00:03:39.904\nto light up the building at night.\n\n00:03:39.904 --> 00:03:44.026\nWith these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers\n\n00:03:44.026 --> 00:03:45.182\nbecause they were like,\n\n00:03:45.182 --> 00:03:47.870\n\"This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that.\"\n\n00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.679\nBut then we all realized that this idea of the market\n\n00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:56.453\nhappened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall\n\n00:03:56.453 --> 00:03:59.173\nbecause basically they had more shops to sell.\n\n00:03:59.173 --> 00:04:03.247\nAnd also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper,\n\n00:04:03.247 --> 00:04:05.475\nnot only because of the material compared with the glass,\n\n00:04:05.475 --> 00:04:08.163\nbut also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore.\n\n00:04:08.163 --> 00:04:10.320\nSo we created some budget savings\n\n00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.217\nthat we used to implement the project.\n\n00:04:12.217 --> 00:04:14.149\nAnd the first implementation was to think\n\n00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:17.389\nabout how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy\n\n00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.723\nin a city that has electricity cuts almost every day.\n\n00:04:20.723 --> 00:04:24.940\nSo we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof.\n\n00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.021\nAnd then under those panels\n\n00:04:27.021 --> 00:04:30.757\nwe thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars\n\n00:04:30.757 --> 00:04:33.571\nthat would create this urban oasis.\n\n00:04:33.571 --> 00:04:35.361\nAnd these porches on the roof,\n\n00:04:35.361 --> 00:04:40.097\nall together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside.\n\n00:04:40.097 --> 00:04:45.259\nHopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction.\n\n00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.314\nThe second example is a master plan\n\n00:04:48.314 --> 00:04:51.593\nof 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis.\n\n00:04:51.593 --> 00:04:55.527\nAnd for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever designed,\n\n00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:57.792\nI really needed to understand the city of Tunis,\n\n00:04:57.792 --> 00:05:01.914\nbut also its surroundings and the tradition and culture.\n\n00:05:01.914 --> 00:05:05.022\nDuring that analysis I paid special attention to the medina\n\n00:05:05.022 --> 00:05:08.999\nthat is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall,\n\n00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:13.448\nopened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines.\n\n00:05:13.448 --> 00:05:17.817\nWhen I went to the site, the first design operation we did\n\n00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:21.837\nwas to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks\n\n00:05:21.837 --> 00:05:25.021\nsimilar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona\n\n00:05:25.021 --> 00:05:28.012\nand other cities in Europe with these courtyards.\n\n00:05:28.012 --> 00:05:30.797\nOn top of that, we selected some strategic points\n\n00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:33.998\nreminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines,\n\n00:05:33.998 --> 00:05:36.768\nand this modified this initial pattern.\n\n00:05:36.768 --> 00:05:39.218\nAnd the last operation was to think about the cell,\n\n00:05:39.218 --> 00:05:41.908\nthe small cell of the project, like the apartment,\n\n00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:43.686\nas an essential part of the master plan.\n\n00:05:43.686 --> 00:05:46.859\nAnd for that I thought, what would be the best orientation\n\n00:05:46.859 --> 00:05:49.158\nin the Mediterranean climate for an apartment?\n\n00:05:49.158 --> 00:05:53.921\nAnd it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house\n\n00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:56.784\nand then a natural ventilation.\n\n00:05:56.784 --> 00:06:00.370\nSo we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments\n\n00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.510\nare perfectly oriented in that direction.\n\n00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.970\nAnd this is the result\n\n00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.735\nthat is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.\n\n00:06:07.735 --> 00:06:09.333\nIt has these blocks with courtyards,\n\n00:06:09.333 --> 00:06:10.456\nand then on the ground floor\n\n00:06:10.456 --> 00:06:12.592\nyou have all these connections for the pedestrians.\n\n00:06:12.592 --> 00:06:15.699\nAnd also it responds to the local regulations that establish\n\n00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:19.362\na higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor.\n\n00:06:19.362 --> 00:06:22.908\nAnd it also reinforces this idea of the gates.\n\n00:06:22.908 --> 00:06:24.800\nThe volume has this connecting shape\n\n00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.102\nthat shades itself with three different types of apartments\n\n00:06:28.102 --> 00:06:31.745\nand also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood\n\n00:06:31.745 --> 00:06:34.645\nAnd in the courtyards there are the different facilities,\n\n00:06:34.645 --> 00:06:36.375\nsuch as a gym and a kindergarten\n\n00:06:36.375 --> 00:06:40.445\nand close by, a series of commercial [spaces] that bring activity to the ground floor.\n\n00:06:40.445 --> 00:06:43.245\nThe roof, which is my favorite space of the project\n\n00:06:43.245 --> 00:06:46.955\nis almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction.\n\n00:06:46.955 --> 00:06:49.239\nAnd it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize,\n\n00:06:49.239 --> 00:06:52.776\nand do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning,\n\n00:06:52.776 --> 00:06:56.160\njumping from one building to another.\n\n00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.519\nThese two examples,\n\n00:06:58.519 --> 00:07:01.903\nthey have a common approach in the design process.\n\n00:07:01.903 --> 00:07:04.482\nAnd also, they are in emerging countries where you can see\n\n00:07:04.482 --> 00:07:06.628\nthe cities literally growing.\n\n00:07:06.628 --> 00:07:11.369\nIn these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow\n\n00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:16.510\nchanges the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow.\n\n00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.118\nFor this reason, I see even more importance\n\n00:07:19.118 --> 00:07:24.148\nto look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions\n\n00:07:24.148 --> 00:07:28.209\nthat enhance the relationship between the community and the environment\n\n00:07:28.209 --> 00:07:32.127\nand that aim to connect nature and people.\n\n00:07:32.127 --> 00:07:34.025\nThank you very much.\n\n00:07:34.025 --> 00:07:35.852\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Government -- investor, risk-taker, innovator", "duration": "844", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/mariana_mazzucato_government_investor_risk_taker_innovator", "transcript": "Have you ever asked yourselves why it is that companies, the really cool companies, the innovative ones, the creative, new economy-type companies \u2014 Apple, Google, Facebook \u2014 are coming out of one particular country, the United States of America? Usually when I say this, someone says, \"Spotify! That's Europe.\" But, yeah. It has not had the impact that these other companies have had.Now what I do is I'm an economist, and I actually study the relationship between innovation and economic growth at the level of the company, the industry and the nation, and I work with policymakers worldwide, especially in the European Commission, but recently also in interesting places like China, and I can tell you that that question is on the tip of all of their tongues: Where are the European Googles? What is the secret behind the Silicon Valley growth model, which they understand is different from this old economy growth model? And what is interesting is that often, even if we're in the 21st century, we kind of come down in the end to these ideas of market versus state. It's talked about in these modern ways, but the idea is that somehow, behind places like Silicon Valley, the secret have been different types of market-making mechanisms, the private initiative, whether this be about a dynamic venture capital sector that's actually able to provide that high-risk finance to these innovative companies, the gazelles as we often call them, which traditional banks are scared of, or different types of really successful commercialization policies which actually allow these companies to bring these great inventions, their products, to the market and actually get over this really scary Death Valley period in which many companies instead fail.But what really interests me, especially nowadays and because of what's happening politically around the world, is the language that's used, the narrative, the discourse, the images, the actual words. So we often are presented with the kind of words like that the private sector is also much more innovative because it's able to think out of the box. They are more dynamic. Think of Steve Jobs' really inspirational speech to the 2005 graduating class at Stanford, where he said to be innovative, you've got to stay hungry, stay foolish. Right? So these guys are kind of the hungry and foolish and colorful guys, right? And in places like Europe, it might be more equitable, we might even be a bit better dressed and eat better than the U.S., but the problem is this damn public sector. It's a bit too big, and it hasn't actually allowed these things like dynamic venture capital and commercialization to actually be able to really be as fruitful as it could. And even really respectable newspapers, some that I'm actually subscribed to, the words they use are, you know, the state as this Leviathan. Right? This monster with big tentacles. They're very explicit in these editorials. They say, \"You know, the state, it's necessary to fix these little market failures when you have public goods or different types of negative externalities like pollution, but you know what, what is the next big revolution going to be after the Internet? We all hope it might be something green, or all of this nanotech stuff, and in order for that stuff to happen,\" they say \u2014 this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution \u2014 they say, \"the state, just stick to the basics, right? Fund the infrastructure. Fund the schools. Even fund the basic research, because this is popularly recognized, in fact, as a big public good which private companies don't want to invest in, do that, but you know what? Leave the rest to the revolutionaries.\" Those colorful, out-of-the-box kind of thinkers. They're often called garage tinkerers, because some of them actually did some things in garages, even though that's partly a myth. And so what I want to do with you in, oh God, only 10 minutes, is to really think again this juxtaposition, because it actually has massive, massive implications beyond innovation policy, which just happens to be the area that I often talk with with policymakers. It has huge implications, even with this whole notion that we have on where, when and why we should actually be cutting back on public spending and different types of public services which, of course, as we know, are increasingly being outsourced because of this juxtaposition. Right? I mean, the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools is in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened by this heavy hand of the state curriculum, or something. So these kind of words are constantly, these juxtapositions come up everywhere, not just with innovation policy.And so to think again, there's no reason that you should believe me, so just think of some of the smartest revolutionary things that you have in your pockets and do not turn it on, but you might want to take it out, your iPhone. Ask who actually funded the really cool, revolutionary thinking-out-of-the-box things in the iPhone. What actually makes your phone a smartphone, basically, instead of a stupid phone? So the Internet, which you can surf the web anywhere you are in the world; GPS, where you can actually know where you are anywhere in the world; the touchscreen display, which makes it also a really easy-to-use phone for anybody. These are the very smart, revolutionary bits about the iPhone, and they're all government-funded. And the point is that the Internet was funded by DARPA, U.S. Department of Defense. GPS was funded by the military's Navstar program. Even Siri was actually funded by DARPA. The touchscreen display was funded by two public grants by the CIA and the NSF to two public university researchers at the University of Delaware. Now, you might be thinking, \"Well, she's just said the word 'defense' and 'military' an awful lot,\" but what's really interesting is that this is actually true in sector after sector and department after department. So the pharmaceutical industry, which I am personally very interested in because I've actually had the fortune to study it in quite some depth, is wonderful to be asking this question about the revolutionary versus non-revolutionary bits, because each and every medicine can actually be divided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental. So the new molecular entities with priority rating are the revolutionary new drugs, whereas the slight variations of existing drugs \u2014 Viagra, different color, different dosage \u2014 are the less revolutionary ones. And it turns out that a full 75 percent of the new molecular entities with priority rating are actually funded in boring, Kafka-ian public sector labs. This doesn't mean that Big Pharma is not spending on innovation. They do. They spend on the marketing part. They spend on the D part of R&D. They spend an awful lot on buying back their stock, which is quite problematic. In fact, companies like Pfizer and Amgen recently have spent more money in buying back their shares to boost their stock price than on R&D, but that's a whole different TED Talk which one day I'd be fascinated to tell you about.Now, what's interesting in all of this is the state, in all these examples, was doing so much more than just fixing market failures. It was actually shaping and creating markets. It was funding not only the basic research, which again is a typical public good, but even the applied research. It was even, God forbid, being a venture capitalist. So these SBIR and SDTR programs, which give small companies early-stage finance have not only been extremely important compared to private venture capital, but also have become increasingly important. Why? Because, as many of us know, V.C. is actually quite short-term. They want their returns in three to five years. Innovation takes a much longer time than that, 15 to 20 years. And so this whole notion \u2014 I mean, this is the point, right? Who's actually funding the hard stuff? Of course, it's not just the state. The private sector does a lot. But the narrative that we've always been told is the state is important for the basics, but not really providing that sort of high-risk, revolutionary thinking out of the box. In all these sectors, from funding the Internet to doing the spending, but also the envisioning, the strategic vision, for these investments, it was actually coming within the state. The nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating to study this, because the word itself, nanotechnology, came from within government.And so there's huge implications of this. First of all, of course I'm not someone, this old-fashioned person, market versus state. What we all know in dynamic capitalism is that what we actually need are public-private partnerships. But the point is, by constantly depicting the state part as necessary but actually \u2014 pffff \u2014 a bit boring and often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan, I think we've actually really stunted the possibility to build these public-private partnerships in a really dynamic way. Even the words that we often use to justify the \"P\" part, the public part \u2014 well, they're both P's \u2014 with public-private partnerships is in terms of de-risking. What the public sector did in all these examples I just gave you, and there's many more, which myself and other colleagues have been looking at, is doing much more than de-risking. It's kind of been taking on that risk. Bring it on. It's actually been the one thinking out of the box. But also, I'm sure you all have had experience with local, regional, national governments, and you're kind of like, \"You know what, that Kafka-ian bureaucrat, I've met him.\" That whole juxtaposition thing, it's kind of there. Well, there's a self-fulfilling prophecy. By talking about the state as kind of irrelevant, boring, it's sometimes that we actually create those organizations in that way. So what we have to actually do is build these entrepreneurial state organizations. DARPA, that funded the Internet and Siri, actually thought really hard about this, how to welcome failure, because you will fail. You will fail when you innovative. One out of 10 experiments has any success. And the V.C. guys know this, and they're able to actually fund the other losses from that one success.And this brings me, actually, probably, to the biggest implication, and this has huge implications beyond innovation. If the state is more than just a market fixer, if it actually is a market shaper, and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk, what happened to the reward? We all know, if you've ever taken a finance course, the first thing you're taught is sort of the risk-reward relationship, and so some people are foolish enough or probably smart enough if they have time to wait, to actually invest in stocks, because they're higher risk which over time will make a greater reward than bonds, that whole risk-reward thing. Well, where's the reward for the state of having taken on these massive risks and actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet? The Internet was crazy. It really was. I mean, the probability of failure was massive. You had to be completely nuts to do it, and luckily, they were. Now, we don't even get to this question about rewards unless you actually depict the state as this risk-taker. And the problem is that economists often think, well, there is a reward back to the state. It's tax. You know, the companies will pay tax, the jobs they create will create growth so people who get those jobs and their incomes rise will come back to the state through the tax mechanism. Well, unfortunately, that's not true. Okay, it's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad. Globalization, and that's fine. We shouldn't be nationalistic. Let the jobs go where they have to go, perhaps. I mean, one can take a position on that. But also these companies that have actually had this massive benefit from the state \u2014 Apple's a great example. They even got the first \u2014 well, not the first, but 500,000 dollars actually went to Apple, the company, through this SBIC program, which predated the SBIR program, as well as, as I said before, all the technologies behind the iPhone. And yet we know they legally, as many other companies, pay very little tax back.So what we really need to actually rethink is should there perhaps be a return-generating mechanism that's much more direct than tax. Why not? It could happen perhaps through equity. This, by the way, in the countries that are actually thinking about this strategically, countries like Finland in Scandinavia, but also in China and Brazil, they're retaining equity in these investments. Sitra funded Nokia, kept equity, made a lot of money, it's a public funding agency in Finland, which then funded the next round of Nokias. The Brazilian Development Bank, which is providing huge amounts of funds today to clean technology, they just announced a $56 billion program for the future on this, is retaining equity in these investments. So to put it provocatively, had the U.S. government thought about this, and maybe just brought back just something called an innovation fund, you can bet that, you know, if even just .05 percent of the profits from what the Internet produced had come back to that innovation fund, there would be so much more money to spend today on green technology. Instead, many of the state budgets which in theory are trying to do that are being constrained. But perhaps even more important, we heard before about the one percent, the 99 percent. If the state is thought about in this more strategic way, as one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism, because that's what we're talking about, right? Who are the different players in creating value in the economy, and is the state's role, has it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player? If we can actually have a broader theory of value creation and allow us to actually admit what the state has been doing and reap something back, it might just be that in the next round, and I hope that we all hope that the next big revolution will in fact be green, that that period of growth will not only be smart, innovation-led, not only green, but also more inclusive, so that the public schools in places like Silicon Valley can actually also benefit from that growth, because they have not.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1855, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.075\nHave you ever asked yourselves why it is that\n\n00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:17.155\ncompanies, the really cool companies,\n\n00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:18.667\nthe innovative ones, the creative,\n\n00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:20.469\nnew economy-type companies --\n\n00:00:20.469 --> 00:00:23.843\nApple, Google, Facebook --\n\n00:00:23.843 --> 00:00:26.531\nare coming out of one particular country,\n\n00:00:26.531 --> 00:00:28.262\nthe United States of America?\n\n00:00:28.262 --> 00:00:30.220\nUsually when I say this, someone says, \"Spotify!\n\n00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.698\nThat's Europe.\" But, yeah.\n\n00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:35.382\nIt has not had the impact that these other companies have had.\n\n00:00:35.382 --> 00:00:37.350\nNow what I do is I'm an economist,\n\n00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.838\nand I actually study the relationship\n\n00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:40.883\nbetween innovation and economic growth\n\n00:00:40.883 --> 00:00:43.782\nat the level of the company, the industry and the nation,\n\n00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:45.897\nand I work with policymakers worldwide,\n\n00:00:45.897 --> 00:00:47.368\nespecially in the European Commission,\n\n00:00:47.368 --> 00:00:50.679\nbut recently also in interesting places like China,\n\n00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:52.554\nand I can tell you that that question\n\n00:00:52.554 --> 00:00:55.154\nis on the tip of all of their tongues:\n\n00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:57.373\nWhere are the European Googles?\n\n00:00:57.373 --> 00:01:01.118\nWhat is the secret behind the Silicon Valley growth model,\n\n00:01:01.118 --> 00:01:03.126\nwhich they understand is different\n\n00:01:03.126 --> 00:01:06.007\nfrom this old economy growth model?\n\n00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:08.686\nAnd what is interesting is that often,\n\n00:01:08.686 --> 00:01:10.265\neven if we're in the 21st century,\n\n00:01:10.265 --> 00:01:12.648\nwe kind of come down in the end to these ideas\n\n00:01:12.648 --> 00:01:14.621\nof market versus state.\n\n00:01:14.621 --> 00:01:16.673\nIt's talked about in these modern ways,\n\n00:01:16.673 --> 00:01:20.436\nbut the idea is that somehow, behind places like Silicon Valley,\n\n00:01:20.436 --> 00:01:24.222\nthe secret have been different types of market-making mechanisms,\n\n00:01:24.222 --> 00:01:27.494\nthe private initiative, whether this be about\n\n00:01:27.494 --> 00:01:29.708\na dynamic venture capital sector\n\n00:01:29.708 --> 00:01:32.054\nthat's actually able to provide that high-risk finance\n\n00:01:32.054 --> 00:01:33.727\nto these innovative companies,\n\n00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:35.852\nthe gazelles as we often call them,\n\n00:01:35.852 --> 00:01:37.847\nwhich traditional banks are scared of,\n\n00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:39.879\nor different types of really successful\n\n00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:42.885\ncommercialization policies which actually allow these companies\n\n00:01:42.885 --> 00:01:45.140\nto bring these great inventions, their products,\n\n00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.163\nto the market and actually get over this\n\n00:01:47.163 --> 00:01:49.414\nreally scary Death Valley period\n\n00:01:49.414 --> 00:01:51.980\nin which many companies instead fail.\n\n00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.756\nBut what really interests me, especially nowadays\n\n00:01:54.756 --> 00:01:57.717\nand because of what's happening politically around the world,\n\n00:01:57.717 --> 00:02:00.970\nis the language that's used, the narrative,\n\n00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.129\nthe discourse, the images, the actual words.\n\n00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:06.434\nSo we often are presented\n\n00:02:06.434 --> 00:02:09.407\nwith the kind of words like that the private sector\n\n00:02:09.407 --> 00:02:11.677\nis also much more innovative because it's able to\n\n00:02:11.677 --> 00:02:13.277\nthink out of the box.\n\n00:02:13.277 --> 00:02:15.530\nThey are more dynamic.\n\n00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.284\nThink of Steve Jobs' really inspirational speech\n\n00:02:18.284 --> 00:02:21.422\nto the 2005 graduating class at Stanford,\n\n00:02:21.422 --> 00:02:23.514\nwhere he said to be innovative,\n\n00:02:23.514 --> 00:02:26.284\nyou've got to stay hungry, stay foolish.\n\n00:02:26.284 --> 00:02:27.819\nRight?

Because, as many of us know,\n\n00:07:38.827 --> 00:07:40.694\nV.C. is actually quite short-term.\n\n00:07:40.694 --> 00:07:42.483\nThey want their returns in three to five years.\n\n00:07:42.483 --> 00:07:45.012\nInnovation takes a much longer time than that,\n\n00:07:45.012 --> 00:07:46.839\n15 to 20 years.\n\n00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:49.226\nAnd so this whole notion -- I mean, this is the point, right?\n\n00:07:49.226 --> 00:07:51.553\nWho's actually funding the hard stuff?\n\n00:07:51.553 --> 00:07:53.278\nOf course, it's not just the state.\n\n00:07:53.278 --> 00:07:54.508\nThe private sector does a lot.\n\n00:07:54.508 --> 00:07:56.707\nBut the narrative that we've always been told\n\n00:07:56.707 --> 00:07:59.590\nis the state is important for the basics,\n\n00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.870\nbut not really providing that sort of high-risk,\n\n00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.170\nrevolutionary thinking out of the box.\n\n00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.502\nIn all these sectors, from funding the Internet\n\n00:08:06.502 --> 00:08:09.407\nto doing the spending, but also the envisioning,\n\n00:08:09.407 --> 00:08:11.698\nthe strategic vision, for these investments,\n\n00:08:11.698 --> 00:08:13.286\nit was actually coming within the state.\n\n00:08:13.286 --> 00:08:15.655\nThe nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating\n\n00:08:15.655 --> 00:08:18.753\nto study this, because the word itself, nanotechnology,\n\n00:08:18.753 --> 00:08:20.724\ncame from within government.\n\n00:08:20.724 --> 00:08:23.071\nAnd so there's huge implications of this.\n\n00:08:23.071 --> 00:08:25.176\nFirst of all, of course I'm not someone,\n\n00:08:25.176 --> 00:08:27.178\nthis old-fashioned person, market versus state.\n\n00:08:27.178 --> 00:08:29.703\nWhat we all know in dynamic capitalism\n\n00:08:29.703 --> 00:08:32.762\nis that what we actually need are public-private partnerships.\n\n00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:35.501\nBut the point is, by constantly depicting\n\n00:08:35.501 --> 00:08:37.626\nthe state part as necessary\n\n00:08:37.626 --> 00:08:40.507\nbut actually -- pffff -- a bit boring\n\n00:08:40.507 --> 00:08:43.556\nand often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan,\n\n00:08:43.556 --> 00:08:46.308\nI think we've actually really stunted the possibility\n\n00:08:46.308 --> 00:08:47.880\nto build these public-private partnerships\n\n00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.426\nin a really dynamic way.\n\n00:08:49.426 --> 00:08:52.620\nEven the words that we often use to justify the \"P\" part,\n\n00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.848\nthe public part -- well, they're both P's --\n\n00:08:54.848 --> 00:08:56.208\nwith public-private partnerships\n\n00:08:56.208 --> 00:08:58.263\nis in terms of de-risking.\n\n00:08:58.263 --> 00:09:00.724\nWhat the public sector did in all these examples\n\n00:09:00.724 --> 00:09:02.811\nI just gave you, and there's many more,\n\n00:09:02.811 --> 00:09:06.275\nwhich myself and other colleagues have been looking at,\n\n00:09:06.275 --> 00:09:07.825\nis doing much more than de-risking.\n\n00:09:07.825 --> 00:09:10.391\nIt's kind of been taking on that risk. Bring it on.\n\n00:09:10.391 --> 00:09:12.964\nIt's actually been the one thinking out of the box.\n\n00:09:12.964 --> 00:09:15.675\nBut also, I'm sure you all have had experience\n\n00:09:15.675 --> 00:09:17.735\nwith local, regional, national governments,\n\n00:09:17.735 --> 00:09:20.882\nand you're kind of like, \"You know what, that Kafka-ian bureaucrat, I've met him.\"\n\n00:09:20.882 --> 00:09:24.326\nThat whole juxtaposition thing, it's kind of there.\n\n00:09:24.326 --> 00:09:26.140\nWell, there's a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.306\nBy talking about the state as kind of irrelevant,\n\n00:09:28.306 --> 00:09:30.633\nboring, it's sometimes\n\n00:09:30.633 --> 00:09:32.845\nthat we actually create those organizations in that way.\n\n00:09:32.845 --> 00:09:35.046\nSo what we have to actually do is build\n\n00:09:35.046 --> 00:09:37.222\nthese entrepreneurial state organizations.\n\n00:09:37.222 --> 00:09:39.711\nDARPA, that funded the Internet and Siri,\n\n00:09:39.711 --> 00:09:41.296\nactually thought really hard about this,\n\n00:09:41.296 --> 00:09:43.989\nhow to welcome failure, because you will fail.\n\n00:09:43.989 --> 00:09:45.914\nYou will fail when you innovative.\n\n00:09:45.914 --> 00:09:49.786\nOne out of 10 experiments has any success.\n\n00:09:49.786 --> 00:09:51.524\nAnd the V.C. guys know this,\n\n00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:53.396\nand they're able to actually fund the other losses\n\n00:09:53.396 --> 00:09:55.250\nfrom that one success.\n\n00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:56.743\nAnd this brings me, actually, probably,\n\n00:09:56.743 --> 00:09:59.338\nto the biggest implication,\n\n00:09:59.338 --> 00:10:02.005\nand this has huge implications beyond innovation.\n\n00:10:02.005 --> 00:10:05.665\nIf the state is more than just a market fixer,\n\n00:10:05.665 --> 00:10:07.477\nif it actually is a market shaper,\n\n00:10:07.477 --> 00:10:10.445\nand in doing that has had to take on this massive risk,\n\n00:10:10.445 --> 00:10:12.439\nwhat happened to the reward?\n\n00:10:12.439 --> 00:10:14.813\nWe all know, if you've ever taken a finance course,\n\n00:10:14.813 --> 00:10:18.219\nthe first thing you're taught is sort of the risk-reward relationship,\n\n00:10:18.219 --> 00:10:19.839\nand so some people are foolish enough\n\n00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:22.301\nor probably smart enough if they have time to wait,\n\n00:10:22.301 --> 00:10:24.783\nto actually invest in stocks, because they're higher risk\n\n00:10:24.783 --> 00:10:27.303\nwhich over time will make a greater reward than bonds,\n\n00:10:27.303 --> 00:10:28.882\nthat whole risk-reward thing.\n\n00:10:28.882 --> 00:10:30.855\nWell, where's the reward for the state\n\n00:10:30.855 --> 00:10:33.311\nof having taken on these massive risks\n\n00:10:33.311 --> 00:10:35.770\nand actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet?\n\n00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.722\nThe Internet was crazy.\n\n00:10:37.722 --> 00:10:40.874\nIt really was.

It's tax.\n\n00:10:57.001 --> 00:10:58.550\nYou know, the companies will pay tax,\n\n00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.840\nthe jobs they create will create growth\n\n00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.991\nso people who get those jobs and their incomes rise\n\n00:11:03.991 --> 00:11:07.215\nwill come back to the state through the tax mechanism.\n\n00:11:07.215 --> 00:11:09.205\nWell, unfortunately, that's not true.\n\n00:11:09.205 --> 00:11:12.724\nOkay, it's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad.\n\n00:11:12.724 --> 00:11:15.691\nGlobalization, and that's fine. We shouldn't be nationalistic.\n\n00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:17.898\nLet the jobs go where they have to go, perhaps.\n\n00:11:17.898 --> 00:11:19.987\nI mean, one can take a position on that.\n\n00:11:19.987 --> 00:11:21.651\nBut also these companies\n\n00:11:21.651 --> 00:11:24.723\nthat have actually had this massive benefit from the state --\n\n00:11:24.723 --> 00:11:26.584\nApple's a great example.\n\n00:11:26.584 --> 00:11:28.633\nThey even got the first -- well, not the first,\n\n00:11:28.633 --> 00:11:33.201\nbut 500,000 dollars actually went to Apple, the company,\n\n00:11:33.201 --> 00:11:35.870\nthrough this SBIC program,\n\n00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.918\nwhich predated the SBIR program,\n\n00:11:37.918 --> 00:11:41.236\nas well as, as I said before, all the technologies behind the iPhone.\n\n00:11:41.236 --> 00:11:43.726\nAnd yet we know they legally,\n\n00:11:43.726 --> 00:11:47.408\nas many other companies, pay very little tax back.\n\n00:11:47.408 --> 00:11:50.395\nSo what we really need to actually rethink\n\n00:11:50.395 --> 00:11:54.654\nis should there perhaps be a return-generating mechanism\n\n00:11:54.654 --> 00:11:57.341\nthat's much more direct than tax. Why not?\n\n00:11:57.341 --> 00:11:59.911\nIt could happen perhaps through equity.\n\n00:11:59.911 --> 00:12:01.718\nThis, by the way, in the countries\n\n00:12:01.718 --> 00:12:04.022\nthat are actually thinking about this strategically,\n\n00:12:04.022 --> 00:12:06.153\ncountries like Finland in Scandinavia,\n\n00:12:06.153 --> 00:12:08.188\nbut also in China and Brazil,\n\n00:12:08.188 --> 00:12:10.518\nthey're retaining equity in these investments.\n\n00:12:10.518 --> 00:12:14.344\nSitra funded Nokia, kept equity, made a lot of money,\n\n00:12:14.344 --> 00:12:17.004\nit's a public funding agency in Finland,\n\n00:12:17.004 --> 00:12:19.830\nwhich then funded the next round of Nokias.\n\n00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.839\nThe Brazilian Development Bank,\n\n00:12:21.839 --> 00:12:24.634\nwhich is providing huge amounts of funds today\n\n00:12:24.634 --> 00:12:26.431\nto clean technology, they just announced\n\n00:12:26.431 --> 00:12:30.680\na $56 billion program for the future on this,\n\n00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.219\nis retaining equity in these investments.\n\n00:12:34.219 --> 00:12:35.731\nSo to put it provocatively,\n\n00:12:35.731 --> 00:12:38.670\nhad the U.S. government thought about this,\n\n00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.514\nand maybe just brought back\n\n00:12:40.514 --> 00:12:42.939\njust something called an innovation fund,\n\n00:12:42.939 --> 00:12:46.071\nyou can bet that, you know, if even just .05 percent\n\n00:12:46.071 --> 00:12:47.954\nof the profits from what the Internet produced\n\n00:12:47.954 --> 00:12:49.612\nhad come back to that innovation fund,\n\n00:12:49.612 --> 00:12:51.236\nthere would be so much more money\n\n00:12:51.236 --> 00:12:53.464\nto spend today on green technology.\n\n00:12:53.464 --> 00:12:54.958\nInstead, many of the state budgets\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.556\nwhich in theory are trying to do that\n\n00:12:57.556 --> 00:12:59.392\nare being constrained.\n\n00:12:59.392 --> 00:13:01.202\nBut perhaps even more important,\n\n00:13:01.202 --> 00:13:03.069\nwe heard before about the one percent,\n\n00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:04.644\nthe 99 percent.\n\n00:13:04.644 --> 00:13:08.389\nIf the state is thought about in this more strategic way,\n\n00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:11.422\nas one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism,\n\n00:13:11.422 --> 00:13:13.243\nbecause that's what we're talking about, right?\n\n00:13:13.243 --> 00:13:15.177\nWho are the different players in creating value\n\n00:13:15.177 --> 00:13:17.472\nin the economy, and is the state's role,\n\n00:13:17.472 --> 00:13:21.201\nhas it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player?\n\n00:13:21.201 --> 00:13:23.556\nIf we can actually have a broader theory\n\n00:13:23.556 --> 00:13:25.609\nof value creation and allow us to actually admit\n\n00:13:25.609 --> 00:13:28.660\nwhat the state has been doing and reap something back,\n\n00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.479\nit might just be that in the next round,\n\n00:13:31.479 --> 00:13:34.045\nand I hope that we all hope that the next big revolution\n\n00:13:34.045 --> 00:13:35.686\nwill in fact be green,\n\n00:13:35.686 --> 00:13:37.409\nthat that period of growth\n\n00:13:37.409 --> 00:13:40.099\nwill not only be smart, innovation-led,\n\n00:13:40.099 --> 00:13:43.285\nnot only green, but also more inclusive,\n\n00:13:43.285 --> 00:13:46.539\nso that the public schools in places like Silicon Valley\n\n00:13:46.539 --> 00:13:49.279\ncan actually also benefit from that growth,\n\n00:13:49.279 --> 00:13:50.878\nbecause they have not.\n\n00:13:50.878 --> 00:13:52.131\nThank you.\n\n00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:57.378\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A simple solution to the coming phosphorus crisis", "duration": "821", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/mohamed_hijri_a_simple_solution_to_the_coming_phosphorus_crisis", "transcript": "I'm going to start by asking you a question: Is anyone familiar with the blue algae problem? Okay, so most of you are. I think we can all agree it's a serious issue. Nobody wants to drink blue algae-contaminated water, or swim in a blue algae-infested lake. Right?I hope you won't be disappointed, but today, I won't be talking about blue algae. Instead, I'll be talking about the main cause at the root of this issue, which I will be referring to as the phosphorus crisis. Why have I chosen to talk to you about the phosphorus crisis today? For the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it. And by the end of my presentation, I hope that the general public will be more aware of this crisis and this issue.Now, the problem is that if I ask, why do we find ourselves in this situation with blue algae? The answer is that it comes from how we farm. We use fertilizers in our farming, chemical fertilizers. Why do we use chemical fertilizers in agriculture? Basically, to help plants grow and to produce a better yield. The issue is that this is set to engender an environmental problem that is without precedent.Before going further, let me give you a crash course in plant biology. So, what does a plant need in order to grow? A plant, quite simply, needs light, it needs CO2, but even more importantly, it needs nutrients, which it draws from the soil. Several of these nutrients are essential chemical elements: phosphorus, nitrogen and calcium. So, the plant\u2019s roots will extract these resources.Today I'll be focusing on a major problem that is linked to phosphorus. Why phosphorus in particular? Because it is the most problematic chemical element. By the end of my presentation, you will have seen what these problems are, and where we are today.Phosphorus is a chemical element that is essential to life. This is a very important point. I\u2019d like everyone to understand precisely what the phosphorus issue is. Phosphorus is a key component in several molecules, in many of our molecules of life. Experts in the field will know that cellular communication is phosphorus-based \u2014 phosphorylation, dephosphorylation. Cell membranes are phosphorus-based: These are called phospholipids. The energy in all living things, ATP, is phosphorus-based. And more importantly still, phosphorus is a key component of DNA, something everyone is familiar with, and which is shown in this image. DNA is our genetic heritage. It is extremely important, and once again, phosphorus is a key player.Now, where do we find this phosphorus? As humans, where do we find it? As I explained earlier, plants extract phosphorus from the soil, through water. So, we humans get it from the things we eat: plants, vegetables, fruits, and also from eggs, meat and milk. It\u2019s true that some humans eat better than others. Some are happier than others. And now, looking at this picture, which speaks for itself, we see modern agriculture, which I also refer to as intensive agriculture. Intensive agriculture is based on the use of chemical fertilizers. Without them, we would not manage to produce enough to feed the world's population. Speaking of humans, there are currently 7 billion of us on Earth. In less than 40 years, there will be 9 billion of us. And the question is a simple one: Do we have enough phosphorus to feed our future generations?So, in order to understand these issues, where do we find our phosphorus? Let me explain. But first, let\u2019s just suppose that we are using 100 percent of a given dose of phosphorus. Only 15 percent of this 100 percent goes to the plant. Eighty-five percent is lost. It goes into the soil, ending its journey in the lakes, resulting in lakes with extra phosphorus, which leads to the blue algae problem. So, you\u2019ll see there\u2019s a problem here, something that is illogical. A hundred percent of the phosphorus is used, but only 15 percent goes to the plant. You\u2019re going to tell me it\u2019s wasteful. Yes, it is. What is worse is that it is very expensive. Nobody wants to throw their money out the window, but unfortunately that's what is happening here. Eighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost. Modern agriculture depends on phosphorus. And because in order to get 15 percent of it to the plant, all the rest is lost, we have to add more and more.Now, where will we get this phosphorus from? Basically, we get it out of mines. This is the cover of an extraordinary article published in Nature in 2009, which really launched the discussion about the phosphorus crisis. Phosphorus, a nutrient essential to life, which is becoming increasingly scarce, yet nobody is talking about it. And everyone agrees: Politicians and scientists are in agreement that we are headed for a phosphorus crisis.What you are seeing here is an open-pit mine in the U.S., and to give you an idea of the dimensions of this mine, if you look in the top right-hand corner, the little crane you can see, that is a giant crane. So that really puts it into perspective. So, we get phosphorus from mines. And if I make a comparison with oil, there\u2019s an oil crisis, we talk about it, we talk about global warming, yet we never mention the phosphorus crisis. To come back to the oil problem, oil is something we can replace. We can use biofuels, or solar power, or hydropower, but phosphorus is an essential element, indispensable to life, and we can\u2019t replace it.What is the current state of the world's phosphorus reserves? This graph gives you a rough idea of where we are today. The black line represents predictions for phosphorus reserves. In 2030, we\u2019ll reach the peak. By the end of this century, it will all be gone. The dotted line shows where we are today. As you can see, they meet in 2030, I\u2019ll be retired by then. But we are indeed heading for a major crisis, and I\u2019d like people to become aware of this problem.Do we have a solution? What are we to do? We are faced with a paradox. Less and less phosphorus will be available. By 2050 there will be 9 billion of us, and according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, we will need to produce twice as much food in 2050 than we do today. So, we will have less phosphorus, but we'll need to produce more food. What should we do? It truly is a paradoxical situation. Do we have a solution, or an alternative which will allow us to optimize phosphorus use?Remember that 80 percent is destined to be lost. The solution I'm offering today is one that has existed for a very long time, even before plants existed on Earth, and it's a microscopic mushroom that is very mysterious, very simple, and yet also extremely complex. I've been fascinated by this little mushroom for over 16 years now. It has led me to further my research and to use it as a model for my laboratory research.This mushroom exists in symbiosis with the roots. By symbiosis, I mean a bidirectional and mutually beneficial association which is also called mycorrhiza. This slide illustrates the elements of a mycorrhiza. You\u2019re looking at the root of wheat, one of the world\u2019s most important plants. Normally, a root will find phosphorus all by itself. It will go in search of phosphorus, but only within the one millimeter which surrounds it. Beyond one millimeter, the root is ineffective. It cannot go further in its search for phosphorus. Now, imagine this tiny, microscopic mushroom. It grows much faster, and is much better designed to seek out phosphorus. It can go beyond the root\u2019s one-millimeter scope to seek out phosphorus.I haven\u2019t invented anything at all; it's a biotechnology that has existed for 450 million years. And over time, this mushroom has evolved and adapted to seek out even the tiniest trace of phosphorus, and to put it to use, to make it available to the plant. What you\u2019re seeing here, in the real world, is a carrot root, and the mushroom with its very fine filaments. Looking closer, we can see that this mushroom is very gentle in its penetration. It will proliferate between the root's cells, eventually penetrating a cell and starting to form a typical arbuscular structure, which will considerably increase the exchange interface between the plant and the mushroom. And it is through this structure that mutual exchanges will occur. It\u2019s a win-win trade: I give you phosphorus, and you feed me. True symbiosis.Now let's add a mycorrhiza plant into the diagram I used earlier. And instead of using a 100 percent dose, I\u2019m going to reduce it to 25 percent. You\u2019ll see that of this 25 percent, most will benefit the plant, more than 90 percent. A very small amount of phosphorus will remain in the soil. That's completely natural. What's more is that in certain cases, we don't even need to add phosphorus.If you recall the graphs I showed you earlier, 85 percent of phosphorus is lost in the soil, and the plants are unable to access it. Even though it is present in the soil, it is in insoluble form. The plant is only able to seek out soluble forms. The mushroom is capable of dissolving this insoluble form and making it available for the plant to use. To further support my argument, here is a picture that speaks for itself. These are trials in a field of sorghum. On the left side, you see the yield produced using conventional agriculture, with a 100 percent phosphorus dose. On the other side, the dose was reduced to 50 percent, and just look at the yield. With only a half-dose, we achieved a better yield.This is to show you that this method works. And in some cases, in Cuba, Mexico and India, the dose can be reduced to 25 percent, and in several other cases, there's no need to add any phosphorus at all, because the mushrooms are so well adapted to finding phosphorus and drawing it from the soil. This is an example of soy production in Canada. Mycorrhiza was used in one field but not in the other. And here, where blue indicates a better yield, and yellow a weaker yield. The black rectangle is the plot from which the mycorrhiza was added. In other words, as I already said, I have invented nothing. Mycorrhiza has existed for 450 million years, and it has even helped modern-day plant species to diversify.So, this it isn't something that is still undergoing lab tests. Mycorrhiza exists, it works, it's produced at an industrial scale and commercialized worldwide. The problem is that people are not aware of it. People like food producers and farmers are still not aware of this problem. We have a technology that works, and one that, if used correctly, will alleviate some of the pressure we are putting on the world's phosphorus reserves.In conclusion, I am a scientist and a dreamer. I'm passionate about this topic. So if you were to ask me what my retirement dream is, which will be at the moment we reach that phosphorus peak, it would be that we use one label, \"Made with mycorrhiza,\" and that my children and grandchildren buy products bearing that label too.Thank you for your attention.(Applause)", "id": 1783, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.148 -->

vegetables, fruits,\n\n00:03:35.355 --> 00:03:38.360\nand also from eggs, meat and milk.\n\n00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.927\nIt\u2019s true that some humans\neat better than others.\n\n00:03:41.927 --> 00:03:43.903\nSome are happier than others.\n\n00:03:44.563 --> 00:03:48.744\nAnd now, looking at this picture,\nwhich speaks for itself,\n\n00:03:49.034 --> 00:03:50.850\nwe see modern agriculture,\n\n00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.406\nwhich I also refer to\nas intensive agriculture.\n\n00:03:54.406 --> 00:03:58.862\nIntensive agriculture is based\non the use of chemical fertilizers.\n\n00:03:58.862 --> 00:04:01.890\nWithout them,\nwe would not manage to produce enough\n\n00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.918\nto feed the world's population.\n\n00:04:04.918 --> 00:04:08.396\nSpeaking of humans, there are currently\n7 billion of us on Earth.\n\n00:04:08.696 --> 00:04:11.822\nIn less than 40 years,\nthere will be 9 billion of us.\n\n00:04:11.822 --> 00:04:15.212\nAnd the question is a simple one:\nDo we have enough phosphorus\n\n00:04:15.212 --> 00:04:18.082\nto feed our future generations?\n\n00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:23.174\nSo, in order to understand these issues,\nwhere do we find our phosphorus?\n\n00:04:23.174 --> 00:04:24.795\nLet me explain.\n\n00:04:24.955 --> 00:04:27.532\nBut first, let\u2019s just suppose\n\n00:04:27.802 --> 00:04:32.708\nthat we are using\n100 percent of a given dose of phosphorus.\n\n00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:40.776\nOnly 15 percent of this 100 percent goes to the plant.\nEighty-five percent is lost.\n\n00:04:42.236 --> 00:04:45.635\nIt goes into the soil,\nending its journey in the lakes,\n\n00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:49.631\nresulting in lakes with extra phosphorus,\nwhich leads to the blue algae problem.\n\n00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:53.369\nSo, you\u2019ll see there\u2019s a problem here,\nsomething that is illogical.\n\n00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:57.458\nA hundred percent of the phosphorus is used,\nbut only 15 percent goes to the plant.\n\n00:04:57.808 --> 00:04:59.742\nYou\u2019re going to tell me it\u2019s wasteful.\n\n00:05:00.232 --> 00:05:04.359\nYes, it is. What is worse\nis that it is very expensive.\n\n00:05:04.359 --> 00:05:07.741\nNobody wants to throw their money\nout the window,\n\n00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:10.081\nbut unfortunately\nthat's what is happening here.\n\n00:05:10.471 --> 00:05:13.277\nEighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost.\n\n00:05:15.007 --> 00:05:20.659\nModern agriculture\ndepends on phosphorus.\n\n00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:25.258\nAnd because in order to get 15 percent of it\nto the plant, all the rest is lost,\n\n00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:27.179\nwe have to add more and more.\n\n00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:30.553\nNow, where will we get\nthis phosphorus from?\n\n00:05:31.093 --> 00:05:34.427\nBasically, we get it out of mines.\n\n00:05:34.947 --> 00:05:37.194\nThis is the cover\nof an extraordinary article\n\n00:05:37.474 --> 00:05:39.231\npublished in Nature in 2009,\n\n00:05:39.231 --> 00:05:42.418\nwhich really launched the discussion\nabout the phosphorus crisis.\n\n00:05:42.418 --> 00:05:47.381\nPhosphorus, a nutrient essential to life,\nwhich is becoming increasingly scarce,\n\n00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:49.204\nyet nobody is talking about it.\n\n00:05:49.204 --> 00:05:55.068\nAnd everyone agrees:\nPoliticians and scientists are in agreement\n\n00:05:55.068 --> 00:05:57.409\nthat we are headed\nfor a phosphorus crisis.\n\n00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:00.857\nWhat you are seeing here\nis an open-pit mine in the U.S.,\n\n00:06:00.857 --> 00:06:03.958\nand to give you an idea\nof the dimensions of this mine,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.512\nif you look in the top right-hand corner,\nthe little crane you can see,\n\n00:06:07.512 --> 00:06:08.977\nthat is a giant crane.\n\n00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:12.361\nSo that really puts it into perspective.\n\n00:06:12.361 --> 00:06:14.559\nSo, we get phosphorus from mines.\n\n00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:17.007\nAnd if I make a comparison with oil,\n\n00:06:17.767 --> 00:06:21.138\nthere\u2019s an oil crisis, we talk about it,\nwe talk about global warming,\n\n00:06:21.138 --> 00:06:23.162\nyet we never mention\nthe phosphorus crisis.\n\n00:06:23.162 --> 00:06:26.994\nTo come back to the oil problem,\noil is something we can replace.\n\n00:06:27.364 --> 00:06:31.726\nWe can use biofuels, or solar power,\n\n00:06:31.726 --> 00:06:35.490\nor hydropower,\nbut phosphorus is an essential element,\n\n00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.214\nindispensable to life,\nand we can\u2019t replace it.\n\n00:06:41.064 --> 00:06:44.727\nWhat is the current state\nof the world's phosphorus reserves?\n\n00:06:44.727 --> 00:06:48.838\nThis graph gives you a rough idea\nof where we are today.\n\n00:06:48.838 --> 00:06:53.489\nThe black line represents predictions\nfor phosphorus reserves.\n\n00:06:53.489 --> 00:06:56.113\nIn 2030, we\u2019ll reach the peak.\n\n00:06:56.113 --> 00:06:59.439\nBy the end of this century,\nit will all be gone.\n\n00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:03.504\nThe dotted line shows where we are today.\n\n00:07:03.934 --> 00:07:07.406\nAs you can see, they meet in 2030,\nI\u2019ll be retired by then.\n\n00:07:08.616 --> 00:07:12.185\nBut we are indeed heading\nfor a major crisis,\n\n00:07:12.185 --> 00:07:15.457\nand I\u2019d like people to become aware\nof this problem.\n\n00:07:16.047 --> 00:07:17.687\nDo we have a solution?\n\n00:07:18.407 --> 00:07:21.519\nWhat are we to do?\nWe are faced with a paradox.\n\n00:07:22.489 --> 00:07:24.796\nLess and less phosphorus\nwill be available.\n\n00:07:25.076 --> 00:07:28.272\nBy 2050 there will be 9 billion of us,\n\n00:07:28.442 --> 00:07:34.806\nand according to\nthe U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization,\n\n00:07:35.056 --> 00:07:39.799\nwe will need to produce twice as much food\nin 2050 than we do today.\n\n00:07:39.799 --> 00:07:43.569\nSo, we will have less phosphorus,\nbut we'll need to produce more food.\n\n00:07:44.099 --> 00:07:45.717\nWhat should we do?\n\n00:07:46.157 --> 00:07:48.247\nIt truly is a paradoxical situation.\n\n00:07:48.987 --> 00:07:51.735\nDo we have a solution,\nor an alternative\n\n00:07:51.735 --> 00:07:54.703\nwhich will allow us to optimize\nphosphorus use?\n\n00:07:54.703 --> 00:07:58.073\nRemember that 80 percent is destined to be lost.\n\n00:08:00.323 --> 00:08:07.627\nThe solution I'm offering today is one\nthat has existed for a very long time,\n\n00:08:07.627 --> 00:08:10.025\neven before plants existed on Earth,\n\n00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:13.843\nand it's a microscopic mushroom\nthat is very mysterious,\n\n00:08:13.843 --> 00:08:17.351\nvery simple,\nand yet also extremely complex.\n\n00:08:17.891 --> 00:08:22.579\nI've been fascinated by this little mushroom\nfor over 16 years now.\n\n00:08:22.579 --> 00:08:26.424\nIt has led me to further my research\n\n00:08:26.424 --> 00:08:29.794\nand to use it as a model\nfor my laboratory research.\n\n00:08:29.794 --> 00:08:33.248\nThis mushroom exists in symbiosis\nwith the roots.\n\n00:08:33.508 --> 00:08:38.895\nBy symbiosis, I mean a bidirectional\nand mutually beneficial association\n\n00:08:38.895 --> 00:08:41.923\nwhich is also called mycorrhiza.\n\n00:08:44.043 --> 00:08:47.100\nThis slide illustrates the elements\nof a mycorrhiza.\n\n00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.365\nYou\u2019re looking at the root of wheat,\n\n00:08:49.365 --> 00:08:52.709\none of the world\u2019s most important plants.\n\n00:08:53.459 --> 00:08:56.298\nNormally, a root will find phosphorus\nall by itself.\n\n00:08:56.298 --> 00:08:58.330\nIt will go in search of phosphorus,\n\n00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.572\nbut only within the one millimeter\nwhich surrounds it.\n\n00:09:02.002 --> 00:09:05.077\nBeyond one millimeter,\nthe root is ineffective.\n\n00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:07.402\nIt cannot go further\nin its search for phosphorus.\n\n00:09:07.402 --> 00:09:10.138\nNow, imagine this tiny,\nmicroscopic mushroom.\n\n00:09:10.138 --> 00:09:12.399\nIt grows much faster,\n\n00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:15.195\nand is much better designed\nto seek out phosphorus.\n\n00:09:15.195 --> 00:09:18.574\nIt can go beyond\nthe root\u2019s one-millimeter scope\n\n00:09:18.574 --> 00:09:20.661\nto seek out phosphorus.\n\n00:09:20.661 --> 00:09:22.717\nI haven\u2019t invented anything at all;\n\n00:09:22.717 --> 00:09:26.215\nit's a biotechnology that has existed\nfor 450 million years.\n\n00:09:26.215 --> 00:09:30.128\nAnd over time, this mushroom\nhas evolved and adapted to seek out\n\n00:09:30.128 --> 00:09:33.621\neven the tiniest trace of phosphorus,\nand to put it to use,\n\n00:09:33.621 --> 00:09:35.954\nto make it available to the plant.\n\n00:09:36.674 --> 00:09:40.607\nWhat you\u2019re seeing here,\nin the real world, is a carrot root,\n\n00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:43.878\nand the mushroom\nwith its very fine filaments.\n\n00:09:43.878 --> 00:09:46.285\nLooking closer,\nwe can see that this mushroom\n\n00:09:46.285 --> 00:09:48.372\nis very gentle in its penetration.\n\n00:09:48.372 --> 00:09:52.061\nIt will proliferate\nbetween the root's cells,\n\n00:09:52.061 --> 00:09:55.144\neventually penetrating a cell\n\n00:09:55.554 --> 00:10:00.238\nand starting to form\na typical arbuscular structure,\n\n00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:05.435\nwhich will considerably increase\nthe exchange interface\n\n00:10:05.435 --> 00:10:07.994\nbetween the plant and the mushroom.\n\n00:10:07.994 --> 00:10:11.439\nAnd it is through this structure\nthat mutual exchanges will occur.\n\n00:10:11.439 --> 00:10:13.075\nIt\u2019s a win-win trade:\n\n00:10:13.075 --> 00:10:15.640\nI give you phosphorus, and you feed me.\n\n00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.220\nTrue symbiosis.\n\n00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.328\nNow let's add a mycorrhiza plant\n\n00:10:23.328 --> 00:10:26.588\ninto the diagram I used earlier.\n\n00:10:26.588 --> 00:10:31.665\nAnd instead of using a 100 percent dose,\nI\u2019m going to reduce it to 25 percent.\n\n00:10:31.665 --> 00:10:36.639\nYou\u2019ll see that of this 25 percent,\nmost will benefit the plant,\n\n00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:38.195\nmore than 90 percent.\n\n00:10:38.195 --> 00:10:41.775\nA very small amount of phosphorus\nwill remain in the soil.\n\n00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:44.075\nThat's completely natural.\n\n00:10:45.535 --> 00:10:49.406\nWhat's more is that in certain cases,\nwe don't even need to add phosphorus.\n\n00:10:49.406 --> 00:10:51.818\nIf you recall the graphs\nI showed you earlier,\n\n00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:55.039\n85 percent of phosphorus is lost in the soil,\n\n00:10:55.039 --> 00:10:58.284\nand the plants are unable to access it.\n\n00:10:58.284 --> 00:11:02.092\nEven though it is present in the soil,\nit is in insoluble form.\n\n00:11:02.092 --> 00:11:05.102\nThe plant is only able to seek out\nsoluble forms.\n\n00:11:05.102 --> 00:11:08.914\nThe mushroom is capable\nof dissolving this insoluble form\n\n00:11:08.914 --> 00:11:12.355\nand making it available\nfor the plant to use.\n\n00:11:12.355 --> 00:11:15.906\nTo further support my argument,\nhere is a picture that speaks for itself.\n\n00:11:15.906 --> 00:11:19.794\nThese are trials\nin a field of sorghum.\n\n00:11:19.794 --> 00:11:24.306\nOn the left side, you see the yield\nproduced using conventional agriculture,\n\n00:11:24.306 --> 00:11:26.888\nwith a 100 percent phosphorus dose.\n\n00:11:27.048 --> 00:11:30.261\nOn the other side,\nthe dose was reduced to 50 percent,\n\n00:11:30.261 --> 00:11:31.794\nand just look at the yield.\n\n00:11:31.794 --> 00:11:37.375\nWith only a half-dose,\nwe achieved a better yield.\n\n00:11:37.375 --> 00:11:42.205\nThis is to show you\nthat this method works.\n\n00:11:42.205 --> 00:11:46.774\nAnd in some cases, in Cuba,\nMexico and India,\n\n00:11:46.774 --> 00:11:50.061\nthe dose can be reduced to 25 percent,\nand in several other cases,\n\n00:11:50.061 --> 00:11:52.215\nthere's no need to add\nany phosphorus at all,\n\n00:11:52.215 --> 00:11:54.659\nbecause the mushrooms are so well adapted\n\n00:11:54.659 --> 00:11:57.395\nto finding phosphorus\nand drawing it from the soil.\n\n00:11:57.855 --> 00:12:02.373\nThis is an example of soy production\nin Canada.\n\n00:12:03.693 --> 00:12:10.635\nMycorrhiza was used in one field\nbut not in the other.\n\n00:12:11.305 --> 00:12:19.231\nAnd here, where blue indicates a better yield,\nand yellow a weaker yield.\n\n00:12:20.721 --> 00:12:23.544\nThe black rectangle is the plot\n\n00:12:23.544 --> 00:12:25.927\nfrom which the mycorrhiza was added.\n\n00:12:25.927 --> 00:12:29.295\nIn other words, as I already said,\nI have invented nothing.\n\n00:12:29.295 --> 00:12:32.045\nMycorrhiza has existed\nfor 450 million years,\n\n00:12:32.045 --> 00:12:36.304\nand it has even helped\nmodern-day plant species to diversify.\n\n00:12:36.304 --> 00:12:40.863\nSo, this it isn't something\nthat is still undergoing lab tests.\n\n00:12:40.863 --> 00:12:43.279\nMycorrhiza exists, it works,\n\n00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:47.718\nit's produced at an industrial scale\nand commercialized worldwide.\n\n00:12:47.718 --> 00:12:51.028\nThe problem is\nthat people are not aware of it.\n\n00:12:51.028 --> 00:12:55.024\nPeople like food producers and farmers\nare still not aware of this problem.\n\n00:12:55.024 --> 00:12:57.652\nWe have a technology that works,\n\n00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:04.749\nand one that, if used correctly,\nwill alleviate some of the pressure\n\n00:13:04.749 --> 00:13:08.402\nwe are putting\non the world's phosphorus reserves.\n\n00:13:09.172 --> 00:13:13.636\nIn conclusion,\nI am a scientist and a dreamer.\n\n00:13:14.326 --> 00:13:16.085\nI'm passionate about this topic.\n\n00:13:16.085 --> 00:13:19.373\nSo if you were to ask me\nwhat my retirement dream is,\n\n00:13:19.373 --> 00:13:22.199\nwhich will be at the moment we reach\nthat phosphorus peak,\n\n00:13:22.199 --> 00:13:26.155\nit would be that we use one label,\n\"Made with mycorrhiza,\"\n\n00:13:26.155 --> 00:13:29.065\nand that my children and grandchildren\n\n00:13:29.065 --> 00:13:32.073\nbuy products bearing that label too.\n\n00:13:32.073 --> 00:13:33.773\nThank you for your attention.\n\n00:13:33.773 --> 00:13:36.274\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Life in the \"digital now\"", "duration": "721", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/abha_dawesar_life_in_the_digital_now", "transcript": "I was in New York during Hurricane Sandy, and this little white dog called Maui was staying with me. Half the city was dark because of a power cut, and I was living on the dark side. Now, Maui was terrified of the dark, so I had to carry him up the stairs, actually down the stairs first, for his walk, and then bring him back up. I was also hauling gallons of bottles of water up to the seventh floor every day. And through all of this, I had to hold a torch between my teeth. The stores nearby were out of flashlights and batteries and bread. For a shower, I walked 40 blocks to a branch of my gym.But these were not the major preoccupations of my day. It was just as critical for me to be the first person in at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers to juice my multiple devices. I started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points. I wasn't the only one. Even in the rain, people stood between Madison and 5th Avenue under their umbrellas charging their cell phones from outlets on the street. Nature had just reminded us that it was stronger than all our technology, and yet here we were, obsessed about being wired.I think there's nothing like a crisis to tell you what's really important and what's not, and Sandy made me realize that our devices and their connectivity matter to us right up there with food and shelter. The self as we once knew it no longer exists, and I think that an abstract, digital universe has become a part of our identity, and I want to talk to you about what I think that means.I'm a novelist, and I'm interested in the self because the self and fiction have a lot in common. They're both stories, interpretations. You and I can experience things without a story. We might run up the stairs too quickly and we might get breathless. But the larger sense that we have of our lives, the slightly more abstract one, is indirect. Our story of our life is based on direct experience, but it's embellished. A novel needs scene after scene to build, and the story of our life needs an arc as well. It needs months and years. Discrete moments from our lives are its chapters. But the story is not about these chapters. It's the whole book. It's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness, the victories and the disappointments, but it's because how because of these, and sometimes, more importantly, in spite of these, we find our place in the world and we change it and we change ourselves. Our story, therefore, needs two dimensions of time: a long arc of time that is our lifespan, and the timeframe of direct experience that is the moment. Now the self that experiences directly can only exist in the moment, but the one that narrates needs several moments, a whole sequence of them, and that's why our full sense of self needs both immersive experience and the flow of time. Now, the flow of time is embedded in everything, in the erosion of a grain of sand, in the budding of a little bud into a rose. Without it, we would have no music. Our own emotions and state of mind often encode time, regret or nostalgia about the past, hope or dread about the future.I think that technology has altered that flow of time. The overall time that we have for our narrative, our lifespan, has been increasing, but the smallest measure, the moment, has shrunk. It has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time, and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world, and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers. All of this to say that the gap between what we can perceive and what we can measure is only going to widen. Science can do things with and in a picosecond, but you and I are never going to have the inner experience of a millionth of a millionth of a second. You and I answer only to nature's rhythm and flow, to the sun, the moon and the seasons, and this is why we need that long arc of time with the past, the present and the future to see things for what they are, to separate signal from noise and the self from sensations. We need time's arrow to understand cause and effect, not just in the material world, but in our own intentions and our motivations. What happens when that arrow goes awry? What happens when time warps?So many of us today have the sensation that time's arrow is pointing everywhere and nowhere at once. This is because time doesn't flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one. We all know that the Internet has shrunk space as well as time. Far away over there is now here. News from India is a stream on my smartphone app whether I'm in New York or New Delhi. And that's not all. Your last job, your dinner reservations from last year, your former friends, lie on a flat plain with today's friends, because the Internet also archives, and it warps the past. With no distinction left between the past, the present and the future, and the here or there, we are left with this moment everywhere, this moment that I'll call the digital now.Just how can we prioritize in the landscape of the digital now? This digital now is not the present, because it's always a few seconds ahead, with Twitter streams that are already trending and news from other time zones. This isn't the now of a shooting pain in your foot or the second that you bite into a pastry or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book. This now bears very little physical or psychological reference to our own state. Its focus, instead, is to distract us at every turn on the road. Every digital landmark is an invitation to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else and do something else. Are you reading an interview by an author? Why not buy his book? Tweet it. Share it. Like it. Find other books exactly like his. Find other people reading those books. Travel can be liberating, but when it is incessant, we become permanent exiles without repose. Choice is freedom, but not when it's constantly for its own sake.Not just is the digital now far from the present, but it's in direct competition with it, and this is because not just am I absent from it, but so are you. Not just are we absent from it, but so is everyone else. And therein lies its greatest convenience and horror. I can order foreign language books in the middle of the night, shop for Parisian macarons, and leave video messages that get picked up later. At all times, I can operate at a different rhythm and pace from you, while I sustain the illusion that I'm tapped into you in real time.Sandy was a reminder of how such an illusion can shatter. There were those with power and water, and those without. There are those who went back to their lives, and those who are still displaced after so many months. For some reason, technology seems to perpetuate the illusion for those who have it that everyone does, and then, like an ironic slap in the face, it makes it true. For example, it's said that there are more people in India with access to cell phones than toilets. Now if this rift, which is already so great in many parts of the world, between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology, isn't somehow bridged, there will be ruptures between the digital and the real. For us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it, the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous. How does one live inside distraction?We might think that those younger than us, those who are born into this, will adapt more naturally. Possibly, but I remember my childhood. I remember my grandfather revising the capitals of the world with me. Buda and Pest were separated by the Danube, and Vienna had a Spanish riding school. If I were a child today, I could easily learn this information with apps and hyperlinks, but it really wouldn't be the same, because much later, I went to Vienna, and I went to the Spanish riding school, and I could feel my grandfather right beside me. Night after night, he took me up on the terrace, on his shoulders, and pointed out Jupiter and Saturn and the Great Bear to me. And even here, when I look at the Great Bear, I get back that feeling of being a child, hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself on his shoulder, and I can get back that feeling of being a child again. What I had with my grandfather was wrapped so often in information and knowledge and fact, but it was about so much more than information or knowledge or fact. Time-warping technology challenges our deepest core, because we are able to archive the past and some of it becomes hard to forget, even as the current moment is increasingly unmemorable. We want to clutch, and we are left instead clutching at a series of static moments. They're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them.By archiving everything, we think that we can store it, but time is not data. It cannot be stored. You and I know exactly what it means like to be truly present in a moment. It might have happened while we were playing an instrument, or looking into the eyes of someone we've known for a very long time. At such moments, our selves are complete. The self that lives in the long narrative arc and the self that experiences the moment become one. The present encapsulates the past and a promise for the future. The present joins a flow of time from before and after.I first experienced these feelings with my grandmother. I wanted to learn to skip, and she found an old rope and she tucked up her sari and she jumped over it. I wanted to learn to cook, and she kept me in the kitchen, cutting, cubing and chopping for a whole month. My grandmother taught me that things happen in the time they take, that time can't be fought, and because it will pass and it will move, we owe the present moment our full attention. Attention is time. One of my yoga instructors once said that love is attention, and definitely from my grandmother, love and attention were one and the same thing. The digital world cannibalizes time, and in doing so, I want to suggest that what it threatens is the completeness of ourselves. It threatens the flow of love. But we don't need to let it. We can choose otherwise. We've seen again and again just how creative technology can be, and in our lives and in our actions, we can choose those solutions and those innovations and those moments that restore the flow of time instead of fragmenting it. We can slow down and we can tune in to the ebb and flow of time. We can choose to take time back.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1856, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.504 --> 00:00:14.751\nI was in New York during Hurricane Sandy,\n\n00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:16.991\nand this little white dog called Maui\n\n00:00:16.991 --> 00:00:18.876\nwas staying with me.\n\n00:00:18.876 --> 00:00:21.348\nHalf the city was dark because of a power cut,\n\n00:00:21.348 --> 00:00:23.572\nand I was living on the dark side.\n\n00:00:23.572 --> 00:00:25.681\nNow, Maui was terrified of the dark,\n\n00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:27.785\nso I had to carry him up the stairs,\n\n00:00:27.785 --> 00:00:30.873\nactually down the stairs first, for his walk,\n\n00:00:30.873 --> 00:00:32.761\nand then bring him back up.\n\n00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:35.742\nI was also hauling gallons of bottles of water\n\n00:00:35.742 --> 00:00:37.841\nup to the seventh floor every day.\n\n00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:39.414\nAnd through all of this,\n\n00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:41.718\nI had to hold a torch between my teeth.\n\n00:00:41.718 --> 00:00:44.362\nThe stores nearby were out of flashlights\n\n00:00:44.362 --> 00:00:47.299\nand batteries and bread.\n\n00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:49.962\nFor a shower, I walked 40 blocks\n\n00:00:49.962 --> 00:00:51.936\nto a branch of my gym.\n\n00:00:51.936 --> 00:00:55.015\nBut these were not the major preoccupations of my day.\n\n00:00:55.015 --> 00:00:58.316\nIt was just as critical for me to be the first person in\n\n00:00:58.316 --> 00:01:01.608\nat a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers\n\n00:01:01.608 --> 00:01:03.457\nto juice my multiple devices.\n\n00:01:03.457 --> 00:01:06.182\nI started to prospect under the benches of bakeries\n\n00:01:06.182 --> 00:01:09.807\nand the entrances of pastry shops for plug points.\n\n00:01:09.807 --> 00:01:11.376\nI wasn't the only one.\n\n00:01:11.376 --> 00:01:15.140\nEven in the rain, people stood between Madison and 5th Avenue\n\n00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.604\nunder their umbrellas charging their cell phones\n\n00:01:17.604 --> 00:01:19.641\nfrom outlets on the street.\n\n00:01:19.641 --> 00:01:21.898\nNature had just reminded us\n\n00:01:21.898 --> 00:01:24.214\nthat it was stronger than all our technology,\n\n00:01:24.214 --> 00:01:27.483\nand yet here we were, obsessed about being wired.\n\n00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:29.359\nI think there's nothing like a crisis\n\n00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:32.548\nto tell you what's really important and what's not,\n\n00:01:32.548 --> 00:01:36.110\nand Sandy made me realize that our devices\n\n00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.376\nand their connectivity matter to us\n\n00:01:38.376 --> 00:01:42.894\nright up there with food and shelter.\n\n00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:46.211\nThe self as we once knew it no longer exists,\n\n00:01:46.211 --> 00:01:48.703\nand I think that an abstract, digital universe\n\n00:01:48.703 --> 00:01:51.228\nhas become a part of our identity,\n\n00:01:51.228 --> 00:01:55.480\nand I want to talk to you about what I think that means.\n\n00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.323\nI'm a novelist, and I'm interested in the self\n\n00:01:58.323 --> 00:02:00.792\nbecause the self and fiction have a lot in common.\n\n00:02:00.792 --> 00:02:04.109\nThey're both stories, interpretations.\n\n00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.562\nYou and I can experience things without a story.\n\n00:02:06.562 --> 00:02:08.644\nWe might run up the stairs too quickly\n\n00:02:08.644 --> 00:02:10.331\nand we might get breathless.\n\n00:02:10.331 --> 00:02:12.861\nBut the larger sense that we have of our lives,\n\n00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:16.221\nthe slightly more abstract one, is indirect.\n\n00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:19.341\nOur story of our life is based on direct experience,\n\n00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:21.235\nbut it's embellished.\n\n00:02:21.235 --> 00:02:24.083\nA novel needs scene after scene to build,\n\n00:02:24.083 --> 00:02:27.231\nand the story of our life needs an arc as well.\n\n00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:29.922\nIt needs months and years.\n\n00:02:29.922 --> 00:02:32.940\nDiscrete moments from our lives are its chapters.\n\n00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.530\nBut the story is not about these chapters.\n\n00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.475\nIt's the whole book.\n\n00:02:37.475 --> 00:02:40.818\nIt's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness,\n\n00:02:40.818 --> 00:02:42.997\nthe victories and the disappointments,\n\n00:02:42.997 --> 00:02:45.202\nbut it's because how because of these,\n\n00:02:45.202 --> 00:02:48.355\nand sometimes, more importantly, in spite of these,\n\n00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:50.450\nwe find our place in the world\n\n00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.530\nand we change it and we change ourselves.\n\n00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.923\nOur story, therefore, needs two dimensions of time:\n\n00:02:56.923 --> 00:02:59.938\na long arc of time that is our lifespan,\n\n00:02:59.938 --> 00:03:02.441\nand the timeframe of direct experience\n\n00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:03.894\nthat is the moment.\n\n00:03:03.894 --> 00:03:06.024\nNow the self that experiences directly\n\n00:03:06.024 --> 00:03:07.925\ncan only exist in the moment,\n\n00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:10.687\nbut the one that narrates needs several moments,\n\n00:03:10.687 --> 00:03:12.801\na whole sequence of them,\n\n00:03:12.801 --> 00:03:15.046\nand that's why our full sense of self\n\n00:03:15.046 --> 00:03:17.978\nneeds both immersive experience\n\n00:03:17.978 --> 00:03:20.423\nand the flow of time.\n\n00:03:20.423 --> 00:03:23.572\nNow, the flow of time is embedded in everything,\n\n00:03:23.572 --> 00:03:26.140\nin the erosion of a grain of sand,\n\n00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.932\nin the

it,\n\n00:08:10.113 --> 00:08:12.290\nthe challenge is to live in two streams of time\n\n00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.234\nthat are parallel and almost simultaneous.\n\n00:08:15.234 --> 00:08:19.334\nHow does one live inside distraction?\n\n00:08:19.334 --> 00:08:21.284\nWe might think that those younger than us,\n\n00:08:21.284 --> 00:08:24.898\nthose who are born into this, will adapt more naturally.\n\n00:08:24.898 --> 00:08:28.036\nPossibly, but I remember my childhood.\n\n00:08:28.036 --> 00:08:29.740\nI remember my grandfather revising\n\n00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.002\nthe capitals of the world with me.\n\n00:08:32.002 --> 00:08:34.752\nBuda and Pest were separated by the Danube,\n\n00:08:34.752 --> 00:08:37.527\nand Vienna had a Spanish riding school.\n\n00:08:37.527 --> 00:08:40.426\nIf I were a child today, I could easily learn this information\n\n00:08:40.426 --> 00:08:42.591\nwith apps and hyperlinks,\n\n00:08:42.591 --> 00:08:44.502\nbut it really wouldn't be the same,\n\n00:08:44.502 --> 00:08:46.782\nbecause much later, I went to Vienna,\n\n00:08:46.782 --> 00:08:48.750\nand I went to the Spanish riding school,\n\n00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:52.115\nand I could feel my grandfather right beside me.\n\n00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:54.685\nNight after night, he took me up on the terrace,\n\n00:08:54.685 --> 00:08:57.463\non his shoulders, and pointed out Jupiter\n\n00:08:57.463 --> 00:09:00.691\nand Saturn and the Great Bear to me.\n\n00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:03.386\nAnd even here, when I look at the Great Bear,\n\n00:09:03.386 --> 00:09:06.142\nI get back that feeling of being a child,\n\n00:09:06.142 --> 00:09:08.520\nhanging onto his head and trying to balance myself\n\n00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.740\non his shoulder,\n\n00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.940\nand I can get back that feeling of being a child again.\n\n00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.407\nWhat I had with my grandfather was wrapped\n\n00:09:16.407 --> 00:09:19.649\nso often in information and knowledge and fact,\n\n00:09:19.649 --> 00:09:21.673\nbut it was about so much more\n\n00:09:21.673 --> 00:09:25.463\nthan information or knowledge or fact.\n\n00:09:25.463 -->

00:09:36.547\nand some of it becomes hard to forget,\n\n00:09:36.547 --> 00:09:39.151\neven as the current moment\n\n00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:41.770\nis increasingly unmemorable.\n\n00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.510\nWe want to clutch, and we are left instead\n\n00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.973\nclutching at a series of static moments.\n\n00:09:46.973 --> 00:09:49.679\nThey're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them.\n\n00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:52.472\nBy archiving everything, we think that we can store it,\n\n00:09:52.472 --> 00:09:54.437\nbut time is not data.\n\n00:09:54.437 --> 00:09:56.570\nIt cannot be stored.\n\n00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.586\nYou and I know exactly what it means like\n\n00:09:58.586 --> 00:10:00.490\nto be truly present in a moment.\n\n00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:01.707\nIt might have happened while we were\n\n00:10:01.707 --> 00:10:03.466\nplaying an instrument,\n\n00:10:03.466 --> 00:10:05.314\nor looking into the eyes of someone we've known\n\n00:10:05.314 --> 00:10:07.498\nfor a very long time.\n\n00:10:07.498 --> 00:10:10.529\nAt such moments, our selves are complete.\n\n00:10:10.529 --> 00:10:12.597\nThe self that lives in the long narrative arc\n\n00:10:12.597 --> 00:10:14.680\nand the self that experiences the moment\n\n00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.072\nbecome one.\n\n00:10:16.072 --> 00:10:18.014\nThe present encapsulates the past\n\n00:10:18.014 --> 00:10:20.445\nand a promise for the future.\n\n00:10:20.445 --> 00:10:22.413\nThe present joins a flow of time\n\n00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:24.656\nfrom before and after.\n\n00:10:24.656 --> 00:10:28.213\nI first experienced these feelings with my grandmother.\n\n00:10:28.213 --> 00:10:30.552\nI wanted to learn to skip, and she found an old rope\n\n00:10:30.552 --> 00:10:31.904\nand she tucked up her sari\n\n00:10:31.904 --> 00:10:33.632\nand she jumped over it.\n\n00:10:33.632 --> 00:10:36.286\nI wanted to learn to cook, and she kept me in the kitchen,\n\n00:10:36.286 --> 00:10:40.394\ncutting, cubing and chopping for a whole month.\n\n00:10:40.394 --> 00:10:42.801\nMy grandmother taught me that things happen\n\n00:10:42.801 --> 00:10:46.522\nin the time they take, that time can't be fought,\n\n00:10:46.522 --> 00:10:48.355\nand because it will pass and it will move,\n\n00:10:48.355 --> 00:10:51.469\nwe owe the present moment our full attention.\n\n00:10:51.469 --> 00:10:54.113\nAttention is time.\n\n00:10:54.113 --> 00:10:56.296\nOne of my yoga instructors once said\n\n00:10:56.296 --> 00:10:58.539\nthat love is attention,\n\n00:10:58.539 --> 00:11:00.373\nand definitely from my grandmother,\n\n00:11:00.373 --> 00:11:04.699\nlove and attention were one and the same thing.\n\n00:11:04.699 --> 00:11:07.282\nThe digital world cannibalizes time,\n\n00:11:07.282 --> 00:11:10.662\nand in doing so, I want to suggest\n\n00:11:10.662 --> 00:11:12.336\nthat what it threatens\n\n00:11:12.336 --> 00:11:14.766\nis the completeness of ourselves.\n\n00:11:14.766 --> 00:11:17.124\nIt threatens the flow of love.\n\n00:11:17.124 --> 00:11:19.145\nBut we don't need to let it.\n\n00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:20.613\nWe can choose otherwise.\n\n00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:22.690\nWe've seen again and again\n\n00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:24.920\njust how creative technology can be,\n\n00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.160\nand in our lives and in our actions,\n\n00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.149\nwe can choose those solutions and those innovations\n\n00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:34.257\nand those moments that restore the flow of time\n\n00:11:34.257 --> 00:11:37.878\ninstead of fragmenting it.\n\n00:11:37.878 --> 00:11:40.458\nWe can slow down and we can tune in\n\n00:11:40.458 --> 00:11:43.130\nto the ebb and flow of time.\n\n00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:47.078\nWe can choose to take time back.\n\n00:11:47.078 --> 00:11:49.278\nThank you.\n\n00:11:49.278 --> 00:11:53.278\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why stay in Chernobyl? Because it's home.", "duration": "531", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/holly_morris_why_stay_in_chernobyl_because_it_s_home", "transcript": "Three years ago, I was standing about a hundred yards from Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four. My Geiger counter dosimeter, which measures radiation, was going berserk, and the closer I got, the more frenetic it became, and frantic. My God.I was there covering the 25th anniversary of the world's worst nuclear accident, as you can see by the look on my face, reluctantly so, but with good reason, because the nuclear fire that burned for 11 days back in 1986 released 400 times as much radiation as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, and the sarcophagus, which is the covering over reactor number four, which was hastily built 27 years ago, now sits cracked and rusted and leaking radiation.So I was filming. I just wanted to get the job done and get out of there fast. But then, I looked into the distance, and I saw some smoke coming from a farmhouse, and I'm thinking, who could be living here? I mean, after all, Chernobyl's soil, water and air, are among the most highly contaminated on Earth, and the reactor sits at the the center of a tightly regulated exclusion zone, or dead zone, and it's a nuclear police state, complete with border guards. You have to have dosimeter at all times, clicking away, you have to have a government minder, and there's draconian radiation rules and constant contamination monitoring. The point being, no human being should be living anywhere near the dead zone. But they are.It turns out an unlikely community of some 200 people are living inside the zone. They're called self-settlers. And almost all of them are women, the men having shorter lifespans in part due to overuse of alcohol, cigarettes, if not radiation. Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated at the time of the accident, but not everybody accepted that fate. The women in the zone, now in their 70s and 80s, are the last survivors of a group who defied authorities and, it would seem, common sense, and returned to their ancestral homes inside the zone. They did so illegally. As one woman put it to a soldier who was trying to evacuate her for a second time, \"Shoot me and dig the grave. Otherwise, I'm going home.\"Now why would they return to such deadly soil? I mean, were they unaware of the risks or crazy enough to ignore them, or both? The thing is, they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently.Now around Chernobyl, there are scattered ghost villages, eerily silent, strangely charming, bucolic, totally contaminated. Many were bulldozed under at the time of the accident, but a few are left like this, kind of silent vestiges to the tragedy. Others have a few residents in them, one or two \"babushkas,\" or \"babas,\" which are the Russian and Ukrainian words for grandmother. Another village might have six or seven residents. So this is the strange demographic of the zone \u2014 isolated alone together.And when I made my way to that piping chimney I'd seen in the distance, I saw Hanna Zavorotnya, and I met her. She's the self-declared mayor of Kapavati village, population eight. (Laughter) And she said to me, when I asked her the obvious, \"Radiation doesn't scare me. Starvation does.\"And you have to remember, these women have survived the worst atrocities of the 20th century. Stalin's enforced famines of the 1930s, the Holodomor, killed millions of Ukrainians, and they faced the Nazis in the '40s, who came through slashing, burning, raping, and in fact many of these women were shipped to Germany as forced labor. So when a couple decades into Soviet rule, Chernobyl happened, they were unwilling to flee in the face of an enemy that was invisible. So they returned to their villages and are told they're going to get sick and die soon, but five happy years, their logic goes, is better than 10 stuck in a high rise on the outskirts of Kiev, separated from the graves of their mothers and fathers and babies, the whisper of stork wings on a spring afternoon. For them, environmental contamination may not be the worst sort of devastation. It turns out this holds true for other species as well. Wild boar, lynx, moose, they've all returned to the region in force, the very real, very negative effects of radiation being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus of humans. The dead zone, it turns out, is full of life.And there is a kind of heroic resilience, a kind of plain-spoken pragmatism to those who start their day at 5 a.m. pulling water from a well and end it at midnight poised to beat a bucket with a stick and scare off wild boar that might mess with their potatoes, their only company a bit of homemade moonshine vodka. And there's a patina of simple defiance among them. \"They told us our legs would hurt, and they do. So what?\" I mean, what about their health? The benefits of hardy, physical living, but an environment made toxic by a complicated, little-understood enemy, radiation. It's incredibly difficult to parse. Health studies from the region are conflicting and fraught. The World Health Organization puts the number of Chernobyl-related deaths at 4,000, eventually. Greenpeace and other organizations put that number in the tens of thousands. Now everybody agrees that thyroid cancers are sky high, and that Chernobyl evacuees suffer the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere: higher levels of anxiety, depression, alcoholism, unemployment and, importantly, disrupted social networks.Now, like many of you, I have moved maybe 20, 25 times in my life. Home is a transient concept. I have a deeper connection to my laptop than any bit of soil. So it's hard for us to understand, but home is the entire cosmos of the rural babushka, and connection to the land is palpable. And perhaps because these Ukrainian women were schooled under the Soviets and versed in the Russian poets, aphorisms about these ideas slip from their mouths all the time.\"If you leave, you die.\"\"Those who left are worse off now. They are dying of sadness.\"\"Motherland is motherland. I will never leave.\"What sounds like faith, soft faith, may actually be fact, because the surprising truth \u2014 I mean, there are no studies, but the truth seems to be that these women who returned to their homes and have lived on some of the most radioactive land on Earth for the last 27 years, have actually outlived their counterparts who accepted relocation, by some estimates up to 10 years.How could this be? Here's a theory: Could it be that those ties to ancestral soil, the soft variables reflected in their aphorisms, actually affect longevity? The power of motherland so fundamental to that part of the world seems palliative. Home and community are forces that rival even radiation.Now radiation or not, these women are at the end of their lives. In the next decade, the zone's human residents will be gone, and it will revert to a wild, radioactive place, full only of animals and occasionally daring, flummoxed scientists. But the spirit and existence of the babushkas, whose numbers have been halved in the three years I've known them, will leave us with powerful new templates to think about and grapple with, about the relative nature of risk, about transformative connections to home, and about the magnificent tonic of personal agency and self-determination.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1857, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.358 --> 00:00:15.447\nThree years ago, I was standing about a hundred yards\n\n00:00:15.447 --> 00:00:19.073\nfrom Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four.\n\n00:00:19.073 --> 00:00:22.220\nMy Geiger counter dosimeter, which measures radiation,\n\n00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.808\nwas going berserk,\n\n00:00:23.808 --> 00:00:27.255\nand the closer I got, the more frenetic it became,\n\n00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:30.051\nand frantic.

they run decidedly differently.\n\n00:02:47.077 --> 00:02:50.330\nNow around Chernobyl, there are scattered ghost villages,\n\n00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.661\neerily silent, strangely charming,

are left like this,\n\n00:03:01.756 --> 00:03:05.309\nkind of silent vestiges to the tragedy.\n\n00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:07.620\nOthers have a few residents in them,\n\n00:03:07.620 -->

might have six or seven residents.\n\n00:03:16.357 --> 00:03:19.087\nSo this is the strange demographic of the zone --\n\n00:03:19.087 --> 00:03:21.956\nisolated alone together.\n\n00:03:21.956 -->

Well, I can tell you that, in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature of the Korean school system, also known as pressure cooker, not everyone can do well in that environment. While many people responded in different ways about our education system, my response to the high-pressure environment was making bows with pieces of wood found near my apartment building.Why bows? I'm not quite sure. Perhaps, in the face of constant pressure, my caveman instinct of survival has connected with the bows. If you think about it, the bow has really helped drive human survival since prehistoric times. The area within three kilometers of my home used to be a mulberry forest during the Joseon dynasty, where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves. In order to raise the historical awareness of this fact, the government has planted mulberry trees. The seeds from these trees also have spread by birds here and there nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway that has been built around the 1988 Olympics. The area near these walls, which nobody bothers to pay attention to, had been left free from major intervention, and this is where I first found my treasures.As I fell deeper into bow making, I began to search far and beyond my neighborhood. When I went on school field trips, family vacations, or simply on my way home from extracurricular classes, I wandered around wooded areas and gathered tree branches with the tools that I sneaked inside my school bag. And they would be somethings like saws, knives, sickles and axes that I covered up with a piece of towel. I would bring the branches home, riding buses and subways, barely holding them in my hands.And I did not bring the tools here to Long Beach. Airport security.(Laughter) In the privacy of my room, covered in sawdust, I would saw, trim and polish wood all night long until a bow took shape.One day, I was changing the shape of a bamboo piece and ended up setting the place on fire. Where? The rooftop of my apartment building, a place where 96 families call home. A customer from a department store across from my building called 911, and I ran downstairs to tell my mom with half of my hair burned. I want to take this opportunity to tell my mom, in the audience today: Mom, I was really sorry, and I will be more careful with open fire from now on.My mother had to do a lot of explaining, telling people that her son did not commit a premeditated arson.I also researched extensively on bows around the world. In that process, I tried to combine the different bows from across time and places to create the most effective bow. I also worked with many different types of wood, such as maple, yew and mulberry, and did many shooting experiments in the wooded area near the urban expressway that I mentioned before.The most effective bow for me would be like this.One: Curved tips can maximize the springiness when you draw and shoot the arrow.Two: Belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight, which means more power.Three: Sinew used in the outer layer of the limb for maximum tension storage.And four: Horn used to store energy in compression.After fixing, breaking, redesigning, mending, bending and amending, my ideal bow began to take shape, and when it was finally done, it looked like this. I was so proud of myself for inventing a perfect bow on my own. This is a picture of Korean traditional bows taken from a museum, and see how my bow resembles them. Thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention. (Laughter)Through bowmaking, I came in contact with part of my heritage. Learning the information that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me. You see, I searched far and wide, but never bothered to look close and near. From this realization, I began to take interest in Korean history, which had never inspired me before. In the end, the grass is often greener on my side of the fence, although we don't realize it.Now, I am going to show you how my bow works. And let's see how this one works. This is a bamboo bow, with 45-pound draw weights. (Noise of shooting arrow) (Applause)A bow may function in a simple mechanism, but in order to make a good bow, a great amount of sensitivity is required. You need to console and communicate with the wood material. Each fiber in the wood has its own reason and function for being, and only through cooperation and harmony among them comes a great bow.

For two straight days, the city became an open battlefield between the federal forces and a well-organized group, presumably from the local criminal organization, La Familia Michoacana, or the Michoac\u00e1n family. The citizens didn't only experience incessant gunfire but also explosions and burning trucks used as barricades across the city, so truly like a battlefield. After these two days, and during a particularly intense encounter, it was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana, Nazario Moreno, was killed.In response to this terrifying violence, the mayor of Apatzing\u00e1n decided to call the citizens to a march for peace. The idea was to ask for a softer approach to criminal activity in the state. And so, the day of the scheduled procession, thousands of people showed up. As the mayor was preparing to deliver the speech starting the march, his team noticed that, while half of the participants were appropriately dressed in white, and bearing banners asking for peace, the other half was actually marching in support of the criminal organization and its now-presumed-defunct leader. Shocked, the mayor decided to step aside rather than participate or lead a procession that was ostensibly in support of organized crime. And so his team stepped aside. The two marches joined together, and they continued their path towards the state capital.This story of horrific violence followed by a fumbled approach by federal and local authorities as they tried to engage civil society, who has been very well engaged by a criminal organization, is a perfect metaphor for what's happening in Mexico today, where we see that our current understanding of drug violence and what leads to it is probably at the very least incomplete.If you decided to spend 30 minutes trying to figure out what's going on with drug violence in Mexico by, say, just researching online, the first thing you would find out is that while the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal, there are some that are more and there are some that are much less equal than others, because you will quickly find out that in the past six years anywhere between 60 and 100,000 people have lost their lives in drug-related violence. To put these numbers in perspective, this is eight times larger than the number of casualties in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. It's also shockingly close to the number of people who have died in the Syrian civil war, which is an active civil war. This is happening just south of the border.Now as you're reading, however, you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly become numb to the numbers of deaths, because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers of faceless, nameless dead people. Implicitly or explicitly, there is a narrative that all the people who are dying were somehow involved in the drug trade, and we infer this because they were either tortured or executed in a professional manner, or, most likely, both. And so clearly they were criminals because of the way they died. And so the narrative is that somehow these people got what they were deserved. They were part of the bad guys. And that creates some form of comfort for a lot of people.However, while it's easier to think of us, the citizens, the police, the army, as the good guys, and them, the narcos, the carteles, as the bad guys, if you think about it, the latter are only providing a service to the former. Whether we like it or not, the U.S. is the largest market for illegal substances in the world, accounting for more than half of global demand. It shares thousands of miles of border with Mexico that is its only route of access from the South, and so, as the former dictator of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz, used to say, \"Poor Mexico, so far from God and so close to the United States.\"The U.N. estimates that there are 55 million users of illegal drugs in the United States. Using very, very conservative assumptions, this yields a yearly drug market on the retail side of anywhere between 30 and 150 billion dollars. If we assume that the narcos only have access to the wholesale part, which we know is false, that still leaves you with yearly revenues of anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars. To put these numbers in perspective, Microsoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars. And it so happens that this is a product that, because of its nature, a business model to address this market requires you to guarantee to your producers that their product will be reliably placed in the markets where it is consumed. And the only way to do this, because it's illegal, is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors that are used to transport drugs. Hence the violence. If you look at a map of cartel influence and violence, you will see that it almost perfectly aligns with the most efficient routes of transportation from the south to the north. The only thing that the cartels are doing is that they're trying to protect their business.It's not only a multi-billion dollar market, but it's also a complex one. For example, the coca plant is a fragile plant that can only grow in certain latitudes, and so it means that a business model to address this market requires you to have decentralized, international production, that by the way needs to have good quality control, because people need a good high that is not going to kill them and that is going to be delivered to them when they need it. And so that means they need to secure production and quality control in the south, and you need to ensure that you have efficient and effective distribution channels in the markets where these drugs are consumed. I urge you, but only a little bit, because I don't want to get you in trouble, to just ask around and see how difficult it would be to get whatever drug you want, wherever you want it, whenever you want it, anywhere in the U.S., and some of you may be surprised to know that there are many dealers that offer a service where if you send them a text message, they guarantee delivery of the drug in 30 minutes or less.Think about this for a second. Think about the complexity of the distribution network that I just described. It's very difficult to reconcile this with the image of faceless, ignorant goons that are just shooting each other, very difficult to reconcile.Now, as a business professor, and as any business professor would tell you, an effective organization requires an integrated strategy that includes a good organizational structure, good incentives, a solid identity and good brand management. This leads me to the second thing that you would learn in your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico. Because you would quickly realize, and maybe be confused by the fact, that there are three organizations that are constantly named in the articles. You will hear about Los Zetas, the Knights Templar, which is the new brand for the Familia Michoacana that I spoke about at the beginning, and the Sinaloa Federation. You will read that Los Zetas is this assortment of sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter and they silence the press, and this is somewhat true, or mostly true. But this is the result of a very careful branding and business strategy. You see, Los Zetas is not just this random assortment of individuals, but was actually created by another criminal organization, the Gulf Cartel, that used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico. When that corridor became contested, they decided that they wanted to recruit a professional enforcement arm. So they recruited Los Zetas: an entire unit of elite paratroopers from the Mexican Army. They were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel, so much so that at some point, they decided to just take over the operations, which is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets, because they grow up. Because the Zetas organization was founded in treason, they lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution in the most profitable markets like cocaine, but what they did have, and this is again based on their military origin, was a perfectly structured chain of command with a very clear hierarchy and a very clear promotion path that allowed them to supervise and operate across many, many markets very effectively, which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do. And so because they didn't have access to the more profitable drug markets, this pushed them and gave them the opportunity to diversify into other forms of crime. That includes kidnapping, prostitution, local drug dealing and human trafficking, including of migrants that go from the south to the U.S. So what they currently run is truly and quite literally a franchise business. They focus most of their recruiting on the army, and they very openly advertise for better salaries, better benefits, better promotion paths, not to mention much better food, than what the army can deliver. The way they operate is that when they arrive in a locality, they let people know that they are there, and they go to the most powerful local gang and they say, \"I offer you to be the local representative of the Zeta brand.\" If they agree \u2014 and you don't want to know what happens if they don't \u2014 they train them and they supervise them on how to run the most efficient criminal operation for that town, in exchange for royalties. This kind of business model obviously depends entirely on having a very effective brand of fear, and so Los Zetas carefully stage acts of violence that are spectacular in nature, especially when they arrive first in a city, but again, that's just a brand strategy. I'm not saying they're not violent, but what I am saying is that even though you will read that they are the most violent of all, when you count, when you do the body count, they're actually all the same.In contrast to them, the Knights Templar that arose in Michoac\u00e1n emerged in reaction to the incursion of the Zetas into the state of Michoac\u00e1n. Michoac\u00e1n is a geographically strategic state because it has one of the largest ports in Mexico, and it has very direct routes to the center of Mexico, which then gives you direct access to the U.S. The Knights Templar realized very quickly that they couldn't face the Zetas on violence alone, and so they developed a strategy as a social enterprise. They brand themselves as representative of and protecting of the citizens of Michoac\u00e1n against organized crime. Their brand of social enterprise means that they require a lot of civic engagement, so they invest heavily in providing local services, like dealing with home violence, going after petty criminals, treating addicts, and keeping drugs out of the local markets where they are, and, of course, protecting people from other criminal organizations. Now, they kill a lot of people too, but when they kill them, they provide very careful narratives and descriptions for why they did them, through newspaper insertions, YouTube videos, and billboards that explain that the people who were killed were killed because they represented a threat not to us, as an organization, of course, but to you, as citizens. And so we're actually here to protect you. They, as social enterprises do, have created a moral and ethical code that they advertise around, and they have very strict recruiting practices. And here you have the types of explanations that they provide for some of their actions. They have actually retained access to the profitable drug trade, but the way they do it is, because they control all of Michoac\u00e1n, and they control the Port of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, they leverage that to, for example, trade copper from Michoac\u00e1n that is legally created and legally extracted with illegal ephedrine from China which is a critical precursor for methamphetamines that they produce, and then they have partnerships with larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federation that place their products in the U.S.Finally, the Sinaloa Federation. When you read about them, you will often read about them with an undertone of reverence and admiration, because they are the most integrated and the largest of all the Mexican organizations, and, many people argue, the world. They started as just sort of a transport organization that specialized in smuggling between the U.S. and the Mexican borders, but now they have grown into a truly integrated multinational that has partnerships in production in the south and partnerships in global distribution across the planet. They have cultivated a brand of professionalism, business acumen and innovation. They have designed new drug products and new drug processes. They have designed narco-tunnels that go across the border, and you can see that these are not \"The Shawshank Redemption\" types. They have invented narco-submarines and boats that are not detected by radar. They have invented drones to transport drugs, catapults, you name it. One of the leaders of the Sinaloa Federation actually made it to the Forbes list.[#701 Joaquin Guzman Loera]Like any multinational would, they have specialized and focused only in the most profitable part of the business, which is high-margin drugs like cocaine, heroine, methamphetamines. Like any traditional Latin American multinational would, the way they control their operations is through family ties. When they're entering a new market, they send a family member to supervise it, or, if they're partnering with a new organization, they create a family tie, either through marriages or other types of ties. Like any other multinational would, they protect their brand by outsourcing the more questionable parts of the business model, like for example, when they have to engage in violence against other criminal organizations, they recruit gangs and other smaller players to do the dirty work for them, and they try to separate their operations and their violence and be very discrete about this.To further strengthen their brand, they actually have professional P.R. firms that shape how the press talks about them. They have professional videographers on staff. They have incredibly productive ties with the security organizations on both sides of the border.And so, differences aside, what these three organizations share is on the one hand, a very clear understanding that institutions cannot be imposed from the top, but rather they are built from the bottom up one interaction at a time. They have created extremely coherent structures that they use to show the inconsistencies in government policies.And so what I want you to remember from this talk are three things. The first one is that drug violence is actually the result of a huge market demand and an institutional setup that forces the servicing of this market to necessitate violence to guarantee delivery routes. The second thing I want you to remember is that these are sophisticated, coherent organizations that are business organizations, and analyzing them and treating them as such is probably a much more useful approach. The third thing I want you to remember is that even though we're more comfortable with this idea of \"them,\" a set of bad guys separated from us, we are actually accomplices to them, either through our direct consumption or through our acceptance of the inconsistency between our policies of prohibition and our actual behavior of tolerance or even encouragement of consumption.These organizations service, recruit from, and operate within our communities, so necessarily, they are much more integrated within them than we are comfortable acknowledging. And so to me the question is not whether these dynamics will continue the way they have. We see that the nature of this phenomenon guarantees that they will. The question is whether we are willing to continue our support of a failed strategy based on our stubborn, blissful, voluntary ignorance at the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1859, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:17.251\nIn December of 2010,\n\n00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:19.068\nthe city of Apatzing\u00e1n\n\n00:00:19.068 --> 00:00:22.220\nin the coastal state of Michoac\u00e1n, in Mexico,\n\n00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.590\nawoke to gunfire.\n\n00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.166\nFor two straight days,\n\n00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.584\nthe city became an open battlefield\n\n00:00:28.584 --> 00:00:30.368\nbetween the federal forces\n\n00:00:30.368 --> 00:00:32.037\nand a well-organized group,\n\n00:00:32.037 --> 00:00:34.820\npresumably from the local criminal organization,\n\n00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.192\nLa Familia Michoacana, or the Michoac\u00e1n family.\n\n00:00:38.192 --> 00:00:41.342\nThe citizens didn't only experience incessant gunfire\n\n00:00:41.342 --> 00:00:43.762\nbut also explosions\n\n00:00:43.762 --> 00:00:47.033\nand burning trucks used as barricades across the city,\n\n00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:49.050\nso truly like a battlefield.\n\n00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.580\nAfter these two days,\n\n00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.385\nand during a particularly intense encounter,\n\n00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:55.952\nit was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana,\n\n00:00:55.952 --> 00:00:58.457\nNazario Moreno, was killed.\n\n00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:00.468\nIn response to this terrifying violence,\n\n00:01:00.468 --> 00:01:02.467\nthe mayor of Apatzing\u00e1n\n\n00:01:02.467 --> 00:01:04.767\ndecided to call the citizens to a march for peace.\n\n00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:08.114\nThe idea was to ask for a softer approach\n\n00:01:08.114 --> 00:01:10.532\nto criminal activity in the state.\n\n00:01:10.532 --> 00:01:13.726\nAnd so, the day of the scheduled procession,\n\n00:01:13.726 --> 00:01:15.580\nthousands of people showed up.\n\n00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.274\nAs the mayor was preparing to deliver\n\n00:01:17.274 --> 00:01:19.385\nthe speech starting the march,\n\n00:01:19.385 --> 00:01:20.887\nhis team noticed\n\n00:01:20.887 --> 00:01:24.045\nthat, while half of the participants\n\n00:01:24.045 --> 00:01:25.720\nwere appropriately dressed in white,\n\n00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.560\nand bearing banners asking for peace,\n\n00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.729\nthe other half was actually marching\n\n00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.820\nin support of the criminal organization\n\n00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.004\nand its now-presumed-defunct leader.\n\n00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:40.073\nShocked, the mayor decided to step aside\n\n00:01:40.073 --> 00:01:42.084\nrather than participate or lead a procession\n\n00:01:42.084 --> 00:01:45.469\nthat was ostensibly in support of organized crime.\n\n00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:47.711\nAnd so his team stepped aside.\n\n00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:49.787\nThe two marches joined together,\n\n00:01:49.787 --> 00:01:52.792\nand they continued their path\n\n00:01:52.792 --> 00:01:55.402\ntowards the state capital.\n\n00:01:55.402 --> 00:02:00.213\nThis story of horrific violence\n\n00:02:00.213 --> 00:02:02.410\nfollowed by a fumbled approach\n\n00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.605\nby federal and local authorities as they tried\n\n00:02:04.605 --> 00:02:06.028\nto engage civil society,\n\n00:02:06.028 --> 00:02:09.384\nwho has been very well engaged by a criminal organization,\n\n00:02:09.384 --> 00:02:12.848\nis a perfect metaphor for what's happening in Mexico today,\n\n00:02:12.848 --> 00:02:16.197\nwhere we see that our current understanding\n\n00:02:16.197 --> 00:02:18.565\nof drug violence and what leads to it\n\n00:02:18.565 --> 00:02:21.167\nis probably at the very least incomplete.\n\n00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:23.170\nIf you decided to spend 30 minutes trying\n\n00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.200\nto figure out what's going on with drug violence in Mexico\n\n00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.839\nby, say, just researching online,\n\n00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:29.680\nthe first thing you would find out is that\n\n00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.647\nwhile the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal,\n\n00:02:33.647 --> 00:02:34.766\nthere are some that are more\n\n00:02:34.766 --> 00:02:38.125\nand there are some that are much less equal than others,\n\n00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:39.376\nbecause you will quickly find out\n\n00:02:39.376 --> 00:02:41.080\nthat in the past six years\n\n00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.228\nanywhere between 60 and 100,000 people\n\n00:02:43.228 --> 00:02:46.786\nhave lost their lives in drug-related violence.\n\n00:02:46.786 --> 00:02:48.533\nTo put these numbers in perspective,\n\n00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:51.349\nthis is eight times larger than the number of casualties\n\n00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.870\nin the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.\n\n00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.374\nIt's also shockingly close to the number of people\n\n00:02:58.374 --> 00:03:00.900\nwho have died in the Syrian civil war,\n\n00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.113\nwhich is an active civil war.\n\n00:03:03.113 --> 00:03:06.309\nThis is happening just south of the border.\n\n00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:07.913\nNow as you're reading, however,\n\n00:03:07.913 --> 00:03:09.596\nyou will be maybe surprised that you will quickly\n\n00:03:09.596 --> 00:03:11.632\nbecome numb to the numbers of deaths,\n\n00:03:11.632 --> 00:03:15.318\nbecause you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers\n\n00:03:15.318 --> 00:03:18.911\nof faceless, nameless dead people.\n\n00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:21.635\nImplicitly or explicitly, there is a narrative\n\n00:03:21.635 --> 00:03:23.470\nthat all the people who are dying\n\n00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.326\nwere somehow involved in the drug trade,\n\n00:03:26.326 --> 00:03:29.922\nand we infer this because they were either tortured\n\n00:03:29.922 --> 00:03:32.083\nor executed in a professional manner,\n\n00:03:32.083 --> 00:03:33.735\nor, most likely, both.\n\n00:03:33.735 --> 00:03:35.716\nAnd so clearly they were criminals\n\n00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:38.331\nbecause of the way they died.\n\n00:03:38.331 --> 00:03:40.894\nAnd so the narrative is that somehow these people\n\n00:03:40.894 --> 00:03:42.137\ngot what they were deserved.\n\n00:03:42.137 --> 00:03:44.588\nThey were part of the bad guys.\n\n00:03:44.588 --> 00:03:47.136\nAnd that creates some form of comfort\n\n00:03:47.136 --> 00:03:48.768\nfor a lot of people.\n\n00:03:48.768 --> 00:03:51.732\nHowever, while it's easier to think\n\n00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:55.717\nof us, the citizens, the police, the army,\n\n00:03:55.717 --> 00:03:59.289\nas the good guys, and them, the narcos,\n\n00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:02.583\nthe carteles, as the bad guys,\n\n00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:03.749\nif you think about it,\n\n00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:07.557\nthe latter are only providing a service to the former.\n\n00:04:07.557 --> 00:04:09.672\nWhether we like it or not,\n\n00:04:09.672 --> 00:04:12.333\nthe U.S. is the largest market\n\n00:04:12.333 --> 00:04:13.951\nfor illegal substances in the world,\n\n00:04:13.951 --> 00:04:17.005\naccounting for more than half of global demand.\n\n00:04:17.005 --> 00:04:20.265\nIt shares thousands of miles of border with Mexico\n\n00:04:20.265 --> 00:04:23.383\nthat is its only route of access from the South,\n\n00:04:23.383 --> 00:04:26.438\nand so, as the former dictator of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz,\n\n00:04:26.438 --> 00:04:29.167\nused to say, \"Poor Mexico,\n\n00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:35.359\nso far from God and so close to the United States.\"\n\n00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:38.208\nThe U.N. estimates that there are 55 million users\n\n00:04:38.208 --> 00:04:40.675\nof illegal drugs in the United States.\n\n00:04:40.675 --> 00:04:43.101\nUsing very, very conservative assumptions,\n\n00:04:43.101 --> 00:04:46.198\nthis yields a yearly drug market on the retail side\n\n00:04:46.198 --> 00:04:48.981\nof anywhere between 30 and 150 billion dollars.\n\n00:04:48.981 --> 00:04:51.650\nIf we assume that the narcos only have access\n\n00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.374\nto the wholesale part, which we know is false,\n\n00:04:54.374 --> 00:04:56.715\nthat still leaves you with yearly revenues\n\n00:04:56.715 --> 00:05:01.233\nof anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars.\n\n00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:03.149\nTo put these numbers in perspective,\n\n00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:07.942\nMicrosoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars.\n\n00:05:07.942 --> 00:05:10.448\nAnd it so happens that this is a product that,\n\n00:05:10.448 --> 00:05:13.423\nbecause of its nature, a business model\n\n00:05:13.423 --> 00:05:16.177\nto address this market requires you\n\n00:05:16.177 --> 00:05:18.306\nto guarantee to your producers\n\n00:05:18.306 --> 00:05:20.924\nthat their product will be reliably placed\n\n00:05:20.924 --> 00:05:23.041\nin the markets where it is consumed.\n\n00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:26.598\nAnd the only way to do this, because it's illegal,\n\n00:05:26.598 --> 00:05:29.608\nis to have absolute control of the geographic corridors\n\n00:05:29.608 --> 00:05:31.907\nthat are used to transport drugs.\n\n00:05:31.907 --> 00:05:34.424\nHence the violence.\n\n00:05:34.424 --> 00:05:37.456\nIf you look at a map of cartel influence and violence,\n\n00:05:37.456 --> 00:05:39.576\nyou will see that it almost perfectly aligns\n\n00:05:39.576 --> 00:05:41.360\nwith the most efficient routes of transportation\n\n00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.255\nfrom the south to the north.\n\n00:05:43.255 --> 00:05:44.411\nThe only thing that the cartels are doing\n\n00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:47.162\nis that they're trying to protect their business.\n\n00:05:47.162 --> 00:05:49.587\nIt's not only a multi-billion dollar market,\n\n00:05:49.587 --> 00:05:51.682\nbut it's also a complex one.\n\n00:05:51.682 --> 00:05:54.391\nFor example, the coca plant is a fragile plant\n\n00:05:54.406 --> 00:05:56.722\nthat can only grow in certain latitudes,\n\n00:05:56.722 --> 00:05:58.458\nand so it means that a business model\n\n00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:00.193\nto address this market requires you to have\n\n00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:02.714\ndecentralized, international production,\n\n00:06:02.714 --> 00:06:05.258\nthat by the way needs to have good quality control,\n\n00:06:05.258 --> 00:06:07.759\nbecause people need a good high\n\n00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:09.344\nthat is not going to kill them\n\n00:06:09.344 --> 00:06:12.206\nand that is going to be delivered to them when they need it.\n\n00:06:12.206 --> 00:06:14.199\nAnd so that means they need to secure\n\n00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.101\nproduction and quality control in the south,\n\n00:06:17.101 --> 00:06:19.108\nand you need to ensure that you have\n\n00:06:19.108 --> 00:06:21.600\nefficient and effective distribution channels\n\n00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.039\nin the markets where these drugs are consumed.\n\n00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:26.630\nI urge you, but only a little bit,\n\n00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.841\nbecause I don't want to get you in trouble,\n\n00:06:28.841 --> 00:06:32.127\nto just ask around and see how difficult it would be\n\n00:06:32.127 --> 00:06:34.984\nto get whatever drug you want, wherever you want it,\n\n00:06:34.984 --> 00:06:37.929\nwhenever you want it, anywhere in the U.S.,\n\n00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:40.742\nand some of you may be surprised to know\n\n00:06:40.742 --> 00:06:42.756\nthat there are many dealers that offer a service\n\n00:06:42.756 --> 00:06:44.580\nwhere if you send them a text message,\n\n00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.285\nthey guarantee delivery of the drug\n\n00:06:46.285 --> 00:06:49.167\nin 30 minutes or less.\n\n00:06:49.167 --> 00:06:51.588\nThink about this for a second.\n\n00:06:51.588 --> 00:06:53.319\nThink about the complexity\n\n00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:56.719\nof the distribution network that I just described.\n\n00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:59.217\nIt's very difficult to reconcile this\n\n00:06:59.217 --> 00:07:03.339\nwith the image of faceless, ignorant goons\n\n00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:05.944\nthat are just shooting each other,\n\n00:07:05.944 --> 00:07:07.632\nvery difficult to reconcile.\n\n00:07:07.632 --> 00:07:10.961\nNow, as a business professor, and as any business professor would tell you,\n\n00:07:10.961 --> 00:07:13.636\nan effective organization requires\n\n00:07:13.636 --> 00:07:15.545\nan integrated strategy that includes\n\n00:07:15.545 --> 00:07:18.418\na good organizational structure, good incentives,\n\n00:07:18.418 --> 00:07:21.410\na solid identity and good brand management.\n\n00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.545\nThis leads me to the second thing that you would learn\n\n00:07:23.545 --> 00:07:26.445\nin your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico.\n\n00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:28.007\nBecause you would quickly realize,\n\n00:07:28.007 --> 00:07:29.670\nand maybe be confused by the fact,\n\n00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:30.907\nthat there are three organizations\n\n00:07:30.907 --> 00:07:34.442\nthat are constantly named in the articles.\n\n00:07:34.442 --> 00:07:36.516\nYou will hear about Los Zetas,\n\n00:07:36.516 --> 00:07:38.487\nthe Knights Templar, which is the new brand\n\n00:07:38.487 --> 00:07:41.345\nfor the Familia Michoacana that I spoke about at the beginning,\n\n00:07:41.345 --> 00:07:43.719\nand the Sinaloa Federation.\n\n00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:46.510\nYou will read that Los Zetas is this assortment\n\n00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:50.865\nof sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter\n\n00:07:50.865 --> 00:07:52.991\nand they silence the press,\n\n00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:56.365\nand this is somewhat true, or mostly true.\n\n00:07:56.365 --> 00:08:00.444\nBut this is the result of a very careful branding\n\n00:08:00.444 --> 00:08:02.245\nand business strategy.\n\n00:08:02.245 --> 00:08:04.414\nYou see, Los Zetas is not just\n\n00:08:04.414 --> 00:08:06.214\nthis random assortment of individuals,\n\n00:08:06.214 --> 00:08:09.869\nbut was actually created by another criminal organization, the Gulf Cartel,\n\n00:08:09.869 --> 00:08:12.881\nthat used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico.\n\n00:08:12.881 --> 00:08:15.295\nWhen that corridor became contested, they decided\n\n00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:17.085\nthat they wanted to recruit\n\n00:08:17.085 --> 00:08:19.916\na professional enforcement arm.\n\n00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:23.525\nSo they recruited Los Zetas:\n\n00:08:23.525 --> 00:08:26.283\nan entire unit of elite paratroopers\n\n00:08:26.283 --> 00:08:29.300\nfrom the Mexican Army.\n\n00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.006\nThey were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel,\n\n00:08:33.006 --> 00:08:34.894\nso much so that at some point, they decided\n\n00:08:34.894 --> 00:08:37.387\nto just take over the operations,\n\n00:08:37.387 --> 00:08:41.181\nwhich is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets,\n\n00:08:41.181 --> 00:08:43.822\nbecause they grow up.\n\n00:08:43.822 --> 00:08:47.518\nBecause the Zetas organization was founded in treason,\n\n00:08:47.518 --> 00:08:50.454\nthey lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution\n\n00:08:50.454 --> 00:08:52.661\nin the most profitable markets like cocaine,\n\n00:08:52.661 --> 00:08:53.951\nbut what they did have,\n\n00:08:53.951 --> 00:08:56.411\nand this is again based on their military origin,\n\n00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:59.258\nwas a perfectly structured chain of command\n\n00:08:59.258 --> 00:09:01.883\nwith a very clear hierarchy\n\n00:09:01.883 --> 00:09:05.947\nand a very clear promotion path that allowed them\n\n00:09:05.947 --> 00:09:09.769\nto supervise and operate across many, many markets\n\n00:09:09.769 --> 00:09:11.411\nvery effectively,\n\n00:09:11.411 --> 00:09:15.210\nwhich is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do.\n\n00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:16.499\nAnd so because they didn't have access\n\n00:09:16.499 --> 00:09:18.834\nto the more profitable drug markets,\n\n00:09:18.834 --> 00:09:20.507\nthis pushed them and gave them the opportunity\n\n00:09:20.507 --> 00:09:24.005\nto diversify into other forms of crime.\n\n00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:28.060\nThat includes kidnapping, prostitution,\n\n00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.241\nlocal drug dealing and human trafficking,\n\n00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:34.197\nincluding of migrants that go from the south to the U.S.\n\n00:09:34.197 --> 00:09:38.445\nSo what they currently run is truly\n\n00:09:38.445 --> 00:09:42.017\nand quite literally a franchise business.\n\n00:09:42.017 --> 00:09:45.848\nThey focus most of their recruiting on the army,\n\n00:09:45.848 --> 00:09:48.925\nand they very openly advertise for better salaries,\n\n00:09:48.925 --> 00:09:51.623\nbetter benefits, better promotion paths,\n\n00:09:51.623 --> 00:09:53.271\nnot to mention much better food,\n\n00:09:53.271 --> 00:09:55.978\nthan what the army can deliver.\n\n00:09:55.978 --> 00:09:57.847\nThe way they operate is that\n\n00:09:57.847 --> 00:09:59.752\nwhen they arrive in a locality,\n\n00:09:59.752 --> 00:10:01.503\nthey let people know that they are there,\n\n00:10:01.503 --> 00:10:04.573\nand they go to the most powerful local gang\n\n00:10:04.573 --> 00:10:06.813\nand they say, \"I offer you\n\n00:10:06.813 --> 00:10:10.002\nto be the local representative of the Zeta brand.\"\n\n00:10:10.002 --> 00:10:11.875\nIf they agree -- and you don't want to know\n\n00:10:11.875 --> 00:10:13.618\nwhat happens if they don't --\n\n00:10:13.618 --> 00:10:15.305\nthey train them and they supervise them\n\n00:10:15.305 --> 00:10:18.632\non how to run the most efficient criminal operation\n\n00:10:18.632 --> 00:10:22.133\nfor that town, in exchange for royalties.\n\n00:10:22.133 --> 00:10:24.039\nThis kind of business model obviously depends\n\n00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:26.436\nentirely on having a very effective brand of fear,\n\n00:10:26.436 --> 00:10:28.809\nand so Los Zetas\n\n00:10:28.809 --> 00:10:31.102\ncarefully stage acts of violence\n\n00:10:31.102 --> 00:10:33.035\nthat are spectacular in nature,\n\n00:10:33.035 --> 00:10:35.835\nespecially when they arrive first in a city,\n\n00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:39.069\nbut again, that's just a brand strategy.\n\n00:10:39.069 --> 00:10:40.968\nI'm not saying they're not violent,\n\n00:10:40.968 --> 00:10:42.911\nbut what I am saying is that even though you will read\n\n00:10:42.911 --> 00:10:44.774\nthat they are the most violent of all,\n\n00:10:44.774 --> 00:10:47.737\nwhen you count, when you do the body count,\n\n00:10:47.737 --> 00:10:51.509\nthey're actually all the same.\n\n00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:54.597\nIn contrast to them, the Knights Templar\n\n00:10:54.597 --> 00:10:56.437\nthat arose in Michoac\u00e1n\n\n00:10:56.437 --> 00:10:59.044\nemerged in reaction to the incursion\n\n00:10:59.044 --> 00:11:01.579\nof the Zetas into the state of Michoac\u00e1n.\n\n00:11:01.579 --> 00:11:04.496\nMichoac\u00e1n is a geographically strategic state\n\n00:11:04.496 --> 00:11:06.499\nbecause it has one of the largest ports in Mexico,\n\n00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:09.090\nand it has very direct routes to the center of Mexico,\n\n00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:12.156\nwhich then gives you direct access to the U.S.\n\n00:11:12.156 --> 00:11:13.695\nThe Knights Templar realized very quickly\n\n00:11:13.695 --> 00:11:17.203\nthat they couldn't face the Zetas on violence alone,\n\n00:11:17.203 --> 00:11:19.560\nand so they developed a strategy\n\n00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.339\nas a social enterprise.\n\n00:11:22.339 --> 00:11:25.339\nThey brand themselves as representative of\n\n00:11:25.339 --> 00:11:27.995\nand protecting of the citizens of Michoac\u00e1n\n\n00:11:27.995 --> 00:11:30.293\nagainst organized crime.\n\n00:11:30.293 --> 00:11:32.024\nTheir brand of social enterprise means\n\n00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:34.075\nthat they require a lot of civic engagement,\n\n00:11:34.075 --> 00:11:38.241\nso they invest heavily in providing local services,\n\n00:11:38.241 --> 00:11:41.739\nlike dealing with home violence,\n\n00:11:41.739 --> 00:11:45.515\ngoing after petty criminals, treating addicts,\n\n00:11:45.515 --> 00:11:48.293\nand keeping drugs out of the local markets\n\n00:11:48.293 --> 00:11:50.773\nwhere they are,\n\n00:11:50.773 --> 00:11:52.392\nand, of course, protecting people\n\n00:11:52.392 --> 00:11:54.883\nfrom other criminal organizations.\n\n00:11:54.883 --> 00:11:57.914\nNow, they kill a lot of people too,\n\n00:11:57.914 --> 00:12:00.011\nbut when they kill them,\n\n00:12:00.026 --> 00:12:02.926\nthey provide very careful narratives and descriptions\n\n00:12:02.926 --> 00:12:04.178\nfor why they did them,\n\n00:12:04.178 --> 00:12:08.141\nthrough newspaper insertions, YouTube videos,\n\n00:12:08.141 --> 00:12:10.607\nand billboards that explain that the people who were killed\n\n00:12:10.607 --> 00:12:12.935\nwere killed because they represented a threat\n\n00:12:12.935 --> 00:12:14.791\nnot to us, as an organization, of course,\n\n00:12:14.791 --> 00:12:16.727\nbut to you, as citizens.\n\n00:12:16.727 --> 00:12:19.183\nAnd so we're actually here to protect you.\n\n00:12:19.183 --> 00:12:21.747\nThey, as social enterprises do,\n\n00:12:21.747 --> 00:12:23.247\nhave created a moral and ethical code\n\n00:12:23.247 --> 00:12:25.616\nthat they advertise around,\n\n00:12:25.616 --> 00:12:28.754\nand they have very strict recruiting practices.\n\n00:12:28.754 --> 00:12:30.577\nAnd here you have the types of explanations\n\n00:12:30.577 --> 00:12:34.518\nthat they provide for some of their actions.\n\n00:12:34.518 --> 00:12:36.414\nThey have actually retained access\n\n00:12:36.414 --> 00:12:38.714\nto the profitable drug trade,\n\n00:12:38.714 --> 00:12:40.924\nbut the way they do it is, because they control all of Michoac\u00e1n,\n\n00:12:40.924 --> 00:12:43.067\nand they control the Port of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas,\n\n00:12:43.067 --> 00:12:44.869\nthey leverage that to, for example,\n\n00:12:44.869 --> 00:12:48.426\ntrade copper from Michoac\u00e1n that is legally created\n\n00:12:48.426 --> 00:12:49.826\nand legally extracted\n\n00:12:49.826 --> 00:12:51.828\nwith illegal ephedrine from China\n\n00:12:51.828 --> 00:12:55.252\nwhich is a critical precursor for methamphetamines\n\n00:12:55.252 --> 00:12:57.652\nthat they produce, and then they have partnerships\n\n00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:00.190\nwith larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federation\n\n00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.880\nthat place their products in the U.S.\n\n00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.551\nFinally, the Sinaloa Federation.\n\n00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:07.749\nWhen you read about them, you will often read about them\n\n00:13:07.749 --> 00:13:11.449\nwith an undertone of reverence and admiration,\n\n00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:13.365\nbecause they are the most integrated\n\n00:13:13.365 --> 00:13:15.653\nand the largest of all the Mexican organizations,\n\n00:13:15.653 --> 00:13:19.107\nand, many people argue, the world.\n\n00:13:19.107 --> 00:13:22.091\nThey started as just sort of a transport organization\n\n00:13:22.091 --> 00:13:24.165\nthat specialized in smuggling between the U.S.\n\n00:13:24.165 --> 00:13:26.290\nand the Mexican borders,\n\n00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:27.708\nbut now they have grown\n\n00:13:27.708 --> 00:13:31.134\ninto a truly integrated multinational\n\n00:13:31.134 --> 00:13:33.440\nthat has partnerships in production in the south\n\n00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.453\nand partnerships in global distribution\n\n00:13:36.453 --> 00:13:38.947\nacross the planet.\n\n00:13:38.947 --> 00:13:42.277\nThey have cultivated a brand of professionalism,\n\n00:13:42.277 --> 00:13:45.595\nbusiness acumen and innovation.\n\n00:13:45.595 --> 00:13:47.694\nThey have designed new drug products\n\n00:13:47.694 --> 00:13:49.417\nand new drug processes.\n\n00:13:49.417 --> 00:13:51.635\nThey have designed narco-tunnels\n\n00:13:51.635 --> 00:13:53.176\nthat go across the border,\n\n00:13:53.176 --> 00:13:54.991\nand you can see that these are not\n\n00:13:54.991 --> 00:13:58.939\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\" types.\n\n00:13:58.939 --> 00:14:02.635\nThey have invented narco-submarines and boats\n\n00:14:02.635 --> 00:14:05.318\nthat are not detected by radar.\n\n00:14:05.318 --> 00:14:07.881\nThey have invented drones to transport drugs,\n\n00:14:07.881 --> 00:14:11.167\ncatapults, you name it.\n\n00:14:11.167 --> 00:14:13.508\nOne of the leaders of the Sinaloa Federation\n\n00:14:13.508 --> 00:14:15.946\nactually made it to the Forbes list.\n\n00:14:15.946 --> 00:14:17.919\n[#701 Joaquin Guzman Loera]\n\n00:14:17.919 --> 00:14:20.824\nLike any multinational would, they have specialized\n\n00:14:20.824 --> 00:14:23.113\nand focused only in the most profitable part of the business,\n\n00:14:23.113 --> 00:14:25.791\nwhich is high-margin drugs like cocaine,\n\n00:14:25.791 --> 00:14:28.076\nheroine, methamphetamines.\n\n00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:30.649\nLike any traditional Latin American multinational would,\n\n00:14:30.649 --> 00:14:32.390\nthe way they control their operations\n\n00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.172\nis through family ties.\n\n00:14:34.172 --> 00:14:36.117\nWhen they're entering a new market, they send\n\n00:14:36.117 --> 00:14:37.838\na family member to supervise it,\n\n00:14:37.838 --> 00:14:40.655\nor, if they're partnering with a new organization,\n\n00:14:40.655 --> 00:14:42.075\nthey create a family tie,\n\n00:14:42.075 --> 00:14:46.541\neither through marriages or other types of ties.\n\n00:14:46.541 --> 00:14:48.704\nLike any other multinational would,\n\n00:14:48.704 --> 00:14:51.871\nthey protect their brand by outsourcing\n\n00:14:51.871 --> 00:14:54.039\nthe more questionable parts of the business model,\n\n00:14:54.039 --> 00:14:56.082\nlike for example, when they have to engage\n\n00:14:56.082 --> 00:14:58.847\nin violence against other criminal organizations,\n\n00:14:58.847 --> 00:15:02.292\nthey recruit gangs and other smaller players\n\n00:15:02.292 --> 00:15:04.091\nto do the dirty work for them,\n\n00:15:04.091 --> 00:15:05.876\nand they try to separate their operations\n\n00:15:05.876 --> 00:15:09.511\nand their violence and be very discrete about this.\n\n00:15:09.511 --> 00:15:12.007\nTo further strengthen their brand,\n\n00:15:12.007 --> 00:15:14.900\nthey actually have professional P.R. firms\n\n00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.379\nthat shape how the press talks about them.\n\n00:15:17.379 --> 00:15:20.930\nThey have professional videographers on staff.\n\n00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.043\nThey have incredibly productive ties\n\n00:15:23.043 --> 00:15:24.876\nwith the security organizations\n\n00:15:24.876 --> 00:15:28.288\non both sides of the border.\n\n00:15:28.288 --> 00:15:30.889\nAnd so, differences aside,\n\n00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:34.444\nwhat these three organizations share\n\n00:15:34.444 --> 00:15:38.084\nis on the one hand, a very clear understanding\n\n00:15:38.084 --> 00:15:41.168\nthat institutions cannot be imposed from the top,\n\n00:15:41.168 --> 00:15:44.108\nbut rather they are built from the bottom up\n\n00:15:44.108 --> 00:15:47.391\none interaction at a time.\n\n00:15:47.391 --> 00:15:49.812\nThey have created extremely coherent structures\n\n00:15:49.812 --> 00:15:52.646\nthat they use to show the inconsistencies\n\n00:15:52.646 --> 00:15:56.673\nin government policies.\n\n00:15:56.673 --> 00:15:59.160\nAnd so what I want you to remember from this talk\n\n00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.693\nare three things.\n\n00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:03.749\nThe first one is that drug violence\n\n00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:05.626\nis actually the result\n\n00:16:05.626 --> 00:16:08.877\nof a huge market demand\n\n00:16:08.877 --> 00:16:12.527\nand an institutional setup that forces\n\n00:16:12.527 --> 00:16:15.653\nthe servicing of this market to necessitate violence\n\n00:16:15.653 --> 00:16:19.698\nto guarantee delivery routes.\n\n00:16:19.698 --> 00:16:21.624\nThe second thing I want you to remember\n\n00:16:21.624 --> 00:16:23.570\nis that these are sophisticated,\n\n00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.493\ncoherent organizations\n\n00:16:26.493 --> 00:16:28.451\nthat are business organizations,\n\n00:16:28.451 --> 00:16:30.370\nand analyzing them and treating them as such\n\n00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:33.759\nis probably a much more useful approach.\n\n00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:35.895\nThe third thing I want you to remember\n\n00:16:35.895 --> 00:16:37.323\nis that even though we're more comfortable\n\n00:16:37.323 --> 00:16:39.846\nwith this idea of \"them,\"\n\n00:16:39.846 --> 00:16:42.587\na set of bad guys separated from us,\n\n00:16:42.587 --> 00:16:45.564\nwe are actually accomplices to them,\n\n00:16:45.564 --> 00:16:47.953\neither through our direct consumption\n\n00:16:47.953 --> 00:16:52.025\nor through our acceptance of the inconsistency\n\n00:16:52.025 --> 00:16:54.293\nbetween our policies of prohibition\n\n00:16:54.293 --> 00:16:57.241\nand our actual behavior of tolerance\n\n00:16:57.241 --> 00:17:01.465\nor even encouragement of consumption.\n\n00:17:01.465 --> 00:17:05.485\nThese organizations service, recruit from,\n\n00:17:05.485 --> 00:17:07.813\nand operate within our communities,\n\n00:17:07.813 --> 00:17:10.231\nso necessarily, they are much more integrated\n\n00:17:10.231 --> 00:17:14.701\nwithin them than we are comfortable acknowledging.\n\n00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:17.566\nAnd so to me the question is not whether\n\n00:17:17.566 --> 00:17:20.847\nthese dynamics will continue the way they have.\n\n00:17:20.847 --> 00:17:23.612\nWe see that the nature of this phenomenon\n\n00:17:23.612 --> 00:17:26.080\nguarantees that they will.\n\n00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.960\nThe question is whether we are willing to continue\n\n00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.566\nour support of a failed strategy\n\n00:17:33.566 --> 00:17:39.073\nbased on our stubborn, blissful, voluntary ignorance\n\n00:17:39.073 --> 00:17:44.034\nat the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young.\n\n00:17:44.034 --> 00:17:45.765\nThank you.\n\n00:17:45.765 --> 00:17:50.927\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "What I discovered in New York City  trash", "duration": "472", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/robin_nagle_what_i_discovered_in_new_york_city_trash", "transcript": "I was about 10 years old on a camping trip with my dad in the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness area in the northern part of New York State. It was a beautiful day. The forest was sparkling. The sun made the leaves glow like stained glass, and if it weren't for the path we were following, we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to ever walk that land.We got to our campsite. It was a lean-to on a bluff looking over a crystal, beautiful lake, when I discovered a horror. Behind the lean-to was a dump, maybe 40 feet square with rotting apple cores and balled-up aluminum foil, and a dead sneaker. And I was astonished, I was very angry, and I was deeply confused. The campers who were too lazy to take out what they had brought in, who did they think would clean up after them?That question stayed with me, and it simplified a little. Who cleans up after us? However you configure or wherever you place the us, who cleans up after us in Istanbul? Who cleans up after us in Rio or in Paris or in London? Here in New York, the Department of Sanitation cleans up after us, to the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage and 2,000 tons of recyclables every day. I wanted to get to know them as individuals. I wanted to understand who takes the job. What's it like to wear the uniform and bear that burden?So I started a research project with them. I rode in the trucks and walked the routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities all over the city, and I learned a lot, but I was still an outsider. I needed to go deeper.So I took the job as a sanitation worker. I didn't just ride in the trucks now. I drove the trucks. And I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow. It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education.Everyone asks about the smell. It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think, and on days when it is really bad, you get used to it rather quickly. The weight takes a long time to get used to. I knew people who were several years on the job whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden of bearing on your body tons of trash every week.Then there's the danger. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous occupations in the country, and I learned why. You're in and out of traffic all day, and it's zooming around you. It just wants to get past you, so it's often the motorist is not paying attention. That's really bad for the worker. And then the garbage itself is full of hazards that often fly back out of the truck and do terrible harm.I also learned about the relentlessness of trash. When you step off the curb and you see a city from behind a truck, you come to understand that trash is like a force of nature unto itself. It never stops coming. It's also like a form of respiration or circulation. It must always be in motion.And then there's the stigma. You put on the uniform, and you become invisible until someone is upset with you for whatever reason like you've blocked traffic with your truck, or you're taking a break too close to their home, or you're drinking coffee in their diner, and they will come and scorn you, and tell you that they don't want you anywhere near them. I find the stigma especially ironic, because I strongly believe that sanitation workers are the most important labor force on the streets of the city, for three reasons. They are the first guardians of public health. If they're not taking away trash efficiently and effectively every day, it starts to spill out of its containments, and the dangers inherent to it threaten us in very real ways. Diseases we've had in check for decades and centuries burst forth again and start to harm us. The economy needs them. If we can't throw out the old stuff, we have no room for the new stuff, so then the engines of the economy start to sputter when consumption is compromised. I'm not advocating capitalism, I'm just pointing out their relationship. And then there's what I call our average, necessary quotidian velocity. By that I simply mean how fast we're used to moving in the contemporary day and age. We usually don't care for, repair, clean, carry around our coffee cup, our shopping bag, our bottle of water. We use them, we throw them out, we forget about them, because we know there's a workforce on the other side that's going to take it all away.So I want to suggest today a couple of ways to think about sanitation that will perhaps help ameliorate the stigma and bring them into this conversation of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane. Their work, I think, is kind of liturgical. They're on the streets every day, rhythmically. They wear a uniform in many cities. You know when to expect them. And their work lets us do our work. They are almost a form of reassurance. The flow that they maintain keeps us safe from ourselves, from our own dross, our cast-offs, and that flow must be maintained always no matter what.On the day after September 11 in 2001, I heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street, and I grabbed my infant son and I ran downstairs and there was a man doing his paper recycling route like he did every Wednesday. And I tried to thank him for doing his work on that day of all days, but I started to cry. And he looked at me, and he just nodded, and he said, \"We're going to be okay. We're going to be okay.\" It was a little while later that I started my research with sanitation, and I met that man again. His name is Paulie, and we worked together many times, and we became good friends.I want to believe that Paulie was right. We are going to be okay. But in our effort to reconfigure how we as a species exist on this planet, we must include and take account of all the costs, including the very real human cost of the labor. And we also would be well informed to reach out to the people who do that work and get their expertise on how do we think about, how do we create systems around sustainability that perhaps take us from curbside recycling, which is a remarkable success across 40 years, across the United States and countries around the world, and lift us up to a broader horizon where we're looking at other forms of waste that could be lessened from manufacturing and industrial sources. Municipal waste, what we think of when we talk about garbage, accounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream. It's a remarkable statistic.So in the flow of your days, in the flow of your lives, next time you see someone whose job is to clean up after you, take a moment to acknowledge them. Take a moment to say thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1858, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.273 --> 00:00:14.530\nI was about 10 years old\n\n00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.229\non a camping trip with my dad\n\n00:00:16.229 --> 00:00:18.989\nin the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness area\n\n00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.984\nin the northern part of New York State.\n\n00:00:21.984 --> 00:00:23.425\nIt was a beautiful day.\n\n00:00:23.425 --> 00:00:25.427\nThe forest was sparkling.\n\n00:00:25.427 --> 00:00:28.951\nThe sun made the leaves glow like stained glass,\n\n00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:32.156\nand if it weren't for the path we were following,\n\n00:00:32.156 --> 00:00:33.560\nwe could almost pretend we were\n\n00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.122\nthe first human beings to ever walk that land.\n\n00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:38.773\nWe got to our campsite.\n\n00:00:38.773 --> 00:00:40.740\nIt was a lean-to on a bluff\n\n00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.436\nlooking over a crystal, beautiful lake,\n\n00:00:43.436 --> 00:00:46.132\nwhen I discovered a horror.\n\n00:00:46.132 --> 00:00:49.230\nBehind the lean-to was a dump,\n\n00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.688\nmaybe 40 feet square\n\n00:00:50.688 --> 00:00:53.001\nwith rotting apple cores\n\n00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:54.748\nand balled-up aluminum foil,\n\n00:00:54.748 --> 00:00:56.497\nand a dead sneaker.\n\n00:00:56.497 --> 00:00:59.068\nAnd I was astonished,\n\n00:00:59.068 --> 00:01:02.500\nI was very angry, and I was deeply confused.\n\n00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.082\nThe campers who were too lazy\n\n00:01:04.082 --> 00:01:06.040\nto take out what they had brought in,\n\n00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.885\nwho did they think would clean up after them?\n\n00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:11.794\nThat question stayed with me,\n\n00:01:11.794 --> 00:01:13.761\nand it simplified a little.\n\n00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:16.137\nWho cleans up after us?\n\n00:01:16.137 --> 00:01:17.559\nHowever you configure\n\n00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:19.266\nor wherever you place the us,\n\n00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.856\nwho cleans up after us in Istanbul?\n\n00:01:21.856 --> 00:01:24.112\nWho cleans up after us in Rio\n\n00:01:24.112 --> 00:01:26.641\nor in Paris or in London?\n\n00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:28.213\nHere in New York,\n\n00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:30.805\nthe Department of Sanitation cleans up after us,\n\n00:01:30.805 --> 00:01:33.475\nto the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage\n\n00:01:33.475 --> 00:01:37.837\nand 2,000 tons of recyclables every day.\n\n00:01:37.837 --> 00:01:40.470\nI wanted to get to know them as individuals.\n\n00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.316\nI wanted to understand who takes the job.\n\n00:01:43.316 --> 00:01:45.835\nWhat's it like to wear the uniform\n\n00:01:45.835 --> 00:01:47.489\nand bear that burden?\n\n00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:50.142\nSo I started a research project with them.\n\n00:01:50.142 --> 00:01:52.681\nI rode in the trucks and walked the routes\n\n00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:55.090\nand interviewed people in offices and facilities\n\n00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.597\nall over the city,\n\n00:01:56.597 --> 00:01:58.336\nand I learned a lot,\n\n00:01:58.336 --> 00:02:00.685\nbut I was still an outsider.\n\n00:02:00.685 --> 00:02:02.563\nI needed to go deeper.\n\n00:02:02.563 --> 00:02:05.679\nSo I took the job as a sanitation worker.\n\n00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.326\nI didn't just ride in the trucks now.

00:05:00.314\non the other side that's going to take it all away.\n\n00:05:00.314 --> 00:05:02.761\nSo I want to suggest today a couple of ways\n\n00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:07.275\nto think about sanitation that will perhaps help\n\n00:05:07.275 --> 00:05:09.749\nameliorate the stigma\n\n00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:11.980\nand bring them into this conversation\n\n00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.570\nof how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane.\n\n00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.731\nTheir work, I think, is kind of liturgical.\n\n00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:24.192\nThey're on the streets every day, rhythmically.\n\n00:05:24.192 --> 00:05:26.253\nThey wear a uniform in many cities.\n\n00:05:26.253 --> 00:05:28.122\nYou know when to expect them.\n\n00:05:28.122 --> 00:05:32.045\nAnd their work lets us do our work.\n\n00:05:32.045 --> 00:05:34.836\nThey are almost a form of reassurance.\n\n00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:36.573\nThe flow that they maintain\n\n00:05:36.573 --> 00:05:38.563\nkeeps us safe from ourselves,\n\n00:05:38.563 --> 00:05:41.200\nfrom our own dross, our cast-offs,\n\n00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.458\nand that flow must be maintained always\n\n00:05:44.458 --> 00:05:46.091\nno matter what.\n\n00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:49.815\nOn the day after September 11 in 2001,\n\n00:05:49.815 --> 00:05:53.102\nI heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street,\n\n00:05:53.102 --> 00:05:55.414\nand I grabbed my infant son and I ran downstairs\n\n00:05:55.414 --> 00:05:58.256\nand there was a man doing his paper recycling route\n\n00:05:58.256 --> 00:06:00.438\nlike he did every Wednesday.\n\n00:06:00.438 --> 00:06:02.858\nAnd I tried to thank him for doing his work\n\n00:06:02.858 --> 00:06:04.983\non that day of all days,\n\n00:06:04.983 --> 00:06:07.584\nbut I started to cry.\n\n00:06:07.584 --> 00:06:09.268\nAnd he looked at me,\n\n00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:12.692\nand he just nodded, and he said,\n\n00:06:12.692 --> 00:06:15.570\n\"We're going to be okay.\n\n00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.211\nWe're going to be okay.\"\n\n00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.564\nIt was a little while later that I started\n\n00:06:19.564 --> 00:06:20.944\nmy research with sanitation,\n\n00:06:20.944 --> 00:06:22.358\nand I met that man again.\n\n00:06:22.358 --> 00:06:25.275\nHis name is Paulie, and we worked together many times,\n\n00:06:25.275 --> 00:06:27.098\nand we became good friends.\n\n00:06:27.098 --> 00:06:29.925\nI want to believe that Paulie was right.\n\n00:06:29.925 --> 00:06:32.127\nWe are going to be okay.\n\n00:06:32.127 --> 00:06:34.104\nBut in

My lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology focuses on spinal cord injury, which affects more than 50,000 people around the world every year, with dramatic consequences for affected individuals, whose life literally shatters in a matter of a handful of seconds.And for me, the Man of Steel, Christopher Reeve, has best raised the awareness on the distress of spinal cord injured people. And this is how I started my own personal journey in this field of research, working with the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation.I still remember this decisive moment. It was just at the end of a regular day of work with the foundation. Chris addressed us, the scientists and experts, \"You have to be more pragmatic. When leaving your laboratory tomorrow, I want you to stop by the rehabilitation center to watch injured people fighting to take a step, struggling to maintain their trunk. And when you go home, think of what you are going to change in your research on the following day to make their lives better.\"These words, they stuck with me. This was more than 10 years ago, but ever since, my laboratory has followed the pragmatic approach to recovery after spinal cord injury. And my first step in this direction was to develop a new model of spinal cord injury that would more closely mimic some of the key features of human injury while offering well-controlled experimental conditions. And for this purpose, we placed two hemisections on opposite sides of the body. They completely interrupt the communication between the brain and the spinal cord, thus leading to complete and permanent paralysis of the leg. But, as observed, after most injuries in humans, there is this intervening gap of intact neural tissue through which recovery can occur. But how to make it happen?Well, the classical approach consists of applying intervention that would promote the growth of the severed fiber to the original target. And while this certainly remained the key for a cure, this seemed extraordinarily complicated to me. To reach clinical fruition rapidly, it was obvious: I had to think about the problem differently.It turned out that more than 100 years of research on spinal cord physiology, starting with the Nobel Prize Sherrington, had shown that the spinal cord, below most injuries, contained all the necessary and sufficient neural networks to coordinate locomotion, but because input from the brain is interrupted, they are in a nonfunctional state, like kind of dormant. My idea: We awaken this network.And at the time, I was a post-doctoral fellow in Los Angeles, after completing my Ph.D. in France, where independent thinking is not necessarily promoted. (Laughter) I was afraid to talk to my new boss, but decided to muster up my courage. I knocked at the door of my wonderful advisor, Reggie Edgerton, to share my new idea.He listened to me carefully, and responded with a grin. \"Why don't you try?\"And I promise to you, this was such an important moment in my career, when I realized that the great leader believed in young people and new ideas.And this was the idea: I'm going to use a simplistic metaphor to explain to you this complicated concept. Imagine that the locomotor system is a car. The engine is the spinal cord. The transmission is interrupted. The engine is turned off. How could we re-engage the engine? First, we have to provide the fuel; second, press the accelerator pedal; third, steer the car. It turned out that there are known neural pathways coming from the brain that play this very function during locomotion. My idea: Replace this missing input to provide the spinal cord with the kind of intervention that the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk.For this, I leveraged 20 years of past research in neuroscience, first to replace the missing fuel with pharmacological agents that prepare the neurons in the spinal cord to fire, and second, to mimic the accelerator pedal with electrical stimulation. So here imagine an electrode implanted on the back of the spinal cord to deliver painless stimulation. It took many years, but eventually we developed an electrochemical neuroprosthesis that transformed the neural network in the spinal cord from dormant to a highly functional state. Immediately, the paralyzed rat can stand. As soon as the treadmill belt starts moving, the animal shows coordinated movement of the leg, but without the brain. Here what I call \"the spinal brain\" cognitively processes sensory information arising from the moving leg and makes decisions as to how to activate the muscle in order to stand, to walk, to run, and even here, while sprinting, instantly stand if the treadmill stops moving.This was amazing. I was completely fascinated by this locomotion without the brain, but at the same time so frustrated. This locomotion was completely involuntary. The animal had virtually no control over the legs. Clearly, the steering system was missing. And it then became obvious from me that we had to move away from the classical rehabilitation paradigm, stepping on a treadmill, and develop conditions that would encourage the brain to begin voluntary control over the leg.With this in mind, we developed a completely new robotic system to support the rat in any direction of space. Imagine, this is really cool. So imagine the little 200-gram rat attached at the extremity of this 200-kilo robot, but the rat does not feel the robot. The robot is transparent, just like you would hold a young child during the first insecure steps.Let me summarize: The rat received a paralyzing lesion of the spinal cord. The electrochemical neuroprosthesis enabled a highly functional state of the spinal locomotor networks. The robot provided the safe environment to allow the rat to attempt anything to engage the paralyzed legs. And for motivation, we used what I think is the most powerful pharmacology of Switzerland: fine Swiss chocolate.(Laughter)Actually, the first results were very, very, very disappointing. Here is my best physical therapist completely failing to encourage the rat to take a single step, whereas the same rat, five minutes earlier, walked beautifully on the treadmill. We were so frustrated.But you know, one of the most essential qualities of a scientist is perseverance. We insisted. We refined our paradigm, and after several months of training, the otherwise paralyzed rat could stand, and whenever she decided, initiated full weight-bearing locomotion to sprint towards the rewards. This is the first recovery ever observed of voluntary leg movement after an experimental lesion of the spinal cord leading to complete and permanent paralysis.In fact \u2014(Applause)Thank you.In fact, not only could the rat initiate and sustain locomotion on the ground, they could even adjust leg movement, for example, to resist gravity in order to climb a staircase. I can promise you this was such an emotional moment in my laboratory. It took us 10 years of hard work to reach this goal.But the remaining question was, how? I mean, how is it possible? And here, what we found was completely unexpected. This novel training paradigm encouraged the brain to create new connections, some relay circuits that relay information from the brain past the injury and restore cortical control over the locomotor networks below the injury. And here, you can see one such example, where we label the fibers coming from the brain in red. This blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center, and what this constellation of synaptic contacts means is that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center with only one relay neuron. But the remodeling was not restricted to the lesion area. It occurred throughout the central nervous system, including in the brain stem, where we observed up to 300-percent increase in the density of fibers coming from the brain. We did not aim to repair the spinal cord, yet we were able to promote one of the more extensive remodeling of axonal projections ever observed in the central nervous system of adult mammal after an injury.And there is a very important message hidden behind this discovery. They are the result of a young team of very talented people: physical therapists, neurobiologists, neurosurgeons, engineers of all kinds, who have achieved together what would have been impossible by single individuals. This is truly a trans-disciplinary team. They are working so close to each other that there is horizontal transfer of DNA. We are creating the next generation of M.D.'s and engineers capable of translating discoveries all the way from bench to bedside. And me? I am only the maestro who orchestrated this beautiful symphony.Now, I am sure you are all wondering, aren't you, will this help injured people? Me too, every day. The truth is that we don't know enough yet. This is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury, but I begin to believe that this may lead to an intervention to improve recovery and people's quality of life.I would like you all to take a moment and dream with me. Imagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury. After a few weeks of recovery, we will implant a programmable pump to deliver a personalized pharmacological cocktail directly to the spinal cord. At the same time, we will implant an electrode array, a sort of second skin covering the area of the spinal cord controlling leg movement, and this array is attached to an electrical pulse generator that delivers stimulations that are tailored to the person's needs. This defines a personalized electrochemical neuroprosthesis that will enable locomotion during training with a newly designed supporting system. And my hope is that after several months of training, there may be enough remodeling of residual connection to allow locomotion without the robot, maybe even without pharmacology or stimulation. My hope here is to be able to create the personalized condition to boost the plasticity of the brain and the spinal cord. And this is a radically new concept that may apply to other neurological disorders, what I termed \"personalized neuroprosthetics,\" where by sensing and stimulating neural interfaces, I implanted throughout the nervous system, in the brain, in the spinal cord, even in peripheral nerves, based on patient-specific impairments. But not to replace the lost function, no \u2014 to help the brain help itself.And I hope this enticed your imagination, because I can promise to you this is not a matter of whether this revolution will occur, but when. And remember, we are only as great as our imagination, as big as our dream.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1860, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.404 -->

don't you try?\"\n\n00:03:53.228 --> 00:03:55.353\nAnd I promise to you,\n\n00:03:55.353 --> 00:03:58.708\nthis was such an important moment in my career,\n\n00:03:58.708 --> 00:04:01.143\nwhen I realized that the great leader\n\n00:04:01.143 --> 00:04:04.136\nbelieved in young people and new ideas.\n\n00:04:04.136 --> 00:04:05.744\nAnd this was the idea:\n\n00:04:05.744 --> 00:04:08.410\nI'm going to use a simplistic metaphor\n\n00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.536\nto explain to you this complicated concept.\n\n00:04:10.536 --> 00:04:15.302\nImagine that the locomotor system is a car.\n\n00:04:15.302 --> 00:04:17.548\nThe engine is the spinal cord.\n\n00:04:17.548 --> 00:04:20.806\nThe transmission is interrupted. The engine is turned off.\n\n00:04:20.806 --> 00:04:23.813\nHow could we re-engage the engine?\n\n00:04:23.813 --> 00:04:26.955\nFirst, we have to provide the fuel;\n\n00:04:26.955 --> 00:04:29.298\nsecond, press the accelerator pedal;\n\n00:04:29.298 --> 00:04:31.236\nthird, steer the car.\n\n00:04:31.236 --> 00:04:32.998\nIt turned out that there are known neural pathways\n\n00:04:32.998 --> 00:04:35.952\ncoming from the brain that play this very function\n\n00:04:35.952 --> 00:04:37.334\nduring locomotion.\n\n00:04:37.334 --> 00:04:40.049\nMy idea: Replace this missing input\n\n00:04:40.049 --> 00:04:41.451\nto provide the spinal cord\n\n00:04:41.451 --> 00:04:42.847\nwith the kind of intervention\n\n00:04:42.847 --> 00:04:47.577\nthat the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk.\n\n00:04:47.577 --> 00:04:52.016\nFor this, I leveraged 20 years of past research in neuroscience,\n\n00:04:52.016 --> 00:04:54.780\nfirst to replace the missing fuel\n\n00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.848\nwith pharmacological agents\n\n00:04:56.848 --> 00:05:00.328\nthat prepare the neurons in the spinal cord to fire,\n\n00:05:00.328 --> 00:05:04.383\nand second, to mimic the accelerator pedal\n\n00:05:04.383 --> 00:05:05.863\nwith electrical stimulation.\n\n00:05:05.863 --> 00:05:08.032\nSo here imagine an electrode\n\n00:05:08.032 --> 00:05:10.438\nimplanted on the back of the spinal cord\n\n00:05:10.438 --> 00:05:12.700\nto deliver painless stimulation.\n\n00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.532\nIt took many years, but eventually we developed\n\n00:05:15.532 --> 00:05:18.089\nan electrochemical neuroprosthesis\n\n00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:19.855\nthat transformed the neural network\n\n00:05:19.855 --> 00:05:24.861\nin the spinal cord from dormant to a highly functional state.\n\n00:05:24.861 --> 00:05:31.141\nImmediately, the paralyzed rat can stand.\n\n00:05:31.141 --> 00:05:33.468\nAs soon as the treadmill belt starts moving,\n\n00:05:33.468 --> 00:05:37.274\nthe animal shows coordinated movement of the leg,\n\n00:05:37.274 --> 00:05:39.252\nbut without the brain.\n\n00:05:39.252 --> 00:05:41.242\nHere what I call \"the spinal brain\"\n\n00:05:41.242 --> 00:05:44.364\ncognitively processes sensory information\n\n00:05:44.364 --> 00:05:46.259\narising from the moving leg\n\n00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.954\nand makes decisions as to how to activate the muscle\n\n00:05:49.954 --> 00:05:53.344\nin order to stand, to walk, to run,\n\n00:05:53.344 --> 00:05:55.456\nand even here, while sprinting,\n\n00:05:55.456 --> 00:05:57.753\ninstantly stand\n\n00:05:57.753 --> 00:06:00.216\nif the treadmill stops moving.\n\n00:06:00.216 --> 00:06:01.553\nThis was amazing.\n\n00:06:01.553 --> 00:06:04.940\nI was completely fascinated by this locomotion\n\n00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.435\nwithout the brain,\n\n00:06:07.435 --> 00:06:11.090\nbut at the same time so frustrated.\n\n00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.483\nThis locomotion was completely involuntary.\n\n00:06:13.483 --> 00:06:16.848\nThe animal had virtually no control over the legs.\n\n00:06:16.848 --> 00:06:20.968\nClearly, the steering system was missing.\n\n00:06:20.968 --> 00:06:22.860\nAnd it then became obvious from me\n\n00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.208\nthat we had to move away\n\n00:06:24.208 --> 00:06:27.580\nfrom the classical rehabilitation paradigm,\n\n00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.302\nstepping on a treadmill,\n\n00:06:29.302 --> 00:06:32.522\nand develop conditions that would encourage\n\n00:06:32.522 --> 00:06:37.755\nthe brain to begin voluntary control over the leg.\n\n00:06:37.755 --> 00:06:41.140\nWith this in mind, we developed a completely new\n\n00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.370\nrobotic system to support the rat\n\n00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.896\nin any direction of space.\n\n00:06:46.896 --> 00:06:49.071\nImagine, this is really cool.\n\n00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:52.902\nSo imagine the little 200-gram rat\n\n00:06:52.902 --> 00:06:56.603\nattached at the extremity of this 200-kilo robot,\n\n00:06:56.603 --> 00:06:59.175\nbut the rat does not feel the robot.\n\n00:06:59.175 --> 00:07:01.247\nThe robot is transparent,\n\n00:07:01.247 --> 00:07:03.609\njust like you would hold a young child\n\n00:07:03.609 --> 00:07:05.973\nduring the first insecure steps.\n\n00:07:05.973 --> 00:07:09.527\nLet me summarize: The rat received\n\n00:07:09.527 --> 00:07:11.972\na paralyzing lesion of the spinal cord.\n\n00:07:11.972 --> 00:07:14.562\nThe electrochemical neuroprosthesis enabled\n\n00:07:14.562 --> 00:07:18.769\na highly functional state of the spinal locomotor networks.\n\n00:07:18.769 --> 00:07:22.535\nThe robot provided the safe environment\n\n00:07:22.535 --> 00:07:24.498\nto allow the rat to attempt anything\n\n00:07:24.498 --> 00:07:27.180\nto engage the paralyzed legs.\n\n00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.005\nAnd for motivation, we used what I think\n\n00:07:30.005 --> 00:07:33.839\nis the most powerful pharmacology of Switzerland:\n\n00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:36.146\nfine Swiss chocolate.\n\n00:07:36.146 --> 00:07:39.068\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:39.068 --> 00:07:43.631\nActually, the first results were very, very,\n\n00:07:43.631 --> 00:07:46.266\nvery disappointing.\n\n00:07:46.266 --> 00:07:49.568\nHere is my best physical therapist\n\n00:07:56.752 --> 00:07:59.342\ncompletely failing to encourage the rat\n\n00:07:59.342 --> 00:08:01.403\nto take a single step,\n\n00:08:01.403 --> 00:08:04.249\nwhereas the same rat, five minutes earlier,\n\n00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:06.555\nwalked beautifully on the treadmill.\n\n00:08:06.555 --> 00:08:08.712\nWe were so frustrated.\n\n00:08:08.712 --> 00:08:11.611\nBut you know, one of the most essential qualities\n\n00:08:11.611 --> 00:08:14.087\nof a scientist is perseverance.\n\n00:08:14.087 --> 00:08:17.503\nWe insisted. We refined our paradigm,\n\n00:08:17.503 --> 00:08:19.766\nand after several months of training,\n\n00:08:19.766 --> 00:08:23.572\nthe otherwise paralyzed rat could stand,\n\n00:08:23.572 --> 00:08:25.384\nand whenever she decided,\n\n00:08:25.384 --> 00:08:27.716\ninitiated full weight-bearing locomotion\n\n00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:30.966\nto sprint towards the rewards.\n\n00:08:30.966 --> 00:08:34.371\nThis is the first recovery ever observed\n\n00:08:34.371 --> 00:08:36.265\nof voluntary leg movement\n\n00:08:36.265 --> 00:08:38.719\nafter an experimental lesion of the spinal cord\n\n00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:42.180\nleading to complete and permanent paralysis.\n\n00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.167\nIn fact --\n\n00:08:44.167 --> 00:08:45.887\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:45.887 --> 00:08:50.266\nThank you.\n\n00:08:50.266 --> 00:08:53.360\nIn fact, not only could the rat initiate\n\n00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.037\nand sustain locomotion on the ground,\n\n00:08:56.037 --> 00:08:58.318\nthey could even adjust leg movement,\n\n00:08:58.318 --> 00:09:00.674\nfor example, to resist gravity\n\n00:09:00.674 --> 00:09:03.298\nin order to climb a staircase.\n\n00:09:03.298 --> 00:09:05.248\nI can promise you this was\n\n00:09:05.248 --> 00:09:08.357\nsuch an emotional moment in my laboratory.\n\n00:09:08.357 --> 00:09:11.100\nIt took us 10 years of hard work\n\n00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.551\nto reach this goal.\n\n00:09:13.551 --> 00:09:16.102\nBut the remaining question was, how?\n\n00:09:16.102 --> 00:09:17.794\nI mean, how is it possible?\n\n00:09:17.794 --> 00:09:19.472\nAnd here, what we found\n\n00:09:19.472 --> 00:09:23.148\nwas completely unexpected.\n\n00:09:23.148 --> 00:09:27.306\nThis novel training paradigm\n\n00:09:27.306 --> 00:09:30.977\nencouraged the brain to create new connections,\n\n00:09:30.977 --> 00:09:33.879\nsome relay circuits\n\n00:09:33.879 --> 00:09:36.927\nthat relay information from the brain\n\n00:09:36.927 --> 00:09:40.083\npast the injury and restore cortical control\n\n00:09:40.083 --> 00:09:43.524\nover the locomotor networks below the injury.\n\n00:09:43.524 --> 00:09:46.446\nAnd here, you can see one such example,\n\n00:09:46.446 --> 00:09:49.809\nwhere we label the fibers coming from the brain in red.\n\n00:09:49.809 --> 00:09:53.229\nThis blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center,\n\n00:09:53.229 --> 00:09:55.592\nand what this constellation\n\n00:09:55.592 --> 00:09:57.943\nof synaptic contacts means\n\n00:09:57.943 --> 00:10:01.742\nis that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center\n\n00:10:01.742 --> 00:10:05.740\nwith only one relay neuron.\n\n00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.671\nBut the remodeling was not restricted\n\n00:10:07.671 --> 00:10:08.758\nto the lesion area.\n\n00:10:08.758 --> 00:10:12.047\nIt occurred throughout the central nervous system,\n\n00:10:12.047 --> 00:10:14.365\nincluding in the brain stem,\n\n00:10:14.365 --> 00:10:17.627\nwhere we observed up to 300-percent increase\n\n00:10:17.627 --> 00:10:21.386\nin the density of fibers coming from the brain.\n\n00:10:21.386 --> 00:10:24.913\nWe did not aim to repair the spinal cord,\n\n00:10:24.913 --> 00:10:27.510\nyet we were able to promote\n\n00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.667\none of the more extensive remodeling\n\n00:10:29.667 --> 00:10:32.136\nof axonal projections ever observed\n\n00:10:32.136 --> 00:10:34.397\nin the central nervous system of adult mammal\n\n00:10:34.397 --> 00:10:36.942\nafter an injury.\n\n00:10:36.942 --> 00:10:42.011\nAnd there is a very important message\n\n00:10:42.011 --> 00:10:46.454\nhidden behind this discovery.\n\n00:10:46.454 --> 00:10:49.676\nThey are the result of a young team\n\n00:10:49.676 --> 00:10:52.068\nof very talented people:\n\n00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:56.526\nphysical therapists, neurobiologists, neurosurgeons,\n\n00:10:56.526 --> 00:10:58.725\nengineers of all kinds,\n\n00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:00.516\nwho have achieved together\n\n00:11:00.516 --> 00:11:04.159\nwhat would have been impossible by single individuals.\n\n00:11:04.159 --> 00:11:07.242\nThis is truly a trans-disciplinary team.\n\n00:11:07.242 --> 00:11:09.430\nThey are working so close to each other\n\n00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:12.621\nthat there is horizontal transfer of DNA.\n\n00:11:12.621 --> 00:11:14.244\nWe are creating the next generation\n\n00:11:14.244 --> 00:11:16.485\nof M.D.'s and engineers\n\n00:11:16.485 --> 00:11:18.929\ncapable of translating discoveries all the way\n\n00:11:18.929 --> 00:11:21.601\nfrom bench to bedside.\n\n00:11:21.601 --> 00:11:23.607\nAnd me?\n\n00:11:23.607 --> 00:11:28.154\nI am only the maestro who orchestrated this beautiful symphony.\n\n00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:34.957\nNow, I am sure you are all wondering, aren't you,\n\n00:11:34.957 --> 00:11:38.721\nwill this help injured people?\n\n00:11:38.721 --> 00:11:42.613\nMe too, every day.\n\n00:11:42.613 --> 00:11:46.026\nThe truth is that we don't know enough yet.\n\n00:11:46.026 --> 00:11:50.250\nThis is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury,\n\n00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.984\nbut I begin to believe that this may lead\n\n00:11:52.984 --> 00:11:55.551\nto an intervention to improve recovery\n\n00:11:55.551 --> 00:11:58.738\nand people's quality of life.\n\n00:11:58.738 --> 00:12:01.227\nI would like you all\n\n00:12:01.227 --> 00:12:04.854\nto take a moment and dream with me.\n\n00:12:04.854 --> 00:12:10.749\nImagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury.\n\n00:12:10.749 --> 00:12:13.904\nAfter a few weeks of recovery,\n\n00:12:13.904 --> 00:12:16.264\nwe will implant a programmable pump\n\n00:12:16.264 --> 00:12:19.297\nto deliver a personalized pharmacological cocktail\n\n00:12:19.297 --> 00:12:21.739\ndirectly to the spinal cord.\n\n00:12:21.739 --> 00:12:25.002\nAt the same time, we will implant an electrode array,\n\n00:12:25.002 --> 00:12:27.109\na sort of second skin\n\n00:12:27.109 --> 00:12:30.669\ncovering the area of the spinal cord controlling leg movement,\n\n00:12:30.669 --> 00:12:33.935\nand this array is attached to an electrical pulse generator\n\n00:12:33.935 --> 00:12:36.397\nthat delivers stimulations that are tailored\n\n00:12:36.397 --> 00:12:38.583\nto the person's needs.\n\n00:12:38.583 --> 00:12:43.441\nThis defines a personalized electrochemical neuroprosthesis\n\n00:12:43.441 --> 00:12:46.192\nthat will enable locomotion\n\n00:12:46.192 --> 00:12:50.239\nduring training with a newly designed supporting system.\n\n00:12:50.239 --> 00:12:53.522\nAnd my hope is that after several months of training,\n\n00:12:53.522 --> 00:12:55.685\nthere may be enough remodeling of residual connection\n\n00:12:55.685 --> 00:12:59.354\nto allow locomotion without the robot,\n\n00:12:59.354 --> 00:13:03.132\nmaybe even without pharmacology or stimulation.\n\n00:13:03.132 --> 00:13:05.666\nMy hope here is to be able to create\n\n00:13:05.666 --> 00:13:07.931\nthe personalized condition\n\n00:13:07.931 --> 00:13:10.594\nto boost the plasticity of the brain\n\n00:13:10.594 --> 00:13:12.125\nand the spinal cord.\n\n00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:14.864\nAnd this is a radically new concept\n\n00:13:14.864 --> 00:13:18.157\nthat may apply to other neurological disorders,\n\n00:13:18.157 --> 00:13:22.695\nwhat I termed \"personalized neuroprosthetics,\"\n\n00:13:22.695 --> 00:13:25.719\nwhere by sensing and stimulating neural interfaces,\n\n00:13:25.719 --> 00:13:29.433\nI implanted throughout the nervous system,\n\n00:13:29.433 --> 00:13:32.774\nin the brain, in the

phone. They've changed the world. However, largely to our surprise, they also turned out to be the perfect tools for the surveillance state. It turned out that the capability to collect data, information and connections about basically any of us and all of us is exactly what we've been hearing throughout of the summer through revelations and leaks about Western intelligence agencies, mostly U.S. intelligence agencies, watching over the rest of the world.We've heard about these starting with the revelations from June 6. Edward Snowden started leaking information, top secret classified information, from the U.S. intelligence agencies, and we started learning about things like PRISM and XKeyscore and others. And these are examples of the kinds of programs U.S. intelligence agencies are running right now, against the whole rest of the world.And if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by George Orwell, well it turns out that George Orwell was an optimist. (Laughter) We are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined.And this here is the infamous NSA data center in Utah. Due to be opened very soon, it will be both a supercomputing center and a data storage center. You could basically imagine it has a large hall filled with hard drives storing data they are collecting. And it's a pretty big building. How big? Well, I can give you the numbers \u2014 140,000 square meters \u2014 but that doesn't really tell you very much. Maybe it's better to imagine it as a comparison. You think about the largest IKEA store you've ever been in. This is five times larger. How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store? Right? It's pretty big. We estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year. And this kind of wholesale surveillance means that they can collect our data and keep it basically forever, keep it for extended periods of time, keep it for years, keep it for decades. And this opens up completely new kinds of risks to us all. And what this is is that it is wholesale blanket surveillance on everyone.Well, not exactly everyone, because the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners. They can monitor foreigners when foreigners' data connections end up in the United States or pass through the United States. And monitoring foreigners doesn't sound too bad until you realize that I'm a foreigner and you're a foreigner. In fact, 96 percent of the planet are foreigners.(Laughter)Right?So it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us, all of us who use telecommunications and the Internet.But don't get me wrong: There are actually types of surveillance that are okay. I love freedom, but even I agree that some surveillance is fine. If the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer, or they're trying to catch a drug lord or trying to prevent a school shooting, and they have leads and they have suspects, then it's perfectly fine for them to tap the suspect's phone, and to intercept his Internet communications. I'm not arguing that at all, but that's not what programs like PRISM are about. They are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings. They're about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent.So the four main arguments supporting surveillance like this, well, the first of all is that whenever you start discussing about these revelations, there will be naysayers trying to minimize the importance of these revelations, saying that we knew all this already, we knew it was happening, there's nothing new here. And that's not true. Don't let anybody tell you that we knew this already, because we did not know this already. Our worst fears might have been something like this, but we didn't know this was happening. Now we know for a fact it's happening. We didn't know about this. We didn't know about PRISM. We didn't know about XKeyscore. We didn't know about Cybertrans. We didn't know about DoubleArrow. We did not know about Skywriter \u2014 all these different programs run by U.S. intelligence agencies. But now we do.And we did not know that U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose. And what that means is that you take something which is secure, an encryption algorithm which is so secure that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file, nobody can decrypt that file. Even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file, it's going to take millions of years. So that's basically perfectly safe, uncrackable. You take something which is that good and then you weaken it on purpose, making all of us less secure as an end result. A real-world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because, you know, bad people might have house alarms, but it will also make all of us less secure as an end result. Backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind. But of course, these intelligence agencies are doing their job. This is what they have been told to do: do signals intelligence, monitor telecommunications, monitor Internet traffic. That's what they're trying to do, and since most, a very big part of the Internet traffic today is encrypted, they're trying to find ways around the encryption. One way is to sabotage encryption algorithms, which is a great example about how U.S. intelligence agencies are running loose. They are completely out of control, and they should be brought back under control.So what do we actually know about the leaks? Everything is based on the files leaked by Mr. Snowden. The very first PRISM slides from the beginning of June detail a collection program where the data is collected from service providers, and they actually go and name the service providers they have access to. They even have a specific date on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers. So for example, they name the collection from Microsoft started on September 11, 2007, for Yahoo on the March 12, 2008, and then others: Google, Facebook, Skype, Apple and so on.And every single one of these companies denies. They all say that this simply isn't true, that they are not giving backdoor access to their data. Yet we have these files. So is one of the parties lying, or is there some other alternative explanation? And one explanation would be that these parties, these service providers, are not cooperating. Instead, they've been hacked. That would explain it. They aren't cooperating. They've been hacked. In this case, they've been hacked by their own government. That might sound outlandish, but we already have cases where this has happened, for example, the case of the Flame malware which we strongly believe was authored by the U.S. government, and which, to spread, subverted the security of the Windows Update network, meaning here, the company was hacked by their own government. And there's more evidence supporting this theory as well. Der Spiegel, from Germany, leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies. Inside NSA, the unit is called TAO, Tailored Access Operations, and inside GCHQ, which is the U.K. equivalent, it's called NAC, Network Analysis Centre. And these recent leaks of these three slides detail an operation run by this GCHQ intelligence agency from the United Kingdom targeting a telecom here in Belgium. And what this really means is that an E.U. country's intelligence agency is breaching the security of a telecom of a fellow E.U. country on purpose, and they discuss it in their slides completely casually, business as usual. Here's the primary target, here's the secondary target, here's the teaming. They probably have a team building on Thursday evening in a pub. They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art like, you know, \"Success,\" when they gain access to services like this. What the hell?And then there's the argument that okay, yes, this might be going on, but then again, other countries are doing it as well. All countries spy. And maybe that's true. Many countries spy, not all of them, but let's take an example. Let's take, for example, Sweden. I'm speaking of Sweden because Sweden has a little bit of a similar law to the United States. When your data traffic goes through Sweden, their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law to intercept that traffic. All right, how many Swedish decisionmakers and politicians and business leaders use, every day, U.S.-based services, like, you know, run Windows or OSX, or use Facebook or LinkedIn, or store their data in clouds like iCloud or Skydrive or DropBox, or maybe use online services like Amazon web services or sales support? And the answer is, every single Swedish business leader does that every single day. And then we turn it around. How many American leaders use Swedish webmails and cloud services? And the answer is zero. So this is not balanced. It's not balanced by any means, not even close.And when we do have the occasional European success story, even those, then, typically end up being sold to the United States. Like, Skype used to be secure. It used to be end-to-end encrypted. Then it was sold to the United States. Today, it no longer is secure. So once again, we take something which is secure and then we make it less secure on purpose, making all of us less secure as an outcome.And then the argument that the United States is only fighting terrorists. It's the war on terror. You shouldn't worry about it. Well, it's not the war on terror. Yes, part of it is war on terror, and yes, there are terrorists, and they do kill and maim, and we should fight them, but we know through these leaks that they have used the same techniques to listen to phone calls of European leaders, to tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil, to read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament, and I don't think they are trying to find terrorists from inside the E.U. Parliament, right? It's not the war on terror. Part of it might be, and there are terrorists, but are we really thinking about terrorists as such an existential threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them? Are the Americans ready to throw away the Constituion and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists? And the same thing with the Bill of Rights and all the amendments and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the E.U. conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms and the press freedom? Do we really think terrorism is such an existential threat, we are ready to do anything at all?But people are scared about terrorists, and then they think that maybe that surveillance is okay because they have nothing to hide. Feel free to survey me if that helps. And whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasn't thought about this long enough.(Applause)Because we have this thing called privacy, and if you really think that you have nothing to hide, please make sure that's the first thing you tell me, because then I know that I should not trust you with any secrets, because obviously you can't keep a secret. But people are brutally honest with the Internet, and when these leaks started, many people were asking me about this. And I have nothing to hide. I'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal. Yet, I have nothing that I would in particular like to share with an intelligence agency, especially a foreign intelligence agency. And if we indeed need a Big Brother, I would much rather have a domestic Big Brother than a foreign Big Brother. And when the leaks started, the very first thing I tweeted about this was a comment about how, when you've been using search engines, you've been potentially leaking all that to U.S. intelligence. And two minutes later, I got a reply by somebody called Kimberly from the United States challenging me, like, why am I worried about this? What am I sending to worry about this? Am I sending naked pictures or something? And my answer to Kimberly was that what I'm sending is none of your business, and it should be none of your government's business either. Because that's what it's about. It's about privacy. Privacy is nonnegotiable. It should be built in to all the systems we use.(Applause)And one thing we should all understand is that we are brutally honest with search engines. You show me your search history, and I'll find something incriminating or something embarrassing there in five minutes. We are more honest with search engines than we are with our families. Search engines know more about you than your family members know about you. And this is all the kind of information we are giving away, we are giving away to the United States.And surveillance changes history. We know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon. Imagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today. And let me actually quote the president of Brazil, Ms. Dilma Rousseff. She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance. Her email was read, and she spoke at the United Nations Headquarters, and she said, \"If there is no right to privacy, there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion, and therefore, there can be no effective democracy.\"That's what it's about. Privacy is the building block of our democracies. And to quote a fellow security researcher, Marcus Ranum, he said that the United States is right now treating the Internet as it would be treating one of its colonies. So we are back to the age of colonization, and we, the foreign users of the Internet, we should think about Americans as our masters.So Mr. Snowden, he's been blamed for many things. Some are blaming him for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry and software companies with these revelations \u2014 and blaming Snowden for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry would be the equivalent of blaming Al Gore for causing global warming.(Laughter)(Applause)So, what is there to be done? Should we worry. No, we shouldn't worry. We should be angry, because this is wrong, and it's rude, and it should not be done. But that's not going to really change the situation. What's going to change the situation for the rest of the world is to try to steer away from systems built in the United States. And that's much easier said than done. How do you do that? A single country, any single country in Europe cannot replace and build replacements for the U.S.-made operating systems and cloud services.But maybe you don't have to do it alone. Maybe you can do it together with other countries. The solution is open source. By building together open, free, secure systems, we can go around such surveillance, and then one country doesn't have to solve the problem by itself. It only has to solve one little problem. And to quote a fellow security researcher, Haroon Meer, one country only has to make a small wave, but those small waves together become a tide, and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time, and the tide we will build with secure, free, open-source systems, will become the tide that will lift all of us up and above the surveillance state.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1861, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.084\nThe two most likely largest inventions\n\n00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:19.331\nof our generation\n\n00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:22.524\nare the Internet and the mobile phone.\n\n00:00:22.524 --> 00:00:24.659\nThey've changed the world.\n\n00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:28.174\nHowever, largely to our surprise,\n\n00:00:28.174 --> 00:00:32.572\nthey also turned out to be the perfect tools\n\n00:00:32.572 --> 00:00:35.722\nfor the surveillance state.\n\n00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:38.619\nIt turned out that the capability\n\n00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:42.663\nto collect data, information and connections\n\n00:00:42.663 --> 00:00:46.881\nabout basically any of us and all of us\n\n00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:48.694\nis exactly what we've been hearing\n\n00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:53.301\nthroughout of the summer\nthrough revelations and leaks\n\n00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:56.392\nabout Western intelligence agencies,\n\n00:00:56.392 --> 00:00:59.418\nmostly U.S. intelligence agencies,\n\n00:00:59.418 --> 00:01:02.591\nwatching over the rest of the world.\n\n00:01:02.591 --> 00:01:05.789\nWe've heard about these starting with the\n\n00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:09.475\nrevelations from June 6.\n\n00:01:09.475 --> 00:01:12.544\nEdward Snowden started leaking information,\n\n00:01:12.544 --> 00:01:14.848\ntop secret classified information,\n\n00:01:14.848 --> 00:01:16.315\nfrom the U.S. intelligence agencies,\n\n00:01:16.315 --> 00:01:18.784\nand we started learning about things like PRISM\n\n00:01:18.784 --> 00:01:22.051\nand XKeyscore and others.\n\n00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:25.156\nAnd these are examples of the kinds of programs\n\n00:01:25.156 --> 00:01:29.435\nU.S. intelligence agencies are running right now,\n\n00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:32.951\nagainst the whole rest of the world.\n\n00:01:32.951 --> 00:01:36.659\nAnd if you look back about the forecasts\n\n00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.760\non surveillance by George Orwell,\n\n00:01:40.775 --> 00:01:42.893\nwell it turns out that\n\n00:01:42.893 --> 00:01:45.397\nGeorge Orwell was an optimist.\n\n00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:47.877\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:47.877 --> 00:01:50.577\nWe are right now seeing a much larger scale\n\n00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:52.475\nof tracking of individual citizens\n\n00:01:52.475 --> 00:01:56.107\nthan he could have ever imagined.\n\n00:01:56.107 --> 00:01:59.642\nAnd this here is the infamous\n\n00:01:59.642 --> 00:02:03.486\nNSA data center in Utah.\n\n00:02:03.486 --> 00:02:06.642\nDue to be opened very soon,\n\n00:02:06.642 --> 00:02:09.433\nit will be both a supercomputing center\n\n00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:11.570\nand a data storage center.\n\n00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.463\nYou could basically imagine it has a large hall\n\n00:02:14.463 --> 00:02:16.919\nfilled with hard drives storing data\n\n00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:19.193\nthey are collecting.\n\n00:02:19.193 --> 00:02:21.350\nAnd it's a pretty big building.\n\n00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.201\nHow big?

Don't let anybody tell you\n\n00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:13.541\nthat we knew this already,\nbecause we did not know this already.\n\n00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:17.314\nOur worst fears might have been something like this,\n\n00:05:17.314 --> 00:05:19.265\nbut we didn't know this was happening.\n\n00:05:19.265 --> 00:05:22.042\nNow we know for a fact it's happening.\n\n00:05:22.042 --> 00:05:24.621\nWe didn't know about this.\nWe didn't know about PRISM.\n\n00:05:24.621 --> 00:05:27.527\nWe didn't know about XKeyscore.\nWe didn't know about Cybertrans.\n\n00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:29.477\nWe didn't know about DoubleArrow.\n\n00:05:29.477 --> 00:05:31.625\nWe did not know about Skywriter --\n\n00:05:31.625 --> 00:05:33.320\nall these different programs\n\n00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.561\nrun by U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\n00:05:36.561 --> 00:05:39.590\nBut now we do.\n\n00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.756\nAnd we did not know\n\n00:05:41.756 --> 00:05:44.831\nthat U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes\n\n00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:48.668\nsuch as infiltrating standardization bodies\n\n00:05:48.668 --> 00:05:53.416\nto sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose.\n\n00:05:53.416 --> 00:05:55.453\nAnd what that means\n\n00:05:55.453 --> 00:05:57.273\nis that you take something which is secure,\n\n00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.694\nan encryption algorithm which is so secure\n\n00:05:59.694 --> 00:06:02.801\nthat if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file,\n\n00:06:02.801 --> 00:06:04.543\nnobody can decrypt that file.\n\n00:06:04.543 --> 00:06:08.956\nEven if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file,\n\n00:06:08.956 --> 00:06:11.016\nit's going to take millions of years.\n\n00:06:11.016 --> 00:06:13.263\nSo that's basically perfectly safe, uncrackable.\n\n00:06:13.263 --> 00:06:15.337\nYou take something which is that good\n\n00:06:15.337 --> 00:06:17.821\nand then you weaken it on purpose,\n\n00:06:17.821 --> 00:06:23.431\nmaking all of us less secure as an end result.\n\n00:06:23.431 --> 00:06:25.562\nA real-world equivalent would be that\n\n00:06:25.562 --> 00:06:28.214\nintelligence agencies would force\n\n00:06:28.214 --> 00:06:31.041\nsome secret pin code into every single house alarm\n\n00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:32.834\nso they could get into every single house\n\n00:06:32.834 --> 00:06:35.080\nbecause, you know, bad people\nmight have house alarms,\n\n00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.519\nbut it will also make all of us\n\n00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:39.748\nless secure as an end result.\n\n00:06:39.748 --> 00:06:43.488\nBackdooring encryption algorithms\n\n00:06:43.488 --> 00:06:46.584\njust boggles the mind.\n\n00:06:46.584 --> 00:06:50.359\nBut of course, these intelligence agencies\nare doing their job.\n\n00:06:50.359 --> 00:06:52.116\nThis is what they have been told to do:\n\n00:06:52.116 --> 00:06:54.346\ndo signals intelligence,\n\n00:06:54.346 --> 00:06:56.358\nmonitor telecommunications,\n\n00:06:56.358 --> 00:06:57.780\nmonitor Internet traffic.\n\n00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.488\nThat's what they're trying to do,\n\n00:06:59.488 --> 00:07:02.570\nand since most, a very big part\nof the Internet traffic today is encrypted,\n\n00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.527\nthey're trying to find ways around the encryption.\n\n00:07:04.527 --> 00:07:07.584\nOne way is to sabotage encryption algorithms,\n\n00:07:07.584 --> 00:07:09.469\nwhich is a great example\n\n00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:11.690\nabout how U.S. intelligence agencies\n\n00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.439\nare running loose.\n\n00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:15.280\nThey are completely out of control,\n\n00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.722\nand they should be brought back under control.\n\n00:07:21.587 --> 00:07:24.537\nSo what do we actually know about the leaks?\n\n00:07:24.537 --> 00:07:26.647\nEverything is based on the files\n\n00:07:26.647 --> 00:07:29.145\nleaked by Mr. Snowden.\n\n00:07:29.145 --> 00:07:31.993\nThe very first PRISM slides\n\n00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:33.982\nfrom the beginning of June\n\n00:07:33.982 --> 00:07:36.076\ndetail a collection program where the data\n\n00:07:36.076 --> 00:07:37.862\nis collected from service providers,\n\n00:07:37.862 --> 00:07:40.740\nand they actually go and name the service providers\n\n00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.071\nthey have access to.\n\n00:07:42.071 --> 00:07:45.013\nThey even have a specific date\n\n00:07:45.013 --> 00:07:47.677\non when the collection of data began\n\n00:07:47.677 --> 00:07:49.316\nfor each of the service providers.\n\n00:07:49.316 --> 00:07:51.603\nSo for example, they name\nthe collection from Microsoft\n\n00:07:51.603 --> 00:07:55.323\nstarted on September 11, 2007,\n\n00:07:55.323 --> 00:07:58.055\nfor Yahoo on the March 12, 2008,\n\n00:07:58.055 --> 00:08:01.071\nand then others: Google, Facebook,\n\n00:08:01.071 --> 00:08:04.315\nSkype, Apple and so on.\n\n00:08:04.315 --> 00:08:07.163\nAnd every single one of these companies denies.\n\n00:08:07.163 --> 00:08:11.558\nThey all say that this simply isn't true,\n\n00:08:11.558 --> 00:08:16.166\nthat they are not giving\nbackdoor access to their data.\n\n00:08:16.166 --> 00:08:20.289\nYet we have these files.\n\n00:08:20.289 --> 00:08:22.610\nSo is one of the parties lying,\n\n00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.933\nor is there some other alternative explanation?\n\n00:08:25.933 --> 00:08:28.855\nAnd one explanation would be\n\n00:08:28.855 --> 00:08:31.742\nthat these parties, these service providers,\n\n00:08:31.742 --> 00:08:33.658\nare not cooperating.\n\n00:08:33.658 --> 00:08:36.679\nInstead, they've been hacked.\n\n00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:39.896\nThat would explain it. They aren't cooperating. They've been hacked.\n\n00:08:39.896 --> 00:08:44.074\nIn this case, they've been hacked\nby their own government.\n\n00:08:44.074 --> 00:08:46.495\nThat might sound outlandish,\n\n00:08:46.495 --> 00:08:48.709\nbut we already have cases where this has happened,\n\n00:08:48.709 --> 00:08:51.755\nfor example, the case of the Flame malware\n\n00:08:51.755 --> 00:08:53.788\nwhich we strongly believe was authored\n\n00:08:53.788 --> 00:08:55.685\nby the U.S. government,\n\n00:08:55.685 --> 00:08:59.584\nand which, to spread, subverted the security\n\n00:08:59.584 --> 00:09:02.470\nof the Windows Update network,\n\n00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:06.563\nmeaning here, the company was hacked\n\n00:09:06.563 --> 00:09:08.921\nby their own government.\n\n00:09:08.921 --> 00:09:10.520\nAnd there's more evidence\n\n00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.071\nsupporting this theory as well.\n\n00:09:13.071 --> 00:09:17.076\nDer Spiegel, from Germany, leaked more information\n\n00:09:17.076 --> 00:09:21.341\nabout the operations run by the elite hacker units\n\n00:09:21.341 --> 00:09:24.376\noperating inside these intelligence agencies.\n\n00:09:24.376 --> 00:09:27.002\nInside NSA, the unit is called TAO,\n\n00:09:27.002 --> 00:09:28.847\nTailored Access Operations,\n\n00:09:28.847 --> 00:09:32.411\nand inside GCHQ, which is the U.K. equivalent,\n\n00:09:32.411 --> 00:09:36.410\nit's called NAC, Network Analysis Centre.\n\n00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:40.254\nAnd these recent leaks of these three slides\n\n00:09:40.254 --> 00:09:42.458\ndetail an operation\n\n00:09:42.458 --> 00:09:45.616\nrun by this GCHQ intelligence agency\n\n00:09:45.616 --> 00:09:47.425\nfrom the United Kingdom\n\n00:09:47.425 --> 00:09:51.658\ntargeting a telecom here in Belgium.\n\n00:09:51.658 --> 00:09:53.934\nAnd what this really means\n\n00:09:53.934 --> 00:09:57.822\nis that an E.U. country's intelligence agency\n\n00:09:57.822 --> 00:10:00.037\nis breaching the security\n\n00:10:00.037 --> 00:10:04.850\nof a telecom of a fellow E.U. country on purpose,\n\n00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:08.685\nand they discuss it in their slides completely casually,\n\n00:10:08.685 --> 00:10:10.286\nbusiness as usual.\n\n00:10:10.286 --> 00:10:11.954\nHere's the primary target,\n\n00:10:11.954 --> 00:10:13.332\nhere's the secondary target,\n\n00:10:13.332 --> 00:10:14.756\nhere's the teaming.\n\n00:10:14.756 --> 00:10:18.612\nThey probably have a team building\non Thursday evening in a pub.\n\n00:10:18.612 --> 00:10:21.653\nThey even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art\n\n00:10:21.653 --> 00:10:23.360\nlike, you know, \"Success,\"\n\n00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.624\nwhen they gain access to services like this.\n\n00:10:26.624 --> 00:10:29.450\nWhat the hell?\n\n00:10:31.643 --> 00:10:33.476\nAnd then there's the argument\n\n00:10:33.476 --> 00:10:35.136\nthat okay, yes, this might be going on,\n\n00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:37.773\nbut then again, other countries are doing it as well.\n\n00:10:37.773 --> 00:10:40.196\nAll countries spy.\n\n00:10:40.196 --> 00:10:41.934\nAnd maybe that's true.\n\n00:10:41.934 --> 00:10:44.372\nMany countries spy, not all of them,\nbut let's take an example.\n\n00:10:44.372 --> 00:10:46.483\nLet's take, for example, Sweden.\n\n00:10:46.483 --> 00:10:47.859\nI'm speaking of Sweden because Sweden\n\n00:10:47.859 --> 00:10:50.138\nhas a little bit of a similar law to the United States.\n\n00:10:50.138 --> 00:10:52.261\nWhen your data traffic goes through Sweden,\n\n00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:55.071\ntheir intelligence agency has a legal right by the law\n\n00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:57.072\nto intercept that traffic.\n\n00:10:57.072 --> 00:11:00.277\nAll right, how many Swedish decisionmakers\n\n00:11:00.277 --> 00:11:03.149\nand politicians and business leaders\n\n00:11:03.149 --> 00:11:06.222\nuse, every day, U.S.-based services,\n\n00:11:06.222 --> 00:11:09.490\nlike, you know, run Windows or OSX,\n\n00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.700\nor use Facebook or LinkedIn,\n\n00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.100\nor store their data in clouds like iCloud\n\n00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.994\nor Skydrive or DropBox,\n\n00:11:18.994 --> 00:11:23.297\nor maybe use online services like\nAmazon web services or sales support?\n\n00:11:23.297 --> 00:11:27.254\nAnd the answer is, every single Swedish\nbusiness leader does that every single day.\n\n00:11:27.254 --> 00:11:28.853\nAnd then we turn it around.\n\n00:11:28.853 --> 00:11:30.758\nHow many American leaders\n\n00:11:30.758 --> 00:11:35.051\nuse Swedish webmails and cloud services?\n\n00:11:35.051 --> 00:11:37.091\nAnd the answer is zero.\n\n00:11:37.091 --> 00:11:39.360\nSo this is not balanced.\n\n00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.985\nIt's not balanced by any means, not even close.\n\n00:11:43.985 --> 00:11:46.426\nAnd when we do have the occasional\n\n00:11:46.426 --> 00:11:48.427\nEuropean success story,\n\n00:11:48.427 --> 00:11:51.993\neven those, then, typically end up being sold\nto the United States.\n\n00:11:51.993 --> 00:11:54.257\nLike, Skype used to be secure.\n\n00:11:54.257 --> 00:11:56.990\nIt used to be end-to-end encrypted.\n\n00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.031\nThen it was sold to the United States.\n\n00:11:59.031 --> 00:12:01.680\nToday, it no longer is secure.\n\n00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.901\nSo once again, we take something which is secure\n\n00:12:04.901 --> 00:12:06.771\nand then we make it less secure on purpose,\n\n00:12:06.771 --> 00:12:11.255\nmaking all of us less secure as an outcome.\n\n00:12:12.813 --> 00:12:15.060\nAnd then the argument that the United States\n\n00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.078\nis only fighting terrorists.\n\n00:12:17.078 --> 00:12:18.244\nIt's the war on terror.\n\n00:12:18.244 --> 00:12:20.791\nYou shouldn't worry about it.\n\n00:12:20.791 --> 00:12:23.021\nWell, it's not the war on terror.\n\n00:12:23.021 --> 00:12:25.194\nYes, part of it is war on terror, and yes,\n\n00:12:25.194 --> 00:12:28.170\nthere are terrorists, and they do kill and maim,\n\n00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:29.721\nand we should fight them,\n\n00:12:29.721 --> 00:12:31.327\nbut we know through these leaks\n\n00:12:31.327 --> 00:12:33.909\nthat they have used the same techniques\n\n00:12:33.909 --> 00:12:37.245\nto listen to phone calls of European leaders,\n\n00:12:37.245 --> 00:12:40.700\nto tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil,\n\n00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:45.506\nto read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament,\n\n00:12:45.506 --> 00:12:48.660\nand I don't think they are trying to find terrorists\n\n00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.678\nfrom inside the E.U. Parliament, right?\n\n00:12:51.678 --> 00:12:53.626\nIt's not the war on terror.\n\n00:12:53.626 --> 00:12:57.768\nPart of it might be, and there are terrorists,\n\n00:12:57.768 --> 00:13:00.195\nbut are we really thinking about terrorists\n\n00:13:00.195 --> 00:13:02.364\nas such an existential threat\n\n00:13:02.364 --> 00:13:06.040\nthat we are willing to do anything at all to fight them?\n\n00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.531\nAre the Americans ready\nto throw away the Constituion\n\n00:13:09.531 --> 00:13:13.772\nand throw it in the trash\njust because there are terrorists?\n\n00:13:13.772 --> 00:13:16.296\nAnd the same thing with the Bill of Rights\nand all the amendments\n\n00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:18.613\nand the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n\n00:13:18.613 --> 00:13:23.764\nand the E.U. conventions on human rights\nand fundamental freedoms\n\n00:13:23.764 --> 00:13:25.281\nand the press freedom?\n\n00:13:25.281 --> 00:13:29.096\nDo we really think terrorism\nis such an existential threat,\n\n00:13:29.096 --> 00:13:32.222\nwe are ready to do anything at all?\n\n00:13:34.448 --> 00:13:37.112\nBut people are scared about terrorists,\n\n00:13:37.112 --> 00:13:39.526\nand then they think that\nmaybe that surveillance is okay\n\n00:13:39.526 --> 00:13:41.570\nbecause they have nothing to hide.\n\n00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.277\nFeel free to survey me if that helps.\n\n00:13:44.277 --> 00:13:47.165\nAnd whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide\n\n00:13:47.165 --> 00:13:51.878\nsimply hasn't thought about this long enough.\n\n00:13:54.478 --> 00:14:00.343\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:00.343 --> 00:14:03.115\nBecause we have this thing called privacy,\n\n00:14:03.115 --> 00:14:05.460\nand if you really think that you have nothing to hide,\n\n00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.676\nplease make sure that's the first thing you tell me,\n\n00:14:07.676 --> 00:14:09.226\nbecause then I know\n\n00:14:09.226 --> 00:14:10.866\nthat I should not trust you with any secrets,\n\n00:14:10.866 --> 00:14:14.164\nbecause obviously you can't keep a secret.\n\n00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:20.852\nBut people are brutally honest with the Internet,\n\n00:14:20.852 --> 00:14:23.548\nand when these leaks started,\n\n00:14:23.548 --> 00:14:25.426\nmany people were asking me about this.\n\n00:14:25.426 --> 00:14:27.000\nAnd I have nothing to hide.\n\n00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.290\nI'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal.\n\n00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:33.075\nYet, I have nothing that I would in particular\n\n00:14:33.075 --> 00:14:35.868\nlike to share with an intelligence agency,\n\n00:14:35.868 --> 00:14:40.005\nespecially a foreign intelligence agency.\n\n00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:42.860\nAnd if we indeed need a Big Brother,\n\n00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.338\nI would much rather have a domestic Big Brother\n\n00:14:46.338 --> 00:14:49.498\nthan a foreign Big Brother.\n\n00:14:49.503 --> 00:14:54.562\nAnd when the leaks started,\nthe very first thing I tweeted about this\n\n00:14:54.562 --> 00:14:56.636\nwas a comment about how,\n\n00:14:56.636 --> 00:14:58.324\nwhen you've been using search engines,\n\n00:14:58.324 --> 00:15:01.973\nyou've been potentially leaking all that\nto U.S. intelligence.\n\n00:15:01.973 --> 00:15:03.945\nAnd two minutes later, I got a reply\n\n00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:06.281\nby somebody called Kimberly from the United States\n\n00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:08.448\nchallenging me, like, why am I worried about this?\n\n00:15:08.461 --> 00:15:12.493\nWhat am I sending to worry about this?\nAm I sending naked pictures or something?\n\n00:15:12.493 --> 00:15:14.461\nAnd my answer to Kimberly was\n\n00:15:14.461 --> 00:15:17.490\nthat what I'm sending is none of your business,\n\n00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:21.755\nand it should be none\nof your government's business either.\n\n00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:24.007\nBecause that's what it's about.

He proposed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions that we are all aware of. That is in addition to left, right, back, forth and up, down, Kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason we don't yet see. Now, when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea, sometimes that's all it is \u2014 bold and bizarre, but it has nothing to do with the world around us. This particular idea, however \u2014 although we don't yet know whether it's right or wrong, and at the end I'll discuss experiments which, in the next few years, may tell us whether it's right or wrong \u2014 this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century and continues to inform a lot of cutting-edge research.So, I'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions. So where do we go? To begin we need a little bit of back story. Go to 1907. This is a year when Einstein is basking in the glow of having discovered the special theory of relativity and decides to take on a new project, to try to understand fully the grand, pervasive force of gravity. And in that moment, there are many people around who thought that that project had already been resolved. Newton had given the world a theory of gravity in the late 1600s that works well, describes the motion of planets, the motion of the moon and so forth, the motion of apocryphal of apples falling from trees, hitting people on the head. All of that could be described using Newton's work.But Einstein realized that Newton had left something out of the story, because even Newton had written that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity, he'd been unable to figure out how it really works. How is it that the Sun, 93 million miles away, [that] somehow it affects the motion of the Earth? How does the Sun reach out across empty inert space and exert influence? And that is a task to which Einstein set himself \u2014 to figure out how gravity works. And let me show you what it is that he found. So Einstein found that the medium that transmits gravity is space itself. The idea goes like this: imagine space is a substrate of all there is.Einstein said space is nice and flat, if there's no matter present. But if there is matter in the environment, such as the Sun, it causes the fabric of space to warp, to curve. And that communicates the force of gravity. Even the Earth warps space around it. Now look at the Moon. The Moon is kept in orbit, according to these ideas, because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment that the Sun and the Moon and the Earth can all create by virtue of their presence. We go to a full-frame view of this. The Earth itself is kept in orbit because it rolls along a valley in the environment that's curved because of the Sun's presence. That is this new idea about how gravity actually works.Now, this idea was tested in 1919 through astronomical observations. It really works. It describes the data. And this gained Einstein prominence around the world. And that is what got Kaluza thinking. He, like Einstein, was in search of what we call a unified theory. That's one theory that might be able to describe all of nature's forces from one set of ideas, one set of principles, one master equation, if you will. So Kaluza said to himself, Einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of warps and curves in space \u2014 in fact, space and time, to be more precise. Maybe I can play the same game with the other known force, which was, at that time, known as the electromagnetic force \u2014 we know of others today, but at that time that was the only other one people were thinking about. You know, the force responsible for electricity and magnetic attraction and so forth.So Kaluza says, maybe I can play the same game and describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves. That raised a question: warps and curves in what? Einstein had already used up space and time, warps and curves, to describe gravity. There didn't seem to be anything else to warp or curve. So Kaluza said, well, maybe there are more dimensions of space. He said, if I want to describe one more force, maybe I need one more dimension. So he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space, not three, and imagined that electromagnetism was warps and curves in that fourth dimension. Now here's the thing: when he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves in a universe with four space dimensions, not three, he found the old equations that Einstein had already derived in three dimensions \u2014 those were for gravity \u2014 but he found one more equation because of the one more dimension. And when he looked at that equation, it was none other than the equation that scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force. Amazing \u2014 it just popped out. He was so excited by this realization that he ran around his house screaming, \"Victory!\" \u2014 that he had found the unified theory.Now clearly, Kaluza was a man who took theory very seriously. He, in fact \u2014 there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim, he read a book, a treatise on swimming \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 then dove into the ocean. This is a man who would risk his life on theory. Now, but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded, two questions immediately arise from his observation. Number one: if there are more dimensions in space, where are they? We don't seem to see them. And number two: does this theory really work in detail, when you try to apply it to the world around us? Now, the first question was answered in 1926 by a fellow named Oskar Klein. He suggested that dimensions might come in two varieties \u2014 there might be big, easy-to-see dimensions, but there might also be tiny, curled-up dimensions, curled up so small, even though they're all around us, that we don't see them.Let me show you that one visually. So, imagine you're looking at something like a cable supporting a traffic light. It's in Manhattan. You're in Central Park \u2014 it's kind of irrelevant \u2014 but the cable looks one-dimensional from a distant viewpoint, but you and I all know that it does have some thickness. It's very hard to see it, though, from far away. But if we zoom in and take the perspective of, say, a little ant walking around \u2014 little ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions \u2014 the long dimension, but also this clockwise, counter-clockwise direction. And I hope you appreciate this. It took so long to get these ants to do this.(Laughter)But this illustrates the fact that dimensions can be of two sorts: big and small. And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can easily see, but there might be additional dimensions curled up, sort of like the circular part of that cable, so small that they have so far remained invisible. Let me show you what that would look like. So, if we take a look, say, at space itself \u2014 I can only show, of course, two dimensions on a screen. Some of you guys will fix that one day, but anything that's not flat on a screen is a new dimension, goes smaller, smaller, smaller, and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself, this is the idea, you could have additional curled up dimensions \u2014here is a little shape of a circle \u2014 so small that we don't see them. But if you were a little ultra microscopic ant walking around, you could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about \u2014 that's like the grid part \u2014 but you could also access the tiny curled-up dimension that's so small that we can't see it with the naked eye or even with any of our most refined equipment. But deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself, the idea is there could be more dimensions, as we see there. Now that's an explanation about how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see. But what about the second question that I asked: does the theory actually work when you try to apply it to the real world?Well, it turns out that Einstein and Kaluza and many others worked on trying to refine this framework and apply it to the physics of the universe as was understood at the time, and, in detail, it didn't work. In detail, for instance, they couldn't get the mass of the electron to work out correctly in this theory. So many people worked on it, but by the '40s, certainly by the '50s, this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away. Until something wonderful happened in our age. In our era, a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself, many others around the world, it's called superstring theory, as you were indicating. And the wonderful thing is that superstring theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions, but when we study superstring theory, we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling, new form.So, let me just tell you how that goes. Superstring theory \u2014 what is it? Well, it's a theory that tries to answer the question: what are the basic, fundamental, indivisible, uncuttable constituents making up everything in the world around us? The idea is like this. So, imagine we look at a familiar object, just a candle in a holder, and imagine that we want to figure out what it is made of. So we go on a journey deep inside the object and examine the constituents. So deep inside \u2014 we all know, you go sufficiently far down, you have atoms. We also all know that atoms are not the end of the story. They have little electrons that swarm around a central nucleus with neutrons and protons. Even the neutrons and protons have smaller particles inside of them known as quarks. That is where conventional ideas stop.Here is the new idea of string theory. Deep inside any of these particles, there is something else. This something else is this dancing filament of energy. It looks like a vibrating string \u2014 that's where the idea, string theory comes from. And just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello can vibrate in different patterns, these can also vibrate in different patterns. They don't produce different musical notes. Rather, they produce the different particles making up the world around us. So if these ideas are correct, this is what the ultra-microscopic landscape of the universe looks like. It's built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy, vibrating in different frequencies. The different frequencies produce the different particles. The different particles are responsible for all the richness in the world around us.And there you see unification, because matter particles, electrons and quarks, radiation particles, photons, gravitons, are all built up from one entity. So matter and the forces of nature all are put together under the rubric of vibrating strings. And that's what we mean by a unified theory. Now here is the catch. When you study the mathematics of string theory, you find that it doesn't work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space. It doesn't work in a universe with four dimensions of space, nor five, nor six. Finally, you can study the equations, and show that it works only in a universe that has 10 dimensions of space and one dimension of time. It leads us right back to this idea of Kaluza and Klein \u2014 that our world, when appropriately described, has more dimensions than the ones that we see.Now you might think about that and say, well, OK, you know, if you have extra dimensions, and they're really tightly curled up, yeah, perhaps we won't see them, if they're small enough. But if there's a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there, and you make them small enough, and we won't see them either. That is true. One of the other predictions of string theory \u2014 no, that's not one of the other predictions of string theory.(Laughter)But it raises the question: are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions, or do they tell us something about the world? In the remaining time, I'd like to tell you two features of them. First is, many of us believe that these extra dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question in theoretical physics, theoretical science. And that question is this: when we look around the world, as scientists have done for the last hundred years, there appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe. These are numbers like the mass of the particles, like electrons and quarks, the strength of gravity, the strength of the electromagnetic force \u2014 a list of about 20 numbers that have been measured with incredible precision, but nobody has an explanation for why the numbers have the particular values that they do.Now, does string theory offer an answer? Not yet. But we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do may rely on the form of the extra dimensions. And the wonderful thing is, if those numbers had any other values than the known ones, the universe, as we know it, wouldn't exist. This is a deep question. Why are those numbers so finely tuned to allow stars to shine and planets to form, when we recognize that if you fiddle with those numbers \u2014 if I had 20 dials up here and I let you come up and fiddle with those numbers, almost any fiddling makes the universe disappear. So can we explain those 20 numbers? And string theory suggests that those 20 numbers have to do with the extra dimensions. Let me show you how. So when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory, it's not one extra dimension, as in the older ideas of Kaluza and Klein. This is what string theory says about the extra dimensions. They have a very rich, intertwined geometry.This is an example of something known as a Calabi-Yau shape \u2014 name isn't all that important. But, as you can see, the extra dimensions fold in on themselves and intertwine in a very interesting shape, interesting structure. And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like, then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales. When you swing your hand, you'd be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again, but they're so small that we wouldn't know it. So what is the physical implication, though, relevant to those 20 numbers?Consider this. If you look at the instrument, a French horn, notice that the vibrations of the airstreams are affected by the shape of the instrument. Now in string theory, all the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate. So just as those airstreams are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument, strings themselves will be affected by the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving. So let me bring some strings into the story. And if you watch these little fellows vibrating around \u2014 they'll be there in a second \u2014 right there, notice that they way they vibrate is affected by the geometry of the extra dimensions.So, if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like \u2014 we don't yet, but if we did \u2014 we should be able to calculate the allowed notes, the allowed vibrational patterns. And if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns, we should be able to calculate those 20 numbers. And if the answer that we get from our calculations agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determined through detailed and precise experimentation, this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe is the way it is. Now, the second issue that I want to finish up with is: how might we test for these extra dimensions more directly? Is this just an interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some previously unexplained features of the world, or can we actually test for these extra dimensions? And we think \u2014 and this is, I think, very exciting \u2014 that in the next five years or so we may be able to test for the existence of these extra dimensions.Here's how it goes. In CERN, Geneva, Switzerland, a machine is being built called the Large Hadron Collider. It's a machine that will send particles around a tunnel, opposite directions, near the speed of light. Every so often those particles will be aimed at each other, so there's a head-on collision. The hope is that if the collision has enough energy, it may eject some of the debris from the collision from our dimensions, forcing it to enter into the other dimensions. How would we know it? Well, we'll measure the amount of energy after the collision, compare it to the amount of energy before, and if there's less energy after the collision than before, this will be evidence that the energy has drifted away. And if it drifts away in the right pattern that we can calculate, this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there.Let me show you that idea visually. So, imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton \u2014 that's the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out, if the extra dimensions are real. But here's how the experiment will go. You take these particles. You slam them together. You slam them together, and if we are right, some of the energy of that collision will go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions. So this is the kind of experiment that we'll be looking at in the next five, seven to 10 years or so. And if this experiment bears fruit, if we see that kind of particle ejected by noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions than when we began, this will show that the extra dimensions are real.And to me this is a really remarkable story, and a remarkable opportunity. Going back to Newton with absolute space \u2014 didn't provide anything but an arena, a stage in which the events of the universe take place. Einstein comes along and says, well, space and time can warp and curve \u2014 that's what gravity is. And now string theory comes along and says, yes, gravity, quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, all together in one package, but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see. And this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime. Amazing possibility. Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 251, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nIn the year 1919,\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:21.958\na virtually unknown German mathematician, named Theodor Kaluza\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nsuggested a very bold and, in some ways, a very bizarre idea.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nHe proposed that our universe\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nmight actually have more than the three dimensions\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nthat we are all aware of.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nThat is in addition to left, right, back, forth and up, down,\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nKaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nthat for some reason we don't yet see.\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nNow, when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nsometimes that's all it is -- bold and bizarre,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nbut it has nothing to do with the world around us.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nThis particular idea, however --\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nalthough we don't yet know whether it's right or wrong,\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nand at the end I'll discuss experiments which, in the next few years,\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nmay tell us whether it's right or wrong --\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nthis idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nand continues to inform a lot of cutting-edge research.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nSo, I'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nSo where do we go?\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nTo begin we need a little bit of back story. Go to 1907.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nThis is a year when Einstein is basking in the glow\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nof having discovered the special theory of relativity\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nand decides to take on a new project,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nto try to understand fully the grand, pervasive force of gravity.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nAnd in that moment, there are many people around\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nwho thought that that project had already been resolved.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nNewton had given the world a theory of gravity in the late 1600s\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nthat works well, describes the motion of planets,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nthe motion of the moon and so forth,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nthe motion of apocryphal of apples falling from trees,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nhitting people on the head.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nAll of that could be described using Newton's work.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nBut Einstein realized that Newton had left something out of the story,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nbecause even Newton had written\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nthat although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nhe'd been unable to figure out how it really works.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nHow is it that the Sun, 93 million miles away,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\n[that] somehow it affects the motion of the Earth?\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nHow does the Sun reach out across empty inert space and exert influence?\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nAnd that is a task to which Einstein set himself --\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nto figure out how gravity works.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nAnd let me show you what it is that he found.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nSo Einstein found\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nthat the medium that transmits gravity is space itself.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nThe idea goes like this:\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nimagine space is a substrate of all there is.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nEinstein said space is nice and flat, if there's no matter present.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nBut if there is matter in the environment, such as the Sun,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nit causes the fabric of space to warp, to curve.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nAnd that communicates the force of gravity.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nEven the Earth warps space around it.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nNow look at the Moon.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nThe Moon is kept in orbit, according to these ideas,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nbecause it rolls along a valley in the curved environment\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nthat the Sun and the Moon and the Earth can all create by virtue of their presence.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nWe go to a full-frame view of this.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nThe Earth itself is kept in orbit\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nbecause it rolls along a valley in the environment that's curved\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nbecause of the Sun's presence.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nThat is this new idea about how gravity actually works.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nNow, this idea was tested in 1919 through astronomical observations.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nIt really works. It describes the data.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nAnd this gained Einstein prominence around the world.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nAnd that is what got Kaluza thinking.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nHe, like Einstein, was in search of what we call a unified theory.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nThat's one theory\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthat might be able to describe all of nature's forces from one set of ideas,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:01.958\none set of principles, one master equation, if you will.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nSo Kaluza said to himself,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nEinstein has been able to describe gravity\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nin terms of warps and curves in space --\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nin fact, space and time, to be more precise.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nMaybe I can play the same game with the other known force,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nwhich was, at that time, known as the electromagnetic force --\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nwe know of others today, but at that time\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nthat was the only other one people were thinking about.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nYou know, the force responsible for electricity\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nand magnetic attraction and so forth.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nSo Kaluza says, maybe I can play the same game\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nand describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nThat raised a question: warps and curves in what?\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nEinstein had already used up space and time,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nwarps and curves, to describe gravity.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nThere didn't seem to be anything else to warp or curve.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nSo Kaluza said, well, maybe there are more dimensions of space.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nHe said, if I want to describe one more force,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nmaybe I need one more dimension.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nSo he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space, not three,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nand imagined that electromagnetism was warps and curves\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nin that fourth dimension. Now here's the thing:\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nwhen he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nin a universe with four space dimensions, not three,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nhe found the old equations that Einstein had already derived in three dimensions --\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nthose were for gravity --\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nbut he found one more equation because of the one more dimension.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nAnd when he looked at that equation,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nit was none other than the equation\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nthat scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nAmazing -- it just popped out.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nHe was so excited by this realization\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nthat he ran around his house screaming, \"Victory!\" --\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nthat he had found the unified theory.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nNow clearly, Kaluza was a man who took theory very seriously.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nHe, in fact --\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nthere is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim,\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nhe read a book, a treatise on swimming --\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\n-- then dove into the ocean.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nThis is a man who would risk his life on theory.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nNow, but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\ntwo questions immediately arise from his observation.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nNumber one: if there are more dimensions in space, where are they?\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nWe don't seem to see them.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nAnd number two: does this theory really work in detail,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nwhen you try to apply it to the world around us?\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nNow, the first question was answered in 1926\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nby a fellow named Oskar Klein.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nHe suggested that dimensions might come in two varieties --\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nthere might be big, easy-to-see dimensions,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nbut there might also be tiny, curled-up dimensions,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\ncurled up so small, even though they're all around us,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nthat we don't see them.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nLet me show you that one visually.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nSo, imagine you're looking at something\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nlike a cable supporting a traffic light.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nIt's in Manhattan. You're in Central Park -- it's kind of irrelevant --\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nbut the cable looks one-dimensional from a distant viewpoint,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nbut you and I all know that it does have some thickness.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nIt's very hard to see it, though, from far away.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nBut if we zoom in and take the perspective of, say,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\na little ant walking around --\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nlittle ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions --\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nthe long dimension,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nbut also this clockwise, counter-clockwise direction.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nAnd I hope you appreciate this.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nIt took so long to get these ants to do this.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nBut this illustrates the fact that dimensions can be of two sorts:\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nbig and small. And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nare the ones that we can easily see,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nbut there might be additional dimensions curled up,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nsort of like the circular part of that cable,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nso small that they have so far remained invisible.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nLet me show you what that would look like.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nSo, if we take a look, say, at space itself --\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nI can only show, of course, two dimensions on a screen.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nSome of you guys will fix that one day,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nbut anything that's not flat on a screen is a new dimension,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\ngoes smaller, smaller, smaller,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nand way down in the microscopic depths of space itself,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nthis is the idea,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nyou could have additional curled up dimensions --\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nhere is a little shape of a circle -- so small that we don't see them.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nBut if you were a little ultra microscopic ant walking around,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nyou could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about --\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nthat's like the grid part --\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nbut you could also access the tiny curled-up dimension\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nthat's so small that we can't see it with the naked eye\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nor even with any of our most refined equipment.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nBut deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nthe idea is there could be more dimensions, as we see there.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nNow that's an explanation\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nabout how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nBut what about the second question that I asked:\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\ndoes the theory actually work\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nwhen you try to apply it to the real world?\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nWell, it turns out that Einstein and Kaluza and many others\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nworked on trying to refine this framework\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nand apply it to the physics of the universe\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nas was understood at the time, and, in detail, it didn't work.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nIn detail, for instance,\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nthey couldn't get the mass of the electron\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nto work out correctly in this theory.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nSo many people worked on it, but by the '40s, certainly by the '50s,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nthis strange but very compelling idea\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nof how to unify the laws of physics had gone away.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nUntil something wonderful happened in our age.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nIn our era, a new approach to unify the laws of physics\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nis being pursued by physicists such as myself,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nmany others around the world,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nit's called superstring theory, as you were indicating.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nAnd the wonderful thing is that superstring theory\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nhas nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nbut when we study superstring theory,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nwe find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling, new form.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nSo, let me just tell you how that goes.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nSuperstring theory -- what is it?\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nWell, it's a theory that tries to answer the question:\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nwhat are the basic, fundamental, indivisible, uncuttable constituents\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nmaking up everything in the world around us?\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nThe idea is like this.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nSo, imagine we look at a familiar object, just a candle in a holder,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nand imagine that we want to figure out what it is made of.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nSo we go on a journey deep inside the object and examine the constituents.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nSo deep inside -- we all know, you go sufficiently far down, you have atoms.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nWe also all know that atoms are not the end of the story.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nThey have little electrons that swarm around a central nucleus\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nwith neutrons and protons.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nEven the neutrons and protons have smaller particles inside of them known as quarks.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nThat is where conventional ideas stop.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nHere is the new idea of string theory.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nDeep inside any of these particles, there is something else.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nThis something else is this dancing filament of energy.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nIt looks like a vibrating string --\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nthat's where the idea, string theory comes from.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nAnd just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\ncan vibrate in different patterns,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nthese can also vibrate in different patterns.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nThey don't produce different musical notes.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nRather, they produce the different particles making up the world around us.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nSo if these ideas are correct,\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nthis is what the ultra-microscopic landscape of the universe looks like.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nIt's built up of a huge number\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nof these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nvibrating in different frequencies.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nThe different frequencies produce the different particles.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nThe different particles are responsible\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nfor all the richness in the world around us.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nAnd there you see unification,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nbecause matter particles, electrons and quarks,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nradiation particles, photons, gravitons, are all built up from one entity.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nSo matter and the forces of nature all are put together\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nunder the rubric of vibrating strings.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nAnd that's what we mean by a unified theory.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nNow here is the catch.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nWhen you study the mathematics of string theory,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nyou find that it doesn't work\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nin a universe that just has three dimensions of space.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nIt doesn't work in a universe with four dimensions of space, nor five, nor six.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nFinally, you can study the equations, and show that it works\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nonly in a universe that has 10 dimensions of space\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nand one dimension of time.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nIt leads us right back to this idea of Kaluza and Klein --\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nthat our world, when appropriately described,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nhas more dimensions than the ones that we see.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nNow you might think about that and say, well,\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nOK, you know, if you have extra dimensions, and they're really tightly curled up,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nyeah, perhaps we won't see them, if they're small enough.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nBut if there's a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nand you make them small enough, and we won't see them either. That is true.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nOne of the other predictions of string theory --\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nno, that's not one of the other predictions of string theory.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nBut it raises the question:\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nare we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nor do they tell us something about the world?\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nIn the remaining time, I'd like to tell you two features of them.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nFirst is, many of us believe that these extra dimensions\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nhold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nin theoretical physics, theoretical science.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nAnd that question is this: when we look around the world,\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nas scientists have done for the last hundred years,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nthere appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nThese are numbers like the mass of the particles,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nlike electrons and quarks, the strength of gravity,\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nthe strength of the electromagnetic force --\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\na list of about 20 numbers\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nthat have been measured with incredible precision,\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nbut nobody has an explanation\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nfor why the numbers have the particular values that they do.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nNow, does string theory offer an answer?\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nNot yet.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nBut we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nmay rely on the form of the extra dimensions.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nAnd the wonderful thing is, if those numbers\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nhad any other values than the known ones,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nthe universe, as we know it, wouldn't exist.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nThis is a deep question.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nWhy are those numbers so finely tuned\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nto allow stars to shine and planets to form,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nwhen we recognize that if you fiddle with those numbers --\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nif I had 20 dials up here\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nand I let you come up and fiddle with those numbers,\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nalmost any fiddling makes the universe disappear.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nSo can we explain those 20 numbers?\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nAnd string theory suggests that those 20 numbers\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nhave to do with the extra dimensions.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nLet me show you how.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nSo when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nit's not one extra dimension,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nas in the older ideas of Kaluza and Klein.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nThis is what string theory says about the extra dimensions.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nThey have a very rich, intertwined geometry.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nThis is an example of something known as a Calabi-Yau shape --\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nname isn't all that important.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nBut, as you can see,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nthe extra dimensions fold in on themselves\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nand intertwine in a very interesting shape, interesting structure.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nAnd the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nthen the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nwould look like this on the tiniest of scales.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nWhen you swing your hand,\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nyou'd be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again,\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nbut they're so small that we wouldn't know it.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nSo what is the physical implication, though, relevant to those 20 numbers?\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nConsider this. If you look at the instrument, a French horn,\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nnotice that the vibrations of the airstreams\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nare affected by the shape of the instrument.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nNow in string theory,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nall the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nSo just as those airstreams\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nare affected by the twists and turns in the instrument,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nstrings themselves will be affected\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nby the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nSo let me bring some strings into the story.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nAnd if you watch these little fellows vibrating around --\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nthey'll be there in a second -- right there,\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nnotice that they way they vibrate is affected\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nby the geometry of the extra dimensions.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nSo, if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like --\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nwe don't yet, but if we did --\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nwe should be able to calculate the allowed notes,\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nthe allowed vibrational patterns.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nAnd if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nwe should be able to calculate those 20 numbers.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nAnd if the answer that we get from our calculations\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nagrees with the values of those numbers\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nthat have been determined\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nthrough detailed and precise experimentation,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nthis in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nfor why the structure of the universe is the way it is.\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nNow, the second issue that I want to finish up with is:\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nhow might we test for these extra dimensions more directly?\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nIs this just an interesting mathematical structure\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nthat might be able to explain\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nsome previously unexplained features of the world,\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nor can we actually test for these extra dimensions?\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nAnd we think -- and this is, I think, very exciting --\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nthat in the next five years or so we may be able to test\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nfor the existence of these extra dimensions.\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nHere's how it goes. In CERN, Geneva, Switzerland,\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:52.958\na machine is being built called the Large Hadron Collider.\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nIt's a machine that will send particles around a tunnel,\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nopposite directions, near the speed of light.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nEvery so often those particles will be aimed at each other,\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nso there's a head-on collision.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nThe hope is that if the collision has enough energy,\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nit may eject some of the debris from the collision\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nfrom our dimensions, forcing it to enter into the other dimensions.\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nHow would we know it?\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nWell, we'll measure the amount of energy after the collision,\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\ncompare it to the amount of energy before,\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nand if there's less energy after the collision than before,\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nthis will be evidence that the energy has drifted away.\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nAnd if it drifts away in the right pattern that we can calculate,\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nthis will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there.\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nLet me show you that idea visually.\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nSo, imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton --\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nthat's the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out,\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nif the extra dimensions are real.\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nBut here's how the experiment will go.\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nYou take these particles. You slam them together.\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nYou slam them together, and if we are right,\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nsome of the energy of that collision\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nwill go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions.\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nSo this is the kind of experiment\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nthat we'll be looking at in the next five, seven to 10 years or so.\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nAnd if this experiment bears fruit,\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nif we see that kind of particle ejected\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:12.958\nby noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nthan when we began,\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nthis will show that the extra dimensions are real.\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nAnd to me this is a really remarkable story,\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nand a remarkable opportunity. Going back to Newton with absolute space --\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\ndidn't provide anything but an arena, a stage\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nin which the events of the universe take place.\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nEinstein comes along and says,\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nwell, space and time can warp and curve -- that's what gravity is.\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nAnd now string theory comes along and says,\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nyes, gravity, quantum mechanics, electromagnetism,\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nall together in one package,\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:46.958\nbut only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see.\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nAnd this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime.\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nAmazing possibility.\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:19:02.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "CERN's supercollider", "duration": "899", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/brian_cox_on_cern_s_supercollider", "transcript": "This is the Large Hadron Collider.

You get some sense of the size \u2014 you can just see these EU standard-size people underneath.(Laughter)You get some sense of the size: 44 meters wide, 22 meters in diameter, 7,000 tons. And we re-create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began up to 600 million times a second inside that detector \u2014 immense numbers. And if you see those metal bits there \u2014 those are huge magnets that bend electrically charged particles, so it can measure how fast they're traveling. This is a picture about a year ago. Those magnets are in there. And, again, a EU standard-size, real person, so you get some sense of the scale. And it's in there that those mini-Big Bangs will be created, sometime in the summer this year.And actually, this morning, I got an email saying that we've just finished, today, building the last piece of ATLAS. So as of today, it's finished. I'd like to say that I planned that for TED, but I didn't. So it's been completed as of today.(Applause)Yeah, it's a wonderful achievement. So, you might be asking, \"Why? Why create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began?\" Well, particle physicists are nothing if not ambitious. And the aim of particle physics is to understand what everything's made of, and how everything sticks together. And by everything I mean, of course, me and you, the Earth, the Sun, the 100 billion suns in our galaxy and the 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe. Absolutely everything.Now you might say, \"Well, OK, but why not just look at it? You know? If you want to know what I'm made of, let's look at me.\" Well, we found that as you look back in time, the universe gets hotter and hotter, denser and denser, and simpler and simpler. Now, there's no real reason I'm aware of for that, but that seems to be the case. So, way back in the early times of the universe, we believe it was very simple and understandable. All this complexity, all the way to these wonderful things \u2014 human brains \u2014 are a property of an old and cold and complicated universe. Back at the start, in the first billionth of a second, we believe, or we've observed, it was very simple.It's almost like ... imagine a snowflake in your hand, and you look at it, and it's an incredibly complicated, beautiful object. But as you heat it up, it'll melt into a pool of water, and you would be able to see that, actually, it was just made of H20, water. So it's in that same sense that we look back in time to understand what the universe is made of. And, as of today, it's made of these things. Just 12 particles of matter, stuck together by four forces of nature. The quarks, these pink things, are the things that make up protons and neutrons that make up the atomic nuclei in your body. The electron \u2014 the thing that goes around the atomic nucleus \u2014 held around in orbit, by the way, by the electromagnetic force that's carried by this thing, the photon. The quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons.And these guys, here, they're the weak nuclear force, probably the least familiar. But, without it, the sun wouldn't shine. And when the sun shines, you get copious quantities of these things, called neutrinos, pouring out. Actually, if you just look at your thumbnail \u2014 about a square centimeter \u2014 there are something like 60 billion neutrinos per second from the sun, passing through every square centimeter of your body. But you don't feel them, because the weak force is correctly named \u2014 very short range and very weak, so they just fly through you.And these particles have been discovered over the last century, pretty much. The first one, the electron, was discovered in 1897, and the last one, this thing called the tau neutrino, in the year 2000. Actually just \u2014 I was going to say, just up the road in Chicago. I know it's a big country, America, isn't it? Just up the road. Relative to the universe, it's just up the road.(Laughter)So, this thing was discovered in the year 2000, so it's a relatively recent picture. One of the wonderful things, actually, I find, is that we've discovered any of them, when you realize how tiny they are. You know, they're a step in size from the entire observable universe. So, 100 billion galaxies, 13.7 billion light years away \u2014 a step in size from that to Monterey, actually, is about the same as from Monterey to these things. Absolutely, exquisitely minute, and yet we've discovered pretty much the full set.So, one of my most illustrious forebears at Manchester University, Ernest Rutherford, discoverer of the atomic nucleus, once said, \"All science is either physics or stamp collecting.\" Now, I don't think he meant to insult the rest of science, although he was from New Zealand, so it's possible.(Laughter)But what he meant was that what we've done, really, is stamp collect there. OK, we've discovered the particles, but unless you understand the underlying reason for that pattern \u2014 you know, why it's built the way it is \u2014 really you've done stamp collecting. You haven't done science. Fortunately, we have probably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century that underpins that pattern. It's the Newton's laws, if you want, of particle physics. It's called the standard model \u2014 beautifully simple mathematical equation. You could stick it on the front of a T-shirt, which is always the sign of elegance. This is it.(Laughter)I've been a little disingenuous, because I've expanded it out in all its gory detail. This equation, though, allows you to calculate everything \u2014 other than gravity \u2014 that happens in the universe. So, you want to know why the sky is blue, why atomic nuclei stick together \u2014 in principle, you've got a big enough computer \u2014 why DNA is the shape it is. In principle, you should be able to calculate it from that equation.But there's a problem. Can anyone see what it is? A bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me. I'll make it easier, actually, by blowing one of the lines up. Basically, each of these terms refers to some of the particles. So those Ws there refer to the Ws, and how they stick together. These carriers of the weak force, the Zs, the same. But there's an extra symbol in this equation: H. Right, H. H stands for Higgs particle. Higgs particles have not been discovered. But they're necessary: they're necessary to make that mathematics work. So all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation wouldn't be possible without an extra bit. So it's a prediction: a prediction of a new particle.What does it do? Well, we had a long time to come up with good analogies. And back in the 1980s, when we wanted the money for the LHC from the U.K. government, Margaret Thatcher, at the time, said, \"If you guys can explain, in language a politician can understand, what the hell it is that you're doing, you can have the money. I want to know what this Higgs particle does.\" And we came up with this analogy, and it seemed to work. Well, what the Higgs does is, it gives mass to the fundamental particles. And the picture is that the whole universe \u2014 and that doesn't mean just space, it means me as well, and inside you \u2014 the whole universe is full of something called a Higgs field. Higgs particles, if you will.The analogy is that these people in a room are the Higgs particles. Now when a particle moves through the universe, it can interact with these Higgs particles. But imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room. Then everyone ignores them. They can just pass through the room very quickly, essentially at the speed of light. They're massless. And imagine someone incredibly important and popular and intelligent walks into the room. They're surrounded by people, and their passage through the room is impeded. It's almost like they get heavy. They get massive. And that's exactly the way the Higgs mechanism works. The picture is that the electrons and the quarks in your body and in the universe that we see around us are heavy, in a sense, and massive, because they're surrounded by Higgs particles. They're interacting with the Higgs field.If that picture's true, then we have to discover those Higgs particles at the LHC. If it's not true \u2014 because it's quite a convoluted mechanism, although it's the simplest we've been able to think of \u2014 then whatever does the job of the Higgs particles we know have to turn up at the LHC. So, that's one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine. I'm glad you recognize Margaret Thatcher. Actually, I thought about making it more culturally relevant, but \u2014 (Laughter) anyway. So that's one thing. That's essentially a guarantee of what the LHC will find.There are many other things. You've heard many of the big problems in particle physics. One of them you heard about: dark matter, dark energy. There's another issue, which is that the forces in nature \u2014 it's quite beautiful, actually \u2014 seem, as you go back in time, they seem to change in strength. Well, they do change in strength. So, the electromagnetic force, the force that holds us together, gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures. The strong force, the strong nuclear force, which sticks nuclei together, gets weaker. And what you see is the standard model \u2014 you can calculate how these change \u2014 is the forces, the three forces, other than gravity, almost seem to come together at one point. It's almost as if there was one beautiful kind of super-force, back at the beginning of time. But they just miss.Now there's a theory called super-symmetry, which doubles the number of particles in the standard model, which, at first sight, doesn't sound like a simplification. But actually, with this theory, we find that the forces of nature do seem to unify together, back at the Big Bang \u2014 absolutely beautiful prophecy. The model wasn't built to do that, but it seems to do it. Also, those super-symmetric particles are very strong candidates for the dark matter. So a very compelling theory that's really mainstream physics. And if I was to put money on it, I would put money on \u2014 in a very unscientific way \u2014 that that these things would also crop up at the LHC. Many other things that the LHC could discover.But in the last few minutes, I just want to give you a different perspective of what I think \u2014 what particle physics really means to me \u2014 particle physics and cosmology. And that's that I think it's given us a wonderful narrative \u2014 almost a creation story, if you'd like \u2014 about the universe, from modern science over the last few decades. And I'd say that it deserves, in the spirit of Wade Davis' talk, to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories of the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north. This is a creation story, I think, equally as wonderful.The story goes like this: we know that the universe began 13.7 billion years ago, in an immensely hot, dense state, much smaller than a single atom. It began to expand about a million, billion, billion, billion billionth of a second \u2014 I think I got that right \u2014 after the Big Bang. Gravity separated away from the other forces. The universe then underwent an exponential expansion called inflation. In about the first billionth of a second or so, the Higgs field kicked in, and the quarks and the gluons and the electrons that make us up got mass. The universe continued to expand and cool. After about a few minutes, there was hydrogen and helium in the universe. That's all. The universe was about 75 percent hydrogen, 25 percent helium. It still is today.It continued to expand about 300 million years. Then light began to travel through the universe. It was big enough to be transparent to light, and that's what we see in the cosmic microwave background that George Smoot described as looking at the face of God. After about 400 million years, the first stars formed, and that hydrogen, that helium, then began to cook into the heavier elements. So the elements of life \u2014 carbon, and oxygen and iron, all the elements that we need to make us up \u2014 were cooked in those first generations of stars, which then ran out of fuel, exploded, threw those elements back into the universe. They then re-collapsed into another generation of stars and planets.And on some of those planets, the oxygen, which had been created in that first generation of stars, could fuse with hydrogen to form water, liquid water on the surface. On at least one, and maybe only one of those planets, primitive life evolved, which evolved over millions of years into things that walked upright and left footprints about three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of Tanzania, and eventually left a footprint on another world. And built this civilization, this wonderful picture, that turned the darkness into light, and you can see the civilization from space. As one of my great heroes, Carl Sagan, said, these are the things \u2014 and actually, not only these, but I was looking around \u2014 these are the things, like Saturn V rockets, and Sputnik, and DNA, and literature and science \u2014 these are the things that hydrogen atoms do when given 13.7 billion years.Absolutely remarkable. And, the laws of physics. Right? So, the right laws of physics \u2014 they're beautifully balanced. If the weak force had been a little bit different, then carbon and oxygen wouldn't be stable inside the hearts of stars, and there would be none of that in the universe. And I think that's a wonderful and significant story. 50 years ago, I couldn't have told that story, because we didn't know it. It makes me really feel that that civilization \u2014 which, as I say, if you believe the scientific creation story, has emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics, and a few hydrogen atoms \u2014 then I think, to me anyway, it makes me feel incredibly valuable.So that's the LHC. The LHC is certainly, when it turns on in summer, going to write the next chapter of that book. And I'm certainly looking forward with immense excitement to it being turned on.

If you want to know what I'm made of, let's look at me.\"\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nWell, we found that as you look back in time,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nthe universe gets hotter and hotter,\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\ndenser and denser, and simpler and simpler.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nNow, there's no real reason I'm aware of for that,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nbut that seems to be the case.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nSo, way back in the early times of the universe,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nwe believe it was very simple and understandable.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nAll this complexity, all the way to these wonderful things --\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nhuman brains -- are a property of an old\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nand cold and complicated universe.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nBack at the start, in the first billionth of a second,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nwe believe, or we've observed, it was very simple.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nIt's almost like ...\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nimagine a snowflake in your hand,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nand you look at it, and it's an incredibly complicated,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nbeautiful object. But as you heat it up,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nit'll melt into a pool of water,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nand you would be able to see that, actually, it was just made\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nof H20, water.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nSo it's in that same sense that we look back in time\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nto understand what the universe is made of.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nAnd, as of today, it's made of these things.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nJust 12 particles of matter,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nstuck together by four forces of nature.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nThe quarks, these pink things, are the things that make up protons and neutrons\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nthat make up the atomic nuclei in your body.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nThe electron -- the thing that goes around\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nthe atomic nucleus --\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nheld around in orbit, by the way, by the electromagnetic force\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nthat's carried by this thing, the photon.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nThe quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nAnd these guys, here, they're the weak nuclear force,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nprobably the least familiar.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nBut, without it, the sun wouldn't shine.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nAnd when the sun shines, you get copious quantities\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nof these things, called neutrinos, pouring out.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nActually, if you just look at your thumbnail --\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nabout a square centimeter --\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nthere are something like 60 billion neutrinos per second\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nfrom the sun, passing\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nthrough every square centimeter of your body.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nBut you don't feel them, because the weak force\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nis correctly named --\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nvery short range and very weak,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nso they just fly through you.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd these particles have been discovered\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nover the last century, pretty much.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nThe first one, the electron, was discovered in 1897,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nand the last one, this thing called the tau neutrino,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nin the year 2000. Actually just --\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nI was going to say, just up the road in Chicago. I know it's a big country,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nAmerica, isn't it?\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nJust up the road.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nRelative to the universe, it's just up the road.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nSo, this thing was discovered in the year 2000,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nso it's a relatively recent picture.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nOne of the wonderful things, actually, I find,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nis that we've discovered any of them, when you realize how tiny they are.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nYou know, they're a step in size\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nfrom the entire observable universe.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nSo, 100 billion galaxies,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\n13.7 billion light years away --\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\na step in size from that to Monterey, actually,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nis about the same as from Monterey to these things.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nAbsolutely, exquisitely minute,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nand yet we've discovered pretty much the full set.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nSo, one of my most illustrious forebears\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nat Manchester University, Ernest Rutherford,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\ndiscoverer of the atomic nucleus,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nonce said, \"All science is either physics\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nor stamp collecting.\"\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nNow, I don't think he meant to insult\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nthe rest of science,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nalthough he was from New Zealand, so it's possible.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nBut what he meant was that what we've done, really,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nis stamp collect there.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nOK, we've discovered the particles,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nbut unless you understand the underlying\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nreason for that pattern -- you know, why it's built the way it is --\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nreally you've done stamp collecting. You haven't done science.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nFortunately, we have\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nprobably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nthat underpins that pattern.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nIt's the Newton's laws, if you want,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nof particle physics.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nIt's called the standard model -- beautifully simple mathematical equation.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nYou could stick it on the front of a T-shirt,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nwhich is always the sign of elegance.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nThis is it.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nI've been a little disingenuous, because I've expanded it out\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nin all its gory detail.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nThis equation, though, allows you to calculate everything --\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nother than gravity -- that happens in the universe.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nSo, you want to know why the sky is blue, why atomic nuclei stick together --\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nin principle, you've got a big enough computer --\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nwhy DNA is the shape it is.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nIn principle, you should be able to calculate it from that equation.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nBut there's a problem.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nCan anyone see what it is?\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nA bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nI'll make it easier, actually, by blowing one of the lines up.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nBasically, each of these terms\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nrefers to some of the particles.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nSo those Ws there refer to the Ws, and how they stick together.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nThese carriers of the weak force, the Zs, the same.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nBut there's an extra symbol in this equation: H.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nRight, H.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nH stands for Higgs particle.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nHiggs particles have not been discovered.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nBut they're necessary: they're necessary\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nto make that mathematics work.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nSo all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nwith that wonderful equation\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nwouldn't be possible without an extra bit.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nSo it's a prediction:\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\na prediction of a new particle.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nWhat does it do?\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nWell, we had a long time to come up with good analogies.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nAnd back in the 1980s, when we wanted the money\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nfor the LHC from the U.K. government,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nMargaret Thatcher, at the time, said,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\n\"If you guys can explain, in language\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\na politician can understand,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nwhat the hell it is that you're doing, you can have the money.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nI want to know what this Higgs particle does.\"\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nAnd we came up with this analogy, and it seemed to work.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nWell, what the Higgs does is, it gives mass to the fundamental particles.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nAnd the picture is that the whole universe --\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nand that doesn't mean just space, it means me as well, and inside you --\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nthe whole universe is full of something called a Higgs field.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nHiggs particles, if you will.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nThe analogy is that these people in a room\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nare the Higgs particles.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nNow when a particle moves through the universe,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nit can interact with these Higgs particles.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nBut imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nThen everyone ignores them. They can just pass through the room very quickly,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nessentially at the speed of light. They're massless.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nAnd imagine someone incredibly important\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nand popular and intelligent\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nwalks into the room.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nThey're surrounded by people, and their passage through the room is impeded.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nIt's almost like they get heavy. They get massive.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nAnd that's exactly the way the Higgs mechanism works.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nThe picture is that the electrons and the quarks\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nin your body and in the universe that we see around us\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nare heavy, in a sense, and massive,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nbecause they're surrounded by Higgs particles.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nThey're interacting with the Higgs field.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nIf that picture's true,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nthen we have to discover those Higgs particles at the LHC.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nIf it's not true -- because it's quite a convoluted mechanism,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nalthough it's the simplest we've been able to think of --\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nthen whatever does the job of the Higgs particles\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nwe know have to turn up\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nat the LHC.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nSo, that's one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nI'm glad you recognize Margaret Thatcher.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nActually, I thought about making it more culturally relevant, but --\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nanyway.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nSo that's one thing.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nThat's essentially a guarantee of what the LHC will find.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nThere are many other things. You've heard\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nmany of the big problems in particle physics.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nOne of them you heard about: dark matter, dark energy.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nThere's another issue,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nwhich is that the forces in nature -- it's quite beautiful, actually --\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nseem, as you go back in time,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nthey seem to change in strength.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nWell, they do change in strength.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nSo, the electromagnetic force, the force that holds us together,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\ngets stronger as you go to higher temperatures.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nThe strong force, the strong nuclear force, which sticks nuclei together,\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\ngets weaker. And what you see is the standard model --\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nyou can calculate how these change -- is the forces,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nthe three forces, other than gravity,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nalmost seem to come together at one point.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nIt's almost as if there was one beautiful\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nkind of super-force, back at the beginning of time.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nBut they just miss.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nNow there's a theory called super-symmetry,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nwhich doubles the number of particles in the standard model,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nwhich, at first sight, doesn't sound like a simplification.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nBut actually, with this theory,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nwe find that the forces of nature\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\ndo seem to unify together, back at the Big Bang --\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nabsolutely beautiful prophecy. The model wasn't built to do that,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nbut it seems to do it.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nAlso, those super-symmetric particles\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nare very strong candidates for the dark matter.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nSo a very compelling theory\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nthat's really mainstream physics.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nAnd if I was to put money on it, I would put money on --\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nin a very unscientific way -- that\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nthat these things would also crop up at the LHC.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nMany other things that the LHC could discover.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nBut in the last few minutes, I just want to give you\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\na different perspective\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nof what I think -- what particle physics\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nreally means to me -- particle physics and cosmology.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nAnd that's that I think it's given us a wonderful\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nnarrative -- almost a creation story,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nif you'd like -- about the universe,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nfrom modern science over the last few decades.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nAnd I'd say that it deserves,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nin the spirit of Wade Davis' talk,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nto be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nof the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nThis is a creation story, I think, equally as wonderful.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nThe story goes like this: we know that\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nthe universe began 13.7 billion years ago,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nin an immensely hot, dense state,\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nmuch smaller than a single atom.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nIt began to expand about\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\na million, billion, billion, billion billionth\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nof a second -- I think I got that right -- after the Big Bang.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nGravity separated away from the other forces.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nThe universe then underwent\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nan exponential expansion called inflation.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nIn about the first billionth of a second or so,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nthe Higgs field kicked in, and the quarks\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nand the gluons and the electrons\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nthat make us up got mass.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nThe universe continued to expand and cool.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAfter about a few minutes,\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nthere was hydrogen and helium in the universe. That's all.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nThe universe was about 75 percent hydrogen,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\n25 percent helium. It still is today.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nIt continued to expand\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nabout 300 million years.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nThen light began to travel through the universe.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nIt was big enough to be transparent to light,\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nand that's what we see in the cosmic microwave background\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nthat George Smoot described\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nas looking at the face of God.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nAfter about 400 million years, the first stars formed,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nand that hydrogen, that helium, then began to cook\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\ninto the heavier elements.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nSo the elements of life --\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\ncarbon, and oxygen and iron,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nall the elements that we need to make us up --\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nwere cooked in those first generations of stars,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nwhich then ran out of fuel, exploded,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nthrew those elements back into the universe.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nThey then re-collapsed into another generation\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nof stars and planets.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nAnd on some of those planets, the oxygen, which had been created\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nin that first generation of stars, could fuse with hydrogen\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nto form water, liquid water on the surface.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nOn at least one, and maybe only one of those planets,\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nprimitive life evolved,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nwhich evolved over millions of years into\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nthings that walked upright and left footprints\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nabout three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of Tanzania,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nand eventually\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nleft a footprint on another world.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nAnd built this civilization,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nthis wonderful picture,\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nthat turned the darkness into light,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nand you can see the civilization from space.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nAs one of my great heroes, Carl Sagan, said,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nthese are the things -- and actually, not only these,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nbut I was looking around -- these are the things,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nlike Saturn V rockets, and Sputnik,\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nand DNA, and literature and science --\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nthese are the things that hydrogen atoms do\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nwhen given 13.7 billion years.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nAbsolutely remarkable.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nAnd, the laws of physics. Right?\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nSo, the right laws of physics --\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nthey're beautifully balanced.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nIf the weak force had been a little bit different,\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nthen carbon and oxygen wouldn't be stable\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\ninside the hearts of stars,\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nand there would be none of that in the universe.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nAnd I think that's\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\na wonderful and significant story.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\n50 years ago, I couldn't have told that story,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nbecause we didn't know it.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nIt makes me really feel that\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nthat civilization --\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nwhich, as I say, if you believe\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nthe scientific creation story,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nhas emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nand a few hydrogen atoms --\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nthen I think, to me anyway,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nit makes me feel incredibly valuable.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nSo that's the LHC.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nThe LHC is certainly, when it turns on in summer,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\ngoing to write the next chapter of that book.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nAnd I'm certainly looking forward with\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nimmense excitement to it being turned on.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nThanks.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:46.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Wake up!

In the spirit of TED, we're bringing you something that has not been released. John, do you want to introduce the song? This is a song about a creature called a hummingbird moth which imitates another creature which imitates yet another creature. It's completely fucked up and can only be explained in song.\u266b Everyone is crying at the dread hypnotic flying \u266b\u266b of the bee of the bird of the moth. \u266b\u266b You can't walk, you can't ramble \u266b\u266b 'cause you're gonna have to scramble \u266b\u266b from the bee of the bird of the moth. \u266b\u266b Catbird is a cat \u266b\u266b but he's got bugness in his veins. \u266b\u266b Manhouse lives within himself \u266b\u266b with thoughtful human brains. \u266b\u266b Neither one is equal  \u266b\u266b to the challenge of the freak we'll call \u266b\u266b the bee of the bird of the moth. \u266b\u266b Now the moth \u266b\u266b defeats the mouse and man. \u266b\u266b It's messing with the plan. \u266b\u266b It can't be believed \u266b\u266b 'cause it's just a hummingbird moth \u266b\u266b who's acting like the bird \u266b\u266b that thinks it's a bee. \u266b\u266b Got a brand new shipment \u266b\u266b of electrical equipment \u266b\u266b it's addressed to the bottom of the sea. \u266b\u266b Send a tangerine-colored \u266b\u266b nuclear submarine \u266b\u266b with a sticker that says STP. \u266b\u266b Windshield wiper washer fluid \u266b\u266b spraying in the air ... \u266b\u266b headlights under head lice \u266b\u266b under hats lie everywhere. \u266b\u266b Subatomic waves \u266b\u266b to the underwater caves \u266b\u266b of the bee of the bird of the moth. \u266b\u266b Now the moth defeats the mouse and man. \u266b\u266b It's messing with the plan. \u266b\u266b It can't be believed \u266b\u266b 'cause it's just a hummingbird moth \u266b\u266b who's acting like a bird \u266b\u266b that thinks it's a bee. \u266b\u266b Is it us or is this messed up? \u266b\u266b Everyone's deforming \u266b\u266b in the presence of the swarming \u266b\u266b of the bee of the bird of the moth. \u266b\u266b Protozoa, snakes and horses \u266b\u266b have enlisted in the forces \u266b\u266b of the bee of bird of the moth. \u266b\u266b Catbug is a cat \u266b\u266b but he's got bugness in his veins. \u266b\u266b Manhouse lives within himself \u266b\u266b with thoughtful human brains. \u266b\u266b Neither one is equal \u266b\u266b to the challenge of the freak we'll call \u266b\u266b the bee of the bird of the moth. \u266b(Applause)Thanks a lot. Thank you very much.So we are past our 1,000th show. Probably somewhere around 1,500. It's hard to know. We've only done two shows in 2007 so far, but our first show was actually the coldest performance we've ever had. It was 19 degrees in St. Louis about a month ago and I'm happy to report that this performance you are seeing today is the earliest we have ever performed. So thank you. We are cultural test pilots, ladies and gentlemen. How early can a rock performance begin? Not all the facts are in about performing at 8.30 in the morning. I can tell you the 19 degree thing was fantastic. All right.So we don't know that much about the history of violinists but we do know that when we entered the state of New Jersey there is an uptick in violence.

And what I mean \u2014 not at TED \u2014 that I'm \u2014 at this point in my life, truly my set of circumstances I would truly consider an accident. But what I'd like to talk to you about today is perhaps a way in which we could use technology to make those accidents happen often. Because I really think, when I look back at how I actually ended up in this accident, technology played a big role in that.So, what I'd like to do today is tell you a little bit about myself, because I'd like to put in context what I'm going to tell you. And I think you will see why the two greatest passions in my life today are children and education. And once I put that in context, I'd like to tell you a little bit about technology: why I believe technology is a tremendous enabler; a very powerful tool to help address some of these challenges. Then, about the initiative that Chris mentioned, that we decided to launch at AMD that we call 50x15. And then I'll come back to the beginning, and tell you a little bit more \u2014 hopefully convince you \u2014 that I believe that in today's world, it is really important for business leaders not only to have an idea of what their business is all about, but to have a passion for something that is meaningful.So, with that in mind, first of all let me tell you, I'm one of five children. I'm the oldest, the other four are women. So I grew up in a family of women. I learned a lot about how to deal with that part of the world. (Laughter) And, as you can imagine, if you can picture this: I was born in a very small village in Mexico, in, unfortunately, very poor surroundings, and my parents did not have a college education. But I was fortunate to be able to have one, and so were my four sisters. That kind of tells you a little bit of an idea of the emphasis that my parents placed on education. My parents were fanatics about learning, and I'll come back to that a little bit later.But one of the things that exposed me early to learning, and a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child, was through a technology which is on the screen \u2014 is a Victrola. My father found that in a junkyard, and was able to repair it and make it work. And somehow \u2014 to this day, I frankly don't know how he was so aware of what was going on in the world \u2014 but, by inviting me to sit down with him when I was only a few years old, and playing records in this Victrola by Mozart, and he would tell me how Mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever, and how Claire de Lune, which was one of his favorites, was a real exposure to me to classical music. He explained to me about Johann Strauss, and how he created the waltzes that became so famous in the world. And would tell me a little bit about history too, when he'd play the 1812 Overture by Tchaikovsky on this little Victrola, and he would tell me about Russia and all the things that were happening in Russia at those times and why this music, in some way, represented a little bit of that history. And even as a child, he was able to instill in me a lot of curiosity. And perhaps to you this product may not look like high tech, but if you can imagine the time when this occurred \u2014 it was in the mid '40s \u2014 this was really, in his view, a pretty piece of high tech.Well, one of the things that is really critical to try to distill from that experience is that in addition to that, people ask me and say, \"Well, how did your parents treat you when you were a child?\" And I always said that they were really tough on me. And not tough in the sense that most people think of, where your parents yell at you or hit you or whatever. They were tough in the sense that, as I grew up, both my mother and father would always say to me, it's really important that you always remember two things. First of all, when you go to bed at night, you've got to look back on the day and make sure that you felt the day was a day which you contributed something, and that you did everything you could to do it the best way you could. And the second thing they said: and we trust you, that no matter where you are or where you go, you will always do the right thing. Now, I don't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids, but if you do, please trust me, it's the most pressure you can put on a child, to say \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 we trust you that you will always do the right thing. When I was out with my friends drinking beer, I always was very aware of those words \u2014 (Laughter)\u2014 and very careful. One of the things that has happened with technology is that it can only be helpful if it is useful, of course, but it can only be helpful too if it's accessible, and it can only be helpful if it's affordable. And in today's world, being useful, affordable and accessible is not necessarily what happens in a lot of the technology that is done today. So, one of our passions in our company, and now one of my personal passions, is to be able to really work hard at making the technology useful, accessible and affordable. And to me, that is very, very critical.Now, technology has changed a lot since the Victrola days. You know, we now have, of course, incredibly powerful computers. A tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the Internet. Although frankly speaking, we don't believe the Internet is the killer app. What we believe is that the Internet, frankly, is a connection of people and ideas. The Internet happens to be just the medium in which those people and ideas get connected. And the power of connecting people and ideas can be pretty awesome. And so, we believe that through all the changes that have occurred, that we're faced today with a tremendous opportunity. If we can connect people and ideas more intensely \u2014 and although you've seen a plethora and a myriad of products that have come to the market today, the key to me is how many of these products are able to provide people connectivity, in a useful way, accessibility, in an easy manner, and also affordability, that regardless of the economic status that a person could have, that they could have the opportunity to afford this technology.So, when you look at that, we said, well, we would like to, then, enable that a little bit. We would like to create an initiative. And a couple of years ago at AMD, we came up with this idea of saying, what if we create this initiative we call 50x15, where we are going to aim, that by the year 2015, half of the world will be connected to the Internet so that people and ideas can get connected. We knew we couldn't do it by ourselves, and by no means did we ever intend to imply that we at AMD could do it alone. We always felt that this was something that could be done through partnerships with governments, industry, educational institutions, a myriad of other companies and, frankly, even competitors. So, it is really a rather lofty initiative, if you want to think that way, but we felt that we had to put a real stake up in the years ahead, that was bold enough and courageous enough that it would force us all to think of ways to do things differently. And I'll come back to that in a minute, because I think the results so far have been remarkable, and I can only anticipate and get real excited about what I think is going to happen in the next eight years, while we get to the 2015 initiative.Where are we today? That's year by year. This comes from our friends at Gapminder.com. Those of you who've never looked at their website, you should look at it. It's really impressive. And you can see how the Internet penetration has changed over the years. And so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say well, where are we related to our goal towards 2015, the thing that becomes apparent is three pieces. One is the Western world, defined mostly by Western Europe and the United States, has made an awful lot of progress. The connectivity in these parts of the world are really truly phenomenal and continue to increase.As a matter of fact, we think reaching 100 percent is very doable, even before the 2015 timeframe. In other parts of emerging countries, such as India and China, the progress has been good \u2014 has been solid, has been good. But in places that are not as developed, places like Africa, Latin America and other places in the world, the progress has been rather slow. As a matter of fact, I was just recently visiting South Africa. I had the opportunity to have a discussion with President Mbeki, and one of the things that we talked about is, what is it that's keeping this connectivity goal from moving ahead faster? And one of the reasons is, in South Africa, it costs 100 dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity. It is impossible, even in the United States, for that cost, to be able to enable the connectivity that we're all trying to reach. So, we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down. So, when you look at this chart, you look at the very last \u2014 it's a logarithmic chart on a horizontal scale \u2014 you look at the very end: we've got quite a long way to go to get to the 2015 goal of 50 percent. But we're excited in our company; we're motivated. We really think it's a phenomenal driver of things, to force us to do things differently, and we look forward to being able to actually, working with so many partners around the world, to be able to reach that goal.Now, one of the things I'd like to explain [about] 50x15, which I think is really critical, is that it is not a charity. It is actually a business venture. Let's take a small segment of this, of this unconnected world, and call it the education market. When you look at elementary-school children, we have hundreds and hundreds of millions of children around the world that could benefit tremendously from being able to be connected to the Internet. Therefore, when we see that, we see an opportunity to have a business that addresses the need of that segment. And when we embarked in this initiative, from the very beginning we said it very clearly: this is not a charity. This is really a business venture, one that addresses a very challenging segment of the market. Because what we have learned in the last three years is that this segment of the market, whether it's education or under-developed nations, either way, it's a segment that demands incredibly high quality, incredibly high reliability, tremendous low cost and access, and a lot of challenges that frankly, without actually doing it, it would be very difficult to understand, and I'll explain that in just a minute.It is an initiative that is focused on simple, accessible and human-centric solutions. What we mean by that is, you know, frankly, the PC was invented in 1980, roughly speaking more or less, and for 20-odd years, it hasn't changed. It is still, in most places, a gray or black box, and it looks the same. And frankly \u2014 and I know that sometimes I offend some of my customers when I say this, but I truly mean it \u2014 if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it, it would be very difficult to judge who made it, because they're all highly commoditized but they're all different. So, there has not been a human-centric approach to addressing this segment of the market, so we really believe it is critical to think of it.It reminded me a lot of the talk we heard this morning, about this operating room machinery that was designed specifically for Africa. We're talking about something very similar here. And it has to be based on a geo-sensitive approach. What I mean by that is that in some parts of the world, the government plays a key role in the development of technology. In other parts, it doesn't. In other parts of the world, you have an infrastructure that allows for manufacturing to take place. In other parts, it doesn't. And then we have to be sensitive about how this technology can be developed and put into action in those regions. And the last piece, which is really important \u2014 and this is an opinion that we have, not shared by many, this is one where we seem to stand alone, on this one \u2014 is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative can come by fostering local, integrated, end-to-end ecosystems.What I mean by that, and let me use this example, the country of South Africa, because I was just there, therefore I'm a little bit familiar with some of the challenges they have. It's a country of 45 million people. It's an economy that's emerging. It's beginning to grow tremendously. They have an objective to lowering the cost of connectivity. They have a computer company that makes computers in South Africa. They're developing a software-training environment in their universities. What a place, what an ideal place to create an ecosystem that could build the hardware and the software needed for their schools. And to my surprise, I learned in South Africa they have 18 dialects, I always thought they only had two \u2014 English and Afrikaans \u2014 but it turns out they have 18 dialects. And to be able to meet the needs of this rather complex educational system, it could only be done from inside. I don't think this segment of the market can be addressed by companies parachuting from another place of the world, and just dumping product and selling into the markets. So, we believe that in those regions of the world where the population is large, and there's an infrastructure that can provide it, that a local, integrated, end-to-end system is really critical for its success.This is a picture of a classroom that we outfitted with computers in Mexico, in my home country. This particular classroom happens to be in the state of Michoacan. Those of you that might be familiar with Mexico \u2014 Michoacan is a very colorful state. Children dress with very colorful, colorful clothes, and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids, in a computer. And I have to tell you that it's so easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology and connectivity can have in the lives and education of these kids. We just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school in the West Cape in South Africa, in a school that's called Nelson Mandela School, and when you see the faces and activities of these children being able to access computers, it's just phenomenal. And recently, they've written us letters, telling us how excited they are about the impact that this has had on their lives, on their educational dreams, on their capabilities, and it's just phenomenal.We have now deployed 30 different technologists in 18 different countries, and we have been able to connect millions of people in an effort to continue to learn what this particular segment of the market needs and demands. And I have to tell you that although millions doesn't sound like a lot in terms of the billions that need to be connected, it's a start. And we are learning a lot. And we're learning a tremendous amount about what we believe this segment needs to be able to be effective.One example of this has been the One Laptop per Child. Some of you are familiar with this. This is a partnership between MIT and a group of companies \u2014 Google is involved, Red Hat \u2014 and AMD is a key player. The electronics behind the One Laptop per Child are based on AMD technology; it's a microprocessor. But to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be, one of the objectives of the One Laptop per Child is to be able to achieve a 10-hour battery life. Because it was felt that a school day would last at least eight hours, and you wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop for at least one full day without having to recharge it. The engineers have done a phenomenal amount of innovation on this part, and battery life on this product is now 15 hours \u2014 just through a lot of innovative work people have done because they're passionate and motivated to be able to do this. We expect this to be deployed towards the end of this year, and we're very excited at the opportunities that this is going to offer in the field of education. It's a highly focused product aimed at strictly the education market, not only in the developing countries, but actually in the developed regions as well, because there are parts of the United States where this can have also a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient.We also have partnered with TED in this project, with Architecture for Humanity, and along with the TED Prize winner Cameron Sinclair, we're having a contest that we have issued to the architectural community to come up with the best design for a computer lab for an emerging region. And we're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this, and can't wait to see what comes out of this exciting, exciting activity.Let me come back to the beginning, to end this presentation. I'll tell you that one of the things that I feel is really critical for us in industry, in business, is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems. I don't think it's enough to be able to put them on a spreadsheet, and look at numbers and say, yes, that's a good business. I really believe that you have to have a passion for it.And one of the things that I learned, too, from my parents \u2014 and I'll give you a little anecdote \u2014 especially from my father. And it took me a while to understand it, but he said to me, when I went to college, he said, \"You're the first person in the family to go to college. And it's really important you understand that for civilization to make progress, each generation has to do better than the last one. And therefore, this is your opportunity to do better than my generation.\" Frankly, I don't know that I really understood what he told me at the time. I was eager to go off to college, and go find girls, and study, and girls, and study, but then I finished college and I fell in love. I graduated. I decided to get married. And on my wedding day, my father came to me again and said, \"You know, I'm going to remind you again, that each generation has to do better than the last one. You have to be a better husband than I was, because that's how you make progress.\" And now he began to make sense. Because I knew what a great husband he was, and now he was once again beginning to put pressure on me, like he did when I was a little kid. And then a few years later, I had a child, my first child, and again, my father comes to the hospital, and we're looking at the glass, and see all the children on the other side, and he said, \"I've got to remind you again, that for each generation to do better, you're going to have to be a better father than I was.\" That's when it dawned on me the tremendous challenge that he was placing on me, because he was a great father. But the key is that he instilled in me a passion to really get up every day in the morning and want to do better, to really get up and think that my role in life is not just to be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. It's got to be that someday I can look back, and this place is truly better through some small contribution that perhaps each of us could make. Thank you very much.

I'm the oldest, the other four are women.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nSo I grew up in a family of women.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nI learned a lot about how to deal with that part of the world.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nAnd, as you can imagine, if you can picture this:\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nI was born in a very small village in Mexico,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nin, unfortunately, very poor surroundings,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nand my parents did not have a college education.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nBut I was fortunate to be able to have one, and so were my four sisters.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nThat kind of tells you a little bit of an idea of the emphasis\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nthat my parents placed on education.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nMy parents were fanatics about learning,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nand I'll come back to that a little bit later.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nBut one of the things that exposed me early to learning,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nand a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nwas through a technology which is on the screen -- is a Victrola.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nMy father found that in a junkyard,\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nand was able to repair it and make it work. And somehow --\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nto this day, I frankly don't know how he was so aware\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nof what was going on in the world -- but,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nby inviting me to sit down with him when I was only a few years old,\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nand playing records in this Victrola by Mozart, and he would tell me\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nhow Mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nand how Claire de Lune, which was one of his favorites,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nwas a real exposure to me to classical music.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nHe explained to me about Johann Strauss, and how he created the waltzes\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nthat became so famous in the world.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nAnd would tell me a little bit about history too,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nwhen he'd play the 1812 Overture by Tchaikovsky\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\non this little Victrola, and he would tell me about Russia\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nand all the things that were happening in Russia at those times\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nand why this music,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nin some way, represented a little bit of that history.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nAnd even as a child, he was able to instill in me a lot of curiosity.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nAnd perhaps to you this product may not look like high tech,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nbut if you can imagine the time when this occurred --\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nit was in the mid '40s -- this was really, in his view, a pretty piece of high tech.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nWell, one of the things that is really critical to try to\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:05.958\ndistill from that experience is that in addition to that,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:06.958\npeople ask me and say, \"Well,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nhow did your parents treat you when you were a child?\"\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nAnd I always said that they were really tough on me.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nAnd not tough in the sense that most people think of,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nwhere your parents yell at you or hit you or whatever.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nThey were tough in the sense that, as I grew up,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nboth my mother and father would always say to me,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nit's really important that you always remember two things.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nFirst of all, when you go to bed at night,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nyou've got to look back on the day and make sure that you felt\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nthe day was a day which you contributed something, and\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nthat you did everything you could to do it the best way you could.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nAnd the second thing they said: and we trust you,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nthat no matter where you are or where you go,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nyou will always do the right thing.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nNow, I don't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nbut if you do, please trust me,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nit's the most pressure you can put on a child, to say --\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:57.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\n-- we trust you that you will always do the right thing.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nWhen I was out with my friends drinking beer,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nI always was very aware of those words --\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:11.958\n-- and very careful. One of the things that has happened with technology\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nis that it can only be helpful if it is useful, of course,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nbut it can only be helpful too if it's accessible,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nand it can only be helpful if it's affordable.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd in today's world, being useful, affordable and accessible\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nis not necessarily what happens\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nin a lot of the technology that is done today.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nSo, one of our passions in our company,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nand now one of my personal passions, is to be able to really work hard\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nat making the technology useful, accessible and affordable.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nAnd to me, that is very, very critical.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nNow, technology has changed a lot since the Victrola days.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nYou know, we now have, of course, incredibly powerful computers.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nA tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the Internet.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nAlthough frankly speaking, we don't believe the Internet is the killer app.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nWhat we believe is that the Internet, frankly,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nis a connection of people and ideas.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nThe Internet happens to be just the medium\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nin which those people and ideas get connected.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nAnd the power of connecting people and ideas can be pretty awesome.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nAnd so, we believe that through all the changes that have occurred,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nthat we're faced today with a tremendous opportunity.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nIf we can connect people and ideas more intensely -- and although\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nyou've seen a plethora and a myriad of products\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nthat have come to the market today, the key to me is\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nhow many of these products are able to provide people connectivity, in a useful way,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:45.958\naccessibility, in an easy manner,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nand also affordability, that\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nregardless of the economic status that a person could have,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nthat they could have the opportunity to afford this technology.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nSo, when you look at that, we said, well, we would like to, then,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nenable that a little bit. We would like to create an initiative.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nAnd a couple of years ago at AMD,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nwe came up with this idea of saying,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nwhat if we create this initiative we call 50x15,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nwhere we are going to aim, that by the year 2015,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nhalf of the world will be connected to the Internet\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nso that people and ideas can get connected.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nWe knew we couldn't do it by ourselves, and by no means\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.958\ndid we ever intend to imply that we at AMD could do it alone.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nWe always felt that this was something that could be done\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nthrough partnerships with governments, industry,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:35.958\neducational institutions, a myriad of other companies and, frankly, even competitors.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nSo, it is really a rather lofty initiative,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nif you want to think that way,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nbut we felt that we had to put a real stake up in the years ahead,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nthat was bold enough and courageous enough\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nthat it would force us all to think of ways to do things differently.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nAnd I'll come back to that in a minute, because I think\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nthe results so far have been remarkable,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nand I can only anticipate and get real excited about\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nwhat I think is going to happen in the next eight years,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nwhile we get to the 2015 initiative.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nWhere are we today?\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nThat's year by year. This comes from our friends at Gapminder.com.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nThose of you who've never looked at their website,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nyou should look at it. It's really impressive. And you can see\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nhow the Internet penetration has changed over the years.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nAnd so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nwell, where are we related to our goal towards 2015,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nthe thing that becomes apparent is three pieces.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nOne is the Western world,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\ndefined mostly by Western Europe and the United States,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nhas made an awful lot of progress.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nThe connectivity in these parts of the world\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nare really truly phenomenal and continue to increase.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nAs a matter of fact, we think reaching 100 percent is very doable,\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:54.958\neven before the 2015 timeframe. In other parts of emerging countries,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nsuch as India and China, the progress has been good --\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nhas been solid, has been good. But in places that are not as developed,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nplaces like Africa, Latin America and other places in the world,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nthe progress has been rather slow. As a matter of fact,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nI was just recently visiting South Africa.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nI had the opportunity to have a discussion with President Mbeki,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nand one of the things that we talked about is, what is it\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nthat's keeping this connectivity goal from moving ahead faster?\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nAnd one of the reasons is, in South Africa,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nit costs 100 dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nIt is impossible, even in the United States, for that cost,\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nto be able to enable the connectivity that we're all trying to reach.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nSo, we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nto be able to bring the cost of this technology down.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nSo, when you look at this chart,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nyou look at the very last -- it's a logarithmic chart on a horizontal scale --\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nyou look at the very end:\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nwe've got quite a long way to go to get to the 2015 goal of 50 percent.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nBut we're excited in our company; we're motivated.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nWe really think it's a phenomenal driver of things,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nto force us to do things differently, and we look forward to being able to actually,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nworking with so many partners around the world,\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nto be able to reach that goal.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nNow, one of the things I'd like to explain [about] 50x15,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nwhich I think is really critical, is that it is not a charity.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nIt is actually a business venture.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nLet's take a small segment of this, of this unconnected world,\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nand call it the education market.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nWhen you look at elementary-school children,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nwe have hundreds and hundreds of millions of children around the world\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nthat could benefit tremendously\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nfrom being able to be connected to the Internet.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nTherefore, when we see that, we see an opportunity\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nto have a business that addresses the need of that segment.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nAnd when we embarked in this initiative, from the very beginning\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nwe said it very clearly: this is not a charity.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nThis is really a business venture,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:59.958\none that addresses a very challenging segment of the market.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nBecause what we have learned in the last three years\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nis that this segment of the market, whether it's education\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nor under-developed nations, either way, it's a segment that demands\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nincredibly high quality, incredibly high reliability,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:17.958\ntremendous low cost and access, and a lot of challenges\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nthat frankly, without actually doing it,\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nit would be very difficult to understand, and\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nI'll explain that in just a minute.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nIt is an initiative that is focused on simple, accessible and human-centric solutions.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nWhat we mean by that is,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nyou know, frankly, the PC was invented in 1980, roughly speaking\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nmore or less, and for 20-odd years, it hasn't changed.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nIt is still, in most places, a gray or black box, and it looks the same.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nAnd frankly -- and I know that sometimes I offend some of my customers\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nwhen I say this, but I truly mean it --\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nif you could take the name of the computer off the top of it,\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nit would be very difficult to judge who made it,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nbecause they're all highly commoditized but they're all different.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nSo, there has not been a human-centric approach\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nto addressing this segment of the market,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nso we really believe it is critical to think of it.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nIt reminded me a lot of the talk we heard this morning, about this\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:17.958\noperating room machinery that was designed specifically for Africa.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nWe're talking about something very similar here.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAnd it has to be based on a geo-sensitive approach.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nWhat I mean by that is that in some parts of the world,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nthe government plays a key role in the development of technology.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nIn other parts, it doesn't.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nIn other parts of the world, you have an infrastructure\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nthat allows for manufacturing to take place.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nIn other parts, it doesn't. And then we have to be sensitive\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nabout how this technology can be developed\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nand put into action in those regions.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nAnd the last piece, which is really important --\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nand this is an opinion that we have, not shared by many,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nthis is one where we seem to stand alone, on this one --\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nis that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:01.958\ncan come by fostering local, integrated, end-to-end ecosystems.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nWhat I mean by that, and let me use this example,\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nthe country of South Africa, because I was just there,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:10.958\ntherefore I'm a little bit familiar with some of the challenges they have.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nIt's a country of 45 million people. It's an economy that's emerging.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nIt's beginning to grow tremendously.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nThey have an objective to lowering the cost of connectivity.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nThey have a computer company that makes computers in South Africa.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nThey're developing a software-training environment in their universities.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nWhat a place, what an ideal place\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nto create an ecosystem that could build the hardware and the software\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nneeded for their schools. And to my surprise, I learned in South Africa\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nthey have 18 dialects, I always thought they only had two --\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nEnglish and Afrikaans -- but it turns out they have 18 dialects.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nAnd to be able to meet the needs of this rather complex educational system,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nit could only be done from inside.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nI don't think this segment of the market can be addressed\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nby companies parachuting from another place of the world,\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nand just dumping product and selling into the markets.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nSo, we believe that in those regions of the world\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nwhere the population is large,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nand there's an infrastructure that can provide it,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nthat a local, integrated, end-to-end system\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nis really critical for its success.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nThis is a picture of a classroom that we outfitted with computers\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nin Mexico, in my home country.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nThis particular classroom happens to be in the state of Michoacan.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nThose of you that might be familiar with Mexico --\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nMichoacan is a very colorful state.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nChildren dress with very colorful, colorful clothes,\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nand it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nin a computer. And I have to tell you that it's\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nso easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nand connectivity can have in the lives and education of these kids.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nWe just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nin the West Cape in South Africa,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nin a school that's called Nelson Mandela School,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nand when you see the faces and activities of these children\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nbeing able to access computers, it's just phenomenal.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nAnd recently, they've written us letters,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\ntelling us how excited they are about the impact\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nthat this has had on their lives, on their educational dreams,\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\non their capabilities, and it's just phenomenal.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nWe have now deployed 30 different technologists\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nin 18 different countries, and we have been able\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nto connect millions of people in an effort to continue to learn\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nwhat this particular segment of the market needs and demands.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nAnd I have to tell you that although\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nmillions doesn't sound like a lot\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nin terms of the billions that need to be connected,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nit's a start. And we are learning a lot.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nAnd we're learning a tremendous amount about\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nwhat we believe this segment needs to be able to be effective.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nOne example of this has been the One Laptop per Child.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nSome of you are familiar with this.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nThis is a partnership between MIT and a group of companies --\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nGoogle is involved, Red Hat -- and AMD is a key player.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nThe electronics behind the One Laptop per Child\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nare based on AMD technology; it's a microprocessor.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nBut to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be,\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\none of the objectives of the One Laptop per Child\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nis to be able to achieve a 10-hour battery life.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nBecause it was felt that a school day\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nwould last at least eight hours, and\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nyou wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nfor at least one full day without having to recharge it.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nThe engineers have done a phenomenal amount of innovation on this part,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nand battery life on this product is now 15 hours --\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\njust through a lot of innovative work people have done\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nbecause they're passionate and motivated to be able to do this.\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nWe expect this to be deployed towards the end of this year,\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nand we're very excited at the opportunities that this is going to offer\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nin the field of education.\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nIt's a highly focused product aimed at strictly the education market,\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nnot only in the developing countries, but actually\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nin the developed regions as well, because\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nthere are parts of the United States where this can have\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nalso a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nWe also have partnered with TED\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nin this project, with Architecture for Humanity,\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nand along with the TED Prize winner Cameron Sinclair,\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nwe're having a contest that we have issued to the architectural community\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nto come up with the best design for a computer lab for an emerging region.\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nAnd we're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this,\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nand can't wait to see what comes out of this exciting, exciting activity.\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nLet me come back to the beginning,\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nto end this presentation.\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nI'll tell you that one of the things\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nthat I feel is really critical for us in industry, in business,\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nis to be able to be passionate about solving these problems.\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nI don't think it's enough to be able to put them on a spreadsheet,\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nand look at numbers and say, yes, that's a good business.\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nI really believe that you have to have a passion for it.\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nAnd one of the things that I learned, too, from my parents --\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nand I'll give you a little anecdote -- especially from my father.\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nAnd it took me a while to understand it,\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nbut he said to me, when I went to college, he said,\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:02.958\n\"You're the first person in the family to go to college.\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nAnd it's really important you understand\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nthat for civilization to make progress,\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:11.958\neach generation has to do better than the last one.\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:15.958\nAnd therefore, this is your opportunity to do better than my generation.\"\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nFrankly, I don't know that I really understood what he told me at the time.\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:23.958\nI was eager to go off to college, and go find girls, and study,\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nand girls, and study, but then I finished college and I fell in love.\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nI graduated. I decided to get married.\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nAnd on my wedding day, my father came to me again and said, \"You know,\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nI'm going to remind you again, that each generation\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nhas to do better than the last one.\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nYou have to be a better husband than I was,\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nbecause that's how you make progress.\" And now he began to make sense.\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nBecause I knew what a great husband he was,\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nand now he was once again beginning to put pressure on me,\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nlike he did when I was a little kid. And then a few years later, I had a child,\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nmy first child, and again, my father comes\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:04.958\nto the hospital, and we're looking at the glass,\n\n00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nand see all the children on the other side, and he said,\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:11.958\n\"I've got to remind you again, that for each generation to do better,\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nyou're going to have to be a better father than I was.\"\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nThat's when it dawned on me the tremendous challenge\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:20.958\nthat he was placing on me, because he was a great father.\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:23.958\n\nBut the key is that he instilled in me a passion\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nto really get up every day in the morning and want to do better,\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:31.958\nto really get up and think that my role in life\n\n00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:34.958\nis not just to be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company.\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:36.958\nIt's got to be that someday I can look back,\n\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:40.958\nand this place is truly better through some small contribution\n\n00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:42.958\nthat perhaps each of us could make.\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:44.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:45.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "6 ways mushrooms can save the world", "duration": "1064", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_stamets_on_6_ways_mushrooms_can_save_the_world", "transcript": "I love a challenge, and saving the Earth is probably a good one. We all know the Earth is in trouble. We have now entered in the 6X, the sixth major extinction on this planet. I often wondered, if there was a United Organization of Organisms \u2014 otherwise known as \"Uh-Oh\" \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 and every organism had a right to vote, would we be voted on the planet, or off the planet? I think that vote is occurring right now.I want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions, using fungi, and these solutions are based on mycelium. The mycelium infuses all landscapes, it holds soils together, it's extremely tenacious. This holds up to 30,000 times its mass. They're the grand molecular disassemblers of nature \u2014 the soil magicians. They generate the humus soils across the landmasses of Earth. We have now discovered that there is a multi-directional transfer of nutrients between plants, mitigated by the mcyelium \u2014 so the mycelium is the mother that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees to hemlocks, cedars and Douglas firs.Dusty and I, we like to say, on Sunday, this is where we go to church. I'm in love with the old-growth forest, and I'm a patriotic American because we have those. Most of you are familiar with Portobello mushrooms. And frankly, I face a big obstacle. When I mention mushrooms to somebody, they immediately think Portobellos or magic mushrooms, their eyes glaze over, and they think I'm a little crazy. So, I hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group. We call it mycophobia, the irrational fear of the unknown, when it comes to fungi.Mushrooms are very fast in their growth. Day 21, day 23, day 25. Mushrooms produce strong antibiotics. In fact, we're more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom. A group of 20 eukaryotic microbiologists published a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta \u2014 a super-kingdom that joins animalia and fungi together. We share in common the same pathogens. Fungi don't like to rot from bacteria, and so our best antibiotics come from fungi. But here is a mushroom that's past its prime. After they sporulate, they do rot. But I propose to you that the sequence of microbes that occur on rotting mushrooms are essential for the health of the forest. They give rise to the trees, they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium.And so we see a mushroom here sporulating. And the spores are germinating, and the mycelium forms and goes underground. In a single cubic inch of soil, there can be more than eight miles of these cells. My foot is covering approximately 300 miles of mycelium.This is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey. And notice that as the mycelium grows, it conquers territory and then it begins the net. I've been a scanning electron microscopist for many years, I have thousands of electron micrographs, and when I'm staring at the mycelium, I realize that they are microfiltration membranes. We exhale carbon dioxide, so does mycelium. It inhales oxygen, just like we do. But these are essentially externalized stomachs and lungs. And I present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes. And in these cavities, these micro-cavities form, and as they fuse soils, they absorb water. These are little wells. And inside these wells, then microbial communities begin to form. And so the spongy soil not only resists erosion, but sets up a microbial universe that gives rise to a plurality of other organisms.I first proposed, in the early 1990s, that mycelium is Earth's natural Internet. When you look at the mycelium, they're highly branched. And if there's one branch that is broken, then very quickly, because of the nodes of crossing \u2014 Internet engineers maybe call them hot points \u2014 there are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information. The mycelium is sentient. It knows that you are there. When you walk across landscapes, it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris. So, I believe the invention of the computer Internet is an inevitable consequence of a previously proven, biologically successful model. The Earth invented the computer Internet for its own benefit, and we now, being the top organism on this planet, are trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere.Going way out, dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype. I believe matter begets life; life becomes single cells; single cells become strings; strings become chains; chains network. And this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe.Most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land. They came to land 1.3 billion years ago, and plants followed several hundred million years later. How is that possible? It's possible because the mycelium produces oxalic acids, and many other acids and enzymes, pockmarking rock and grabbing calcium and other minerals and forming calcium oxalates. Makes the rocks crumble, and the first step in the generation of soil. Oxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together. So, fungi and mycelium sequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates. And all sorts of other oxalates are also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals that are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix.This was first discovered in 1859. This is a photograph by Franz Hueber. This photograph's taken 1950s in Saudi Arabia. 420 million years ago, this organism existed. It was called Prototaxites. Prototaxites, laying down, was about three feet tall. The tallest plants on Earth at that time were less than two feet. Dr. Boyce, at the University of Chicago, published an article in the Journal of Geology this past year determining that Prototaxites was a giant fungus, a giant mushroom. Across the landscapes of Earth were dotted these giant mushrooms. All across most land masses. And these existed for tens of millions of years.Now, we've had several extinction events, and as we march forward \u2014 65 million years ago \u2014 most of you know about it \u2014 we had an asteroid impact. The Earth was struck by an asteroid, a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere. Sunlight was cut off, and fungi inherited the Earth. Those organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded, because fungi do not need light. More recently, at Einstein University, they just determined that fungi use radiation as a source of energy, much like plants use light. So, the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere, I think, is a forgone conclusion, at least in my own mind.The largest organism in the world is in Eastern Oregon. I couldn't miss it. It was 2,200 acres in size: 2,200 acres in size, 2,000 years old. The largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat, one cell wall thick. How is it that this organism can be so large, and yet be one cell wall thick, whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us? The mycelium, in the right conditions, produces a mushroom \u2014 it bursts through with such ferocity that it can break asphalt. We were involved with several experiments. I'm going to show you six, if I can, solutions for helping to save the world. Battelle Laboratories and I joined up in Bellingham, Washington. There were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste: one was a control pile; one pile was treated with enzymes; one pile was treated with bacteria; and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium. The mycelium absorbs the oil. The mycelium is producing enzymes \u2014 peroxidases \u2014 that break carbon-hydrogen bonds. These are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together. So, the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil, and then, when we returned six weeks later, all the tarps were removed, all the other piles were dead, dark and stinky. We came back to our pile, it was covered with hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms, and the color changed to a light form. The enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons into carbohydrates \u2014 fungal sugars.Some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms. They're very large. They're showing how much nutrition that they could've obtained. But something else happened, which was an epiphany in my life. They sporulated, the spores attract insects, the insects laid eggs, eggs became larvae. Birds then came, bringing in seeds, and our pile became an oasis of life. Whereas the other three piles were dead, dark and stinky, and the PAH's \u2014 the aromatic hydrocarbons \u2014 went from 10,000 parts per million to less than 200 in eight weeks. The last image we don't have. The entire pile was a green berm of life. These are gateway species, vanguard species that open the door for other biological communities.So I invented burlap sacks, bunker spawn \u2014 and putting the mycelium \u2014 using storm blown debris, you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream from a farm that's producing E. coli, or other wastes, or a factory with chemical toxins, and it leads to habitat restoration. So, we set up a site in Mason County, Washington, and we've seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of coliforms. And I'll show you a graph here. This is a logarithmic scale, 10 to the eighth power. There's more than a 100 million colonies per gram, and 10 to the third power is around 1,000. In 48 hours to 72 hours, these three mushroom species reduced the amount of coliform bacteria 10,000 times. Think of the implications. This is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris \u2014 and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year.So, this one mushroom, in particular, has drawn our interest over time. This is my wife Dusty, with a mushroom called Fomitopsis officinalis \u2014 Agarikon. It's a mushroom exclusive to the old-growth forest that Dioscorides first described in 65 A.D. as a treatment against consumption. This mushroom grows in Washington State, Oregon, northern California, British Columbia, now thought to be extinct in Europe. May not seem that large \u2014 let's get closer. This is extremely rare fungus. Our team \u2014 and we have a team of experts that go out \u2014 we went out 20 times in the old-growth forest last year. We found one sample to be able to get into culture.Preserving the genome of these fungi in the old-growth forest I think is absolutely critical for human health. I've been involved with the U.S. Defense Department BioShield program. We submitted over 300 samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water, and mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites. And a few years ago, we received these results. We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms that were highly active against poxviruses. Dr. Earl Kern, who's a smallpox expert of the U.S. Defense Department, states that any compounds that have a selectivity index of two or more are active. 10 or greater are considered to be very active. Our mushroom strains were in the highly active range. There's a vetted press release that you can read \u2014 it's vetted by DOD \u2014 if you Google \"Stamets\" and \"smallpox.\" Or you can go to NPR.org and listen to a live interview.So, encouraged by this, naturally we went to flu viruses. And so, for the first time, I am showing this. We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms highly active against flu viruses. Here's the selectivity index numbers \u2014 against pox, you saw 10s and 20s \u2014 now against flu viruses, compared to the ribavirin controls, we have an extraordinarily high activity. And we're using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical. We tried it against flu A viruses \u2014 H1N1, H3N2 \u2014 as well as flu B viruses. So then we tried a blend, and in a blend combination we tried it against H5N1, and we got greater than 1,000 selectivity index. (Applause) I then think that we can make the argument that we should save the old-growth forest as a matter of national defense. (Applause)I became interested in entomopathogenic fungi \u2014 fungi that kill insects. Our house was being destroyed by carpenter ants. So, I went to the EPA homepage, and they were recommending studies with metarhizium species of a group of fungi that kill carpenter ants, as well as termites. I did something that nobody else had done. I actually chased the mycelium, when it stopped producing spores. These are spores \u2014 this is in their spores. I was able to morph the culture into a non-sporulating form. And so the industry has spent over 100 million dollars specifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house. But the insects aren't stupid, and they would avoid the spores when they came close, and so I morphed the cultures into a non-sporulating form. And I got my daughter's Barbie doll dish, I put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants were making debris fields, every day, in my house, and the ants were attracted to the mycelium, because there's no spores. They gave it to the queen. One week later, I had no sawdust piles whatsoever.And then \u2014 a delicate dance between dinner and death \u2014 the mycelium is consumed by the ants, they become mummified, and, boing, a mushroom pops out of their head. (Laughter) Now after sporulation, the spores repel. So, the house is no longer suitable for invasion. So, you have a near-permanent solution for reinvasion of termites. And so my house came down, I received my first patent against carpenter ants, termites and fire ants. Then we tried extracts, and lo and behold, we can steer insects to different directions. This has huge implications. I then received my second patent \u2014 and this is a big one. It's been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent. It covers over 200,000 species. This is the most disruptive technology \u2014 I've been told by executives of the pesticide industry \u2014 that they have ever witnessed. This could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world. You could fly 100 Ph.D. students under the umbrella of this concept, because my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi, prior to sporulation, attract the very insects that are otherwise repelled by those spores.And so I came up with a Life Box, because I needed a delivery system. The Life Box \u2014 you're gonna be getting a DVD of the TED conference \u2014 you add soil, you add water, you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores, like of the Agarikon mushroom. The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium. And then you put tree seeds in here, and then you end up growing \u2014 potentially \u2014 an old-growth forest from a cardboard box.I want to reinvent the delivery system, and the use of cardboard around the world, so they become ecological footprints. If there's a YouTube-like site that you could put up, you could make it interactive, zip code specific \u2014 where people could join together, and through satellite imaging systems, through Virtual Earth or Google Earth, you could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered by the trees that are coming through Life Boxes.You could take a cardboard box delivering shoes, you could add water \u2014 I developed this for the refugee community \u2014 corns, beans and squash and onions. I took several containers \u2014 my wife said, if I could do this, anybody could \u2014 and I ended up growing a seed garden. Then you harvest the seeds \u2014 and thank you, Eric Rasmussen, for your help on this \u2014 and then you're harvesting the seed garden. Then you can harvest the kernels, and then you just need a few kernels. I add mycelium to it, and then I inoculate the corncobs. Now, three corncobs, no other grain \u2014 lots of mushrooms begin to form. Too many withdrawals from the carbon bank, and so this population will be shut down. But watch what happens here. The mushrooms then are harvested, but very importantly, the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars. And so I thought, how could we address the energy crisis in this country? And we came up with Econol.Generating ethanol from cellulose using mycelium as an intermediary \u2014 and you gain all the benefits that I've described to you already. But to go from cellulose to ethanol is ecologically unintelligent, and I think that we need to be econologically intelligent about the generation of fuels. So, we build the carbon banks on the planet, renew the soils. These are a species that we need to join with. I think engaging mycelium can help save the world. Thank you very much.

tenacious.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nThis holds up to 30,000 times its mass.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nThey're the grand molecular disassemblers of nature -- the soil magicians.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nThey generate the humus soils across the landmasses of Earth.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nWe have now discovered that there is a multi-directional transfer\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nof nutrients between plants, mitigated by the mcyelium --\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nso the mycelium is the mother\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nthat is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nto hemlocks, cedars and Douglas firs.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nDusty and I, we like to say, on Sunday, this is where we go to church.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nI'm in love with the old-growth forest,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nand I'm a patriotic American because we have those.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nMost of you are familiar with Portobello mushrooms.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nAnd frankly, I face a big obstacle.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nWhen I mention mushrooms to somebody,\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nthey immediately think Portobellos or magic mushrooms,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\ntheir eyes glaze over, and they think I'm a little crazy.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nSo, I hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nWe call it mycophobia,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nthe irrational fear of the unknown, when it comes to fungi.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nMushrooms are very fast in their growth.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nDay 21, day 23, day 25.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nMushrooms produce strong antibiotics.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nIn fact, we're more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nA group of 20 eukaryotic microbiologists\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\npublished a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta --\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\na super-kingdom that joins animalia and fungi together.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nWe share in common the same pathogens.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nFungi don't like to rot from bacteria,\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nand so our best antibiotics come from fungi.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nBut here is a mushroom that's past its prime.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAfter they sporulate, they do rot.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nBut I propose to you that the sequence of microbes\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nthat occur on rotting mushrooms\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nare essential for the health of the forest.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nThey give rise to the trees,\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nthey create the debris fields that feed the mycelium.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAnd so we see a mushroom here sporulating.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nAnd the spores are germinating,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nand the mycelium forms and goes underground.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nIn a single cubic inch of soil, there can be more than eight miles of these cells.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nMy foot is covering approximately 300 miles of mycelium.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nThis is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nAnd notice that as the mycelium grows,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nit conquers territory and then it begins the net.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nI've been a scanning electron microscopist for many years,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nI have thousands of electron micrographs,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nand when I'm staring at the mycelium,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nI realize that they are microfiltration membranes.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nWe exhale carbon dioxide, so does mycelium.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nIt inhales oxygen, just like we do.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nBut these are essentially externalized stomachs and lungs.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nAnd I present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nAnd in these cavities, these micro-cavities form,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nand as they fuse soils, they absorb water.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nThese are little wells.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nAnd inside these wells, then microbial communities begin to form.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nAnd so the spongy soil not only resists erosion,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nbut sets up a microbial universe\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nthat gives rise to a plurality of other organisms.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nI first proposed, in the early 1990s,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthat mycelium is Earth's natural Internet.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nWhen you look at the mycelium, they're highly branched.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nAnd if there's one branch that is broken, then very quickly,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nbecause of the nodes of crossing --\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nInternet engineers maybe call them hot points --\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nthere are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nThe mycelium is sentient.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nIt knows that you are there.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nWhen you walk across landscapes,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nit leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nSo, I believe the invention of the computer Internet\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nis an inevitable consequence\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nof a previously proven, biologically successful model.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nThe Earth invented the computer Internet for its own benefit,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nand we now, being the top organism on this planet,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nare trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nGoing way out, dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nI believe matter begets life;\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nlife becomes single cells; single cells become strings;\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nstrings become chains; chains network.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nAnd this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nMost of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nThey came to land 1.3 billion years ago,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nand plants followed several hundred million years later.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nHow is that possible?\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nIt's possible because the mycelium produces oxalic acids,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nand many other acids and enzymes,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:29.958\npockmarking rock and grabbing calcium and other minerals\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nand forming calcium oxalates.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nMakes the rocks crumble, and the first step in the generation of soil.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nOxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nSo, fungi and mycelium\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nsequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nAnd all sorts of other oxalates\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nare also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nthat are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nThis was first discovered in 1859.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nThis is a photograph by Franz Hueber.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nThis photograph's taken 1950s in Saudi Arabia.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:06.958\n420 million years ago, this organism existed.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nIt was called Prototaxites.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nPrototaxites, laying down, was about three feet tall.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nThe tallest plants on Earth at that time were less than two feet.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nDr. Boyce, at the University of Chicago,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\npublished an article in the Journal of Geology\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nthis past year determining that Prototaxites was a giant fungus,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\na giant mushroom.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nAcross the landscapes of Earth were dotted these giant mushrooms.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nAll across most land masses.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAnd these existed for tens of millions of years.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nNow, we've had several extinction events, and as we march forward --\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\n65 million years ago -- most of you know about it --\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nwe had an asteroid impact.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nThe Earth was struck by an asteroid,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\na huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nSunlight was cut off, and fungi inherited the Earth.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nThose organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nbecause fungi do not need light.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nMore recently, at Einstein University,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nthey just determined that fungi use radiation as a source of energy,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nmuch like plants use light.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nSo, the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nI think, is a forgone conclusion,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nat least in my own mind.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nThe largest organism in the world is in Eastern Oregon.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nI couldn't miss it. It was 2,200 acres in size:\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:36.958\n2,200 acres in size, 2,000 years old.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nThe largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat, one cell wall thick.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nHow is it that this organism can be so large,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nand yet be one cell wall thick,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nwhereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us?\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nThe mycelium, in the right conditions, produces a mushroom --\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nit bursts through with such ferocity that it can break asphalt.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nWe were involved with several experiments.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nI'm going to show you six, if I can,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nsolutions for helping to save the world.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nBattelle Laboratories and I joined up in Bellingham, Washington.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nThere were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste:\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\none was a control pile; one pile was treated with enzymes;\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\none pile was treated with bacteria;\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nand our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nThe mycelium absorbs the oil.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nThe mycelium is producing enzymes --\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nperoxidases -- that break carbon-hydrogen bonds.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nThese are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nSo, the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nand then, when we returned six weeks later,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nall the tarps were removed,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nall the other piles were dead, dark and stinky.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nWe came back to our pile, it was covered\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nwith hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nand the color changed to a light form.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nThe enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\ninto carbohydrates -- fungal sugars.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nSome of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nThey're very large.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nThey're showing how much nutrition that they could've obtained.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nBut something else happened, which was an epiphany in my life.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nThey sporulated, the spores attract insects,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nthe insects laid eggs, eggs became larvae.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nBirds then came, bringing in seeds,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nand our pile became an oasis of life.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nWhereas the other three piles were dead, dark and stinky,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nand the PAH's -- the aromatic hydrocarbons --\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nwent from 10,000 parts per million to less than 200 in eight weeks.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nThe last image we don't have.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nThe entire pile was a green berm of life.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nThese are gateway species,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nvanguard species that open the door for other biological communities.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nSo I invented burlap sacks, bunker spawn --\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nand putting the mycelium -- using storm blown debris,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nyou can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nfrom a farm that's producing E. coli, or other wastes,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nor a factory with chemical toxins,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nand it leads to habitat restoration.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nSo, we set up a site in Mason County, Washington,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nand we've seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of coliforms.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nAnd I'll show you a graph here.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nThis is a logarithmic scale, 10 to the eighth power.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nThere's more than a 100 million colonies per gram,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nand 10 to the third power is around 1,000.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nIn 48 hours to 72 hours, these three mushroom species\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nreduced the amount of coliform bacteria 10,000 times.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nThink of the implications.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nThis is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris --\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nand we can guarantee that we will have storms every year.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nSo, this one mushroom, in particular, has drawn our interest over time.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nThis is my wife Dusty,\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nwith a mushroom called Fomitopsis officinalis -- Agarikon.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nIt's a mushroom exclusive to the old-growth forest\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nthat Dioscorides first described in 65 A.D.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nas a treatment against consumption.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nThis mushroom grows in Washington State, Oregon,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nnorthern California, British Columbia, now thought to be extinct in Europe.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nMay not seem that large --\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nlet's get closer.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nThis is extremely rare fungus.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nOur team -- and we have a team of experts that go out --\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nwe went out 20 times in the old-growth forest last year.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nWe found one sample to be able to get into culture.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nPreserving the genome of these fungi in the old-growth forest\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nI think is absolutely critical for human health.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nI've been involved with the U.S. Defense Department BioShield program.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nWe submitted over 300 samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nand mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nAnd a few years ago,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nwe received these results.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nWe have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nthat were highly active against poxviruses.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nDr. Earl Kern, who's a smallpox expert\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nof the U.S. Defense Department, states that any compounds\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nthat have a selectivity index of two or more are active.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\n10 or greater are considered to be very active.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nOur mushroom strains were in the highly active range.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nThere's a vetted press release that you can read --\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nit's vetted by DOD --\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nif you Google \"Stamets\" and \"smallpox.\"\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nOr you can go to NPR.org and listen to a live interview.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nSo, encouraged by this, naturally we went to flu viruses.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nAnd so, for the first time, I am showing this.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nWe have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nhighly active against flu viruses.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nHere's the selectivity index numbers --\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nagainst pox, you saw 10s and 20s -- now against flu viruses,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\ncompared to the ribavirin controls,\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nwe have an extraordinarily high activity.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nAnd we're using a natural extract\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nwithin the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nWe tried it against flu A viruses -- H1N1, H3N2 --\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nas well as flu B viruses.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nSo then we tried a blend,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nand in a blend combination we tried it against H5N1,\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nand we got greater than 1,000 selectivity index.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:39.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nI then think that we can make the argument\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nthat we should save the old-growth forest\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nas a matter of national defense.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nI became interested in entomopathogenic fungi --\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nfungi that kill insects.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nOur house was being destroyed by carpenter ants.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nSo, I went to the EPA homepage, and they were recommending studies\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nwith metarhizium species of a group of fungi\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nthat kill carpenter ants, as well as termites.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nI did something that nobody else had done.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nI actually chased the mycelium, when it stopped producing spores.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nThese are spores -- this is in their spores.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nI was able to morph the culture\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\ninto a non-sporulating form.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nAnd so the industry has spent over 100 million dollars\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nspecifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nBut the insects aren't stupid,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nand they would avoid the spores when they came close,\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nand so I morphed the cultures into a non-sporulating form.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nAnd I got my daughter's Barbie doll dish,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nI put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nwere making debris fields, every day,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nin my house, and the ants were attracted to the mycelium,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nbecause there's no spores.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nThey gave it to the queen.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nOne week later, I had no sawdust piles whatsoever.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nAnd then -- a delicate dance between dinner and death --\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nthe mycelium is consumed by the ants,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nthey become mummified, and, boing, a mushroom pops out of their head.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nNow after sporulation, the spores repel.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nSo, the house is no longer suitable for invasion.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nSo, you have a near-permanent solution for reinvasion of termites.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nAnd so my house came down, I received my first patent\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nagainst carpenter ants, termites and fire ants.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nThen we tried extracts, and lo and behold,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nwe can steer insects to different directions.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nThis has huge implications.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nI then received my second patent -- and this is a big one.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nIt's been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nIt covers over 200,000 species.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nThis is the most disruptive technology --\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nI've been told by executives of the pesticide industry --\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nthat they have ever witnessed.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nThis could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nYou could fly 100 Ph.D. students under the umbrella of this concept,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nbecause my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi,\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nprior to sporulation, attract the very insects\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nthat are otherwise repelled by those spores.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nAnd so I came up with a Life Box, because I needed a delivery system.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nThe Life Box -- you're gonna be getting a DVD of the TED conference --\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nyou add soil, you add water,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nyou have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nlike of the Agarikon mushroom.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nThe seeds then are mothered by this mycelium.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nAnd then you put tree seeds in here,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nand then you end up growing -- potentially --\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nan old-growth forest from a cardboard box.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nI want to reinvent the delivery system,\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nand the use of cardboard around the world,\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nso they become ecological footprints.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nIf there's a YouTube-like site that you could put up,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nyou could make it interactive, zip code specific --\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nwhere people could join together,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nand through satellite imaging systems,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nthrough Virtual Earth or Google Earth,\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nyou could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nby the trees that are coming through Life Boxes.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nYou could take a cardboard box delivering shoes,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nyou could add water -- I developed this for the refugee community --\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\ncorns, beans and squash and onions.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nI took several containers -- my wife said, if I could do this, anybody could --\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nand I ended up growing a seed garden.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nThen you harvest the seeds --\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nand thank you, Eric Rasmussen, for your help on this --\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nand then you're harvesting the seed garden.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nThen you can harvest the kernels, and then you just need a few kernels.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nI add mycelium to it, and then I inoculate the corncobs.\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nNow, three corncobs, no other grain --\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nlots of mushrooms begin to form.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nToo many withdrawals from the carbon bank,\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nand so this population will be shut down.\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nBut watch what happens here.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nThe mushrooms then are harvested,\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nbut very importantly,\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nthe mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nAnd so I thought, how could we address the energy crisis in this country?\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nAnd we came up with Econol.\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nGenerating ethanol from cellulose using mycelium as an intermediary --\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nand you gain all the benefits that I've described to you already.\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nBut to go from cellulose to ethanol is ecologically unintelligent,\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nand I think that we need to be econologically intelligent\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nabout the generation of fuels.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nSo, we build the carbon banks on the planet, renew the soils.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nThese are a species that we need to join with.\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nI think engaging mycelium can help save the world.\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:26.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Can we domesticate germs?", "duration": "1071", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_ewald_asks_can_we_domesticate_germs", "transcript": "What I'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter, and actually all the way down into the sewer because I want to talk about diarrhea. And in particular, I want to talk about the design of diarrhea. And when evolutionary biologists talk about design, they really mean design by natural selection. And that brings me to the title of the talk, \"Using Evolution to Design Disease Organisms Intelligently.\" And I also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this. But I'm not just doing this to be cute. I really think that this subtitle explains what somebody like me, who's sort of a Darwin wannabe, how they actually look at one's role in sort of coming into this field of health sciences and medicine. It's really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologists. You actually see a great potential, but you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf, and may actually be very resistant, when one tries to introduce ideas.So, all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions. One is that, why are some disease organisms more harmful? And a very closely related question, which is, how can we take control of this situation once we understand the answer to the first question? How can we make the harmful organisms more mild? And I'm going to be talking, to begin with, as I said, about diarrheal disease organisms. And the focus when I'm talking about the diarrheal organisms, as well as the focus when I'm talking about any organisms that cause acute infectious disease, is to think about the problem from a germ's point of view, germ's-eye view. And in particular, to think about a fundamental idea which I think makes sense out of a tremendous amount of variation in the harmfulness of disease organisms. And that idea is that from the germ's-eye point of view, disease organisms have to get from one host to another, and often they have to rely on the well-being of the host to move them to another host.But not always. Sometimes, you get disease organisms that don't rely on host mobility at all for transmission. And when you have that, then evolutionary theory tells us that natural selection will favor the more exploitative, more predator-like organisms. So, natural selection will favor organisms that are more likely to cause damage. If instead transmission to another host requires host mobility, then we expect that the winners of the competition will be the milder organisms. So, if the pathogen doesn't need the host to be healthy and active, and actual selection favors pathogens that take advantage of those hosts, the winners in the competition are those that exploit the hosts for their own reproductive success. But if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen, then it's the benign ones that tend to be the winners.So, I'm going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases. Diarrheal disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways. They can be transmitted from person-to-person contact, person-to-food-then-to-person contact, when somebody eats contaminated food, or they can be transmitted through the water. And when they're transmitted through the water, unlike the first two modes of transmission, these pathogens don't rely on a healthy host for transmission. A person can be sick in bed and still infect tens, even hundreds of other individuals. To sort of illustrate that, this diagram emphasizes that if you've got a sick person in bed, somebody's going to be taking out the contaminated materials. They're going to wash those contaminated materials, and then the water may move into sources of drinking water. People will come in to those places where you've got contaminated drinking water, bring things back to the family, may drink right at that point. The whole point is that a person who can't move can still infect many other individuals.And so, the theory tells us that when diarrheal disease organisms are transported by water, we expect them to be more predator-like, more harmful. And you can test these ideas. So, one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria, and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water, tend to be more harmful. And the answer is \u2014 yep, they are. Now I put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs, but the main point here is that \u2014 (Laughter) there's a lot of them here, I can tell \u2014 the main point here is that those data points all show a very strong, positive association between the degree to which a disease organism is transmitted by water, and how harmful they are, how much death they cause per untreated infection. So this suggests we're on the right track. But this, to me, suggests that we really need to ask some additional questions.Remember the second question that I raised at the outset was, how can we use this knowledge to make disease organisms evolve to be mild? Now, this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission, you could cause disease organisms to shift from the right-hand side of that graph to the left-hand side of the graph. But it doesn't tell you how long. I mean, if this would require thousands of years, then it's worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens. But if it could occur in just a few years, then it might be a very important way to control some of the nasty problems that we haven't been able to control. In other words, this suggests that we could domesticate these organisms. We could make them evolve to be not so harmful to us.And so, as I was thinking about this, I focused on this organism, which is the El Tor biotype of the organism called Vibrio cholerae. And that is the species of organism that is responsible for causing cholera. And the reason I thought this is a really great organism to look at is that we understand why it's so harmful. It's harmful because it produces a toxin, and that toxin is released when the organism gets into our intestinal tract. It causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine into the lumen, the internal chamber of our intestine, and then that fluid goes the only way it can, which is out the other end. And it flushes out thousands of different other competitors that would otherwise make life difficult for the Vibrios.So what happens, if you've got an organism, it produces a lot of toxin. After a few days of infection you end up having \u2014 the fecal material really isn't so disgusting as we might imagine. It's sort of cloudy water. And if you took a drop of that water, you might find a million diarrheal organisms. If the organism produced a lot of toxin, you might find 10 million, or 100 million. If it didn't produce a lot of this toxin, then you might find a smaller number. So the task is to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission, thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted by person-to-person contact, or person-food-person contact \u2014 both of which would really require that people be mobile and fairly healthy for transmission.Now, I can think of some possible experiments. One would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism \u2014 some that produce a lot of toxins, some that produce a little \u2014 and take those strains and spew them out in different countries. Some countries that might have clean water supplies, so that you can't get waterborne transmission: you expect the organism to evolve to mildness there. Other countries, in which you've got a lot of waterborne transmission, there you expect these organisms to evolve towards a high level of harmfulness, right? There's a little ethical problem in this experiment. I was hoping to hear a few gasps at least. That makes me worry a little bit.(Laughter)But anyhow, the laughter makes me feel a little bit better. And this ethical problem's a big problem. Just to emphasize this, this is what we're really talking about. Here's a girl who's almost dead. She got rehydration therapy, she perked up, within a few days she was looking like a completely different person. So, we don't want to run an experiment like that. But interestingly, just that thing happened in 1991. In 1991, this cholera organism got into Lima, Peru, and within two months it had spread to the neighboring areas. Now, I don't know how that happened, and I didn't have anything to do with it, I promise you. I don't think anybody knows, but I'm not averse to, once that's happened, to see whether or not the prediction that we would make, that I did make before, actually holds up. Did the organism evolve to mildness in a place like Chile, which has some of the most well protected water supplies in Latin America? And did it evolve to be more harmful in a place like Ecuador, which has some of the least well protected? And Peru's got something sort of in between.And so, with funding from the Bosack-Kruger Foundation, I got a lot of strains from these different countries and we measured their toxin production in the lab. And we found that in Chile \u2014 within two months of the invasion of Peru you had strains entering Chile \u2014 and when you look at those strains, in the very far left-hand side of this graph, you see a lot of variation in the toxin production. Each dot corresponds to an islet from a different person \u2014 a lot of variation on which natural selection can act. But the interesting point is, if you look over the 1990s, within a few years the organisms evolved to be more mild. They evolved to produce less toxin. And to just give you a sense of how important this might be, if we look in 1995, we find that there's only one case of cholera, on average, reported from Chile every two years.So, it's controlled. That's how much we have in America, cholera that's acquired endemically, and we don't think we've got a problem here. They didn't \u2014 they solved the problem in Chile. But, before we get too confident, we'd better look at some of those other countries, and make sure that this organism doesn't just always evolve toward mildness. Well, in Peru it didn't. And in Ecuador \u2014 remember, this is the place where it has the highest potential waterborne transmission \u2014 it looked like it got more harmful. In every case there's a lot of variation, but something about the environment the people are living in, and I think the only realistic explanation is that it's the degree of waterborne transmission, favored the harmful strains in one place, and mild strains in another.So, this is very encouraging, it suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow, if we had enough money, could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck. It would make these organisms evolve to mildness, so that even though people might be getting infected, they'd be infected with mild strains. It wouldn't be causing severe disease. But there's another really interesting aspect of this, and this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence, evolution of harmfulness, then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance. And the idea is very simple. If you've got a harmful organism, a high proportion of the people are going to be symptomatic, a high proportion of the people are going to be going to get antibiotics. You've got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance, so you get increased virulence leading to the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance. And once you get increased antibiotic resistance, the antibiotics aren't knocking out the harmful strains anymore. So, you've got a higher level of virulence.So, you get this vicious cycle. The goal is to turn this around. If you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence by cleaning up the water supply, you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease in antibiotic resistance. So, we can go to the same countries and look and see. Did Chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance, whereas did Ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem? If we look in the beginning of the 1990s, we see, again, a lot of variation. In this case, on the Y-axis, we've just got a measure of antibiotic sensitivity \u2014 and I won't go into that. But we've got a lot of variation in antibiotic sensitivity in Chile, Peru and Ecuador, and no trend across the years. But if we look at the end of the 1990s, just half a decade later, we see that in Ecuador they started having a resistance problem. Antibiotic sensitivity was going down. And in Chile, you still had antibiotic sensitivity.So, it looks like Chile dodged two bullets. They got the organism to evolve to mildness, and they got no development of antibiotic resistance. Now, these ideas should apply across the board, as long as you can figure out why some organisms evolved to virulence. And I want to give you just one more example, because we've talked a little bit about malaria. And the example I want to deal with is, or the idea I want to deal with, the question is, what can we do to try to get the malarial organism to evolve to mildness? Now, malaria's transmitted by a mosquito, and normally if you're infected with malaria, and you're feeling sick, it makes it even easier for the mosquito to bite you.And you can show, just by looking at data from literature, that vector-borne diseases are more harmful than non-vector-borne diseases. But I think there's a really fascinating example of what one can do experimentally to try to actually demonstrate this. In the case of waterborne transmission, we'd like to clean up the water supplies, see whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness. In the case of malaria, what we'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses. And the logic's a little more subtle here. If you mosquito-proof houses, when people get sick, they're sitting in bed \u2014 or in mosquito-proof hospitals, they're sitting in a hospital bed \u2014 and the mosquitoes can't get to them.So, if you're a harmful variant in a place where you've got mosquito-proof housing, then you're a loser. The only pathogens that get transmitted are the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy enough to walk outside and get mosquito bites. So, if you were to mosquito proof houses, you should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness. And there's a really wonderful experiment that was done that suggests that we really should go ahead and do this. And that experiment was done in Northern Alabama. Just to give you a little perspective on this, I've given you a star at the intellectual center of the United States, which is right there in Louisville, Kentucky. And this really cool experiment was done about 200 miles south of there, in Northern Alabama, by the Tennessee Valley Authority. They had dammed up the Tennessee River. They'd caused the water to back up, they needed electric, hydroelectric power. And when you get stagnant water, you get mosquitoes. They found in the late '30s \u2014 10 years after they'd made these dams \u2014 that the people in Northern Alabama were infected with malaria, about a third to half of them were infected with malaria.This shows you the positions of some of these dams. OK, so the Tennessee Valley Authority was in a little bit of a bind. There wasn't DDT, there wasn't chloroquines: what do they do? Well, they decided to mosquito proof every house in Northern Alabama. So they did. They divided Northern Alabama into 11 zones, and within three years, about 100 dollars per house, they mosquito proofed every house. And these are the data. Every row across here represents one of those 11 zones. And the asterisks represent the time at which the mosquito proofing was complete. And so what you can see is that just the mosquito-proofed housing, and nothing else, caused the eradication of malaria. And this was, incidentally, published in 1949, in the leading textbook of malaria, called \"Boyd's Malariology.\" But almost no malaria experts even know it exists. This is important, because it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities, you can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses.Now, I would suggest that you could do this in a lot of places. Like, you know, just as you get into the malaria zone, sub-Saharan Africa. But as you move to really intense biting rate areas, like Nigeria, you're certainly not going to eradicate. But that's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness. So to me, it's an experiment that's waiting to happen, and if it confirms the prediction, then we should have a very powerful tool. In a way, much more powerful than the kind of tools we're looking at, because most of what's being done today is to rely on things like anti-malarial drugs. And we know that, although it's great to make those anti-malarial drugs available at really low cost and high frequency, we know that when you make them highly available you're going to get resistance to those drugs. And so it's a short-term solution. This is a long-term solution.What I'm suggesting here is that we could get evolution working in the direction we want it to go, rather than always having to battle evolution as a problem that stymies our efforts to control the pathogen, for example with anti-malarial drugs. So, this table I've given just to emphasize that I've only talked about two examples. But as I said earlier, this kind of logic applies across the board for infectious diseases, and it ought to. Because when we're dealing with infectious diseases, we're dealing with living systems. We're dealing with living systems; we're dealing with systems that evolve. And so if you do something with those systems, they're going to evolve one way or another. And all I'm saying is that we need to figure out how they'll evolve, so that \u2014 we need to adjust our interventions to get the most bang for the intervention buck, so that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go.So, I don't really have time to talk about those things, but I did want to put them up there, just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with. And this links up with a lot of the other ideas that have been talked about. So, for example, earlier today there was discussion of, how do you really lower sexual transmission of HIV? What this emphasizes is that we need to figure out how it will work. Will it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area? It may get lowered if we intervene in ways that encourage people to stay more faithful to partners, and so on.But the key thing is to figure out how to lower it, because if we lower it, we'll get an evolutionary change in the virus. And the data really do support this: that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness. And that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts. So the other thing I really like about this, besides the fact that it brings a whole new dimension into the study of control of disease, is that often the kinds of interventions that you want, that it indicates should be done, are the kinds of interventions that people want anyhow. But people just haven't been able to justify the cost.So, this is the kind of thing I'm talking about. If we know that we're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water, then I think that we can say, let's push the effort into that aspect of the control, so that we can actually solve the problem, even though, if you just look at the frequency of infection, you would suggest that you can't solve the problem well enough just by cleaning up water supply. Anyhow, I'll end that there, and thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 259, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nWhat I'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter,\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nand actually all the way down into the sewer\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nbecause I want to talk about diarrhea.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nAnd in particular, I want to talk about\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nthe design of diarrhea.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nAnd when evolutionary biologists talk about design,\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nthey really mean design by natural selection.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nAnd that brings me to the title of the talk,\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:36.958\n\"Using Evolution to Design Disease Organisms Intelligently.\"\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nAnd I also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nBut I'm not just doing this to be cute.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nI really think that this subtitle explains\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nwhat somebody like me, who's sort of a Darwin wannabe,\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nhow they actually look at one's role in\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nsort of coming into this field of health sciences and medicine.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nIt's really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologists.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nYou actually see a great potential,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nbut you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf,\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nand may actually be very resistant, when one tries\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nto introduce ideas.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nSo, all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nOne is that, why are some disease organisms more harmful?\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nAnd a very closely related question, which is,\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nhow can we take control of this situation once we understand\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nthe answer to the first question?\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nHow can we make the harmful organisms more mild?\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nAnd I'm going to be talking, to begin with, as I said,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nabout diarrheal disease organisms.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nAnd the focus when I'm talking about the diarrheal organisms,\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nas well as the focus when I'm talking about any organisms\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nthat cause acute infectious disease,\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nis to think about the problem from a germ's point of view,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\ngerm's-eye view.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nAnd in particular, to think about a fundamental idea\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nwhich I think makes sense out of a tremendous amount of variation\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nin the harmfulness of disease organisms.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nAnd that idea is that from the germ's-eye point of view,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\ndisease organisms have to get from one host to another,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nand often they have to rely on the well-being of the host\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nto move them to another host.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nBut not always.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nSometimes, you get disease organisms\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nthat don't rely on host mobility at all for transmission.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nAnd when you have that, then evolutionary theory tells us\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nthat natural selection will favor the more exploitative,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nmore predator-like organisms.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nSo, natural selection will favor organisms\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nthat are more likely to cause damage.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nIf instead transmission to another host requires host mobility,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nthen we expect that the winners of the competition\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nwill be the milder organisms.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nSo, if the pathogen doesn't need the host to be healthy and active,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nand actual selection favors pathogens\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nthat take advantage of those hosts,\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nthe winners in the competition are those that exploit the hosts\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nfor their own reproductive success.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nBut if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nthen it's the benign ones that tend to be the winners.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nSo, I'm going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nDiarrheal disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nThey can be transmitted from person-to-person contact,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nperson-to-food-then-to-person contact,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nwhen somebody eats contaminated food,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nor they can be transmitted through the water.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nAnd when they're transmitted through the water,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nunlike the first two modes of transmission,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nthese pathogens don't rely on a healthy host for transmission.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nA person can be sick in bed and still infect tens, even hundreds\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nof other individuals.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nTo sort of illustrate that, this diagram emphasizes that\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nif you've got a sick person in bed,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nsomebody's going to be taking out the contaminated materials.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nThey're going to wash those contaminated materials,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nand then the water may move into sources of drinking water.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nPeople will come in to those places where you've got\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:39.958\ncontaminated drinking water,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nbring things back to the family,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nmay drink right at that point.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nThe whole point is that a person who can't move\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\ncan still infect many other individuals.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nAnd so, the theory tells us that\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nwhen diarrheal disease organisms are transported by water,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nwe expect them to be more predator-like, more harmful.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nAnd you can test these ideas.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nSo, one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nand see whether or not the ones that tend to be\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nmore transmitted by water, tend to be more harmful.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nAnd the answer is -- yep, they are.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nNow I put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nbut the main point here is that --\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nthere's a lot of them here, I can tell --\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nthe main point here is that those data points\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nall show a very strong, positive association between\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nthe degree to which a disease organism is transmitted by water,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nand how harmful they are,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nhow much death they cause per untreated infection.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nSo this suggests we're on the right track.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nBut this, to me, suggests that we really need\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nto ask some additional questions.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nRemember the second question that I raised at the outset was,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nhow can we use this knowledge\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nto make disease organisms evolve to be mild?\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nNow, this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nyou could cause disease organisms to shift from\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nthe right-hand side of that graph to the left-hand side of the graph.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nBut it doesn't tell you how long.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nI mean, if this would require thousands of years,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nthen it's worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nBut if it could occur in just a few years,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nthen it might be a very important way to control\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nsome of the nasty problems that we haven't been able to control.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nIn other words, this suggests that we could\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\ndomesticate these organisms.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nWe could make them evolve to be not so harmful to us.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAnd so, as I was thinking about this, I focused on this organism,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nwhich is the El Tor biotype of the organism called Vibrio cholerae.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nAnd that is the species of organism that is responsible\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nfor causing cholera.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nAnd the reason I thought this is a really great organism to look at\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nis that we understand why it's so harmful.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nIt's harmful because it produces a toxin,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nand that toxin is released when the organism\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:38.958\ngets into our intestinal tract.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nIt causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\ninto the lumen, the internal chamber of our intestine,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nand then that fluid goes the only way it can, which is out the other end.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nAnd it flushes out thousands of different other competitors\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nthat would otherwise make life difficult for the Vibrios.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nSo what happens, if you've got an organism,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nit produces a lot of toxin.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nAfter a few days of infection you end up having --\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nthe fecal material really isn't so disgusting as we might imagine.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nIt's sort of cloudy water.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nAnd if you took a drop of that water,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nyou might find a million diarrheal organisms.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nIf the organism produced a lot of toxin,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nyou might find 10 million, or 100 million.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nIf it didn't produce a lot of this toxin,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nthen you might find a smaller number.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nSo the task is to try to figure out\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nhow to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nto evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nthereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nby person-to-person contact,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nor person-food-person contact --\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nboth of which would really require that people be\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nmobile and fairly healthy for transmission.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nNow, I can think of some possible experiments.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nOne would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism --\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nsome that produce a lot of toxins, some that produce a little --\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nand take those strains and spew them out in different countries.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nSome countries that might have clean water supplies,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nso that you can't get waterborne transmission:\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nyou expect the organism to evolve to mildness there.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nOther countries, in which you've got a lot of waterborne transmission,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nthere you expect these organisms to evolve\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:07.958\ntowards a high level of harmfulness, right?\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nThere's a little ethical problem in this experiment.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nI was hoping to hear a few gasps at least.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nThat makes me worry a little bit.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nBut anyhow, the laughter makes me feel a little bit better.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nAnd this ethical problem's a big problem.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nJust to emphasize this, this is what we're really talking about.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nHere's a girl who's almost dead.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nShe got rehydration therapy, she perked up,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nwithin a few days she was looking like a completely different person.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nSo, we don't want to run an experiment like that.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nBut interestingly, just that thing happened in 1991.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nIn 1991, this cholera organism got into Lima, Peru,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nand within two months it had spread to the neighboring areas.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nNow, I don't know how that happened,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nand I didn't have anything to do with it, I promise you.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nI don't think anybody knows,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nbut I'm not averse to, once that's happened,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nto see whether or not the prediction that we would make,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nthat I did make before, actually holds up.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nDid the organism evolve to mildness in a place like Chile,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nwhich has some of the most well protected water supplies\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nin Latin America?\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nAnd did it evolve to be more harmful in a place like Ecuador,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nwhich has some of the least well protected?\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd Peru's got something sort of in between.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nAnd so, with funding from the Bosack-Kruger Foundation,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nI got a lot of strains from these different countries\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nand we measured their toxin production in the lab.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nAnd we found that in Chile -- within two months of the invasion of Peru\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nyou had strains entering Chile --\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nand when you look at those strains,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nin the very far left-hand side of this graph,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nyou see a lot of variation in the toxin production.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nEach dot corresponds to an islet from a different person --\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\na lot of variation on which natural selection can act.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nBut the interesting point is, if you look over the 1990s,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nwithin a few years the organisms evolved to be more mild.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nThey evolved to produce less toxin.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nAnd to just give you a sense of how important this might be,\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nif we look in 1995, we find that there's only one case of cholera,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\non average, reported from Chile every two years.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nSo, it's controlled.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nThat's how much we have in America,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\ncholera that's acquired endemically,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nand we don't think we've got a problem here.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nThey didn't -- they solved the problem in Chile.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nBut, before we get too confident, we'd better look at some of those other countries,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nand make sure that this organism doesn't just always evolve toward mildness.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nWell, in Peru it didn't.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nAnd in Ecuador -- remember, this is the place where it has\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nthe highest potential waterborne transmission --\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nit looked like it got more harmful.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nIn every case there's a lot of variation,\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nbut something about the environment the people are living in,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nand I think the only realistic explanation is that it's\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nthe degree of waterborne transmission,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nfavored the harmful strains in one place, and mild strains in another.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nSo, this is very encouraging,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nit suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nif we had enough money, could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nIt would make these organisms evolve to mildness,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nso that even though people might be getting infected,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nthey'd be infected with mild strains.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nIt wouldn't be causing severe disease.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nBut there's another really interesting aspect of this,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nand this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nevolution of harmfulness,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nthen you should be able to control antibiotic resistance.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nAnd the idea is very simple.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nIf you've got a harmful organism,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\na high proportion of the people are going to be symptomatic,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\na high proportion of the people are going to be going to get antibiotics.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nYou've got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nso you get increased virulence leading to\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nthe evolution of increased antibiotic resistance.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nAnd once you get increased antibiotic resistance,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nthe antibiotics aren't knocking out the harmful strains anymore.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nSo, you've got a higher level of virulence.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nSo, you get this vicious cycle.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nThe goal is to turn this around.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nIf you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nby cleaning up the water supply,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nyou should be able to get an evolutionary decrease\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nin antibiotic resistance.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nSo, we can go to the same countries and look and see.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nDid Chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nwhereas did Ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem?\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nIf we look in the beginning of the 1990s,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nwe see, again, a lot of variation.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nIn this case, on the Y-axis, we've just got a measure of antibiotic sensitivity --\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nand I won't go into that.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nBut we've got a lot of variation in antibiotic sensitivity in Chile,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nPeru and Ecuador, and no trend across the years.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nBut if we look at the end of the 1990s, just half a decade later,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nwe see that in Ecuador they started having a resistance problem.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nAntibiotic sensitivity was going down.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nAnd in Chile, you still had antibiotic sensitivity.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nSo, it looks like Chile dodged two bullets.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nThey got the organism to evolve to mildness,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nand they got no development of antibiotic resistance.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nNow, these ideas should apply across the board,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nas long as you can figure out why some organisms evolved to virulence.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nAnd I want to give you just one more example,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nbecause we've talked a little bit about malaria.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nAnd the example I want to deal with is,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nor the idea I want to deal with, the question is,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nwhat can we do to try to get the malarial organism to evolve to mildness?\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nNow, malaria's transmitted by a mosquito,\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nand normally if you're infected with malaria, and you're feeling sick,\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nit makes it even easier for the mosquito to bite you.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nAnd you can show, just by looking at data from literature,\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nthat vector-borne diseases are more harmful\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nthan non-vector-borne diseases.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nBut I think there's a really fascinating example\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nof what one can do experimentally to try to actually demonstrate this.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nIn the case of waterborne transmission,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nwe'd like to clean up the water supplies,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nsee whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nIn the case of malaria, what we'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nAnd the logic's a little more subtle here.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nIf you mosquito-proof houses,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nwhen people get sick, they're sitting in bed --\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nor in mosquito-proof hospitals, they're sitting in a hospital bed --\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand the mosquitoes can't get to them.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nSo, if you're a harmful variant\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nin a place where you've got mosquito-proof housing, then you're a loser.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nThe only pathogens that get transmitted\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nare the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy enough\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nto walk outside and get mosquito bites.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nSo, if you were to mosquito proof houses,\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nyou should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nAnd there's a really wonderful experiment that was done\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nthat suggests that we really should go ahead and do this.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nAnd that experiment was done in Northern Alabama.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nJust to give you a little perspective on this,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nI've given you a star at the intellectual center of the United States,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nwhich is right there in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nAnd this really cool experiment was done\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nabout 200 miles south of there, in Northern Alabama,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nby the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nThey had dammed up the Tennessee River.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nThey'd caused the water to back up,\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nthey needed electric, hydroelectric power.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nAnd when you get stagnant water, you get mosquitoes.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nThey found in the late '30s -- 10 years after they'd made these dams --\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nthat the people in Northern Alabama were infected with malaria,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nabout a third to half of them were infected with malaria.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nThis shows you the positions of some of these dams.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nOK, so the Tennessee Valley Authority was in a little bit of a bind.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nThere wasn't DDT, there wasn't chloroquines: what do they do?\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nWell, they decided to mosquito proof every house in Northern Alabama.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nSo they did. They divided Northern Alabama into 11 zones,\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nand within three years, about 100 dollars per house,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nthey mosquito proofed every house.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nAnd these are the data.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nEvery row across here represents one of those 11 zones.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nAnd the asterisks represent the time at which\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nthe mosquito proofing was complete.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nAnd so what you can see is that\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\njust the mosquito-proofed housing, and nothing else,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\ncaused the eradication of malaria.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nAnd this was, incidentally, published in 1949,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nin the leading textbook of malaria, called \"Boyd's Malariology.\"\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nBut almost no malaria experts even know it exists.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nThis is important,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nbecause it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nyou can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nNow, I would suggest that you could do this in a lot of places.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nLike, you know, just as you get into the malaria zone,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nsub-Saharan Africa.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nBut as you move to really intense biting rate areas, like Nigeria,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nyou're certainly not going to eradicate.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nBut that's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nSo to me, it's an experiment that's waiting to happen,\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nand if it confirms the prediction, then\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nwe should have a very powerful tool.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nIn a way, much more powerful than the kind of tools we're looking at,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nbecause most of what's being done today is\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nto rely on things like anti-malarial drugs.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nAnd we know that, although it's great to make those\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nanti-malarial drugs available at really low cost and high frequency,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nwe know that when you make them highly available\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nyou're going to get resistance to those drugs.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nAnd so it's a short-term solution.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nThis is a long-term solution.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nWhat I'm suggesting here is that we could get evolution\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nworking in the direction we want it to go,\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nrather than always having to battle evolution as a problem\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nthat stymies our efforts to control the pathogen,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nfor example with anti-malarial drugs.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nSo, this table I've given just to emphasize\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nthat I've only talked about two examples.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nBut as I said earlier, this kind of logic applies across the board\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nfor infectious diseases, and it ought to.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nBecause when we're dealing with infectious diseases, we're dealing with living systems.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nWe're dealing with living systems;\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nwe're dealing with systems that evolve.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nAnd so if you do something with those systems,\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nthey're going to evolve one way or another.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nAnd all I'm saying is that we need to figure out how they'll evolve,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nso that -- we need to adjust our interventions\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nto get the most bang for the intervention buck,\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nso that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nSo, I don't really have time to talk about those things,\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nbut I did want to put them up there,\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\njust to give you a sense that there really are solutions\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nto controlling the evolution of harmfulness\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nof some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nAnd this links up with a lot of the other ideas that have been talked about.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nSo, for example, earlier today there was discussion of,\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nhow do you really lower sexual transmission of HIV?\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nWhat this emphasizes is that we need to figure out how it will work.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nWill it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area?\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nIt may get lowered if we intervene in ways that\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nencourage people to stay more faithful to partners, and so on.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nBut the key thing is to figure out how to lower it,\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nbecause if we lower it, we'll get an evolutionary change in the virus.\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nAnd the data really do support this:\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nthat you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness.\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nAnd that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nSo the other thing I really like about this,\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nbesides the fact that it brings a whole new dimension\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:02.958\ninto the study of control of disease,\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nis that often the kinds of interventions that you want,\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nthat it indicates should be done,\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nare the kinds of interventions that people want anyhow.\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nBut people just haven't been able to justify the cost.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nSo, this is the kind of thing I'm talking about.\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nIf we know that we're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water,\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nthen I think that we can say,\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nlet's push the effort into that aspect of the control,\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nso that we can actually solve the problem,\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:30.958\neven though, if you just look at the frequency of infection,\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nyou would suggest that you can't solve the problem well enough\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:36.958\njust by cleaning up water supply.\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nAnyhow, I'll end that there, and thank you very much.\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Juggling as art ... and science", "duration": "2222", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/michael_moschen_juggles_rhythm_and_motion", "transcript": "I started juggling a long time ago, but long before that, I was a golfer, and that's what I was, a golfer. And as a golfer and as a kid, one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores, that I sort of lived my whole life, is process. And it's the process of learning things. One of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer, but he was lefty. And he had a real passion for golf, and he also created this whole mythology about Ben Hogan and various things. Well, I learned a lot about interesting things that I knew nothing about at the time, but grew to know stuff about. And that was the mythology of skill.So, one of the things that I love to do is to explore skill. And since Richard put me on this whole thing with music \u2014 I'm supposed to actually be doing a project with Tod Machover with the MIT Media Lab \u2014 it relates a lot to music. But Tod couldn't come and the project is sort of somewhere, I'm not sure whether it's happening the way we thought, or not. But I'm going to explore skill, and juggling, and basically visual music, I guess. OK, you can start the music, thanks.(Music)(Applause)Thanks. Thank you. Now, juggling can be a lot of fun; play with skill and play with space, play with rhythm. And you can turn the mike on now. I'm going to do a couple of pieces. I do a big piece in a triangle and these are three sections from it. Part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space using not just my hands \u2014 because a lot of juggling is hand-oriented \u2014 but using the rhythm of my body and feet, and controlling the balls with my feet.(Applause)Thanks. Now, this next section was an attempt to explore space. You see, I think Richard said something about people that are against something. Well, a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff. Well, I kind of, from my childhood and golf and all that, it's a process of joining with forces. And so what I'd like to do is try to figure out how to join with the space through the technique. So juggling gravity \u2014 up, down. If you figure out what up and down really are, it's a complex physical set of skills to be able to throw a ball down and up and everything, but then you add in sideways.(Applause)Now, I look at it somewhat as a way \u2014 when you learn juggling what you learn is how to feel with your eyes, and see with your hands because you're not looking at your hands, you're looking at where the balls are or you're looking at the audience. So this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm, with the obvious reference to the feet, but it's also time \u2014 where the feet were, where the balls were.(Applause)Thanks. So, visual music: rhythm and complexity. I'm going to build towards complexity now. Juggling three balls is simple and normal.(Laughter)Excuse me.(Laughter)We're jugglers, OK. And remember, you're transposing, you're getting into a subculture here.(Laughter)And juggling \u2014 the balls cross and all that. OK, if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines of different heights, but then hopefully even rhythm. And you can change the rhythm \u2014 good, Michael. You can change the rhythm, if you get out of the lights. OK? Change the rhythm, so it's even. Or you can go back and change the height. Now, skill. But you're boxed in, if you can only do it up and down that way. So, you've got to go after the space down there. OK, then you've got to combine them, because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you. And then you get crazy.(Applause)Now, I'm actually going to ask you to try something, so you've got to pay attention. Complexity: if you spend enough time doing something, time slows down or your skill increases, so your perceptions change. It's learning skills \u2014 like being in a high-speed car crash. Things slow down as you learn, as you learn, as you learn. You may not be able to affect it, it almost drifts on you. It goes. But that's the closest approximation I can have to it.So, complexity. Now, how many here are jugglers? OK, so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this. OK? And whoever laughed there \u2014 you understood it completely, right?(Laughter)No, it looks like a mess. It looks like a mess with a guy there, who's got his hands around that mess, OK. Well, that's what juggling is about, right? It's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand. All right. So, that's one way of doing it, which is five balls down. OK? Another way is the outside. And you could play with the rhythm. Same pattern. Make it faster and smaller. Make it wider. Make it narrower. Bring it back up. OK. It's done. Thanks.(Applause)Now, what I wanted to get to is that you're all very bright, very tactile. I have no idea how computer-oriented or three-dimensionally-oriented you are, but let's try something. OK, so since you all don't understand what the five-ball pattern is, I'm going to give you a little clue. Enough of a clue? So, you get the pattern, right? OK.(Laughter)You're not getting off that easy. All right? Now, do me a favor: follow the ball that I ask you to follow. Green. Yellow. Pink. White. OK, you can do that? Yeah? OK.Now, let's actually learn something. Actually, let me put you in that area of learning, which is very insecure. You want to do it? Yeah? OK. Hands out in front of you. Palms up, together. What you're going to learn is this.(Laughter)OK? So what I want you to do is just listen to me and do it. Index finger, middle finger, ring, little. Little, ring, middle, index. And then open. Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. A little bit faster. Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.(Laughter)All right. A lot of different learning processes going on in here.(Laughter)One learning process that I see is this \u2014(Laughter)OK. Another learning process that I see is this \u2014(Laughter)OK. So, everybody take a deep breath in, breath out. OK. Now, one more time, and \u2014 finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Open. Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. OK. Shake your hands out.Now, I assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer. OK? So, what you're doing is, you're going la, la, la, and you're getting this. OK? So that's exactly what I'm going to ask you to do, but in a slightly different way. You're going to combine it. So what I want you to do is \u2014 fingers. I'll tell you what to do with your fingers, same thing. But I want you to do is also, with your eyes, is follow the colored ball that I ask you to follow.(Laughter)OK? Here we go. So, we're going to start off looking at the white ball \u2014 and I'm going to tell you which color, and I'm also going to tell you to go with your fingers. OK? So white ball and \u2014 finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Pink. Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Green. Finger, finger, finger, finger. Yellow. Finger, finger, finger, pink or finger. Pink, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. All right.(Applause)How did you do? Well? OK. The reason I wanted you to do this is because that's actually what most people face throughout their lives, a moment of learning, a moment of challenge. It's a moment that you can't make sense of. Why the hell should I learn this? OK? Does it really have anything to do with anything in my life? You know, I can't decipher \u2014 is it fun? Is it challenging? Am I supposed to cheat?(Laughter)You know, what are you supposed to do? You've got somebody up here who is the operative principle of doing that for his whole life. OK? Trying to figure that stuff out. But is it going to get you anywhere? It's just a moment. That's all it is, a moment. OK? I'm going to change the script for one second. Just let me do this. I don't need music for it. Talking about time in a moment. There's a piece that I recently developed which was all about that, a moment. And what I do as a creative artist is I develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects.What I've done for you here, I developed a lot of those tricks and I put the choreography together, but they're not original techniques. Now, I'm going to start showing you some original techniques that come from the work that I've developed. OK? So, a moment, how would you define a moment? Well, as a juggler, what I wanted to do was create something that was representational of a moment.Ahhh. All right, I'm going to get on my knees and do it. So, a moment.(Rattling)OK? And then, what I did as a juggler was say, OK, what can I do to make that something that is dependent on something else, another dynamic.(Rattling)So, a moment.(Rattling)Another moment.(Rattling)Excuse me, still getting there. A moment that travels.(Rattling)A moment \u2014 no, we'll try that again. It separates, and comes back together. Time. How can you look at time? And what do you dedicate it to, in exploring a particular thing? Well, obviously, there's something in here, and you can all have a guess as to what it is. There's a mystery. There's a mystery in the moment. And it has to settle. And then it's dependent on something else. And then it comes to rest. Just a little thing about time.Now, this has expanded into a much bigger piece, because I use ramps of different parabolas that I roll the balls on while I'm keeping time with this. But I just thought I'd talk about a moment.(Applause)All right. OK. Can we show the video of the triangle? Are we ready to do that? Yes? This is the piece that I told you about. It's a much bigger piece that I do exploring the space of a geometric triangle.(Applause)Thanks. The only thing I'll say about the last session is, you ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees at 120 miles an hour?(Laughter)The only other thing is, it was a real shock. I always drove motorcycles. And when I bought my first car, it shocked me that it cost three times more than my parents' house. Interesting.Anyway, balance: constant movement to find an approach to stillness. Cheating.(Laughter)Balance: making up the rules so you can't cheat, so you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body. To have a conversation with it. To speak. To listen.(Laughter)Hup. Now, it's dependent on rhythm, and keeping a center of balance. When it falls, going underneath. So, there's a rhythm to it. The rhythm can get much smaller. As your skill increases, you learn to find those tinier spaces, those tinier movements. Thanks.(Applause)Now, I'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece that is about balance in some ways, and also \u2014 oh, actually, if you're bored, not here, here's one use for it.(Laughter)You can go with the \"Sticks One\" music.(Music)(Applause)Thanks. That has a certain kind of balance to it, which is all about plumb. I apprenticed with a carpenter and learned about plumb, square and level. And they influenced that, and this next piece, which I'll do a little segment of. \"Two Sticks,\" you can go with it. Thanks. Which is again exploring space, or the lines in space.(Music)(Applause)Working with space and the lines in space in a different way. Oh, let's see here.(Applause)So, I'll come back to that in a second. But working with one ball, now, what if you attach something to it, or change it. This is a little thing that I made because I really like the idea of curves and balls together. And then creating space and the rhythm of space, using the surface of the balls, the surface of the arms. Just a little toy. Which leads me to the next thing, which is \u2014 what have I got here? OK. All right.I'm actually leading up to something, the newest thing that I'm working on. This is not it. This is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape.(Applause)Now, what I just did was I worked with the mathematics \u2014 the diameter and the circumference. Sometimes these pieces are mathematical, in that way that I look at a shape and say, what about if I use this and this and this. Sometimes what happens in life affects my choice of objects that I try to work with.The next piece that I'm going to do \u2014 which is the cylinders piece, if you want to get that up \u2014 it has to do with cylinder seals from about 5,000 years ago, which were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay with all sorts of great designs. I love ceramics and all of that. It's a combination of that, the beauty of that, the shape, and the stories that were involved in it, as well as the fact that they protected the contents.The second influence on this piece came from recycling and looking into a tin can recycling bin and seeing all that beautiful emptiness. So, if you want to go with the music for cylinders.(Music)(Applause)Talking about geometry and everything, if you take the circle and you split it in half \u2014 can you run \"S-Curve music?\" I'm going to do just a short version of it. Circles split in half and rotated, and mythology.(Music)(Applause)Anyway, that piece also has a kinetic sculpture in the middle of it, and I dance around a small stage so \u2014 two minutes, just to end? The latest piece that I'm working on \u2014 what I love is that I never know what I'm working on, why I'm working on it. They're not ideas, they're instincts. And the latest thing that I'm working on \u2014(Clattering) \u2014is something really \u2014 I don't know what it is yet. And that's good. I like not to know for as long as possible. Well, because then it tells me the truth, instead of me imposing the truth. And what it is, is working with both positive and negative space but also with these curves. And what it involves, and I don't know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not, but I'll do a little bit of it.It initially started off with me stacking these things, bunches of them, and then playing with the sense of space, of filling in the space. And then it started changing, and become folding on themselves. And then changing levels. Because my attempt is to make visual instruments, not to just make \u2014 I'll try one other thing. For work in three dimensions, with your perceptions of space and time. Now, I don't know exactly where it's going, but I've got a bit of effort involved in this thing. And it's going to change as I go through it. But I really like it, it feels right. This may not be the right shape, and \u2014 look at this shape, and then I'll show you the first design I ever put to it, just to see, just to play, because I love all different kinds of things to play with. Let's see here. To work with the positive and negative in a different way. And to change, and to change.So, I'm off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space. We'll see what I come up with. Thanks for having me.(Applause)", "id": 260, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nI started juggling a long time ago,\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nbut long before that, I was a golfer, and that's what I was, a golfer.\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nAnd as a golfer and as a kid,\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.958\none of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores,\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nthat I sort of lived my whole life, is process.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nAnd it's the process of learning things.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nOne of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer, but he was lefty.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nAnd he had a real passion for golf,\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nand he also created this whole mythology\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nabout Ben Hogan and various things.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nWell, I learned a lot about interesting things\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nthat I knew nothing about at the time, but grew to know stuff about.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nAnd that was the mythology of skill.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nSo, one of the things that I love to do is to explore skill.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nAnd since Richard put me on this whole thing with music --\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nI'm supposed to actually be doing a project with Tod Machover\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nwith the MIT Media Lab -- it relates a lot to music.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nBut Tod couldn't come and the project is sort of somewhere,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nI'm not sure whether it's happening the way we thought, or not.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nBut I'm going to explore skill, and juggling,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nand basically visual music, I guess.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nOK, you can start the music, thanks.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:04:21.958\n(Music)\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nThanks. Thank you. Now, juggling can be a lot of fun;\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nplay with skill and play with space, play with rhythm.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nAnd you can turn the mike on now. I'm going to do a couple of pieces.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nI do a big piece in a triangle\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nand these are three sections from it.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nPart of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nusing not just my hands -- because a lot of juggling is hand-oriented --\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nbut using the rhythm of my body and feet,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nand controlling the balls with my feet.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nThanks. Now, this next section was an attempt to explore space.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nYou see, I think Richard said something about people that are against something.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nWell, a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nWell, I kind of, from my childhood and golf and all that,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nit's a process of joining with forces.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nAnd so what I'd like to do is try to figure out\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nhow to join with the space through the technique.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nSo juggling gravity -- up, down.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nIf you figure out what up and down really are,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nit's a complex physical set of skills\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nto be able to throw a ball down and up and everything,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nbut then you add in sideways.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:35.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nNow, I look at it somewhat as a way -- when you learn juggling\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nwhat you learn is how to feel with your eyes, and see with your hands\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nbecause you're not looking at your hands,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nyou're looking at where the balls are or you're looking at the audience.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nSo this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nwith the obvious reference to the feet,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nbut it's also time -- where the feet were, where the balls were.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:28.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nThanks. So, visual music: rhythm and complexity.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nI'm going to build towards complexity now.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nJuggling three balls is simple and normal.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nExcuse me.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nWe're jugglers, OK. And remember, you're transposing,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nyou're getting into a subculture here.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nAnd juggling -- the balls cross and all that.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nOK, if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nof different heights, but then hopefully even rhythm.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nAnd you can change the rhythm -- good, Michael.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nYou can change the rhythm, if you get out of the lights.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nOK? Change the rhythm, so it's even.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nOr you can go back and change the height. Now, skill.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nBut you're boxed in, if you can only do it up and down that way.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nSo, you've got to go after the space down there.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nOK, then you've got to combine them,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nbecause then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAnd then you get crazy.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:56.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nNow, I'm actually going to ask you to try something,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nso you've got to pay attention. Complexity:\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nif you spend enough time doing something, time slows down\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nor your skill increases, so your perceptions change.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nIt's learning skills -- like being in a high-speed car crash.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nThings slow down as you learn, as you learn, as you learn.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nYou may not be able to affect it, it almost drifts on you. It goes.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nBut that's the closest approximation I can have to it.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nSo, complexity. Now, how many here are jugglers?\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nOK, so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nOK? And whoever laughed there --\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nyou understood it completely, right?\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nNo, it looks like a mess. It looks like a mess with a guy there,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nwho's got his hands around that mess, OK.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nWell, that's what juggling is about, right?\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nIt's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAll right. So, that's one way of doing it, which is five balls down.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nOK? Another way is the outside.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nAnd you could play with the rhythm.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nSame pattern.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nMake it faster and smaller.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nMake it wider.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nMake it narrower.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nBring it back up.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nOK. It's done. Thanks.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nNow, what I wanted to get to is that you're all very bright, very tactile.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nI have no idea how computer-oriented or three-dimensionally-oriented you are,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nbut let's try something.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nOK, so since you all don't understand what the five-ball pattern is,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nI'm going to give you a little clue.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nEnough of a clue? So, you get the pattern, right? OK.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nYou're not getting off that easy. All right?\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nNow, do me a favor: follow the ball that I ask you to follow.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nGreen.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nYellow.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nPink.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nWhite.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nOK, you can do that? Yeah? OK.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nNow, let's actually learn something.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nActually, let me put you in that area of learning, which is very insecure.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nYou want to do it? Yeah? OK.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nHands out in front of you. Palms up, together.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nWhat you're going to learn is this.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nOK? So what I want you to do is just listen to me and do it.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nIndex finger, middle finger, ring, little.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nLittle, ring, middle, index. And then open.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nFinger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nA little bit faster.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nFinger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nFinger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nAll right. A lot of different learning processes going on in here.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nOne learning process that I see is this --\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nOK. Another learning process that I see is this --\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nOK. So, everybody take a deep breath in, breath out. OK.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nNow, one more time, and --\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nfinger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Open.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nFinger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. OK.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nShake your hands out.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nNow, I assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nOK? So, what you're doing is, you're going la, la, la,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nand you're getting this. OK?\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nSo that's exactly what I'm going to ask you to do,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nbut in a slightly different way. You're going to combine it.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nSo what I want you to do is -- fingers.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nI'll tell you what to do with your fingers, same thing.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nBut I want you to do is also, with your eyes,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nis follow the colored ball that I ask you to follow.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nOK? Here we go.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nSo, we're going to start off looking at the white ball --\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nand I'm going to tell you which color,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nand I'm also going to tell you to go with your fingers. OK?\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nSo white ball and --\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nfinger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Pink.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nFinger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Green.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nFinger, finger, finger, finger. Yellow.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nFinger, finger, finger, pink or finger.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nPink, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nAll right.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nHow did you do? Well? OK. The reason I wanted you to do this is\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nbecause that's actually what most people face throughout their lives,\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\na moment of learning, a moment of challenge.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nIt's a moment that you can't make sense of.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nWhy the hell should I learn this? OK?\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nDoes it really have anything to do with anything in my life?\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nYou know, I can't decipher -- is it fun? Is it challenging? Am I supposed to cheat?\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:26.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nYou know, what are you supposed to do?\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nYou've got somebody up here who is the operative principle\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nof doing that for his whole life. OK?\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nTrying to figure that stuff out. But is it going to get you anywhere?\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nIt's just a moment. That's all it is, a moment. OK?\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nI'm going to change the script for one second. Just let me do this.\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nI don't need music for it. Talking about time in a moment.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nThere's a piece that I recently developed which was all about that,\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:54.958\na moment. And what I do as a creative artist\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nis I develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects.\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nWhat I've done for you here, I developed a lot of those tricks\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nand I put the choreography together,\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nbut they're not original techniques.\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nNow, I'm going to start showing you some original techniques\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nthat come from the work that I've developed. OK?\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nSo, a moment, how would you define a moment?\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nWell, as a juggler, what I wanted to do was create something\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nthat was representational of a moment.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nAhhh.\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nAll right, I'm going to get on my knees and do it.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nSo, a moment.\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:38.958\n(Rattling)\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nOK? And then, what I did as a juggler was say,\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nOK, what can I do to make that something\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nthat is dependent on something else, another dynamic.\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:18:01.958\n(Rattling)\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nSo, a moment.\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:08.958\n(Rattling)\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nAnother moment.\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:16.958\n(Rattling)\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nExcuse me, still getting there. A moment that travels.\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:26.958\n(Rattling)\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nA moment -- no, we'll try that again. It separates, and comes back together.\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nTime. How can you look at time?\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nAnd what do you dedicate it to, in exploring a particular thing?\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:44.958\nWell, obviously, there's something in here,\n\n00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:46.958\nand you can all have a guess as to what it is.\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:48.958\nThere's a mystery. There's a mystery in the moment.\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:52.958\nAnd it has to settle. And then it's dependent on something else.\n\n00:18:52.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nAnd then it comes to rest. Just a little thing about time.\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nNow, this has expanded into a much bigger piece,\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nbecause I use ramps of different parabolas that I roll the balls on\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nwhile I'm keeping time with this.\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nBut I just thought I'd talk about a moment.\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:13.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:19.958\nAll right. OK. Can we show the video of the triangle?\n\n00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nAre we ready to do that? Yes?\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:23.958\nThis is the piece that I told you about.\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:27.958\nIt's a much bigger piece that I do exploring the space of a geometric triangle.\n\n00:20:22.958 --> 00:20:26.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:20:27.958 --> 00:20:31.958\nThanks. The only thing I'll say about the last session is,\n\n00:20:31.958 --> 00:20:35.958\nyou ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees\n\n00:20:35.958 --> 00:20:37.958\nat 120 miles an hour?\n\n00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:41.958\nThe only other thing is, it was a real shock.\n\n00:20:41.958 --> 00:20:45.958\nI always drove motorcycles. And when I bought my first car, it shocked me\n\n00:20:45.958 --> 00:20:50.958\nthat it cost three times more than my parents' house. Interesting.\n\n00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:52.958\nAnyway, balance:\n\n00:20:52.958 --> 00:20:58.958\nconstant movement to find an approach to stillness.\n\n00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:00.958\nCheating.\n\n00:21:00.958 --> 00:21:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:21:03.958 --> 00:21:07.958\nBalance: making up the rules so you can't cheat,\n\n00:21:07.958 --> 00:21:17.958\nso you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body.\n\n00:21:18.958 --> 00:21:28.958\nTo have a conversation with it. To speak. To listen.\n\n00:21:28.958 --> 00:21:29.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:21:29.958 --> 00:21:32.958\nHup. Now, it's dependent on rhythm,\n\n00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:39.958\nand keeping a center of balance. When it falls, going underneath.\n\n00:21:40.958 --> 00:21:42.958\nSo, there's a rhythm to it.\n\n00:21:44.958 --> 00:21:46.958\nThe rhythm can get much smaller.\n\n00:21:54.958 --> 00:21:59.958\nAs your skill increases, you learn to find those tinier spaces,\n\n00:22:00.958 --> 00:22:04.958\nthose tinier movements. Thanks.\n\n00:22:04.958 --> 00:22:07.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:22:08.958 --> 00:22:10.958\nNow, I'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece\n\n00:22:10.958 --> 00:22:16.958\nthat is about balance in some ways, and also --\n\n00:22:17.958 --> 00:22:23.958\noh, actually, if you're bored, not here, here's one use for it.\n\n00:22:23.958 --> 00:22:32.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:22:33.958 --> 00:22:36.958\nYou can go with the \"Sticks One\" music.\n\n00:22:40.958 --> 00:24:04.958\n(Music)\n\n00:24:04.958 --> 00:24:11.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:24:11.958 --> 00:24:17.958\nThanks. That has a certain kind of balance to it, which is all about plumb.\n\n00:24:17.958 --> 00:24:23.958\nI apprenticed with a carpenter and learned about plumb, square and level.\n\n00:24:23.958 --> 00:24:26.958\nAnd they influenced that, and this next piece, which I'll do a little segment of.\n\n00:24:26.958 --> 00:24:29.958\n\"Two Sticks,\" you can go with it. Thanks.\n\n00:24:32.958 --> 00:24:36.958\nWhich is again exploring space, or the lines in space.\n\n00:24:36.958 --> 00:25:37.958\n(Music)\n\n00:25:37.958 --> 00:25:39.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:25:39.958 --> 00:25:46.958\nWorking with space and the lines in space in a different way.\n\n00:25:47.958 --> 00:25:49.958\nOh, let's see here.\n\n00:26:20.958 --> 00:26:21.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:26:22.958 --> 00:26:27.958\nSo, I'll come back to that in a second. But working with one ball,\n\n00:26:27.958 --> 00:26:33.958\nnow, what if you attach something to it, or change it.\n\n00:26:34.958 --> 00:26:36.958\nThis is a little thing that I made\n\n00:26:36.958 --> 00:26:41.958\nbecause I really like the idea of curves and balls together.\n\n00:26:42.958 --> 00:26:48.958\nAnd then creating space and the rhythm of space,\n\n00:26:48.958 --> 00:26:52.958\nusing the surface of the balls, the surface of the arms.\n\n00:26:53.958 --> 00:26:57.958\nJust a little toy. Which leads me to the next thing,\n\n00:26:57.958 --> 00:26:59.958\nwhich is --\n\n00:26:59.958 --> 00:27:06.958\nwhat have I got here? OK. All right.\n\n00:27:12.958 --> 00:27:13.958\nI'm actually leading up to something,\n\n00:27:13.958 --> 00:27:17.958\nthe newest thing that I'm working on. This is not it.\n\n00:27:17.958 --> 00:27:20.958\nThis is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape.\n\n00:28:06.958 --> 00:28:13.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:28:13.958 --> 00:28:16.958\nNow, what I just did was I worked with the mathematics --\n\n00:28:16.958 --> 00:28:18.958\nthe diameter and the circumference.\n\n00:28:19.958 --> 00:28:22.958\nSometimes these pieces are mathematical, in that way\n\n00:28:22.958 --> 00:28:25.958\nthat I look at a shape and say, what about if I use this and this and this.\n\n00:28:25.958 --> 00:28:30.958\nSometimes what happens in life affects my choice\n\n00:28:30.958 --> 00:28:32.958\nof objects that I try to work with.\n\n00:28:32.958 --> 00:28:35.958\nThe next piece that I'm going to do -- which is the cylinders piece,\n\n00:28:35.958 --> 00:28:37.958\nif you want to get that up --\n\n00:28:37.958 --> 00:28:44.958\nit has to do with cylinder seals from about 5,000 years ago,\n\n00:28:44.958 --> 00:28:49.958\nwhich were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay\n\n00:28:49.958 --> 00:28:53.958\nwith all sorts of great designs. I love ceramics and all of that.\n\n00:28:53.958 --> 00:28:57.958\nIt's a combination of that, the beauty of that, the shape,\n\n00:28:57.958 --> 00:29:01.958\nand the stories that were involved in it,\n\n00:29:02.958 --> 00:29:06.958\nas well as the fact that they protected the contents.\n\n00:29:06.958 --> 00:29:11.958\nThe second influence on this piece came from recycling\n\n00:29:11.958 --> 00:29:14.958\nand looking into a tin can recycling bin\n\n00:29:14.958 --> 00:29:17.958\nand seeing all that beautiful emptiness.\n\n00:29:17.958 --> 00:29:20.958\nSo, if you want to go with the music for cylinders.\n\n00:29:20.958 --> 00:32:09.958\n(Music)\n\n00:32:10.958 --> 00:32:13.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:32:13.958 --> 00:32:16.958\nTalking about geometry and everything,\n\n00:32:16.958 --> 00:32:21.958\nif you take the circle and you split it in half --\n\n00:32:21.958 --> 00:32:23.958\ncan you run \"S-Curve music?\"\n\n00:32:23.958 --> 00:32:26.958\nI'm going to do just a short version of it.\n\n00:32:28.958 --> 00:32:32.958\nCircles split in half and rotated, and mythology.\n\n00:32:32.958 --> 00:34:10.958\n(Music)\n\n00:34:10.958 --> 00:34:17.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:34:17.958 --> 00:34:22.958\nAnyway, that piece also has a kinetic sculpture in the middle of it,\n\n00:34:22.958 --> 00:34:25.958\nand I dance around a small stage so --\n\n00:34:25.958 --> 00:34:29.958\ntwo minutes, just to end? The latest piece that I'm working on --\n\n00:34:29.958 --> 00:34:33.958\nwhat I love is that I never know what I'm working on, why I'm working on it.\n\n00:34:33.958 --> 00:34:35.958\nThey're not ideas, they're instincts.\n\n00:34:36.958 --> 00:34:38.958\nAnd the latest thing that I'm working on --\n\n00:34:38.958 --> 00:34:43.958\n(Clattering) --\n\n00:34:44.958 --> 00:34:49.958\nis something really -- I don't know what it is yet.\n\n00:34:49.958 --> 00:34:54.958\nAnd that's good. I like not to know for as long as possible.\n\n00:34:55.958 --> 00:34:57.958\nWell, because then it tells me the truth,\n\n00:34:57.958 --> 00:34:59.958\ninstead of me imposing the truth.\n\n00:35:00.958 --> 00:35:03.958\nAnd what it is, is working with both positive and negative space\n\n00:35:03.958 --> 00:35:05.958\nbut also with these curves.\n\n00:35:05.958 --> 00:35:07.958\nAnd what it involves,\n\n00:35:07.958 --> 00:35:10.958\nand I don't know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not,\n\n00:35:10.958 --> 00:35:12.958\nbut I'll do a little bit of it.\n\n00:35:12.958 --> 00:35:15.958\nIt initially started off with me stacking these things,\n\n00:35:15.958 --> 00:35:20.958\nbunches of them, and then playing with the sense of space,\n\n00:35:21.958 --> 00:35:27.958\nof filling in the space. And then it started changing,\n\n00:35:30.958 --> 00:35:33.958\nand become folding on themselves.\n\n00:35:37.958 --> 00:35:39.958\nAnd then changing levels.\n\n00:35:41.958 --> 00:35:44.958\nBecause my attempt is to make visual instruments,\n\n00:35:46.958 --> 00:35:49.958\nnot to just make -- I'll try one other thing.\n\n00:35:51.958 --> 00:35:57.958\nFor work in three dimensions, with your perceptions of space and time.\n\n00:35:57.958 --> 00:35:59.958\nNow, I don't know exactly where it's going,\n\n00:35:59.958 --> 00:36:01.958\nbut I've got a bit of effort involved in this thing.\n\n00:36:01.958 --> 00:36:04.958\nAnd it's going to change as I go through it.\n\n00:36:05.958 --> 00:36:07.958\nBut I really like it, it feels right.\n\n00:36:07.958 --> 00:36:11.958\nThis may not be the right shape, and -- look at this shape,\n\n00:36:11.958 --> 00:36:15.958\nand then I'll show you the first design I ever put to it,\n\n00:36:15.958 --> 00:36:18.958\njust to see, just to play,\n\n00:36:18.958 --> 00:36:21.958\nbecause I love all different kinds of things to play with.\n\n00:36:21.958 --> 00:36:23.958\nLet's see here.\n\n00:36:23.958 --> 00:36:26.958\nTo work with the positive and negative in a different way.\n\n00:36:30.958 --> 00:36:32.958\nAnd to change, and to change.\n\n00:36:32.958 --> 00:36:36.958\nSo, I'm off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space.\n\n00:36:37.958 --> 00:36:40.958\nWe'll see what I come up with. Thanks for having me.\n\n00:36:41.958 --> 00:36:49.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A thought experiment on the intelligence of crows", "duration": "606", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/joshua_klein_on_the_intelligence_of_crows", "transcript": "How many of you have seen the Alfred Hitchcock film \"The Birds\"? Any of you get really freaked out by that? You might want to leave now.(Laughter)So this is a vending machine for crows. Over the past few days, many of you have been asking, \"How did you come to this? How did you get started doing this?\" It started, as with many great ideas, or many ideas you can't get rid of, anyway, at a cocktail party. About 10 years ago, I was at a cocktail party with a friend of mine. We were sitting there, and he was complaining about the crows that were all over his yard and making a big mess. And he was telling me we ought to eradicate these things, kill them, because they're making a mess. I said that was stupid, maybe we should just train them to do something useful. And he said that was impossible.And I'm sure I'm in good company in finding that tremendously annoying, when someone tells you it's impossible. So I spent the next 10 years reading about crows in my spare time.(Laughter)And after 10 years of this, my wife said, \"You've got to do this thing you've been talking about, and build the vending machine.\" So I did. But part of the reason I found this interesting is, I started noticing that we're very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion, and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living; they're surviving. And I'm talking specifically about synanthropic species, which have adapted specifically for human ecologies, species like rats and cockroaches and crows.And as I started looking at them, I was finding that they had hyper-adapted. They'd become extremely adept at living with us. And in return, we just tried to kill them all the time.(Laughter)And in doing so, we were breeding them for parasitism. We were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt new ways. So, for example, rats are incredibly responsive breeders. And cockroaches, as anyone who's tried to get rid of them knows, have become really immune to the poisons that we're using. So I thought, let's build something that's mutually beneficial; something that we can both benefit from, and find some way to make a new relationship with these species. So I built the vending machine.But the story of the vending machine is a little more interesting if you know more about crows. It turns out, crows aren't just surviving with human beings; they're actually thriving. They're found everywhere on the planet except for the Arctic and the southern tip of South America. And in all that area, they're only rarely found breeding more than five kilometers away from human beings. So we may not think about them, but they're always around. And not surprisingly, given the human population growth, more than half of the human population is living in cities now. And out of those, nine-tenths of the human growth population is occurring in cities. We're seeing a population boom with crows. So bird counts are indicating that we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers. So that's no great surprise.But what was really interesting to me was to find out that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way. And I'll give you an example of that. This is Betty. She's a New Caledonian crow. And these crows use sticks in the wild to get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood. Here, she's trying to get a piece of meat out of a tube. But the researchers had a problem. They messed up and left just a stick of wire in there. And she hadn't had the opportunity to do this before. You see, it wasn't working very well. So she adapted.Now, this is completely unprompted; she had never seen this done before. No one taught her to bend this into a hook or had shown her how it could happen. But she did it all on her own. So keep in mind \u2014 she's never seen this done.(Laughter)Right.(Laughter)Yeah. All right.(Applause)So that's the part where the researchers freak out.(Laughter)It turns out, we've been finding more and more that crows are really intelligent. Their brains are in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are. There's all kinds of anecdotes for the different kinds of intelligence they have. For example, in Sweden, crows will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice. And when the fishermen move off, the crows fly down, reel up the lines, and eat the fish or the bait. It's pretty annoying for the fishermen.On an entirely different tack, at University of Washington a few years ago, they were doing an experiment where they captured some crows on campus. Some students went out, netted some crows, brought them in, weighed and measured them, and let them back out again. And they were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week, whenever these particular students walked around campus, these crows would caw at them and run around, and make their life kind of miserable.(Laughter)They were significantly less entertained when this went on for the next week. And the next month. And after summer break. Until they finally graduated and left campus, and \u2014 glad to get away, I'm sure \u2014 came back sometime later, and found the crows still remembered them.(Laughter)So, the moral being: don't piss off crows. So now, students at the University of Washington that are studying these crows, do so with a giant wig and a big mask.(Laughter)It's fairly interesting.(Laughter)So we know these crows are really smart, but the more I dug into this, the more I found that they actually have an even more significant adaptation.Video: Crows have become highly skilled at making a living in these new urban environments. In this Japanese city, they have devised a way of eating a food that normally they can't manage: drop it among the traffic. The problem now is collecting the bits, without getting run over. Wait for the light to stop the traffic. Then, collect your cracked nut in safety.(Laughter)(Applause)Joshua Klein: Yeah, pretty interesting. What's significant about this isn't that crows are using cars to crack nuts. In fact, that's old hat for crows. This happened about 10 years ago in a place called Sendai City, at a driving school in the suburbs of Tokyo. And since that time, all the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior. Now every crow within five kilometers is standing by a sidewalk, waiting to collect its lunch.So they're learning from each other. And research bears this out. Parents seem to be teaching their young. They learn from their peers, they learn from their enemies. If I have a little extra time, I'll tell you about a case of crow infidelity that illustrates that nicely. The point being, they've developed cultural adaptation. And as we heard yesterday, that's the Pandora's box that's getting human beings in trouble, and we're starting to see it with them. They're able to very quickly and very flexibly adapt to new challenges and new resources in their environment, which is really useful if you live in a city.So we know that there's lots of crows. We found out they're really smart and they can teach each other. When all this became clear, I realized the only obvious thing to do is build a vending machine. So that's what we did. This is a vending machine for crows. And it uses Skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages. It's pretty simple. Basically, what happens is that we put this out in a field or someplace where there's lots of crows. We put coins and peanuts all around the base of the machine. Crows eventually come by, eat the peanuts, and get used to the machine being there. Eventually, they eat all the peanuts. Then they see peanuts here on the feeder tray, and hop up and help themselves. Then they leave, the machine spits up more coins and peanuts, and life is dandy if you're a crow \u2014 you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut.So when they get really used to that, we move on to the crows coming back. Now they're used to the sound of the machine; they keep coming back and digging out peanuts from the pile of coins that's there. When they get really happy about this, we stymie them.We move to the third stage, where we only give them a coin. Now, like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing, this really pisses them off. So they do what they do in nature when they're looking for something: sweep things out of the way with their beak. They do that here, and that knocks the coins down the slot. When that happens, they get a peanut. This goes on for some time. The crows learn that all they have to do is show up, wait for the coin to come out, put it in the slot, then get their peanut.When they're good and comfortable with that, we move to the final stage, where they show up and nothing happens. This is where we see the difference between crows and other animals. Squirrels, for example, would show up, look for the peanut, go away. Come back, look for the peanut, go away. They do this maybe half a dozen times before they get bored, and then they go off and play in traffic.Crows, on the other hand, show up and they try and figure it out. They know this machine has been messing with them through three different stages of behavior.(Laughter)They figure there must be more to it. So they poke at it and peck at it. And eventually some crow gets a bright idea: \"Hey, there's lots of coins lying around from the first stage, hops down, picks it up, drops it in the slot, and we're off to the races. That crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts, until his friends figure out how to do it, and then there we go.So, what's significant about this to me isn't that we can train crows to pick up peanuts. Mind you, there's 216 million dollars' worth of change lost every year, but I'm not sure I can depend on that ROI from crows.(Laughter)Instead, I think we should look a little bit larger. I think crows can be trained to do other things. For example, why not train them to pick up garbage after stadium events? Or find expensive components from discarded electronics? Or maybe do search and rescue? The main point of all this for me is, we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species. We can find ways to interact with these other species that doesn't involve exterminating them, but involves finding an equilibrium with them that's a useful balance.Thanks very much.(Applause)", "id":

00:00:17.815\nAny of you get really freaked out by that?\n\n00:00:18.496 --> 00:00:19.879\nYou might want to leave now.\n\n00:00:19.903 --> 00:00:20.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.961\nSo this is a vending machine for crows.\n\n00:00:22.985 --> 00:00:25.478\nOver the past few days,\nmany of you have been asking,\n\n00:00:25.502 --> 00:00:28.492\n\"How did you come to this?\nHow did you get started doing this?\"\n\n00:00:28.516 --> 00:00:30.285\nIt started, as with many great ideas,\n\n00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:32.345\nor many ideas you can't\nget rid of, anyway,\n\n00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.524\nat a cocktail party.\n\n00:00:33.548 --> 00:00:36.758\nAbout 10 years ago, I was at a cocktail\nparty with a friend of mine.\n\n00:00:36.782 --> 00:00:39.671\nWe were sitting there,\nand he was complaining about the crows\n\n00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:42.066\nthat were all over his yard\nand making a big mess.\n\n00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.792\nAnd he was telling me\nwe ought to eradicate these things,\n\n00:00:44.816 --> 00:00:46.788\nkill them, because they're making a mess.\n\n00:00:46.812 --> 00:00:47.963\nI said that was stupid,\n\n00:00:47.987 --> 00:00:50.560\nmaybe we should just train them\nto do something useful.\n\n00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:52.115\nAnd he said that was impossible.\n\n00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:55.511\nAnd I'm sure I'm in good company\nin finding that tremendously annoying,\n\n00:00:55.535 --> 00:00:57.415\nwhen someone tells you it's impossible.\n\n00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:00.569\nSo I spent the next 10 years reading\nabout crows in my spare time.\n\n00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:03.369\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:03.393 --> 00:01:05.590\nAnd after 10 years of this, my wife said,\n\n00:01:05.614 --> 00:01:08.234\n\"You've got to do this thing\nyou've been talking about,\n\n00:01:08.258 --> 00:01:09.753\nand build the vending machine.\"\n\n00:01:09.777 --> 00:01:10.928\nSo I did.\n\n00:01:10.952 --> 00:01:13.397\nBut part of the reason\nI found this interesting is,\n\n00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:16.253\nI started noticing that we're very\naware of all the species\n\n00:01:16.277 --> 00:01:18.072\nthat are going extinct on the planet\n\n00:01:18.096 --> 00:01:20.165\nas a result of human habitation expansion,\n\n00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.134\nand no one seems to be paying\nattention to all the species\n\n00:01:23.158 --> 00:01:25.226\nthat are actually living;\nthey're surviving.\n\n00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.975\nAnd I'm talking specifically\nabout synanthropic species,\n\n00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:30.677\nwhich have adapted\nspecifically for human ecologies,\n\n00:01:30.701 --> 00:01:34.064\nspecies like rats\nand cockroaches and crows.\n\n00:01:34.088 --> 00:01:37.702\nAnd as I started looking at them,\nI was finding that they had hyper-adapted.\n\n00:01:37.726 --> 00:01:40.118\nThey'd become extremely\nadept at living with us.\n\n00:01:40.142 --> 00:01:42.815\nAnd in return, we just tried\nto kill them all the time.\n\n00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:43.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.531\nAnd in doing so, we were\nbreeding them for parasitism.\n\n00:01:46.555 --> 00:01:50.516\nWe were giving them all sorts\nof reasons to adapt new ways.\n\n00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.298\nSo, for example, rats\nare incredibly responsive breeders.\n\n00:01:53.322 --> 00:01:56.341\nAnd cockroaches, as anyone who's tried\nto get rid of them knows,\n\n00:01:56.365 --> 00:01:59.367\nhave become really immune\nto the poisons that we're using.\n\n00:01:59.391 --> 00:02:03.025\nSo I thought, let's build something\nthat's mutually beneficial;\n\n00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.029\nsomething that we can both benefit from,\n\n00:02:05.053 --> 00:02:08.072\nand find some way to make\na new relationship with these species.\n\n00:02:08.096 --> 00:02:09.738\nSo I built the vending machine.\n\n00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:12.832\nBut the story of the vending machine\nis a little more interesting\n\n00:02:12.856 --> 00:02:14.243\nif you know more about crows.\n\n00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:17.109\nIt turns out, crows aren't just\nsurviving with human beings;\n\n00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:18.374\nthey're actually thriving.\n\n00:02:18.398 --> 00:02:21.235\nThey're found everywhere\non the planet except for the Arctic\n\n00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:23.071\nand the southern tip of South America.\n\n00:02:23.095 --> 00:02:25.786\nAnd in all that area,\nthey're only rarely found breeding\n\n00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.129\nmore than five kilometers\naway from human beings.\n\n00:02:28.153 --> 00:02:30.903\nSo we may not think about them,\nbut they're always around.\n\n00:02:30.927 --> 00:02:33.571\nAnd not surprisingly,\ngiven the human population growth,\n\n00:02:33.595 --> 00:02:36.571\nmore than half of the human population\nis living in cities now.\n\n00:02:36.595 --> 00:02:39.410\nAnd out of those, nine-tenths\nof the human growth population\n\n00:02:39.434 --> 00:02:40.592\nis occurring in cities.\n\n00:02:40.616 --> 00:02:42.789\nWe're seeing a population boom with crows.\n\n00:02:42.813 --> 00:02:44.858\nSo bird counts are indicating\n\n00:02:44.882 --> 00:02:48.030\nthat we might be seeing up to exponential\ngrowth in their numbers.\n\n00:02:48.054 --> 00:02:49.701\nSo that's no great surprise.\n\n00:02:49.725 --> 00:02:52.218\nBut what was really interesting\nto me was to find out\n\n00:02:52.242 --> 00:02:55.065\nthat the birds were adapting\nin a pretty unusual way.\n\n00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.226\nAnd I'll give you an example of that.\n\n00:02:58.798 --> 00:03:01.068\nThis is Betty.\nShe's a New Caledonian crow.\n\n00:03:01.092 --> 00:03:03.498\nAnd these crows use sticks in the wild\n\n00:03:03.522 --> 00:03:06.156\nto get insects and whatnot\nout of pieces of wood.\n\n00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.846\nHere, she's trying to get\na piece of meat out of a tube.\n\n00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.513\nBut the researchers had a problem.\n\n00:03:10.537 --> 00:03:13.085\nThey messed up and left\njust a stick of wire in there.\n\n00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.632\nAnd she hadn't had the opportunity\nto do this before.\n\n00:03:15.656 --> 00:03:17.546\nYou see, it wasn't working very well.\n\n00:03:18.148 --> 00:03:19.601\nSo she adapted.\n\n00:03:20.745 --> 00:03:24.148\nNow, this is completely unprompted;\nshe had never seen this done before.\n\n00:03:24.172 --> 00:03:26.184\nNo one taught her to bend this into a hook\n\n00:03:26.208 --> 00:03:27.989\nor had shown her how it could happen.\n\n00:03:28.013 --> 00:03:29.466\nBut she did it all on her own.\n\n00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.951\nSo keep in mind --\nshe's never seen this done.\n\n00:03:31.975 --> 00:03:33.566\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.773\nRight.\n\n00:03:34.797 --> 00:03:41.325\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:41.456 --> 00:03:42.880\nYeah. All right.\n\n00:03:42.904 --> 00:03:47.549\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:47.573 --> 00:03:50.054\nSo that's the part where\nthe researchers freak out.\n\n00:03:50.078 --> 00:03:51.847\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:51.871 --> 00:03:53.038\nIt turns out,\n\n00:03:53.062 --> 00:03:56.302\nwe've been finding more and more\nthat crows are really intelligent.\n\n00:03:56.326 --> 00:03:59.908\nTheir brains are in the same proportion\nas chimpanzee brains are.\n\n00:04:00.582 --> 00:04:02.024\nThere's all kinds of anecdotes\n\n00:04:02.048 --> 00:04:04.410\nfor the different kinds\nof intelligence they have.\n\n00:04:04.434 --> 00:04:06.934\nFor example, in Sweden,\ncrows will wait for fishermen\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.851\nto drop lines through holes in the ice.\n\n00:04:08.875 --> 00:04:10.415\nAnd when the fishermen move off,\n\n00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.680\nthe crows fly down, reel up the lines,\nand eat the fish or the bait.\n\n00:04:13.704 --> 00:04:15.642\nIt's pretty annoying for the fishermen.\n\n00:04:15.666 --> 00:04:17.105\nOn an entirely different tack,\n\n00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:19.719\nat University of Washington\na few years ago,\n\n00:04:19.743 --> 00:04:23.103\nthey were doing an experiment where\nthey captured some crows on campus.\n\n00:04:23.127 --> 00:04:25.945\nSome students went out,\nnetted some crows, brought them in,\n\n00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:28.553\nweighed and measured them,\nand let them back out again.\n\n00:04:28.577 --> 00:04:31.789\nAnd they were entertained to discover\nthat for the rest of the week,\n\n00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:34.445\nwhenever these particular students\nwalked around campus,\n\n00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:36.580\nthese crows would caw at them\nand run around,\n\n00:04:36.604 --> 00:04:38.416\nand make their life kind of miserable.\n\n00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.442\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:39.466 --> 00:04:41.411\nThey were significantly less entertained\n\n00:04:41.435 --> 00:04:43.164\nwhen this went on for the next week.\n\n00:04:43.188 --> 00:04:44.461\nAnd the next month.\n\n00:04:44.485 --> 00:04:46.213\nAnd after summer break.\n\n00:04:46.237 --> 00:04:48.536\nUntil they finally graduated\nand left campus,\n\n00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.300\nand -- glad to get away, I'm sure --\n\n00:04:50.324 --> 00:04:53.563\ncame back sometime later, and found\nthe crows still remembered them.\n\n00:04:53.587 --> 00:04:54.593\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:54.617 --> 00:04:56.692\nSo, the moral being: don't piss off crows.\n\n00:04:56.716 --> 00:04:59.935\nSo now, students\nat the University of Washington\n\n00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:03.331\nthat are studying these crows,\ndo so with a giant wig and a big mask.\n\n00:05:03.355 --> 00:05:05.570\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:05.594 --> 00:05:06.904\nIt's fairly interesting.\n\n00:05:06.928 --> 00:05:08.499\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:08.523 --> 00:05:10.447\nSo we know these crows are really smart,\n\n00:05:10.471 --> 00:05:12.651\nbut the more I dug into this,\nthe more I found\n\n00:05:12.675 --> 00:05:15.840\nthat they actually have\nan even more significant adaptation.\n\n00:05:16.904 --> 00:05:20.318\nVideo: Crows have become\nhighly skilled at making a living\n\n00:05:20.342 --> 00:05:22.689\nin these new urban environments.\n\n00:05:22.713 --> 00:05:26.624\nIn this Japanese city, they have devised\na way of eating a food\n\n00:05:26.648 --> 00:05:28.935\nthat normally they can't manage:\n\n00:05:31.251 --> 00:05:33.061\ndrop it among the traffic.\n\n00:05:37.261 --> 00:05:42.402\nThe problem now is collecting the bits,\nwithout getting run over.\n\n00:05:42.426 --> 00:05:44.727\nWait for the light to stop the traffic.\n\n00:05:56.567 --> 00:06:00.033\nThen, collect your cracked nut in safety.\n\n00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.037\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:06.061 --> 00:06:08.054\nJoshua Klein: Yeah, pretty interesting.\n\n00:06:08.078 --> 00:06:11.015\nWhat's significant about this\nisn't that crows are using cars\n\n00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:12.190\nto crack nuts.\n\n00:06:12.214 --> 00:06:13.855\nIn fact, that's old hat for crows.\n\n00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:15.414\nThis happened about 10 years ago\n\n00:06:15.438 --> 00:06:17.965\nin a place called Sendai City,\nat a driving school\n\n00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:19.150\nin the suburbs of Tokyo.\n\n00:06:19.695 --> 00:06:20.850\nAnd since that time,\n\n00:06:20.874 --> 00:06:23.936\nall the crows in the neighborhood\nare picking up this behavior.\n\n00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.987\nNow every crow within five kilometers\nis standing by a sidewalk,\n\n00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:28.424\nwaiting to collect its lunch.\n\n00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:32.019\nSo they're learning from each other.\nAnd research bears this out.\n\n00:06:32.043 --> 00:06:34.557\nParents seem to be teaching their young.\n\n00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:37.431\nThey learn from their peers,\nthey learn from their enemies.\n\n00:06:37.455 --> 00:06:38.910\nIf I have a little extra time,\n\n00:06:38.934 --> 00:06:41.081\nI'll tell you about a case\nof crow infidelity\n\n00:06:41.105 --> 00:06:42.543\nthat illustrates that nicely.\n\n00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.638\nThe point being, they've developed\ncultural adaptation.\n\n00:06:45.662 --> 00:06:46.907\nAnd as we heard yesterday,\n\n00:06:46.931 --> 00:06:49.973\nthat's the Pandora's box\nthat's getting human beings in trouble,\n\n00:06:49.997 --> 00:06:51.870\nand we're starting to see it with them.\n\n00:06:51.894 --> 00:06:54.430\nThey're able to very quickly\nand very flexibly adapt\n\n00:06:54.454 --> 00:06:57.182\nto new challenges and new resources\nin their environment,\n\n00:06:57.206 --> 00:06:59.451\nwhich is really useful\nif you live in a city.\n\n00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:02.721\nSo we know that there's lots of crows.\n\n00:07:02.745 --> 00:07:05.806\nWe found out they're really smart\nand they can teach each other.\n\n00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.131\nWhen all this became clear,\n\n00:07:07.155 --> 00:07:10.318\nI realized the only obvious thing to do\nis build a vending machine.\n\n00:07:10.342 --> 00:07:11.495\nSo that's what we did.\n\n00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:13.256\nThis is a vending machine for crows.\n\n00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.947\nAnd it uses Skinnerian training\nto shape their behavior over four stages.\n\n00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:18.328\nIt's pretty simple.\n\n00:07:18.352 --> 00:07:21.356\nBasically, what happens\nis that we put this out in a field\n\n00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.350\nor someplace where there's lots of crows.\n\n00:07:23.374 --> 00:07:26.211\nWe put coins and peanuts\nall around the base of the machine.\n\n00:07:26.235 --> 00:07:28.276\nCrows eventually come by, eat the peanuts,\n\n00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.234\nand get used to the machine being there.\n\n00:07:30.258 --> 00:07:32.039\nEventually, they eat all the peanuts.\n\n00:07:32.063 --> 00:07:34.382\nThen they see peanuts\nhere on the feeder tray,\n\n00:07:34.406 --> 00:07:36.128\nand hop up and help themselves.\n\n00:07:36.152 --> 00:07:39.025\nThen they leave, the machine\nspits up more coins and peanuts,\n\n00:07:39.049 --> 00:07:40.819\nand life is dandy if you're a crow --\n\n00:07:40.843 --> 00:07:43.289\nyou can come back anytime\nand get yourself a peanut.\n\n00:07:43.313 --> 00:07:46.798\nSo when they get really used to that,\nwe move on to the crows coming back.\n\n00:07:46.822 --> 00:07:48.925\nNow they're used to the sound\nof the machine;\n\n00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:51.061\nthey keep coming back\nand digging out peanuts\n\n00:07:51.085 --> 00:07:52.808\nfrom the pile of coins that's there.\n\n00:07:52.832 --> 00:07:55.368\nWhen they get really happy\nabout this, we stymie them.\n\n00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:58.186\nWe move to the third stage,\nwhere we only give them a coin.\n\n00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.948\nNow, like most of us who have gotten\nused to a good thing,\n\n00:08:00.972 --> 00:08:02.311\nthis really pisses them off.\n\n00:08:02.335 --> 00:08:05.615\nSo they do what they do in nature\nwhen they're looking for something:\n\n00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:07.712\nsweep things out of the way\nwith their beak.\n\n00:08:07.736 --> 00:08:10.578\nThey do that here, and that knocks\nthe coins down the slot.\n\n00:08:10.602 --> 00:08:12.388\nWhen that happens, they get a peanut.\n\n00:08:12.412 --> 00:08:13.707\nThis goes on for some time.\n\n00:08:13.731 --> 00:08:16.167\nThe crows learn that\nall they have to do is show up,\n\n00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:18.541\nwait for the coin to come out,\nput it in the slot,\n\n00:08:18.565 --> 00:08:19.716\nthen get their peanut.\n\n00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.819\nWhen they're good\nand comfortable with that,\n\n00:08:21.843 --> 00:08:25.014\nwe move to the final stage,\nwhere they show up and nothing happens.\n\n00:08:25.038 --> 00:08:28.245\nThis is where we see the difference\nbetween crows and other animals.\n\n00:08:28.269 --> 00:08:31.981\nSquirrels, for example, would show up,\nlook for the peanut, go away.\n\n00:08:32.005 --> 00:08:34.559\nCome back, look for the peanut, go away.\n\n00:08:34.583 --> 00:08:37.421\nThey do this maybe half a dozen times\nbefore they get bored,\n\n00:08:37.445 --> 00:08:39.422\nand then they go off and play in traffic.\n\n00:08:39.446 --> 00:08:43.094\nCrows, on the other hand,\nshow up and they try and figure it out.\n\n00:08:43.118 --> 00:08:45.423\nThey know this machine\nhas been messing with them\n\n00:08:45.447 --> 00:08:47.469\nthrough three different\nstages of behavior.\n\n00:08:47.493 --> 00:08:48.495\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:50.298\nThey figure there must be more to it.\n\n00:08:50.322 --> 00:08:52.131\nSo they poke at it and peck at it.\n\n00:08:52.155 --> 00:08:54.309\nAnd eventually some crow\ngets a bright idea:\n\n00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:58.254\n\"Hey, there's lots of coins\nlying around from the first stage,\n\n00:08:58.278 --> 00:09:02.443\nhops down, picks it up, drops it\nin the slot, and we're off to the races.\n\n00:09:02.467 --> 00:09:04.887\nThat crow enjoys a temporary\nmonopoly on peanuts,\n\n00:09:04.911 --> 00:09:08.554\nuntil his friends figure out\nhow to do it, and then there we go.\n\n00:09:08.578 --> 00:09:10.934\nSo, what's significant about this to me\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.292\nisn't that we can train crows\nto pick up peanuts.\n\n00:09:13.316 --> 00:09:17.146\nMind you, there's 216 million\ndollars' worth of change lost every year,\n\n00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.825\nbut I'm not sure I can depend\non that ROI from crows.\n\n00:09:19.849 --> 00:09:20.896\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.104\nInstead, I think we should look\na little bit larger.\n\n00:09:24.128 --> 00:09:26.394\nI think crows can be trained\nto do other things.\n\n00:09:26.418 --> 00:09:29.894\nFor example, why not train them\nto pick up garbage after stadium events?\n\n00:09:29.918 --> 00:09:32.822\nOr find expensive components\nfrom discarded electronics?\n\n00:09:32.846 --> 00:09:34.731\nOr maybe do search and rescue?\n\n00:09:35.307 --> 00:09:37.934\nThe main point of all this for me is,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.687\nwe can find mutually beneficial\nsystems for these species.\n\n00:09:40.711 --> 00:09:43.215\nWe can find ways to interact\nwith these other species\n\n00:09:43.239 --> 00:09:45.173\nthat doesn't involve exterminating them,\n\n00:09:45.197 --> 00:09:48.499\nbut involves finding an equilibrium\nwith them that's a useful balance.\n\n00:09:48.523 --> 00:09:49.778\nThanks very much.\n\n00:09:49.802 --> 00:09:55.402\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How the news distorts our worldview", "duration": "269", "url":

Here's the world based on the way it looks \u2014 based on landmass. And here's how news shapes what Americans see. This map \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 this map shows the number of seconds that American network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories, by country, in February of 2007 \u2014 just one year ago. Now, this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities. There was massive flooding in Indonesia. And in Paris, the IPCC released its study confirming man's impact on global warming. The U.S. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage. And when we take out the U.S. and look at the remaining 21 percent, we see a lot of Iraq \u2014 that's that big green thing there \u2014 and little else. The combined coverage of Russia, China and India, for example, reached just one percent.When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story, here's how the world looked. What was that story? The death of Anna Nicole Smith. This story eclipsed every country except Iraq, and received 10 times the coverage of the IPCC report. And the cycle continues; as we all know, Britney has loomed pretty large lately.So, why don't we hear more about the world? One reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half. Aside from one-person ABC mini-bureaus in Nairobi, New Delhi and Mumbai, there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa, India or South America \u2014 places that are home to more than two billion people.The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper. And this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing when we see where people go for news. Local TV news looms large, and unfortunately only dedicates 12 percent of its coverage to international news.And what about the web? The most popular news sites don't do much better. Last year, Pew and the Colombia J-School analyzed the 14,000 stories that appeared on Google News' front page. And they, in fact, covered the same 24 news events. Similarly, a study in e-content showed that much of global news from U.S. news creators is recycled stories from the AP wire services and Reuters, and don't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it.So, if you put it all together, this could help explain why today's college graduates, as well as less educated Americans, know less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years ago. And if you think it's simply because we are not interested, you would be wrong. In recent years, Americans who say they closely follow global news most of the time grew to over 50 percent.The real question: is this distorted worldview what we want for Americans in our increasingly interconnected world? I know we can do better. And can we afford not to?

I write about cooking. I take it quite seriously, but I'm here to talk about something that's become very important to me in the last year or two. It is about food, but it's not about cooking, per se. I'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow. I'm not a vegetarian \u2014 this is the old Nixon line, right? But I still think that this \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 may be this year's version of this.Now, that is only a little bit hyperbolic. And why do I say it? Because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined. There was the bomb, and there's now. And where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives, but whether, if we could see the Earth a century from now, we'd recognize it. It's a holocaust of a different kind, and hiding under our desks isn't going to help. Start with the notion that global warming is not only real, but dangerous. Since every scientist in the world now believes this, and even President Bush has seen the light, or pretends to, we can take this is a given.Then hear this, please. After energy production, livestock is the second-highest contributor to atmosphere-altering gases. Nearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas is generated by livestock production \u2014 more than transportation. Now, you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts, but methane is 20 times more poisonous than CO2, and it's not just methane. Livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation, air and water pollution, water shortages and loss of biodiversity. There's more. Like half the antibiotics in this country are not administered to people, but to animals. But lists like this become kind of numbing, so let me just say this: if you're a progressive, if you're driving a Prius, or you're shopping green, or you're looking for organic, you should probably be a semi-vegetarian. Now, I'm no more anti-cattle than I am anti-atom, but it's all in the way we use these things. There's another piece of the puzzle, which Ann Cooper talked about beautifully yesterday, and one you already know.There's no question, none, that so-called lifestyle diseases \u2014 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, some cancers \u2014 are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world. And that's the direct result of eating a Western diet. Our demand for meat, dairy and refined carbohydrates \u2014 the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day \u2014 our demand for these things, not our need, our want, drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us. And those calories are in foods that cause, not prevent, disease. Now global warming was unforeseen. We didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility. Maybe a few lung diseases here and there, but, you know, that's not such a big deal. The current health crisis, however, is a little more the work of the evil empire. We were told, we were assured, that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate, the healthier we'd be.No. Overconsumption of animals, and of course, junk food, is the problem, along with our paltry consumption of plants. Now, there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here, but the evidence is that plants \u2014 and I want to make this clear \u2014 it's not the ingredients in plants, it's the plants. It's not the beta-carotene, it's the carrot. The evidence is very clear that plants promote health. This evidence is overwhelming at this point. You eat more plants, you eat less other stuff, you live longer. Not bad. But back to animals and junk food. What do they have in common? One: we don't need either of them for health. We don't need animal products, and we certainly don't need white bread or Coke. Two: both have been marketed heavily, creating unnatural demand. We're not born craving Whoppers or Skittles. Three: their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more health- and Earth-friendly diet.Now, let's imagine a parallel. Let's pretend that our government supported an oil-based economy, while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy, knowing all the while that the result would be pollution, war and rising costs. Incredible, isn't it? Yet they do that. And they do this here. It's the same deal. The sad thing is, when it comes to diet, is that even when well-intentioned Feds try to do right by us, they fail. Either they're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness, or they are puppets of agribusiness. So, when the USDA finally acknowledged that it was plants, rather than animals, that made people healthy, they encouraged us, via their overly simplistic food pyramid, to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, along with more carbs. What they didn't tell us is that some carbs are better than others, and that plants and whole grains should be supplanting eating junk food. But industry lobbyists would never let that happen. And guess what? Half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to agribusiness. So, instead of substituting plants for animals, our swollen appetites simply became larger, and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged. So-called low-fat diets, so-called low-carb diets \u2014 these are not solutions.But with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local, or whether we're being nice to animals, the most important issues just aren't being addressed. Now, don't get me wrong. I like animals, and I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production and to churn them out like they were wrenches. But there's no way to treat animals well, when you're killing 10 billion of them a year. That's our number. 10 billion. If you strung all of them \u2014 chickens, cows, pigs and lambs \u2014 to the moon, they'd go there and back five times, there and back. Now, my math's a little shaky, but this is pretty good, and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long, but you get the idea. That's just the United States. And with our hyper-consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease, kindness might just be a bit of a red herring. Let's get the numbers of the animals we're killing for eating down, and then we'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left.Another red herring might be exemplified by the word \"locavore,\" which was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary. Seriously. And locavore, for those of you who don't know, is someone who eats only locally grown food \u2014 which is fine if you live in California, but for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke. Between the official story \u2014 the food pyramid \u2014 and the hip locavore vision, you have two versions of how to improve our eating. (Laughter).They both get it wrong, though. The first at least is populist, and the second is elitist. How we got to this place is the history of food in the United States. And I'm going to go through that, at least the last hundred years or so, very quickly right now. A hundred years ago, guess what? Everyone was a locavore: even New York had pig farms nearby, and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion. Every family had a cook, usually a mom. And those moms bought and prepared food. It was like your romantic vision of Europe. Margarine didn't exist. In fact, when margarine was invented, several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink, so we'd all know that it was a fake. There was no snack food, and until the '20s, until Clarence Birdseye came along, there was no frozen food. There were no restaurant chains. There were neighborhood restaurants run by local people, but none of them would think to open another one. Eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic. And fancy food was entirely French. As an aside, those of you who remember Dan Aykroyd in the 1970s doing Julia Child imitations can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide. (Laughter)Back in those days, before even Julia, back in those days, there was no philosophy of food. You just ate. You didn't claim to be anything. There was no marketing. There were no national brands. Vitamins had not been invented. There were no health claims, at least not federally sanctioned ones. Fats, carbs, proteins \u2014 they weren't bad or good, they were food. You ate food. Hardly anything contained more than one ingredient, because it was an ingredient. The cornflake hadn't been invented. (Laughter) The Pop-Tart, the Pringle, Cheez Whiz, none of that stuff. Goldfish swam. (Laughter) It's hard to imagine. People grew food, and they ate food. And again, everyone ate local. In New York, an orange was a common Christmas present, because it came all the way from Florida. From the '30s on, road systems expanded, trucks took the place of railroads, fresh food began to travel more. Oranges became common in New York. The South and West became agricultural hubs, and in other parts of the country, suburbs took over farmland. The effects of this are well known. They are everywhere. And the death of family farms is part of this puzzle, as is almost everything from the demise of the real community to the challenge of finding a good tomato, even in summer. Eventually, California produced too much food to ship fresh, so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods. Thus arrived convenience. It was sold to proto-feminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework.Now, I know everybody over the age of, like 45 \u2014 their mouths are watering at this point. (Laughter) (Applause) If we had a slide of Salisbury steak, even more so, right? (Laughter) But this may have cut down on housework, but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well. Many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad. I, for one \u2014 and I'm not kidding \u2014 didn't eat real spinach or broccoli till I was 19. Who needed it though? Meat was everywhere. What could be easier, more filling or healthier for your family than broiling a steak? But by then cattle were already raised unnaturally. Rather than spending their lives eating grass, for which their stomachs were designed, they were forced to eat soy and corn. They have trouble digesting those grains, of course, but that wasn't a problem for producers. New drugs kept them healthy. Well, they kept them alive. Healthy was another story.Thanks to farm subsidies, the fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress, soy, corn and cattle became king. And chicken soon joined them on the throne. It was during this period that the cycle of dietary and planetary destruction began, the thing we're only realizing just now. Listen to this, between 1950 and 2000, the world's population doubled. Meat consumption increased five-fold. Now, someone had to eat all that stuff, so we got fast food. And this took care of the situation resoundingly. Home cooking remained the norm, but its quality was down the tubes. There were fewer meals with home-cooked breads, desserts and soups, because all of them could be bought at any store. Not that they were any good, but they were there. Most moms cooked like mine: a piece of broiled meat, a quickly made salad with bottled dressing, canned soup, canned fruit salad. Maybe baked or mashed potatoes, or perhaps the stupidest food ever, Minute Rice. For dessert, store-bought ice cream or cookies. My mom is not here, so I can say this now. This kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself. (Laughter)It wasn't all bad. By the '70s, forward-thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients. We tended gardens, we became interested in organic food, we knew or we were vegetarians. We weren't all hippies, either. Some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well. Meanwhile, food production had become industrial. Industrial. Perhaps because it was being produced rationally, as if it were plastic, food gained magical or poisonous powers, or both. Many people became fat-phobic. Others worshiped broccoli, as if it were God-like. But mostly they didn't eat broccoli. Instead they were sold on yogurt, yogurt being almost as good as broccoli. Except, in reality, the way the industry sold yogurt was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream. Similarly, let's look at a granola bar. You think that that might be healthy food, but in fact, if you look at the ingredient list, it's closer in form to a Snickers than it is to oatmeal. Sadly, it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma, if not actually killed \u2014 the beginning of the heyday of value-added food, which contained as many soy and corn products as could be crammed into it.Think of the frozen chicken nugget. The chicken is fed corn, and then its meat is ground up, and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder, and then it's fried in corn oil. All you do is nuke it. What could be better? And zapped horribly, pathetically. By the '70s, home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like McNuggets and Hot Pockets \u2014 and we all have our favorites, actually \u2014 made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home. At the same time, masses of women were entering the workforce, and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden. So now, you've got your pizza nights, you've got your microwave nights, you've got your grazing nights, you've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on.Leading the way \u2014 what's leading the way? Meat, junk food, cheese: the very stuff that will kill you. So, now we clamor for organic food. That's good. And as evidence that things can actually change, you can now find organic food in supermarkets, and even in fast-food outlets. But organic food isn't the answer either, at least not the way it's currently defined. Let me pose you a question. Can farm-raised salmon be organic, when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet, even if the feed itself is supposedly organic, and the fish themselves are packed tightly in pens, swimming in their own filth? And if that salmon's from Chile, and it's killed down there and then flown 5,000 miles, whatever, dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere? I don't know. Packed in Styrofoam, of course, before landing somewhere in the United States, and then being trucked a few hundred more miles. This may be organic in letter, but it's surely not organic in spirit. Now here is where we all meet. The locavores, the organivores, the vegetarians, the vegans, the gourmets and those of us who are just plain interested in good food. Even though we've come to this from different points, we all have to act on our knowledge to change the way that everyone thinks about food.We need to start acting. And this is not only an issue of social justice, as Ann Cooper said \u2014 and, of course, she's completely right \u2014 but it's also one of global survival. Which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue, the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food. As I said, 18 percent of greenhouse gases are attributed to livestock production. How much livestock do you need to produce this? 70 percent of the agricultural land on Earth, 30 percent of the Earth's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals we'll eat. And this amount is predicted to double in the next 40 years or so.And if the numbers coming in from China are anything like what they look like now, it's not going to be 40 years. There is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do. And I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life. The most common argument is that we need nutrients \u2014 even though we eat, on average, twice as much protein as even the industry-obsessed USDA recommends. But listen: experts who are serious about disease reduction recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week.What do you think we eat per day? Half a pound. But don't we need meat to be big and strong? Isn't meat eating essential to health? Won't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables turn us into godless, sissy, liberals? (Laughter) Some of us might think that would be a good thing. But, no, even if we were all steroid-filled football players, the answer is no. In fact, there's no diet on Earth that meets basic nutritional needs that won't promote growth, and many will make you much healthier than ours does. We don't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition, we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition, and it's killing us. To suggest that in the interests of personal and human health Americans eat 50 percent less meat \u2014 it's not enough of a cut, but it's a start.It would seem absurd, but that's exactly what should happen, and what progressive people, forward-thinking people should be doing and advocating, along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants. I've been writing about food more or less omnivorously \u2014 one might say indiscriminately \u2014 for about 30 years. During that time, I've eaten and recommended eating just about everything. I'll never stop eating animals, I'm sure, but I do think that for the benefit of everyone, the time has come to stop raising them industrially and stop eating them thoughtlessly.Ann Cooper's right. The USDA is not our ally here. We have to take matters into our own hands, not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone \u2014 and that's the hard part \u2014 but by improving our own. And that happens to be quite easy. Less meat, less junk, more plants. It's a simple formula: eat food. Eat real food. We can continue to enjoy our food, and we continue to eat well, and we can eat even better. We can continue the search for the ingredients we love, and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals. We'll reduce not only calories, but our carbon footprint. We can make food more important, not less, and save ourselves by doing so. We have to choose that path.

become very important to me in the last year or two.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nIt is about food, but it's not about cooking, per se.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nI'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nI'm not a vegetarian -- this is the old Nixon line, right?\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nBut I still think that this --\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:35.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\n-- may be this year's version of this.\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nNow, that is only a little bit hyperbolic.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nAnd why do I say it?\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nBecause only once before has the fate of individual people\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nand the fate of all of humanity\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nbeen so intertwined.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nThere was the bomb, and there's now.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nAnd where we go from here is going to determine\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nnot only the quality and the length of our individual lives,\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nbut whether, if we could see the Earth a century from now,\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nwe'd recognize it.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nIt's a holocaust of a different kind,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nand hiding under our desks isn't going to help.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nStart with the notion that global warming\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nis not only real, but dangerous.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nSince every scientist in the world now believes this,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nand even President Bush has seen the light, or pretends to,\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nwe can take this is a given.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nThen hear this, please.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nAfter energy production, livestock is the second-highest contributor\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nto atmosphere-altering gases.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nNearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nis generated by livestock production --\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nmore than transportation.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nNow, you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts,\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nbut methane is 20 times more poisonous than CO2,\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nand it's not just methane.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nLivestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nair and water pollution, water shortages and loss of biodiversity.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nThere's more.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nLike half the antibiotics in this country\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nare not administered to people, but to animals.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nBut lists like this become kind of numbing, so let me just say this:\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nif you're a progressive,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nif you're driving a Prius, or you're shopping green,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nor you're looking for organic,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nyou should probably be a semi-vegetarian.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nNow, I'm no more anti-cattle than I am anti-atom,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nbut it's all in the way we use these things.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nThere's another piece of the puzzle,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nwhich Ann Cooper talked about beautifully yesterday,\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nand one you already know.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nThere's no question, none, that so-called lifestyle diseases --\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:39.958\ndiabetes, heart disease, stroke, some cancers --\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nare diseases that are far more prevalent here\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nthan anywhere in the rest of the world.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nAnd that's the direct result of eating a Western diet.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nOur demand for meat, dairy and refined carbohydrates --\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nthe world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day --\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nour demand for these things, not our need, our want,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:05.958\ndrives us to consume way more calories than are good for us.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nAnd those calories are in foods that cause, not prevent, disease.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nNow global warming was unforeseen.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nWe didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nMaybe a few lung diseases here and there,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nbut, you know, that's not such a big deal.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nThe current health crisis, however,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nis a little more the work of the evil empire.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nWe were told, we were assured,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nthat the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nthe healthier we'd be.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nNo. Overconsumption of animals, and of course, junk food,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nis the problem, along with our paltry consumption of plants.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nNow, there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nbut the evidence is that plants -- and I want to make this clear --\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nit's not the ingredients in plants, it's the plants.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nIt's not the beta-carotene, it's the carrot.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nThis evidence is overwhelming at this point.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nYou eat more plants, you eat less other stuff, you live longer.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nNot bad.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nBut back to animals and junk food.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nWhat do they have in common?\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nOne: we don't need either of them for health.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nWe don't need animal products,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nand we certainly don't need white bread or Coke.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nTwo: both have been marketed heavily,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\ncreating unnatural demand.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nWe're not born craving Whoppers or Skittles.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nThree: their production has been supported by government agencies\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nat the expense of a more health- and Earth-friendly diet.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nNow, let's imagine a parallel.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nLet's pretend that our government supported an oil-based economy,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nwhile discouraging more sustainable forms of energy,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nknowing all the while that the result would be\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\npollution, war and rising costs.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nIncredible, isn't it?\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nYet they do that.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nAnd they do this here. It's the same deal.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nThe sad thing is, when it comes to diet,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nis that even when well-intentioned Feds\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:01.958\ntry to do right by us, they fail.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nEither they're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nor they are puppets of agribusiness.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nSo, when the USDA finally acknowledged\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nthat it was plants, rather than animals, that made people healthy,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nthey encouraged us, via their overly simplistic food pyramid,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nto eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day,\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nalong with more carbs.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nWhat they didn't tell us is that some carbs are better than others,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nand that plants and whole grains\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nshould be supplanting eating junk food.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nBut industry lobbyists would never let that happen.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nAnd guess what?\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nHalf the people who developed the food pyramid\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nhave ties to agribusiness.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nSo, instead of substituting plants for animals,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nour swollen appetites simply became larger,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nand the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nSo-called low-fat diets, so-called low-carb diets --\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nthese are not solutions.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nBut with lots of intelligent people\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nfocusing on whether food is organic or local,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nor whether we're being nice to animals,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nthe most important issues just aren't being addressed.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nNow, don't get me wrong.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nI like animals,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nand I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nand to churn them out like they were wrenches.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nBut there's no way to treat animals well,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nwhen you're killing 10 billion of them a year.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nThat's our number. 10 billion.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nIf you strung all of them --\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nchickens, cows, pigs and lambs -- to the moon,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nthey'd go there and back five times, there and back.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nNow, my math's a little shaky, but this is pretty good,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nand it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nbut you get the idea.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nThat's just the United States.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nAnd with our hyper-consumption of those animals\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nproducing greenhouse gases and heart disease,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nkindness might just be a bit of a red herring.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nLet's get the numbers of the animals we're killing for eating down,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nand then we'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nAnother red herring might be exemplified by the word \"locavore,\"\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nwhich was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nSeriously.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nAnd locavore, for those of you who don't know,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nis someone who eats only locally grown food --\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nwhich is fine if you live in California,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nbut for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nBetween the official story -- the food pyramid --\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nand the hip locavore vision,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nyou have two versions of how to improve our eating.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\n(Laughter).\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nThey both get it wrong, though.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nThe first at least is populist, and the second is elitist.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nHow we got to this place is the history of food in the United States.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nAnd I'm going to go through that,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nat least the last hundred years or so, very quickly right now.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nA hundred years ago, guess what?\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nEveryone was a locavore: even New York had pig farms nearby,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nand shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nEvery family had a cook, usually a mom.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nAnd those moms bought and prepared food.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nIt was like your romantic vision of Europe.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nMargarine didn't exist.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nIn fact, when margarine was invented,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nseveral states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nso we'd all know that it was a fake.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nThere was no snack food, and until the '20s,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nuntil Clarence Birdseye came along, there was no frozen food.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nThere were no restaurant chains.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nThere were neighborhood restaurants run by local people,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nbut none of them would think to open another one.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nEating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nAnd fancy food was entirely French.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nAs an aside, those of you who remember\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nDan Aykroyd in the 1970s doing Julia Child imitations\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:42.958\ncan see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nBack in those days, before even Julia,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nback in those days, there was no philosophy of food.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nYou just ate.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nYou didn't claim to be anything.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nThere was no marketing. There were no national brands.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nVitamins had not been invented.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nThere were no health claims, at least not federally sanctioned ones.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nFats, carbs, proteins -- they weren't bad or good, they were food.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nYou ate food.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nHardly anything contained more than one ingredient,\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nbecause it was an ingredient.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nThe cornflake hadn't been invented.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:16.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nThe Pop-Tart, the Pringle, Cheez Whiz, none of that stuff.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nGoldfish swam.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nIt's hard to imagine. People grew food, and they ate food.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nAnd again, everyone ate local.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nIn New York, an orange was a common Christmas present,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nbecause it came all the way from Florida.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nFrom the '30s on, road systems expanded,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\ntrucks took the place of railroads,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nfresh food began to travel more.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nOranges became common in New York.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nThe South and West became agricultural hubs,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nand in other parts of the country, suburbs took over farmland.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nThe effects of this are well known. They are everywhere.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nAnd the death of family farms is part of this puzzle,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nas is almost everything\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nfrom the demise of the real community\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nto the challenge of finding a good tomato, even in summer.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nEventually, California produced too much food to ship fresh,\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nso it became critical to market canned and frozen foods.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nThus arrived convenience.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nIt was sold to proto-feminist housewives\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nas a way to cut down on housework.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nNow, I know everybody over the age of, like 45 --\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\ntheir mouths are watering at this point.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:24.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nIf we had a slide of Salisbury steak, even more so, right?\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:29.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nBut this may have cut down on housework,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nbut it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nMany of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nexcept the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nI, for one -- and I'm not kidding --\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:49.958\ndidn't eat real spinach or broccoli till I was 19.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nWho needed it though? Meat was everywhere.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nWhat could be easier, more filling or healthier for your family\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nthan broiling a steak?\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nBut by then cattle were already raised unnaturally.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nRather than spending their lives eating grass,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nfor which their stomachs were designed,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nthey were forced to eat soy and corn.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nThey have trouble digesting those grains, of course,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nbut that wasn't a problem for producers.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nNew drugs kept them healthy.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nWell, they kept them alive.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nHealthy was another story.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nThanks to farm subsidies,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nthe fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nsoy, corn and cattle became king.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nAnd chicken soon joined them on the throne.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nIt was during this period that the cycle of\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\ndietary and planetary destruction began,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nthe thing we're only realizing just now.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nListen to this,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nbetween 1950 and 2000, the world's population doubled.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nMeat consumption increased five-fold.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nNow, someone had to eat all that stuff, so we got fast food.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nAnd this took care of the situation resoundingly.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nHome cooking remained the norm, but its quality was down the tubes.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nThere were fewer meals with home-cooked breads, desserts and soups,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nbecause all of them could be bought at any store.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nNot that they were any good, but they were there.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nMost moms cooked like mine:\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:16.958\na piece of broiled meat, a quickly made salad with bottled dressing,\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\ncanned soup, canned fruit salad.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nMaybe baked or mashed potatoes,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nor perhaps the stupidest food ever, Minute Rice.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nFor dessert, store-bought ice cream or cookies.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nMy mom is not here, so I can say this now.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nIt wasn't all bad.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nBy the '70s, forward-thinking people\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nbegan to recognize the value of local ingredients.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nWe tended gardens, we became interested in organic food,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nwe knew or we were vegetarians.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nWe weren't all hippies, either.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nSome of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nMeanwhile, food production had become industrial. Industrial.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nPerhaps because it was being produced rationally,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nas if it were plastic,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nfood gained magical or poisonous powers, or both.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nMany people became fat-phobic.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nOthers worshiped broccoli, as if it were God-like.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nBut mostly they didn't eat broccoli.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nInstead they were sold on yogurt,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nyogurt being almost as good as broccoli.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nExcept, in reality, the way the industry sold yogurt\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nwas to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nSimilarly, let's look at a granola bar.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nYou think that that might be healthy food,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nbut in fact, if you look at the ingredient list,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nit's closer in form to a Snickers than it is to oatmeal.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nSadly, it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nif not actually killed --\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nthe beginning of the heyday of value-added food,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nwhich contained as many soy and corn products\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nas could be crammed into it.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nThink of the frozen chicken nugget.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nThe chicken is fed corn, and then its meat is ground up,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nand mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nand then it's fried in corn oil.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nAll you do is nuke it. What could be better?\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nAnd zapped horribly, pathetically.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nBy the '70s, home cooking was in such a sad state\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nthat the high fat and spice contents of foods\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nlike McNuggets and Hot Pockets --\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nand we all have our favorites, actually --\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nmade this stuff more appealing than the bland things\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nthat people were serving at home.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nAt the same time, masses of women were entering the workforce,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nand cooking simply wasn't important enough\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nfor men to share the burden.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nSo now, you've got your pizza nights, you've got your microwave nights,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nyou've got your grazing nights,\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nyou've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nLeading the way -- what's leading the way?\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nMeat, junk food, cheese:\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nthe very stuff that will kill you.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nSo, now we clamor for organic food.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nThat's good.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nAnd as evidence that things can actually change,\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nyou can now find organic food in supermarkets,\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nand even in fast-food outlets.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nBut organic food isn't the answer either,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nat least not the way it's currently defined.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nLet me pose you a question.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nCan farm-raised salmon be organic,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nwhen its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet,\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:17.958\neven if the feed itself is supposedly organic, and the fish themselves\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nare packed tightly in pens, swimming in their own filth?\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nAnd if that salmon's from Chile, and it's killed down there\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nand then flown 5,000 miles, whatever,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\ndumping how much carbon into the atmosphere?\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nI don't know.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nPacked in Styrofoam, of course,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nbefore landing somewhere in the United States,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nand then being trucked a few hundred more miles.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nThis may be organic in letter, but it's surely not organic in spirit.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nNow here is where we all meet.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nThe locavores, the organivores, the vegetarians,\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nthe vegans, the gourmets\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nand those of us who are just plain interested in good food.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nEven though we've come to this from different points,\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nwe all have to act on our knowledge\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nto change the way that everyone thinks about food.\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nWe need to start acting.\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nAnd this is not only an issue of social justice, as Ann Cooper said --\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nand, of course, she's completely right --\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nbut it's also one of global survival.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nWhich bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue,\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nthe overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food.\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nAs I said, 18 percent of greenhouse gases\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nare attributed to livestock production.\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nHow much livestock do you need to produce this?\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\n70 percent of the agricultural land on Earth,\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:44.958\n30 percent of the Earth's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nto raising the animals we'll eat.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nAnd this amount is predicted to double in the next 40 years or so.\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nAnd if the numbers coming in from China\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nare anything like what they look like now,\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nit's not going to be 40 years.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nThere is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do.\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nAnd I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nThe most common argument is that we need nutrients --\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.958\neven though we eat, on average, twice as much protein\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nas even the industry-obsessed USDA recommends.\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nBut listen: experts who are serious about disease reduction\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nrecommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week.\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nWhat do you think we eat per day? Half a pound.\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nBut don't we need meat to be big and strong?\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nIsn't meat eating essential to health?\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nWon't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nturn us into godless, sissy, liberals?\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nSome of us might think that would be a good thing.\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nBut, no, even if we were all steroid-filled football players,\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nthe answer is no.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nIn fact, there's no diet on Earth that meets\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nbasic nutritional needs that won't promote growth,\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nand many will make you much healthier than ours does.\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nWe don't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition,\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nwe eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition, and it's killing us.\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nTo suggest that in the interests of personal and human health\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nAmericans eat 50 percent less meat --\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nit's not enough of a cut, but it's a start.\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nIt would seem absurd, but that's exactly what should happen,\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nand what progressive people, forward-thinking people\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nshould be doing and advocating,\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nalong with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nI've been writing about food more or less omnivorously --\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:43.958\none might say indiscriminately -- for about 30 years.\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nDuring that time, I've eaten\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.958\nand recommended eating just about everything.\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nI'll never stop eating animals, I'm sure,\n\n00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nbut I do think that for the benefit of everyone,\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nthe time has come to stop raising them industrially\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:18:59.958\nand stop eating them thoughtlessly.\n\n00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nAnn Cooper's right.\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nThe USDA is not our ally here.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nWe have to take matters into our own hands,\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nnot only by advocating for a better diet for everyone --\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:15.958\nand that's the hard part -- but by improving our own.\n\n00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nAnd that happens to be quite easy.\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:20.958\nLess meat, less junk, more plants.\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:22.958\nIt's a simple formula: eat food.\n\n00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nEat real food.\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nWe can continue to enjoy our food, and we continue to eat well,\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:30.958\nand we can eat even better.\n\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:33.958\nWe can continue the search for the ingredients we love,\n\n00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:38.958\nand we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals.\n\n00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:42.958\nWe'll reduce not only calories, but our carbon footprint.\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:45.958\nWe can make food more important, not less,\n\n00:19:45.958 --> 00:19:47.958\nand save ourselves by doing so.\n\n00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:50.958\nWe have to choose that path.\n\n00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:52.958\nThank you."}, {"title": "The astonishing hidden world of the deep ocean", "duration": "1099", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_ballard_on_exploring_the_oceans", "transcript": "The first question is this. Our country has two exploration programs. One is NASA, with a mission to explore the great beyond, to explore the heavens, which we all want to go to if we're lucky. And you can see we have Sputnik, and we have Saturn, and we have other manifestations of space exploration. Well, there's also another program, in another agency within our government, in ocean exploration. It's in NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And my question is this: \"why are we ignoring the oceans?\" Here's the reason, or not the reason, but here's why I ask that question. If you compare NASA's annual budget to explore the heavens, that one-year budget would fund NOAA's budget to explore the oceans for 1,600 years. Why? Why are we looking up? Is it because it's heaven? And hell is down here? Is it a cultural issue? Why are people afraid of the ocean? Or do they just assume the ocean is just a dark, gloomy place that has nothing to offer?I'm going to take you on a 16-minute trip on 72 percent of the planet, so buckle up. OK. And what we're going to do is we're going to immerse ourselves in my world. And what I'm going to try \u2014 I hope I make the following points. I'm going to make it right now in case I forget. Everything I'm going to present to you was not in my textbooks when I went to school. And most of all, it was not even in my college textbooks. I'm a geophysicist, and all my Earth science books when I was a student \u2014 I had to give the wrong answer to get an A. We used to ridicule continental drift. It was something we laughed at. We learned of Marshall Kay's geosynclinal cycle, which is a bunch of crap. In today's context, it was a bunch of crap, but it was the law of geology, vertical tectonics. All the things we're going to walk through in our explorations and discoveries of the oceans were mostly discoveries made by accident. Mostly discoveries made by accident. We were looking for something and found something else. And everything we're going to talk about represents a one tenth of one percent glimpse, because that's all we've seen.I have a characterization. This is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water. It gives you the false impression it's a map. It is not a map. In fact, I have another version at my office and I ask people, \"Why are there mountains here, on this area here, but there are none over here?\" And they go, \"Well, gee, I don't know,\" saying, \"Is it a fracture zone? Is it a hot spot?\" No, no, that's the only place a ship's been. Most of the southern hemisphere is unexplored. We had more exploration ships down there during Captain Cook's time than now. It's amazing. All right. So we're going to immerse ourselves in the 72 percent of the planet because, you know, it's really naive to think that the Easter Bunny put all the resources on the continents.(Laughter)You know, it's just ludicrous. We are always, constantly playing the zero sum game. You know, we're going to do this, we're going to take it away from something else. I believe in just enriching the economy. And we're leaving so much on the table, 72 percent of the planet. And as I will point out later in the presentation, 50 percent of the United States of America lies beneath the sea. 50 percent of our country that we own, have all legal jurisdiction, have all rights to do whatever we want, lies beneath the sea and we have better maps of Mars than that 50 percent. Why? OK. Now, I began my explorations the hard way. Back then \u2014 actually my first expedition was when I was 17 years old. It was 49 years ago. Do the math, I'm 66. And I went out to sea on a Scripps ship and we almost got sunk by a giant rogue wave, and I was too young to be \u2014 you know, I thought it was great! I was a body surfer and I thought, \"Wow, that was an incredible wave!\" And we almost sank the ship, but I became enraptured with mounting expeditions. And over the last 49 years, I've done about 120, 121 \u2014 I keep doing them \u2014 expeditions.But in the early days, the only way I could get to the bottom was to crawl into a submarine, a very small submarine, and go down to the bottom. I dove in a whole series of different deep diving submersibles. Alvin and Sea Cliff and Cyana, and all the major deep submersibles we have, which are about eight. In fact, on a good day, we might have four or five human beings at the average depth of the Earth \u2014 maybe four or five human beings out of whatever billions we've got going. And so it's very difficult to get there, if you do it physically. But I was enraptured, and in my graduate years was the dawn of plate tectonics. And we realized that the greatest mountain range on Earth lies beneath the sea.The mid-ocean ridge runs around like the seam on a baseball. This is on a Mercator projection. But if you were to put it on an equal area projection, you'd see that the mid-ocean ridge covers 23 percent of the Earth's total surface area. Almost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range and we didn't enter it until after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin went to the moon. So we went to the moon, played golf up there, before we went to the largest feature on our own planet. And our interest in this mountain range, as Earth scientists in those days, was not only because of its tremendous size, dominating the planet, but the role it plays in the genesis of the Earth's outer skin. Because it's along the axis of the mid-ocean ridge where the great crustal plates are separating. And like a living organism, you tear it open, it bleeds its molten blood, rises up to heal that wound from the asthenosphere, hardens, forms new tissue and moves laterally.But no one had actually gone down into the actual site of the boundary of creation as we call it \u2014 into the Rift Valley \u2014 until a group of seven of us crawled in our little submarines in the summer of 1973, 1974 and were the first human beings to enter the Great Rift Valley. We went down into the Rift Valley. This is all accurate except for one thing \u2014 it's pitch black. It's absolutely pitch black, because photons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean, which is 12,000 feet. In the Rift Valley, it's 9,000 feet. Most of our planet does not feel the warmth of the sun. Most of our planet is in eternal darkness. And for that reason, you do not have photosynthesis in the deep sea. And with the absence of photosynthesis you have no plant life, and as a result, you have very little animal life living in this underworld. Or so we thought. And so in our initial explorations, we were totally focused on exploring the boundary of creation, looking at the volcanic features running along that entire 42,000 miles. Running along this entire 42,000 miles are tens of thousands of active volcanoes. Tens of thousands of active volcanoes. There are more active volcanoes beneath the sea than on land by two orders of magnitude. So, it's a phenomenally active region, it's not just a dark, boring place. It's a very alive place. And it's then being ripped open.But we were dealing with a particular scientific issue back then. We couldn't understand why you had a mountain under tension. In plate tectonic theory, we knew that if you had plates collide, it made sense: they would crush into one another, you would thicken the crust, you'd uplift it. That's why you get, you know, you get seashells up on Mount Everest. It's not a flood, it was pushed up there. We understood mountains under compression, but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension. It should not be. Until one of my colleagues said, \"It looks to me like a thermal blister, and the mid-ocean ridge must be a cooling curve.\" We said, \"Let's go find out.\" We punched a bunch of heat probes. Everything made sense, except, at the axis, there was missing heat. It was missing heat. It was hot. It wasn't hot enough. So, we came up with multiple hypotheses: there's little green people down there taking it; there's all sorts of things going on. But the only logical [explanation] was that there were hot springs. So, there must be underwater hot springs.We mounted an expedition to look for the missing heat. And so we went along this mountain range, in an area along Galapagos Rift, and did we find the missing heat. It was amazing. These giant chimneys, huge giant chimneys. We went up to them with our submersible. We wanted to get a temperature probe, we stuck it in there, looked at it \u2014 it pegged off scale. The pilot made this great observation: \"That's hot.\"(Laughter)And then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff \u2014 it could have melted. But it turns out the exiting temperature was 650 degrees F, hot enough to melt lead. This is what a real one looks like, on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. What you're looking at is an incredible pipe organ of chemicals coming out of the ocean. Everything you see in this picture is commercial grade: copper, lead, silver, zinc and gold. So the Easter Bunny has put things in the ocean floor, and you have massive heavy metal deposits that we're making in this mountain range. We're making huge discoveries of large commercial-grade ore along this mountain range, but it was dwarfed by what we discovered. We discovered a profusion of life, in a world that it should not exist [in]. Giant tube worms, 10 feet tall. I remember having to use vodka \u2014 my own vodka \u2014 to pickle it because we don't carry formaldehyde. We went and found these incredible clam beds sitting on the barren rock. Large clams, and when we opened them, they didn't look like a clam. And when we cut them open, they didn't have the anatomy of a clam. No mouth, no gut, no digestive system. Their bodies had been totally taken over by another organism, a bacterium, that had figured out how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark, through a process we now call chemosynthesis. None of it in our textbooks. None of this in our textbooks. We did not know about this life system. We were not predicting it. We stumbled on it, looking for some missing heat.So, we wanted to accelerate this process. We wanted to get away from this silly trip, up and down on a submarine: average depth of the ocean, 12,000 feet; two and half hours to get to work in the morning; two and half hours to get to home. Five hour commute to work. Three hours of bottom time, average distance traveled \u2014 one mile.(Laughter)On a 42,000 mile mountain range. Great job security, but not the way to go. So, I began designing a new technology of telepresence, using robotic systems to replicate myself, so I wouldn't have to cycle my vehicle system. We began to introduce that in our explorations, and we continued to make phenomenal discoveries with our new robotic technologies. Again, looking for something else, moving from one part of the mid-ocean ridge to another. The scientists were off watch and they came across incredible life forms. They came across new creatures they had not seen before. But more importantly, they discovered edifices down there that they did not understand. That did not make sense. They were not above a magma chamber. They shouldn't be there. And we called it Lost City.And Lost City was characterized by these incredible limestone formations and upside down pools. Look at that. How do you do that? That's water upside down. We went in underneath and tapped it, and we found that it had the pH of Drano. The pH of 11, and yet it had chemosynthetic bacteria living in it and at this extreme environment. And the hydrothermal vents were in an acidic environment. All the way at the other end, in an alkaline environment, at a pH of 11, life existed. So life was much more creative than we had ever thought. Again, discovered by accident. Just two years ago working off Santorini, where people are sunning themselves on the beach, unbeknownst to them in the caldera nearby, we found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems and more life systems. This was two miles from where people go to sunbathe, and they were oblivious to the existence of this system. Again, you know, we stop at the water's edge.Recently, diving off \u2014 in the Gulf of Mexico, finding pools of water, this time not upside down, right side up. Bingo. You'd think you're in air, until a fish swims by. You're looking at brine pools formed by salt diapirs. Near that was methane. I've never seen volcanoes of methane. Instead of belching out lava, they were belching out big, big bubbles of methane. And they were creating these volcanoes, and there were flows, not of lava, but of the mud coming out of the Earth but driven by \u2014 I've never seen this before.Moving on, there's more than just natural history beneath the sea \u2014 human history. Our discoveries of the Titanic. The realization that the deep sea is the largest museum on Earth. It contains more history than all of the museums on land combined. And yet we're only now penetrating it. Finding the state of preservation. We found the Bismarck in 16,000 feet. We then found the Yorktown. People always ask, \"Did you find the right ship?\" It said Yorktown on the stern.(Laughter)More recently, finding ancient history. How many ancient mariners have had a bad day? The number's a million. We've been discovering these along ancient trade routes, where they're not supposed to be. This shipwreck sank 100 years before the birth of Christ. This one sank carrying a prefabricated, Home Depot Roman temple. And then here's one that sank at the time of Homer, at 750 B.C. More recently, into the Black Sea, where we're exploring. Because there's no oxygen there, it's the largest reservoir of hydrogen sulfide on Earth. Shipwrecks are perfectly preserved. All their organics are perfectly preserved. We begin to excavate them. We expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their DNA. Look at the state of preservation \u2014 still the ad mark of a carpenter. Look at the state of those artifacts. You still see the beeswax dripping. When they dropped, they sealed it. This ship sank 1,500 years ago.Fortunately, we've been able to convince Congress. We begin to go on the Hill and lobby. And we stole recently a ship from the United States Navy. The Okeanos Explorer on its mission. Its mission is as good as you could get. Its mission is to go where no one has gone before on planet Earth. And I was looking at it yesterday, it's up in Seattle. OK.(Applause)It comes online this summer, and it begins its journey of exploration. But we have no idea what we're going find when we go out there with our technology. But certainly, it's going to be going to the unknown America. This is that part of the United States that lies beneath the sea. We own all of that blue and yet, like I say, particularly the western territorial trust, we don't have maps of them. We don't have maps of them. We have maps of Venus, but not of the western territorial trust. The way we're going to run this \u2014 we have no idea what we're going to discover. We have no idea what we're going to discover. We're going to discover an ancient shipwreck, a Phoenician off Brazil, or a new rock formation, a new life. So, we're going to run it like an emergency hospital.We're going to connect our command center, via a high-bandwidth satellite link to a building we're building at the University of Rhode Island, called the Interspace Center. And within that, we're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine, blue-gold team, switching them off and on, running 24 hours a day. A discovery is made, that discovery is instantly seen in the command center a second later. But then it's connected through Internet too \u2014 the new Internet highway that makes Internet one look like a dirt road on the information highway \u2014 with 10 gigabits of bandwidth. We'll go into areas we have no knowledge of. It's a big blank sheet on our planet. We'll map it within hours, have the maps disseminated out to the major universities. It turns out that 90 percent of all the oceanographic intellect in this country are at 12 universities. They're all on I-2. We can then build a command center. This is a remote center at the University of Washington. She's talking to the pilot. She's 5,000 miles away, but she's assumed command.But the beauty of this, too, is we can then disseminate it to children. We can disseminate. They can follow this expedition. I've started a program \u2014 where are you Jim? Jim Young who helped me start a program called the Jason Project. More recently, we've started a program with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, so that we can use exploration, and the excitement of live exploration, to motivate them and excite them and then give them what they're already ready for. I would not let an adult drive my robot. You don't have enough gaming experience. But I will let a kid with no license take over control of my vehicle system.(Applause)Because we want to create \u2014 we want to create the classroom of tomorrow. We have stiff competition and we need to motivate and it's all being done. You win or lose an engineer or a scientist by eighth grade. The game is not over \u2014 it's over by the eighth grade, it's not beginning. We need to be not only proud of our universities. We need to be proud of our middle schools. And when we have the best middle schools in the world, we'll have the best kids pumped out of that system, let me tell you. Because this is what we want. This is what we want. This is a young lady, not watching a football game, not watching a basketball game. Watching exploration live from thousands of miles away, and it's just dawning on her what she's seeing. And when you get a jaw drop, you can inform. You can put so much information into that mind, it's in full [receiving] mode.(Applause)This, I hope, will be a future engineer or a future scientist in the battle for truth. And my final question, my final question \u2014 why are we not looking at moving out onto the sea? Why do we have programs to build habitation on Mars, and we have programs to look at colonizing the moon, but we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet? And the technology is at hand.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 264, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nThe first question is this.\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nOur country has two exploration programs.\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nOne is NASA, with a mission to explore the great beyond,\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nto explore the heavens, which we all want to go to if we're lucky.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nAnd you can see we have Sputnik, and we have Saturn,\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nand we have other manifestations of space exploration.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nWell, there's also another program,\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nin another agency within our government, in ocean exploration.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nIt's in NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nAnd my question is this: \"why are we ignoring the oceans?\"\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nHere's the reason, or not the reason, but here's why I ask that question.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nIf you compare NASA's annual budget to explore the heavens,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nthat one-year budget would fund NOAA's budget\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nto explore the oceans for 1,600 years.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nWhy? Why are we looking up? Is it because it's heaven?\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nAnd hell is down here? Is it a cultural issue?\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nWhy are people afraid of the ocean?\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nOr do they just assume the ocean is just a dark, gloomy place\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nthat has nothing to offer?\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nI'm going to take you on a 16-minute trip on 72 percent of the planet, so buckle up.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nOK. And what we're going to do\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nis we're going to immerse ourselves in my world.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nAnd what I'm going to try -- I hope I make the following points.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nI'm going to make it right now in case I forget.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nEverything I'm going to present to you\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nwas not in my textbooks when I went to school.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nAnd most of all, it was not even in my college textbooks.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nI'm a geophysicist, and all my Earth science books when I was a student --\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nI had to give the wrong answer to get an A.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nWe used to ridicule continental drift. It was something we laughed at.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nWe learned of Marshall Kay's geosynclinal cycle, which is a bunch of crap.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nIn today's context, it was a bunch of crap,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nbut it was the law of geology, vertical tectonics.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nAll the things we're going to walk through\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nin our explorations and discoveries of the oceans\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nwere mostly discoveries made by accident.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nMostly discoveries made by accident.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nWe were looking for something and found something else.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAnd everything we're going to talk about\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nrepresents a one tenth of one percent glimpse, because that's all we've seen.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nI have a characterization.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nThis is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nIt gives you the false impression it's a map.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nIt is not a map.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nIn fact, I have another version at my office\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nand I ask people, \"Why are there mountains here, on this area here,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nbut there are none over here?\" And they go, \"Well, gee,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nI don't know,\" saying,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\n\"Is it a fracture zone? Is it a hot spot?\"\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nNo, no, that's the only place a ship's been.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nMost of the southern hemisphere is unexplored.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nWe had more exploration ships down there\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nduring Captain Cook's time than now. It's amazing.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nAll right. So we're going to immerse ourselves\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nin the 72 percent of the planet because, you know,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nit's really naive to think that the Easter Bunny\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nput all the resources on the continents.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nYou know, it's just ludicrous.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nWe are always, constantly playing the zero sum game.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nYou know, we're going to do this, we're going to take it away from something else.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nI believe in just enriching the economy.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nAnd we're leaving so much on the table, 72 percent of the planet.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nAnd as I will point out later in the presentation,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:48.958\n50 percent of the United States of America lies beneath the sea.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\n50 percent of our country that we own, have all legal jurisdiction,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nhave all rights to do whatever we want, lies beneath the sea\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nand we have better maps of Mars than that 50 percent.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nWhy? OK. Now, I began my explorations the hard way.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nBack then -- actually my first expedition\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nwas when I was 17 years old. It was 49 years ago.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nDo the math, I'm 66. And I went out to sea on a Scripps ship\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nand we almost got sunk by a giant rogue wave,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nand I was too young to be -- you know, I thought it was great!\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nI was a body surfer and I thought, \"Wow, that was an incredible wave!\"\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nAnd we almost sank the ship, but I became enraptured\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nwith mounting expeditions. And over the last 49 years,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nI've done about 120, 121 -- I keep doing them -- expeditions.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nBut in the early days, the only way I could get to the bottom\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nwas to crawl into a submarine, a very small submarine,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nand go down to the bottom.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nI dove in a whole series of different deep diving submersibles.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nAlvin and Sea Cliff and Cyana,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nand all the major deep submersibles we have, which are about eight.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nIn fact, on a good day, we might have four or five human beings\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nat the average depth of the Earth --\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nmaybe four or five human beings out of whatever billions we've got going.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nAnd so it's very difficult to get there, if you do it physically.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nBut I was enraptured, and in my graduate years\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nwas the dawn of plate tectonics. And we realized\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nthat the greatest mountain range on Earth lies beneath the sea.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nThe mid-ocean ridge runs around like the seam on a baseball.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nThis is on a Mercator projection.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nBut if you were to put it on an equal area projection,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nyou'd see that the mid-ocean ridge covers 23 percent\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nof the Earth's total surface area.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nAlmost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nand we didn't enter it until after Neil Armstrong\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nand Buzz Aldrin went to the moon.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nSo we went to the moon, played golf up there,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nbefore we went to the largest feature on our own planet.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAnd our interest in this mountain range, as Earth scientists in those days,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nwas not only because of its tremendous size, dominating the planet,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nbut the role it plays in the genesis of the Earth's outer skin.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nBecause it's along the axis of the mid-ocean ridge\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nwhere the great crustal plates are separating.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nAnd like a living organism, you tear it open,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nit bleeds its molten blood, rises up to heal that wound\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nfrom the asthenosphere, hardens, forms new tissue and moves laterally.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nBut no one had actually gone down\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\ninto the actual site of the boundary of creation as we call it --\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\ninto the Rift Valley -- until a group of seven of us\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:19.958\ncrawled in our little submarines in the summer of 1973, 1974\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nand were the first human beings to enter the Great Rift Valley.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nWe went down into the Rift Valley.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nThis is all accurate except for one thing -- it's pitch black.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nIt's absolutely pitch black, because\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nphotons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nwhich is 12,000 feet. In the Rift Valley, it's 9,000 feet.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nMost of our planet does not feel the warmth of the sun.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nMost of our planet is in eternal darkness.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nAnd for that reason, you do not have photosynthesis in the deep sea.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nAnd with the absence of photosynthesis\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nyou have no plant life, and as a result,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nyou have very little animal life living in this underworld.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nOr so we thought. And so in our initial explorations,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nwe were totally focused on exploring the boundary of creation,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nlooking at the volcanic features running along that entire 42,000 miles.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nRunning along this entire 42,000 miles\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nare tens of thousands of active volcanoes.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nTens of thousands of active volcanoes.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nThere are more active volcanoes beneath the sea\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nthan on land by two orders of magnitude.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nSo, it's a phenomenally active region,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nit's not just a dark, boring place. It's a very alive place.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nAnd it's then being ripped open.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nBut we were dealing with a particular scientific issue back then.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nWe couldn't understand why you had a mountain under tension.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nIn plate tectonic theory, we knew that if you had plates collide,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nit made sense: they would crush into one another,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nyou would thicken the crust, you'd uplift it.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nThat's why you get, you know, you get seashells up on Mount Everest.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nIt's not a flood, it was pushed up there.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nWe understood mountains under compression,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nbut we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nIt should not be. Until one of my colleagues said,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\n\"It looks to me like a thermal blister, and the mid-ocean ridge\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nmust be a cooling curve.\" We said, \"Let's go find out.\"\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nWe punched a bunch of heat probes. Everything made sense,\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nexcept, at the axis, there was missing heat. It was missing heat.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nIt was hot. It wasn't hot enough.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nSo, we came up with multiple hypotheses:\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nthere's little green people down there taking it;\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nthere's all sorts of things going on.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nBut the only logical [explanation] was that there were hot springs.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nSo, there must be underwater hot springs.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nWe mounted an expedition to look for the missing heat.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nAnd so we went along this mountain range, in an area along Galapagos Rift,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nand did we find the missing heat.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nIt was amazing. These giant chimneys, huge giant chimneys.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nWe went up to them with our submersible.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nWe wanted to get a temperature probe, we stuck it in there,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nlooked at it -- it pegged off scale.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nThe pilot made this great observation: \"That's hot.\"\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nAnd then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff --\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nit could have melted. But it turns out the exiting temperature\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nwas 650 degrees F, hot enough to melt lead.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nThis is what a real one looks like, on the Juan de Fuca Ridge.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nWhat you're looking at is an incredible pipe organ\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nof chemicals coming out of the ocean.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nEverything you see in this picture is commercial grade:\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\ncopper, lead, silver, zinc and gold.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nSo the Easter Bunny has put things in the ocean floor,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nand you have massive heavy metal deposits\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nthat we're making in this mountain range.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nWe're making huge discoveries of large commercial-grade ore\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nalong this mountain range, but it was dwarfed by what we discovered.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nWe discovered a profusion of life,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nin a world that it should not exist [in]. Giant tube worms, 10 feet tall.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nI remember having to use vodka -- my own vodka -- to pickle it\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nbecause we don't carry formaldehyde.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nWe went and found these incredible clam beds\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nsitting on the barren rock. Large clams,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nand when we opened them, they didn't look like a clam.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nAnd when we cut them open, they didn't have the anatomy of a clam.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nNo mouth, no gut, no digestive system.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nTheir bodies had been totally taken over\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nby another organism, a bacterium, that had figured out\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nhow to replicate photosynthesis in the dark,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nthrough a process we now call chemosynthesis.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nNone of it in our textbooks. None of this in our textbooks.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nWe did not know about this life system.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nWe were not predicting it.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nWe stumbled on it, looking for some missing heat.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nSo, we wanted to accelerate this process.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nWe wanted to get away from this silly trip, up and down on a submarine:\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\naverage depth of the ocean, 12,000 feet;\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\ntwo and half hours to get to work in the morning;\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\ntwo and half hours to get to home. Five hour commute to work.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nThree hours of bottom time, average distance traveled -- one mile.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nOn a 42,000 mile mountain range. Great job security, but not the way to go.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nSo, I began designing a new technology of telepresence,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nusing robotic systems to replicate myself,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nso I wouldn't have to cycle my vehicle system.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nWe began to introduce that in our explorations,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nand we continued to make phenomenal discoveries\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nwith our new robotic technologies. Again, looking for something else,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nmoving from one part of the mid-ocean ridge to another.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nThe scientists were off watch and they came across incredible life forms.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nThey came across new creatures they had not seen before.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nBut more importantly, they discovered\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nedifices down there that they did not understand.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nThat did not make sense. They were not above a magma chamber.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nThey shouldn't be there. And we called it Lost City.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nAnd Lost City was characterized by these incredible limestone formations\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nand upside down pools. Look at that.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nHow do you do that? That's water upside down.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nWe went in underneath and tapped it, and we found that it had the pH of Drano.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nThe pH of 11, and yet it had chemosynthetic bacteria living in it\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nand at this extreme environment.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nAnd the hydrothermal vents were in an acidic environment.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nAll the way at the other end, in an alkaline environment,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nat a pH of 11, life existed.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nSo life was much more creative than we had ever thought.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nAgain, discovered by accident. Just two years ago\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nworking off Santorini, where people are sunning themselves on the beach,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nunbeknownst to them in the caldera nearby,\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nwe found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nand more life systems.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nThis was two miles from where people go to sunbathe,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nand they were oblivious to the existence of this system.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nAgain, you know, we stop at the water's edge.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nRecently, diving off -- in the Gulf of Mexico, finding pools of water,\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nthis time not upside down, right side up.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nBingo. You'd think you're in air, until a fish swims by.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nYou're looking at brine pools formed by salt diapirs.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nNear that was methane. I've never seen volcanoes of methane.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nInstead of belching out lava, they were belching out\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nbig, big bubbles of methane. And they were creating these volcanoes,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nand there were flows, not of lava,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nbut of the mud coming out of the Earth but driven by --\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nI've never seen this before.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nMoving on, there's more than just natural history beneath the sea --\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nhuman history. Our discoveries of the Titanic.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nThe realization that the deep sea is the largest museum on Earth.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nIt contains more history than all of the museums on land combined.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nAnd yet we're only now penetrating it.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nFinding the state of preservation.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nWe found the Bismarck in 16,000 feet. We then found the Yorktown.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nPeople always ask, \"Did you find the right ship?\"\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nIt said Yorktown on the stern.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nMore recently, finding ancient history.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nHow many ancient mariners have had a bad day? The number's a million.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nWe've been discovering these along ancient trade routes,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nwhere they're not supposed to be.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nThis shipwreck sank 100 years before the birth of Christ.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nThis one sank carrying a prefabricated, Home Depot Roman temple.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nAnd then here's one that sank at the time of Homer, at 750 B.C.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nMore recently, into the Black Sea, where we're exploring.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nBecause there's no oxygen there, it's the largest reservoir\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nof hydrogen sulfide on Earth. Shipwrecks are perfectly preserved.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nAll their organics are perfectly preserved. We begin to excavate them.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nWe expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their DNA.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nLook at the state of preservation --\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nstill the ad mark of a carpenter. Look at the state of those artifacts.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nYou still see the beeswax dripping. When they dropped, they sealed it.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nThis ship sank 1,500 years ago.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nFortunately, we've been able to convince Congress.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nWe begin to go on the Hill and lobby.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nAnd we stole recently a ship from the United States Navy.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nThe Okeanos Explorer on its mission.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nIts mission is as good as you could get.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nIts mission is to go where no one has gone before on planet Earth.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nAnd I was looking at it yesterday, it's up in Seattle. OK.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:20.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nIt comes online this summer,\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nand it begins its journey of exploration.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nBut we have no idea what we're going find when we go out there with our technology.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nBut certainly, it's going to be going to the unknown America.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nThis is that part of the United States that lies beneath the sea.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nWe own all of that blue and yet,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nlike I say, particularly the western territorial trust,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nwe don't have maps of them. We don't have maps of them.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nWe have maps of Venus, but not of the western territorial trust.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nThe way we're going to run this -- we have no idea what we're going to discover.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nWe have no idea what we're going to discover.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nWe're going to discover an ancient shipwreck, a Phoenician off Brazil,\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nor a new rock formation, a new life.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nSo, we're going to run it like an emergency hospital.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nWe're going to connect our command center,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nvia a high-bandwidth satellite link to a building we're building\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nat the University of Rhode Island, called the Interspace Center.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nAnd within that, we're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nblue-gold team, switching them off and on, running 24 hours a day.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nA discovery is made, that discovery is instantly seen\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nin the command center a second later.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nBut then it's connected through Internet too --\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nthe new Internet highway that makes Internet one\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nlook like a dirt road on the information highway --\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nwith 10 gigabits of bandwidth.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nWe'll go into areas we have no knowledge of.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nIt's a big blank sheet on our planet. We'll map it within hours,\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nhave the maps disseminated out to the major universities.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nIt turns out that 90 percent of all the oceanographic intellect\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nin this country are at 12 universities. They're all on I-2.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nWe can then build a command center.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nThis is a remote center at the University of Washington.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nShe's talking to the pilot. She's 5,000 miles away, but she's assumed command.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nBut the beauty of this, too, is we can then disseminate it to children.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nWe can disseminate.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nThey can follow this expedition. I've started a program --\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nwhere are you Jim? Jim Young who helped me start a program\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\ncalled the Jason Project. More recently, we've started a program\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nwith the Boys and Girls Clubs of America,\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nso that we can use exploration,\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nand the excitement of live exploration, to motivate them and excite them\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nand then give them what they're already ready for.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nI would not let an adult drive my robot.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nYou don't have enough gaming experience.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nBut I will let a kid with no license take over control of my vehicle system.\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nBecause we want to create --\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nwe want to create the classroom of tomorrow.\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nWe have stiff competition and we need to motivate and it's all being done.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nYou win or lose an engineer or a scientist by eighth grade.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nThe game is not over -- it's over by the eighth grade, it's not beginning.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nWe need to be not only proud of our universities.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nWe need to be proud of our middle schools.\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nAnd when we have the best middle schools in the world,\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nwe'll have the best kids pumped out of that system, let me tell you.\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nBecause this is what we want. This is what we want.\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nThis is a young lady, not watching a football game,\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nnot watching a basketball game.\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nWatching exploration live from thousands of miles away,\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nand it's just dawning on her what she's seeing.\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nAnd when you get a jaw drop, you can inform.\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nYou can put so much information into that mind, it's in full [receiving] mode.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:25.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:30.958\nThis, I hope, will be a future engineer\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nor a future scientist in the battle for truth.\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nAnd my final question, my final question --\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nwhy are we not looking at moving out onto the sea?\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nWhy do we have programs to build habitation on Mars,\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nand we have programs to look at colonizing the moon,\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nbut we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet?\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nAnd the technology is at hand.\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:18:01.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Designing objects that tell stories", "duration": "1063", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/yves_behar_on_designing_objects_that_tell_stories", "transcript": "Being a child, and sort of crawling around the house, I remember these Turkish carpets, and there were these scenes, these battle scenes, these love scenes. I mean, look, this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this soldier. And my mom took these pictures actually, last week, of our carpets, and I remember this to this day. There was another object, this sort of towering piece of furniture with creatures and gargoyles and nudity \u2014 pretty scary stuff, when you're a little kid.What I remember today from this is that objects tell stories, so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work. And then there was another influence. I was a teenager, and at 15 or 16, I guess like all teenagers, we want to just do what we love and what we believe in. And so, I fused together the two things I loved the most, which was skiing and windsurfing. Those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in Switzerland.So, I created this compilation of the two: I took my skis and I took a board and I put a mast foot in there, and some foot straps, and some metal fins, and here I was, going really fast on frozen lakes. It was really a death trap. I mean, it was incredible, it worked incredibly well, but it was really dangerous. And I realized then I had to go to design school. (Laughter) I mean, look at those graphics there. (Laughter)So, I went to design school, and it was the early '90s when I finished. And I saw something extraordinary happening in Silicon Valley, so I wanted to be there, and I saw that the computer was coming into our homes, that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes. And so I got myself a job and I was working for a consultancy, and we would get in to these meetings, and these managers would come in, and they would say, \"Well, what we're going to do here is really important, you know.\" And they would give the projects code names, you know, mostly from \"Star Wars,\" actually: things like C3PO, Yoda, Luke. So, in anticipation, I would be this young designer in the back of the room, and I would raise my hand, and I would ask questions. I mean, in retrospect, probably stupid questions, but things like, \"What's this Caps Lock key for?\" or \"What's this Num Lock key for?\" You know, that thing? \"You know, do people really use it? Do they need it? Do they want it in their homes?\" (Laughter)What I realized then is, they didn't really want to change the legacy stuff; they didn't want to change the insides. They were really looking for us, the designers, to create the skins, to put some pretty stuff outside of the box. And I didn't want to be a colorist. It wasn't what I wanted to do. I didn't want to be a stylist in this way. And then I saw this quote: \"advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal.\" (Laughter)So, I had to start on my own. So I moved to San Francisco, and I started a little company, fuseproject. And what I wanted to work on is important stuff. And I wanted to really not just work on the skins, but I wanted to work on the entire human experience. And so the first projects were sort of humble, but they took technology and maybe made it into things that people would use in a new way, and maybe finding some new functionality.This is a watch we made for Mini Cooper, the car company, right when it launched, and it's the first watch that has a display that switches from horizontal to vertical. And that allows me to check my timer discretely, here, without bending my elbow. And other projects, which were really about transformation, about matching the human need. This is a little piece of furniture for an Italian manufacturer, and it ships completely flat, and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot. And something a little bit more experimental: this is a light fixture for Swarovski, and what it does is, it changes shape. So, it goes from a circle, to a round, to a square, to a figure eight. And just by drawing on a little computer tablet, the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want.And then finally, the leaf lamp for Herman Miller. This is a pretty involved process; it took us about four and a half years. But I really was looking for creating a unique experience of light, a new experience of light. So, we had to design both the light and the light bulb. And that's a unique opportunity, I would say, in design. And the new experience I was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm, sort of glowing kind of mood light, all the way to a bright work light. So, the light bulb actually does that. It allows the person to switch, and to mix these two colorations. And it's done in a very simple way: one just touches the base of the light, and on one side, you can mix the brightness, and on the other, the coloration of the light.So, all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them, and I think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world, whether it's for business, or, as I'm going to show, on some civic-type projects. Because I think everybody agrees that as designers we bring value to business, value to the users also, but I think it's the values that we put into these projects that ultimately create the greater value. And the values we bring can be about environmental issues, about sustainability, about lower power consumption. You know, they can be about function and beauty; they can be about business strategy. But designers are really the glue that brings these things together.So Jawbone is a project that you're familiar with, and it has a humanistic technology. It feels your skin. It rests on your skin, and it knows when it is you're talking. And by knowing when it is you're talking, it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about, which is the environmental noises.But the other thing that is humanistic about Jawbone is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff, and all the nerdy stuff out of it, and try to make it as beautiful as we can. I mean, think about it: the care we take in selecting sunglasses, or jewelry, or accessories is really important, so if it isn't beautiful, it really doesn't belong on your face. And this is what we're pursuing here.But how we work on Jawbone is really unique. I want to point at something here, on the left. This is the board, this is one of the things that goes inside that makes this technology work. But this is the design process: there's somebody changing the board, putting tracers on the board, changing the location of the ICs, as the designers on the other side are doing the work. So, it's not about slapping skins, anymore, on a technology. It's really about designing from the inside out. And then, on the other side of the room, the designers are making small adjustments, sketching, drawing by hand, putting it in the computer. And it's what I call being design driven. You know, there is some push and pull, but design is really helping define the whole experience from the inside out.And then, of course, design is never done. And this is \u2014 the other new way that is unique in how we work is, because it's never done, you have to do all this other stuff. The packaging, and the website, and you need to continue to really touch the user, in many ways. But how do you retain somebody, when it's never done? And Hosain Rahman, the CEO of Aliph Jawbone, you know, really understands that you need a different structure. So, in a way, the different structure is that we're partners, it's a partnership. We can continue to work and dedicate ourselves to this project, and then we also share in the rewards.And here's another project, another partnership-type approach. This is called Y Water, and it's this guy from Los Angeles, Thomas Arndt, Austrian originally, who came to us, and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink, or an organic drink for his kids, to replace the high-sugar-content sodas that he's trying to get them away from. So, we worked on this bottle, and it's completely symmetrical in every dimension. And this allows the bottle to turn into a game. The bottles connect together, and you can create different shapes, different forms. (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)And then while we were doing this, the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a Y, and then we thought, well these words, \"why\" and \"why not,\" are probably the most important words that kids ask. So we called it Y Water. And so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room: the three-dimensional design, the ideas, the branding, it all becomes deeply connected. And then the other thing about this project is, we bring intellectual property, we bring a marketing approach, we bring all this stuff, but I think, at the end of the day, what we bring is these values, and these values create a soul for the companies we work with. And it's especially rewarding when your design work becomes a creative endeavor, when others can be creative and do more with it.Here's another project, which I think really emulates that. This is the One Laptop per Child, the $100 laptop. This picture is incredible. In Nigeria, people carry their most precious belongings on their heads. This girl is going to school with a laptop on her head. I mean, to me, it just means so much. But when Nicholas Negroponte \u2014 and he has spoken about this project a lot, he's the founder of OLPC \u2014 came to us about two and a half years ago, there were some clear ideas. He wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology, and those are pillars of his life, but also pillars of the mission of One Laptop per Child. But the third pillar that he talked about was design. And at the time, I wasn't really working on computers. I didn't really want to, from the previous adventure. But what he said was really significant, is that design was going to be why the kids were going to love this product, how we were going to make it low cost, robust. And plus, he said he was going to get rid of the Caps Lock key \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 and the Num Lock key, too.So, I was convinced. We designed it to be iconic, to look different. To look like it's for a kid, but not like a toy. And then the integration of all these great technologies, which you've heard about, the Wi-Fi antennas that allow the kids to connect; the screen, which you can read in sunlight; the keyboard, which is made out of rubber, and it's protected from the environment.You know, all these great technologies really happened because of the passion and the OLPC people and the engineers. They fought the suppliers, they fought the manufacturers. I mean, they fought like animals for this to remain they way it is. And in a way, it is that will that makes projects like this one \u2014 allows the process from not destroying the original idea. And I think this is something really important.So, now you get these pictures \u2014 you get up in the morning, and you see the kids in Nigeria and you see them in Uruguay with their computers, and in Mongolia. And we went away from obviously the beige. I mean it's colorful, it's fun. In fact, you can see each logo is a little bit different. It's because we were able to run, during the manufacturing process, 20 colors for the X and the O, which is the name of the computer, and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor, you get 20 times 20: you get 400 different options there. So, the lessons from seeing the kids using them in the developing world are incredible.But this is my nephew, Anthony, in Switzerland, and he had the laptop for an afternoon, and I had to take it back. It was hard. (Laughter) And it was a prototype. And a month and a half later, I come back to Switzerland, and there he is playing with his own version. (Laughter) Like paper, paper and cardboard.So, I'm going to finish with one last project, and this is a little bit more of adult play. (Laughter) Some of you might have heard about the New York City condom. It's actually just launched, actually launched on Valentine's Day, February 14, about 10 days ago. So, the Department of Health in New York came to us, and they needed a way to distribute 36 million condoms for free to the citizens of New York. So a pretty big endeavor, and we worked on the dispensers. These are the dispensers. There's this friendly shape. It's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant, and it has to be easily serviceable: you have to know where it is and what it does. And we also designed the condoms themselves.And I was just in New York at the launch, and I went to see all these places where they're installed: this is at a Puerto Rican little mom-and-pop store; at a bar in Christopher Street; at a pool hall. I mean, they're being installed in homeless clinics \u2014 everywhere. Of course, clubs and discos, too. And here's the public service announcement for this project. (Music) (Laughter) Get some. (Applause)So, this is really where design is able to create a conversation. I was in these venues, and people were, you know, really into getting them. They were excited. It was breaking the ice, it was getting over a stigma, and I think that's also what design can do. So, I was going to throw some condoms in the room and whatnot, but I'm not sure it's the etiquette here. (Laughter) Yeah? All right, all right. I have only a few. (Laughter) (Applause) So, I have more, you can always ask me for some more later. (Laughter) And if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom, you can just say you like the design. (Laughter)So, I'll finish with just one thought: if we all work together on creating value, but if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do, I think we can change the work that we do. We can change these values, can change the companies we work with, and eventually, together, maybe we can change the world. So, thank you.

I mean, it was incredible,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nit worked incredibly well, but it was really dangerous.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nAnd I realized then I had to go to design school.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:38.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nI mean, look at those graphics there.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nSo, I went to design school,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nand it was the early '90s when I finished.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nAnd I saw something extraordinary happening in Silicon Valley,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nso I wanted to be there,\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nand I saw that the computer was coming into our homes,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nthat it had to change in order to be with us in our homes.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nAnd so I got myself a job and I was working for a consultancy,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nand we would get in to these meetings,\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nand these managers would come in,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nand they would say,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\n\"Well, what we're going to do here is really important, you know.\"\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nAnd they would give the projects code names, you know,\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nmostly from \"Star Wars,\" actually: things like C3PO, Yoda, Luke.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nSo, in anticipation, I would be this young designer\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nin the back of the room, and I would raise my hand,\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nand I would ask questions.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nI mean, in retrospect, probably stupid questions,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nbut things like, \"What's this Caps Lock key for?\"\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nor \"What's this Num Lock key for?\" You know, that thing?\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:49.958\n\"You know, do people really use it?\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nDo they need it? Do they want it in their homes?\"\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nWhat I realized then is, they didn't really want to change\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nthe legacy stuff; they didn't want to change the insides.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nThey were really looking for us, the designers, to create the skins,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nto put some pretty stuff outside of the box.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nAnd I didn't want to be a colorist.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nIt wasn't what I wanted to do.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nI didn't want to be a stylist in this way.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nAnd then I saw this quote:\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:30.958\n\"advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal.\"\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nSo, I had to start on my own. So I moved to San Francisco,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nand I started a little company, fuseproject.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nAnd what I wanted to work on is important stuff.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nAnd I wanted to really not just work on the skins,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nbut I wanted to work on the entire human experience.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nAnd so the first projects were sort of humble,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nbut they took technology and maybe made it into things\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nthat people would use in a new way,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nand maybe finding some new functionality.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nThis is a watch we made for Mini Cooper, the car company,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nright when it launched,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nand it's the first watch that has a display\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nthat switches from horizontal to vertical.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nAnd that allows me to check my timer discretely, here,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nwithout bending my elbow.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nAnd other projects, which were really about transformation,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nabout matching the human need.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nThis is a little piece of furniture for an Italian manufacturer,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nand it ships completely flat,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nAnd something a little bit more experimental:\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nthis is a light fixture for Swarovski,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nand what it does is, it changes shape.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nSo, it goes from a circle, to a round, to a square, to a figure eight.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nAnd just by drawing on a little computer tablet,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nthe entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nAnd then finally, the leaf lamp for Herman Miller.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nThis is a pretty involved process;\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nit took us about four and a half years.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nBut I really was looking for creating a unique experience of light,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:07.958\na new experience of light.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nSo, we had to design both the light and the light bulb.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nAnd that's a unique opportunity, I would say, in design.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nAnd the new experience I was looking for\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nis giving the choice for the user to go from\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\na warm, sort of glowing kind of mood light,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nall the way to a bright work light.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nSo, the light bulb actually does that.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nIt allows the person to switch,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nand to mix these two colorations.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nAnd it's done in a very simple way:\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\none just touches the base of the light,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nand on one side, you can mix the brightness,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nand on the other, the coloration of the light.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nSo, all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them,\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand I think as designers we need to really think\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nabout how we can create a different relationship\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nbetween our work and the world,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nwhether it's for business,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nor, as I'm going to show, on some civic-type projects.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nBecause I think everybody agrees that as designers we bring\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nvalue to business, value to the users also,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nbut I think it's the values that we put into these projects\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nthat ultimately create the greater value.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nAnd the values we bring\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.958\ncan be about environmental issues,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nabout sustainability, about lower power consumption.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nYou know, they can be about function and beauty;\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nthey can be about business strategy.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nBut designers are really the glue\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nthat brings these things together.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nSo Jawbone is a project that you're familiar with,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nand it has a humanistic technology.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nIt feels your skin. It rests on your skin,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nand it knows when it is you're talking.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nAnd by knowing when it is you're talking,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nit gets rid of the other noises that it knows about,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nwhich is the environmental noises.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nBut the other thing that is humanistic about Jawbone\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nis that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nand all the nerdy stuff out of it,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nand try to make it as beautiful as we can.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nI mean, think about it:\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nthe care we take in selecting sunglasses, or jewelry,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nor accessories is really important,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nso if it isn't beautiful, it really doesn't belong on your face.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAnd this is what we're pursuing here.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nBut how we work on Jawbone is really unique.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nI want to point at something here, on the left.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nThis is the board, this is one of the things that goes inside\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nthat makes this technology work.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nBut this is the design process:\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nthere's somebody changing the board,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nputting tracers on the board, changing the location of the ICs,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nas the designers on the other side are doing the work.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nSo, it's not about slapping skins, anymore, on a technology.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nIt's really about designing from the inside out.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nAnd then, on the other side of the room,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nthe designers are making small adjustments,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nsketching, drawing by hand, putting it in the computer.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nAnd it's what I call being design driven.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nYou know, there is some push and pull,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nbut design is really helping define\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nthe whole experience from the inside out.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nAnd then, of course, design is never done.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nAnd this is -- the other new way that is unique\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nin how we work is, because it's never done,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nyou have to do all this other stuff.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nThe packaging, and the website, and you need to continue\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nto really touch the user, in many ways.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nBut how do you retain somebody, when it's never done?\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nAnd Hosain Rahman, the CEO of Aliph Jawbone,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nyou know, really understands that you need a different structure.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nSo, in a way, the different structure is that we're partners,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nit's a partnership. We can continue to work\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nand dedicate ourselves to this project,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nand then we also share in the rewards.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nAnd here's another project, another partnership-type approach.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nThis is called Y Water,\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nand it's this guy from Los Angeles, Thomas Arndt,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nAustrian originally, who came to us,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nand all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nor an organic drink for his kids,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nto replace the high-sugar-content sodas\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nthat he's trying to get them away from.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nSo, we worked on this bottle,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nand it's completely symmetrical in every dimension.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nAnd this allows the bottle to turn into a game.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nThe bottles connect together,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nand you can create different shapes, different forms.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nThank you.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:55.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nAnd then while we were doing this,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nthe shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a Y,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nand then we thought, well these words, \"why\" and \"why not,\"\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nare probably the most important words that kids ask.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nSo we called it Y Water. And so this is\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nanother place where it all comes together in the same room:\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nthe three-dimensional design, the ideas, the branding,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nit all becomes deeply connected.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nAnd then the other thing about this project is,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nwe bring intellectual property,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nwe bring a marketing approach,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nwe bring all this stuff, but I think, at the end of the day,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nwhat we bring is these values,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nand these values create a soul for the companies we work with.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nAnd it's especially rewarding when your design work\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nbecomes a creative endeavor,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nwhen others can be creative and do more with it.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nHere's another project,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nwhich I think really emulates that.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nThis is the One Laptop per Child, the $100 laptop.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nThis picture is incredible.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nIn Nigeria, people carry their most precious belongings on their heads.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nThis girl is going to school with a laptop on her head.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nI mean, to me, it just means so much.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nBut when Nicholas Negroponte --\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nand he has spoken about this project a lot,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nhe's the founder of OLPC -- came to us\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nabout two and a half years ago,\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nthere were some clear ideas.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nHe wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nand those are pillars of his life,\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nbut also pillars of the mission of One Laptop per Child.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nBut the third pillar that he talked about was design.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nAnd at the time, I wasn't really working on computers.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nI didn't really want to, from the previous adventure.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nBut what he said was really significant,\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nis that design was going to be why the kids\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nwere going to love this product,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nhow we were going to make it low cost, robust.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nAnd plus, he said he was going to get rid of the Caps Lock key --\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\n(Laughter) --\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nand the Num Lock key, too.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nSo, I was convinced. We designed it to be iconic,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nto look different. To look like it's for a kid, but not like a toy.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nAnd then the integration of\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nall these great technologies, which you've heard about,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nthe Wi-Fi antennas that allow the kids to connect;\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nthe screen, which you can read in sunlight;\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nthe keyboard, which is made out of rubber,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nand it's protected from the environment.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nYou know, all these great technologies really happened\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nbecause of the passion and\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nthe OLPC people and the engineers.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nThey fought the suppliers,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nthey fought the manufacturers.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nI mean, they fought like animals\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nfor this to remain they way it is.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nAnd in a way, it is that will that makes projects like this one --\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nallows the process\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nfrom not destroying the original idea.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nAnd I think this is something really important.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nSo, now you get these pictures --\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nyou get up in the morning, and you see the kids in Nigeria\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nand you see them in Uruguay\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nwith their computers, and in Mongolia.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nAnd we went away from obviously the beige.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nI mean it's colorful, it's fun.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nIn fact, you can see each logo is a little bit different.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nIt's because we were able\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nto run, during the manufacturing process,\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:37.958\n20 colors for the X and the O,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nwhich is the name of the computer,\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nand by mixing them on the manufacturing floor,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nyou get 20 times 20: you get\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\n400 different options there.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nSo, the lessons from seeing the kids\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nusing them in the developing world are incredible.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nBut this is my nephew, Anthony, in Switzerland,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nand he had the laptop for an afternoon,\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nand I had to take it back. It was hard.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:03.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nAnd it was a prototype. And a month and a half later,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nI come back to Switzerland,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nand there he is playing with his own version.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nLike paper, paper and cardboard.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nSo, I'm going to finish with one last project,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nand this is a little bit more of adult play.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:29.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nSome of you might have heard about the New York City condom.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nIt's actually just launched, actually launched on Valentine's Day,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nFebruary 14, about 10 days ago.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nSo, the Department of Health in New York came to us,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nand they needed a way to distribute\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:55.958\n36 million condoms for free to the citizens of New York.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nSo a pretty big endeavor, and we worked on the dispensers.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nThese are the dispensers. There's this friendly shape.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nIt's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nand it has to be easily serviceable:\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nyou have to know where it is and what it does.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nAnd we also designed the condoms themselves.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nAnd I was just in New York at the launch,\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nand I went to see all these places where they're installed:\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nthis is at a Puerto Rican little mom-and-pop store;\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nat a bar in Christopher Street; at a pool hall.\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nI mean, they're being installed in homeless clinics -- everywhere.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nOf course, clubs and discos, too.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nAnd here's the public service announcement for this project.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:58.958\n(Music)\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nGet some.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:08.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nSo, this is really where design\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nis able to create a conversation.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nI was in these venues, and people were,\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nyou know, really into getting them. They were excited.\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nIt was breaking the ice,\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nit was getting over a stigma,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nand I think that's also what design can do.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nSo, I was going to\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nthrow some condoms in the room and whatnot,\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nbut I'm not sure it's the etiquette here.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:40.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nYeah? All right, all right. I have only a few.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nSo, I have more, you can always ask me for some more later.\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nAnd if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom,\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nyou can just say you like the design.\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nSo, I'll finish with just one thought:\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nif we all work together on creating value,\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nbut if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do,\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nI think we can change the work that we do.\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nWe can change these values, can change the companies we work with,\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nand eventually, together, maybe we can change the world.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:30.958\nSo, thank you.\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:37.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Moving sculpture", "duration": "944", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/arthur_ganson_makes_moving_sculpture", "transcript": "A few words about how I got started, and it has a lot to do with happiness, actually. When I was a very young child, I was extremely introverted and very much to myself. And, kind of as a way of surviving, I would go into my own very personal space, and I would make things. I would make things for people as a way of, you know, giving, showing them my love. I would go into these private places, and I would put my ideas and my passions into objects \u2014 and sort of learning how to speak with my hands. So, the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects is very much connected with not only the idea realm, but also with very much the feeling realm. And the ideas are very disparate.I'm going to show you many different kinds of pieces, and there's no real connection between one or the other, except that they sort of come out of my brain, and they're all different sort of thoughts that are triggered by looking at life, and seeing nature and seeing objects, and just having kind of playful random thoughts about things.When I was a child, I started to explore motion. I fell in love with the way things moved, so I started to explore motion by making little flipbooks. And this is one that I did, probably like when I was around seventh grade, and I remember when I was doing this, I was thinking about that little rock there, and the pathway of the vehicles as they would fly through the air, and how the characters \u2014(Laughter) \u2014would come shooting out of the car, so, on my mind, I was thinking about the trajectory of the vehicles. And of course, when you're a little kid, there's always destruction. So, it has to end with this \u2014(Laughter) \u2014gratuitous violence.(Laughter)So that was how I first started to explore the way things moved, and expressed it.Now, when I went to college, I found myself making fairly complicated, fragile machines. And this really came about from having many different kinds of interests. When I was in high school, I loved to program computers, so I sort of liked the logical flow of events. I was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery and becoming a surgeon, because it meant working with my hands in a very focused, intense way. So, I started taking art courses, and I found a way to make sculpture that brought together my love for being very precise with my hands, with coming up with different kinds of logical flows of energy through a system. And also, working with wire \u2014 everything that I did was both a visual and a mechanical engineering decision at the same time. So, I was able to sort of exercise all of that.Now, this kind of machine is as close as I can get to painting. And it's full of many little trivial end points, like there's a little foot here that just drags around in circles and it doesn't really mean anything. It's really just for the sort of joy of its own triviality. The connection I have with engineering is the same as any other engineer, in that I love to solve problems. I love to figure things out, but the end result of what I'm doing is really completely ambiguous.(Laughter)That's pretty ambiguous.(Laughter)The next piece that is going to come up is an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex. I gave myself the problem. Since I'm always liking to solve problems, I gave myself the problem of turning a crank in one direction, and solving all of the mechanical problems for getting this little man to walk back and forth. So, when I started this, I didn't have an overall plan for the machine, but I did have a sense of the gesture, and a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space. And then it was a matter of starting from one point and sort of building to that final point. That little gear there switches back and forth to change direction. And that's a little found object.So a lot of the pieces that I've made, they involve found objects. And it really \u2014 it's almost like doing visual puns all the time. When I see objects, I imagine them in motion. I imagine what can be said with them.This next one here, \"Machine with Wishbone,\" it came about from playing with this wishbone after dinner. You know, they say, never play with your food \u2014 but I always play with things. So, I had this wishbone, and I thought, it's kind of like a cowboy who's been on his horse for too long.(Laughter)And I started to make him walk across the table, and I thought, \"Oh, I can make a little machine that will do that.\" So, I made this device, linked it up, and the wishbone walks. And because the wishbone is bone \u2014 it's animal \u2014 it's sort of a point where I think we can enter into it. And that's the whole piece.(Laughter)That's about that big.(Applause)This kind of work is also very much like puppetry, where the found object is, in a sense, the puppet, and I'm the puppeteer at first, because I'm playing with an object. But then I make the machine, which is sort of the stand-in for me, and it is able to achieve the action that I want.The next piece I'll show you is a much more conceptual thought, and it's a little piece called \"Cory's Yellow Chair.\" I had this image in my mind, when I saw my son's little chair, and I saw it explode up and out. And \u2014 so the way I saw this in my mind at first, was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed, and the pieces would move far out, and then they would begin to be pulled back with a kind of a gravitational feel, to the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center. And they would coalesce for just a moment, so you could perceive that there was a chair there. For me, it's kind of a feeling about the fleetingness of the present moment, and I wanted to express that. Now, the machine is \u2014 in this case, it's a real approximation of that, because obviously you can't move physical matter infinitely with infinite speed and have it stop instantaneously. This whole thing is about four feet wide, and the chair itself is only about a few inches.(Applause)Now, this is a funny sort of conceptual thing, and yesterday we were talking about Danny Hillis' \"10,000 Year Clock.\" So, we have a motor here on the left, and it goes through a gear train. There are 12 pairs of 50:1 reductions, so that means that the final speed of that gear on the end is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once. So I've invented it in concrete, because it doesn't really matter.(Laughter)Because it could run all the time.(Laughter)Now, a completely different thought. I'm always imagining myself in different situations. I'm imagining myself as a machine. What would I love? I would love to be bathed in oil.(Laughter)So, this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in oil.(Laughter)(Applause)And it's really, just sort of \u2014 for me, it was just really about the lusciousness of oil.(Laughter)And then, I got a call from a friend who wanted to have a show of erotic art, and I didn't have any pieces. But when she suggested to be in the show, this piece came to mind. So, it's sort of related, but you can see it's much more overtly erotic. And this one I call \"Machine with Grease.\" It's just continually ejaculating, and it's \u2014(Laughter) \u2014this is a happy machine, I'll tell you.(Laughter)It's definitely happy.From an engineering point of view, this is just a little four-bar linkage. And then again, this is a found object, a little fan that I found. And I thought, what about the gesture of opening the fan, and how simply could I state something. And, in a case like this, I'm trying to make something which is clear but also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or plant.For me, the process is very important, because I'm inventing machines, but I'm also inventing tools to make machines, and the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning. So this is a little wire-bending tool. After many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers, I made that tool, and then I made this other tool for sort of centering gears very quickly \u2014 sort of developing my own little world of technology. My life completely changed when I found a spot welder.(Laughter)And that was that tool. It completely changed what I could do. Now here, I'm going to do a very poor job of silver soldering. This is not the way they teach you to silver solder when you're in school. I just like, throw it in. I mean, real jewelers put little bits of solder in. So, that's a finished gear.When I moved to Boston, I joined a group called the World Sculpture Racing Society.(Laughter)And the idea, their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street, and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best. It would be \u2014 whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner.(Laughter)So I made \u2014 this is my first racing sculpture, and I thought, \"Oh, I'm going to make a cart, and I'm going to have it \u2014 I'm going to have my hand writing 'faster,' so as I run down the street, the cart's going to talk to me and it's going to go, 'Faster, faster!' \" So, that's what it does.(Laughter)But then in the end, what I decided was every time you finish writing the word, I would stop and I would give the card to somebody on the side of the road. So I would never win the race because I'm always stopping. But I had a lot of fun.(Applause)Now, I only have two and a half minutes \u2014 I'm going to play this. This is a piece that, for me, is in some ways the most complete kind of piece. Because when I was a kid, I also played a lot of guitar. And when I had this thought, I was imagining that I would make \u2014 I would have a whole machine theater evening, where I would \u2014 you would have an audience, the curtain would open, and you'd be entertained by machines on stage. So, I imagined a very simple gestural dance that would be between a machine and just a very simple chair, and ... When I'm making these pieces, I'm always trying to find a point where I'm saying something very clearly and it's very simple, but also at the same time it's very ambiguous. And I think there's a point between simplicity and ambiguity which can allow a viewer to perhaps take something from it.And that leads me to the thought that all of these pieces start off in my own mind, in my heart, and I do my best at finding ways to express them with materials, and it always feels really crude. It's always a struggle, but somehow I manage to sort of get this thought out into an object, and then it's there, OK. It means nothing at all. The object itself just means nothing. Once it's perceived, and someone brings it into their own mind, then there's a cycle that has been completed. And to me, that's the most important thing because, ever since being a kid, I've wanted to communicate my passion and love. And that means the complete cycle of coming from inside, out to the physical, to someone perceiving it. So I'll just let this chair come down.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 267, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nA few words

came about from playing with this wishbone after dinner.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nYou know, they say, never play with your food --\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nbut I always play with things.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nSo, I had this wishbone, and I thought,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nit's kind of like a cowboy who's been on his horse for too long.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:05:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nAnd I started to make him walk across the table,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nand I thought, \"Oh, I can make a little machine that will do that.\"\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nSo, I made this device, linked it up, and the wishbone walks.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nAnd because the wishbone is bone -- it's animal --\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nit's sort of a point where I think we can enter into it.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nAnd that's the whole piece.\n\n00:06:24.958 -->

like puppetry,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nwhere the found object is, in a sense, the puppet,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nand I'm the puppeteer at first, because I'm playing with an

want.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nThe next piece I'll show you is a much more conceptual thought,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nand it's a little piece called \"Cory's Yellow Chair.\"\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nI had this image in my mind, when I saw my son's little chair,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nand I saw it explode up and out.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nAnd --\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nso the way I saw this in my mind at first,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nwas that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nand the pieces would move far out,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nand then they would begin to be pulled back\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nwith a kind of a gravitational feel,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nto the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nAnd they would coalesce for just a moment,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nso you could perceive that there was a chair there.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nFor me, it's kind of a feeling about the fleetingness of the present moment,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nand I wanted to express that.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nNow, the machine is -- in this case, it's a real approximation of that,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nbecause obviously you can't move physical matter\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:04.958\ninfinitely with infinite speed and have it stop instantaneously.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nThis whole thing is about four feet wide,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nand the chair itself is only about a few inches.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:16.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nNow, this is a funny sort of conceptual thing,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nand yesterday we were talking about Danny Hillis' \"10,000 Year Clock.\"\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nSo, we have a motor here on the left,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nand it goes through a gear train.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nThere are 12 pairs of 50:1 reductions,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nso that means that the final speed of that gear on the end\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nis so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nSo I've invented it in concrete, because it doesn't really matter.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nBecause it could run all the time.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nNow, a completely different thought.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nI'm always imagining myself in different situations.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nI'm imagining myself as a machine.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nWhat would I love?\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nI would love to be bathed in oil.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nSo, this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in oil.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:16.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nAnd it's really, just sort of --\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nfor me, it was just really about the lusciousness of oil.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nAnd then, I got a call from a friend\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nwho wanted to have a show of erotic art,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nand I didn't have any pieces.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nBut when she suggested to be in the show, this piece came to mind.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nSo, it's sort of related, but you can see it's much more overtly erotic.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nAnd this one I call \"Machine with Grease.\"\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nIt's just continually ejaculating, and it's --\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:47.958\n(Laughter) --\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nthis is a happy machine, I'll tell you.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nIt's definitely happy.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nFrom an engineering point of view,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nthis is just a little four-bar linkage.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nAnd then again, this is a found object, a little fan that I found.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nAnd I thought, what about the gesture of opening the fan,\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nand how simply could I state something.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nAnd, in a case like this, I'm trying to make something which is clear\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nbut also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or plant.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nFor me, the process is very important,\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nbecause I'm inventing machines,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nbut I'm also inventing tools to make machines,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nand the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nSo this is a little wire-bending tool.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nAfter many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nI made that tool, and then I made this other tool\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nfor sort of centering gears very quickly --\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nsort of developing my own little world of technology.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nMy life completely changed when I found a spot welder.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nAnd that was that tool.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nIt completely changed what I could do.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nNow here, I'm going to do a very poor job of silver soldering.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nThis is not the way they teach you to silver solder when you're in school.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nI just like, throw it in.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nI mean, real jewelers put little bits of solder in.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nSo, that's a finished gear.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nWhen I moved to Boston,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nI joined a group called the World Sculpture Racing Society.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nAnd the idea, their premise was that we wanted to show\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\npieces of sculpture on the street,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nand there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nIt would be -- whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:49.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nSo I made -- this is my first racing sculpture,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nand I thought, \"Oh, I'm going to make a cart,\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nand I'm going to have it --\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nI'm going to have my hand writing 'faster,'\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nso as I run down the street, the cart's going to talk to me\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nand it's going to go, 'Faster, faster!' \"\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nSo, that's what it does.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nBut then in the end, what I decided\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nwas every time you finish writing the word,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nI would stop and I would give the card to somebody on the side of the road.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nSo I would never win the race because I'm always stopping.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nBut I had a lot of fun.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:32.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nNow, I only have two and a half minutes -- I'm going to play this.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nThis is a piece that, for me, is in some ways\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nthe most complete kind of piece.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nBecause when I was a kid, I also played a lot of guitar.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nAnd when I had this thought,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nI was imagining that I would make --\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nI would have a whole machine theater evening,\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nwhere I would -- you would have an audience,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nthe curtain would open, and you'd be entertained by machines on stage.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nSo, I imagined a very simple gestural dance\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nthat would be between a machine and just a very simple chair, and ...\n\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nWhen I'm making these pieces, I'm always trying to find a point\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nwhere I'm saying something very clearly and it's very simple,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nbut also at the same time it's very ambiguous.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nAnd I think there's a point between simplicity and ambiguity\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nwhich can allow a viewer to perhaps take something from it.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nAnd that leads me to the thought that all of these pieces\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nstart off in my own mind, in my heart,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nand I do my best at finding ways to express them with materials,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nand it always feels really crude.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nIt's always a struggle,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nbut somehow I manage to sort of get this thought\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nout into an object, and then it's there, OK.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nIt means nothing at all.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nThe object itself just means nothing.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nOnce it's perceived, and someone brings it into their own mind,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nthen there's a cycle that has been completed.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nAnd to me, that's the most important thing\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nbecause, ever since being a kid, I've wanted to communicate my passion and love.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nAnd that means the complete cycle of coming from inside,\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nout to the physical, to someone perceiving it.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nSo I'll just let this chair come down.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:27.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nThank you.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A hospital tour in Nigeria", "duration": "863", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/dr_seyi_oyesola_tours_a_hospital_in_nigeria", "transcript": "Just to put everything in context, and to kind of give you a background to where I'm coming from, so that a lot of the things I'm going to say, and the things I'm going to do \u2014 or things I'm going to tell you I've done \u2014 you will understand exactly why and how I got motivated to be where I am. I graduated high school in Cleveland, Ohio, 1975. And just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad, we went back home. Finished university education, got a medical degree, 1986. And by the time I was an intern house officer, I could barely afford to maintain my mother's 13-year-old car \u2014 and I was a paid doctor. This brings us to why a lot of us, who are professionals, are now, as they say, in diaspora. Now, are we going to make that a permanent thing, where we all get trained, and we leave, and we don't go back? Perhaps not, I should certainly hope not \u2014 because that is not my vision.All right, for good measure, that's where Nigeria is on the African map, and just there is the Delta region that I'm sure everybody's heard of. People getting kidnapped, where the oil comes from, the oil that sometimes I think has driven us all crazy in Nigeria. But, critical poverty: this slide is from a presentation I gave not that long ago. Gapminder.org tells the story of the gap between Africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care. Very interesting.How many people do you think are on that taxi? And believe it or not, that is a taxi in Nigeria. And the capital \u2014 well, what used to be the capital of Nigeria \u2014 Lagos, that's a taxi, and you have police on them. So, tell me, how many policemen do you think are on this taxi? And now? Three. So, when these kind of people \u2014 and, believe me, it's not just the police that use these taxis in Lagos. We all do. I've been on one of these, and I didn't have a helmet, either. And it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us on a taxi like this falls off, has an accident and needs a hospital.Believe it or not, some of us do survive. Some of us do survive malaria; we do survive AIDS. And like I tell my family, and my wife reminds me every time, \"You're risking your life, you know, every time you go to that country.\" And she's right. Every time you go there, you know that if you actually need critical care \u2014 critical care of any sort \u2014 if you have an accident \u2014 of which there are many, there are accidents everywhere \u2014 where do they go? Where do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff? I'm not saying instead of, I'm saying as well as, AIDS, TB, malaria, typhoid \u2014 the list goes on. I'm saying, where do they go when they're like me? When I go back home \u2014 and I do all kinds of things, I teach, I train \u2014 but I catch one of these things, or I'm chronically ill with one of those, where do they go? What's the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled?I think it's quite significant. This is where they go. These are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden \u2014 this is a major hospital. In fact, it's from a major teaching hospital in Nigeria. Now that is less than a year old, in an operating room. That's sterilizing equipment in Nigeria. You remember all that oil? Yes, I'm sorry if it upsets some of you, but I think you need to see this. That's the floor, OK? You can say some of this is education. You can say it's hygiene. I'm not pleading poverty. I'm saying we need more than just, you know, vaccination, malaria, AIDS, because I want to be treated in a proper hospital if something happens to me out there. In fact, when I start running around saying, \"Hey, boys and girls, you're cardiologists in the U.S., can you come home with me and do a mission?\" I want them to think, \"Well there's some hope.\"Now, have a look at that. That's the anesthesiology machine. And that's my specialty, right? Anesthesiology and critical care \u2014 look at that bag. It's been taped with tape that we even stopped using in the U.K. And believe me, these are current pictures. Now, if something like this, which has happened in the U.K., that's where they go. This is the intensive care unit in which I work.All right, this is a slide from a talk I gave about intensive care units in Nigeria, and jokingly we refer to it as \"Expensive Scare.\" Because it's scary and it's expensive, but we need to have it, OK? So, these are the problems. There are no prizes for telling us what the problems are, are there? I think we all know. And several speakers before and speakers after me are going to tell us even more problems. These are a few of them. So, what did I do?There we go \u2014 we're going on a mission. We're going to do some open-heart surgery. I was the only Brit, on a team of about nine American cardiac surgeons, cardiac nurse, intensive care nurse. We all went out and did a mission and we've done three of them so far. Just so you know, I do believe in missions, I do believe in aid and I do believe in charity. They have their place, but where do they go for those things we talked about earlier? Because it's not everyone that's going to benefit from a mission. Health is wealth, in the words of Hans Rosling. You get wealthier faster if you are healthy first.So, here we are, mission. Big trouble. Open-heart surgery in Nigeria \u2014 big trouble. That's Mike, Mike comes out from Mississippi. Does he look like he's happy? It took us two days just to organize the place, but hey, you know, we worked on it. Does he look happy? Yes, that's the medical advice the committee chairman says, \"Yes, I told you, you weren't going to be able to, you can't do this, I just know it.\" Look, that's the technician we had. So yes, you go on, all right?(Laughter)I got him to come with me \u2014 anesthesia tech \u2014 come with me from the U.K. Yes, let's just go work this thing out. See, that's one of the problems we have in Nigeria and in Africa generally. We get a lot of donated equipment. Equipment that's obsolete, equipment that doesn't quite work, or it works and you can't fix it. And there's nothing wrong with that, so long as we use it and we move on.But we had problems with it. We had severe problems there. He had to get on the phone. This guy was always on the phone. So what we going to do now? It looks like all these Americans are here and yes, one Brit, and he's not going to do anything \u2014 he thinks he's British actually, and he's actually Nigerian, I just thought about that. We eventually got it working, is the truth, but it was one of these. Even older than the one you saw.The reason I have this picture here, this X-ray, it's just to tell you where and how we were viewing X-rays. Do you figure where that is? It was on a window. I mean, what's an X-ray viewing box? Please. Well, nowadays everything's on PAX anyway. You look at your X-rays on a screen and you do stuff with them, you email them. But we were still using X-rays, but we didn't even have a viewing box! And we were doing open-heart surgery.OK, I know it's not AIDS, I know it's not malaria, but we still need this stuff. Oh yeah, echo \u2014 this was just to get the children ready and the adults ready. People still believe in Voodoo. Heart disease, VSD, hole in the heart, tetralogies. You still get people who believe in it and they came. At 67 percent oxygen saturation, the normal is about 97. Her condition, open-heart surgery that as she required, would have been treated when she was a child. We had to do these for adults. So, we did succeed and we still do. We've done three. We're planning another one in July in the north of the country. So, we certainly still do open-heart, but you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in \u2014 we ship everything, instruments. We had explosions because the kit was designed and installed by people who weren't used to it. The oxygen tanks didn't quite work right.But how many did we do the first one? 12. We did 12 open-heart surgical patients successfully. Here is our very first patient, out of intensive care, and just watch that chair, all right? This is what I mean about appropriate technology. That's what he was doing, propping up the bed because the bed simply didn't work. Have you seen one of those before? No? Yes? Doesn't matter, it worked. I'm sure you've all seen or heard this before: \"We, the willing, have been doing so much with so little for so long \u2014(Applause) \u2014 we are now qualified to do anything with nothing.\"(Applause)Thank you. Sustainable Solutions \u2014 this was my first company. This one's sole aim is to provide the very things that I think are missing. So, we put my hand in my pocket and say, \"Guys, let's just buy stuff. Let's go set up a company that teaches people, educates them, gives them the tools they need to keep going.\"And that's a perfect example of one. Usually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital, you buy a different one for children, you buy a different one for transport. This one will do everything, and it will do it at half the price and doesn't need compressed air. If you're in America and you don't know about this one, we do, because we make it our duty to find out what's appropriate technology for Africa \u2014 what's appropriately priced, does the job, and we move on. Anesthesia machine: multi-parameter monitor, operating lights, suction. This little unit here \u2014 remember your little 12-volt plug in the car, that charges your, whatever, Game Boy, telephone? That's exactly how the outlets are designed. Yes, it will take a solar panel. Yes a solar panel will charge it. But if you've got mains as well, it will charge the batteries in there. And guess what? We have a little pedal charger too, just in case. And guess what, if it all fails, if you can find a car that's still got a live battery and you stick it in, it will still work. Then you can customize it. Is it dental surgery you want? General surgery you want? Decide which instruments, stock it up with consumables.And currently we're working on oxygen \u2014 oxygen delivery on-site. The technology for oxygen delivery is not new. Oxygen concentrators are very old technology. What is new, and what we will have in a few months, I hope, is that ability to use this same renewable energy system to provide and produce oxygen on site. Zeolite \u2014 it's not new \u2014 zeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is 78 percent of air. If you take nitrogen out, what's left? Oxygen, pretty much. So that's not new. What we're doing is applying this technology to it.These are the basic features of my device, or our device. This is what makes it so special. Apart from the awards it's won, it's portable and it's certified. It's registered, the MHRA \u2014 and the CE mark, for those who don't know, for Europe, is the equivalent of the FDA in the U.S. If you compare it with what's on the market, price-wise, size-wise, ease of use, complexity ...This picture was taken last year. These are members of my graduating class, 1986. It was in this gentleman's house in the Potomac, for those of you who are familiar with Maryland. There are too many of us outside and everybody, just to borrow a bit from Hans \u2014 Hans Rosling, he's my guy \u2014 if the size of the text represents what gets the most attention, it's the problems. But what we really need are African solutions that are appropriate for Africa \u2014 looking at the culture, looking at the people, looking at how much money they've got. African people, because they will do it with a passion, I hope. And lots and lots of that little bit down there, sacrifice. You have to do it. Africans have to do it, in conjunction with everyone else.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 268, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nJust to put everything in context,\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nand to kind of give you a background to where I'm coming from,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nso that a lot of the things I'm going to say,\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nand the things I'm going to do --\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nor things I'm going to tell you I've done --\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nyou will understand exactly why and how I got motivated to be where I am.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nI graduated high school in Cleveland, Ohio, 1975.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nAnd just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad, we went back home.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nFinished university education, got a medical degree, 1986.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nAnd by the time I was an intern house officer,\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nI could barely afford to maintain my mother's 13-year-old car --\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nand I was a paid doctor.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nThis brings us to why a lot of us, who are professionals,\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nare now, as they say, in diaspora.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nNow, are we going to make that a permanent thing,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nwhere we all get trained, and we leave, and we don't go back?\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nPerhaps not, I should certainly hope not --\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nbecause that is not my vision.\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nAll right, for good measure, that's where Nigeria is on the African map,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nand just there is the Delta region that I'm sure everybody's heard of.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nPeople getting kidnapped, where the oil comes from,\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nthe oil that sometimes I think has driven us all crazy in Nigeria.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nBut, critical poverty: this slide is from a presentation I gave\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nnot that long ago. Gapminder.org tells the story of the gap\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nbetween Africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nVery interesting.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nHow many people do you think are on that taxi?\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nAnd believe it or not, that is a taxi in Nigeria.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nAnd the capital -- well, what used to be the capital of Nigeria -- Lagos,\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nthat's a taxi, and you have police on them.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nSo, tell me, how many policemen do you think are on this taxi? And now? Three.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nSo, when these kind of people -- and, believe me, it's not just the police\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nthat use these taxis in Lagos. We all do. I've been on one of these,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nand I didn't have a helmet, either.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nAnd it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:48.958\non a taxi like this falls off, has an accident and needs a hospital.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nBelieve it or not, some of us do survive.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nSome of us do survive malaria; we do survive AIDS.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nAnd like I tell my family, and my wife reminds me every time,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:04.958\n\"You're risking your life, you know, every time you go to that country.\"\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nAnd she's right. Every time you go there,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nyou know that if you actually need critical care --\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\ncritical care of any sort -- if you have an accident --\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nof which there are many, there are accidents everywhere --\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nwhere do they go?\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nWhere do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff?\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nI'm not saying instead of, I'm saying as well as,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAIDS, TB, malaria, typhoid -- the list goes on.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nI'm saying, where do they go when they're like me?\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nWhen I go back home -- and I do all kinds of things,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nI teach, I train -- but I catch one of these things,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nor I'm chronically ill with one of those, where do they go?\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nWhat's the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled?\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nI think it's quite significant. This is where they go.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nThese are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden --\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nthis is a major hospital. In fact, it's from a major teaching hospital in Nigeria.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nNow that is less than a year old, in an operating room.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nThat's sterilizing equipment in Nigeria.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nYou remember all that oil?\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nYes, I'm sorry if it upsets some of you, but\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nI think you need to see this. That's the floor, OK?\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nYou can say some of this is education.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nYou can say it's hygiene. I'm not pleading poverty.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nI'm saying we need more than just, you know, vaccination,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nmalaria, AIDS, because I want to be treated\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nin a proper hospital if something happens to me out there.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nIn fact, when I start running around saying,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\n\"Hey, boys and girls, you're cardiologists in the U.S.,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\ncan you come home with me and do a mission?\"\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nI want them to think, \"Well there's some hope.\"\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nNow, have a look at that. That's the anesthesiology machine.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nAnd that's my specialty, right?\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nAnesthesiology and critical care -- look at that bag.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nIt's been taped with tape that we even stopped using in the U.K.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nAnd believe me, these are current pictures.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nNow, if something like this, which has happened in the U.K.,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nthat's where they go. This is the intensive care unit in which I work.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nAll right, this is a slide from a talk I gave\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nabout intensive care units in Nigeria,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nand jokingly we refer to it as \"Expensive Scare.\"\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nBecause it's scary and it's expensive, but we need to have it, OK?\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nSo, these are the problems.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nThere are no prizes for telling us what the problems are, are there?\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nI think we all know. And several speakers before\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nand speakers after me are going to tell us even more problems.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nThese are a few of them. So, what did I do?\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nThere we go -- we're going on a mission.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nWe're going to do some open-heart surgery. I was the only Brit,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:17.958\non a team of about nine American cardiac surgeons,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\ncardiac nurse, intensive care nurse.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nWe all went out and did a mission and we've done three of them so far.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nJust so you know, I do believe in missions, I do believe in aid\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nand I do believe in charity. They have their place,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nbut where do they go for those things we talked about earlier?\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nBecause it's not everyone that's going to benefit from a mission.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nHealth is wealth, in the words of Hans Rosling.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nYou get wealthier faster if you are healthy first.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nSo, here we are, mission. Big trouble.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nOpen-heart surgery in Nigeria -- big trouble.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nThat's Mike, Mike comes out from Mississippi.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nDoes he look like he's happy?\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nIt took us two days just to organize the place, but hey,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nyou know, we worked on it. Does he look happy?\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nYes, that's the medical advice the committee chairman says,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\n\"Yes, I told you, you weren't going to be able to,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nyou can't do this, I just know it.\"\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nLook, that's the technician we had. So yes, you go on, all right?\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nI got him to come with me -- anesthesia tech -- come with me from the U.K.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nYes, let's just go work this thing out.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nSee, that's one of the problems we have in Nigeria and in Africa generally.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nWe get a lot of donated equipment.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nEquipment that's obsolete, equipment that doesn't quite work,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nor it works and you can't fix it. And there's nothing wrong with that,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nso long as we use it and we move on.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nBut we had problems with it. We had severe problems there.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nHe had to get on the phone. This guy was always on the phone.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nSo what we going to do now?\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nIt looks like all these Americans are here and\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nyes, one Brit, and he's not going to do anything --\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nhe thinks he's British actually, and he's actually Nigerian,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nI just thought about that.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nWe eventually got it working, is the truth,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nbut it was one of these. Even older than the one you saw.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nThe reason I have this picture here, this X-ray,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nit's just to tell you where and how we were viewing X-rays.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nDo you figure where that is? It was on a window.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nI mean, what's an X-ray viewing box? Please.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nWell, nowadays everything's on PAX anyway.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nYou look at your X-rays on a screen and you do stuff with them,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nyou email them. But we were still using X-rays,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nbut we didn't even have a viewing box!\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nAnd we were doing open-heart surgery.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nOK, I know it's not AIDS, I know it's not malaria,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nbut we still need this stuff. Oh yeah, echo --\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nthis was just to get the children ready and the adults ready.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nPeople still believe in Voodoo. Heart disease,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nVSD, hole in the heart, tetralogies.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nYou still get people who believe in it and they came.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nAt 67 percent oxygen saturation, the normal is about 97.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nHer condition, open-heart surgery that as she required,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nwould have been treated when she was a child.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nWe had to do these for adults. So, we did succeed and we still do.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nWe've done three. We're planning another one in July\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nin the north of the country. So, we certainly still do open-heart,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nbut you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in --\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nwe ship everything, instruments. We had explosions\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nbecause the kit was designed and installed by people who weren't used to it.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nThe oxygen tanks didn't quite work right.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nBut how many did we do the first one? 12.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nWe did 12 open-heart surgical patients successfully.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nHere is our very first patient, out of intensive care,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nand just watch that chair, all right?\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nThis is what I mean about appropriate technology.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nThat's what he was doing, propping up the bed because the bed simply didn't work.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nHave you seen one of those before?\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nNo? Yes? Doesn't matter, it worked.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nI'm sure you've all seen or heard this before:\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:17.958\n\"We, the willing, have been doing so much with so little for so long --\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:18.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:22.958\n-- we are now qualified to do anything with nothing.\"\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nThank you. Sustainable Solutions -- this was my first company.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nThis one's sole aim is to provide the very things that I think are missing.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nSo, we put my hand in my pocket and say, \"Guys, let's just buy stuff.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nLet's go set up a company that teaches people, educates them,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\ngives them the tools they need to keep going.\"\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nAnd that's a perfect example of one.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nUsually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nyou buy a different one for children,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nyou buy a different one for transport. This one will do everything,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nand it will do it at half the price and doesn't need compressed air.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nIf you're in America and you don't know about this one, we do,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nbecause we make it our duty to find out\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nwhat's appropriate technology for Africa -- what's appropriately priced,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:13.958\ndoes the job, and we move on. Anesthesia machine:\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nmulti-parameter monitor, operating lights, suction.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nThis little unit here -- remember your little 12-volt plug in the car,\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nthat charges your, whatever, Game Boy, telephone?\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nThat's exactly how the outlets are designed.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nYes, it will take a solar panel. Yes a solar panel will charge it.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nBut if you've got mains as well, it will charge the batteries in there.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nAnd guess what? We have a little pedal charger too, just in case.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nAnd guess what, if it all fails,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nif you can find a car that's still got a live battery\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nand you stick it in, it will still work. Then you can customize it.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nIs it dental surgery you want? General surgery you want?\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nDecide which instruments, stock it up with consumables.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nAnd currently we're working on oxygen -- oxygen delivery on-site.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nThe technology for oxygen delivery is not new.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nOxygen concentrators are very old technology. What is new,\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nand what we will have in a few months, I hope,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nis that ability to use this same renewable energy system\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nto provide and produce oxygen on site. Zeolite -- it's not new --\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nzeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is 78 percent of air.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nIf you take nitrogen out, what's left? Oxygen, pretty much.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nSo that's not new. What we're doing is applying this technology to it.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nThese are the basic features of my device, or our device.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nThis is what makes it so special.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nApart from the awards it's won,\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nit's portable and it's certified. It's registered, the MHRA --\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nand the CE mark, for those who don't know, for Europe, is the equivalent\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nof the FDA in the U.S.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nIf you compare it with what's on the market, price-wise,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nsize-wise, ease of use, complexity ...\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nThis picture was taken last year.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nThese are members of my graduating class, 1986.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nIt was in this gentleman's house in the Potomac,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nfor those of you who are familiar with Maryland.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nThere are too many of us outside and everybody,\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:40.958\njust to borrow a bit from Hans -- Hans Rosling, he's my guy --\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nif the size of the text represents what gets the most attention,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nit's the problems. But what we really need are African solutions\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nthat are appropriate for Africa -- looking at the culture,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nlooking at the people, looking at how much money they've got.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nAfrican people, because they will do it with a passion, I hope.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nAnd lots and lots of that little bit down there, sacrifice.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nYou have to do it. Africans have to do it,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nin conjunction with everyone else.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nThank you.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The \"bottom billion\"", "duration": "1011", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_collier_shares_4_ways_to_help_the_bottom_billion", "transcript": "So, can we dare to be optimistic? Well, the thesis of \"The Bottom Billion\" is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years, and hence diverging from the rest of mankind. And so, the real question to pose is not, \"Can we be optimistic?\" It's, \"How can we give credible hope to that billion people?\" That, to my mind, is the fundamental challenge now of development.What I'm going to offer you is a recipe, a combination of the two forces that changed the world for good, which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest. Compassion, because a billion people are living in societies that have not offered credible hope. That is a human tragedy. Enlightened self-interest, because if that economic divergence continues for another 40 years, combined with social integration globally, it will build a nightmare for our children. We need compassion to get ourselves started, and enlightened self-interest to get ourselves serious. That's the alliance that changes the world.So, what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion? What can we actually do? Well, a good guide is to think, \"What did we do last time the rich world got serious about developing another region of the world?\" That gives us, it turns out, quite a good clue, except you have to go back quite a long time. The last time the rich world got serious about developing another region was in the late 1940s. The rich world was you, America, and the region that needed to be developed was my world, Europe. That was post-War Europe.Why did America get serious? It wasn't just compassion for Europe, though there was that. It was that you knew you had to, because, in the late 1940s, country after country in Central Europe was falling into the Soviet bloc, and so you knew you'd no choice. Europe had to be dragged into economic development.So, what did you do, last time you got serious? Well, yes, you had a big aid program. Thank you very much. That was Marshall aid: we need to do it again. Aid is part of the solution. But what else did you do? Well, you tore up your trade policy, and totally reversed it. Before the war, America had been highly protectionist. After the war, you opened your markets to Europe, you dragged Europe into the then-global economy, which was your economy, and you institutionalized that trade liberalization through founding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. So, total reversal of trade policy.Did you do anything else? Yes, you totally reversed your security policy. Before the war, your security policy had been isolationist. After the war, you tear that up, you put 100,000 troops in Europe for over 40 years. So, total reversal of security policy. Anything else? Yes, you tear up the \"Eleventh Commandment\" \u2014 national sovereignty. Before the war, you treated national sovereignty as so sacrosanct that you weren't even willing to join the League of Nations. After the war, you found the United Nations, you found the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, you found the IMF, you encouraged Europe to create the European Community \u2014 all systems for mutual government support. That is still the waterfront of effective policies: aid, trade, security, governments. Of course, the details of policy are going to be different, because the challenge is different. It's not rebuilding Europe, it's reversing the divergence for the bottom billion, so that they actually catch up. Is that easier or harder? We need to be at least as serious as we were then.Now, today I'm going to take just one of those four. I'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest, the one that's just motherhood and apple pie \u2014 governments, mutual systems of support for governments \u2014 and I'm going to show you one idea in how we could do something to strengthen governance, and I'm going to show you that that is enormously important now. The opportunity we're going to look to is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion, and that is the commodity booms. The commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money into many, though not all, of the countries of the bottom billion. Partly, they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high, but it's not just that. There's also a range of new discoveries. Uganda has just discovered oil, in about the most disastrous location on Earth; Ghana has discovered oil; Guinea has got a huge new exploitation of iron ore coming out of the ground. So, a mass of new discoveries. Between them, these new revenue flows dwarf aid. Just to give you one example: Angola alone is getting 50 billion dollars a year in oil revenue. The entire aid flows to the 60 countries of the bottom billion last year were 34 billion. So, the flow of resources from the commodity booms to the bottom billion are without precedent. So there's the optimism.The question is, how is it going to help their development? It's a huge opportunity for transformational development. Will it be taken? So, here comes a bit of science, and this is a bit of science I've done since \"The Bottom Billion,\" so it's new. I've looked to see what is the relationship between higher commodity prices of exports, and the growth of commodity-exporting countries. And I've looked globally, I've taken all the countries in the world for the last 40 years, and looked to see what the relationship is. And the short run \u2014 say, the first five to seven years \u2014 is just great. In fact, it's hunky dory: everything goes up. You get more money because your terms of trade have improved, but also that drives up output across the board. So GDP goes up a lot \u2014 fantastic! That's the short run. And how about the long run? Come back 15 years later. Well, the short run, it's hunky dory, but the long run, it's humpty dumpty. You go up in the short run, but then most societies historically have ended up worse than if they'd had no booms at all. That is not a forecast about how commodity prices go; it's a forecast of the consequences, the long-term consequences, for growth of an increase in prices.So, what goes wrong? Why is there this \"resource curse,\" as it's called? And again, I've looked at that, and it turns out that the critical issue is the level of governance, the initial level of economic governance, when the resource booms accrue. In fact, if you've got good enough governance, there is no resource boom. You go up in the short term, and then you go up even more in the long term. That's Norway, the richest country in Europe. It's Australia. It's Canada. The resource curse is entirely confined to countries below a threshold of governance. They still go up in the short run. That's what we're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment. The best growth rates they've had \u2014 ever. And the question is whether the short run will persist. And with bad governance historically, over the last 40 years, it hasn't. It's countries like Nigeria, which are worse off than if they'd never had oil.So, there's a threshold level above which you go up in the long term, and below which you go down. Just to benchmark that threshold, it's about the governance level of Portugal in the mid 1980s. So, the question is, are the bottom billion above or below that threshold? Now, there's one big change since the commodity booms of the 1970s, and that is the spread of democracy. So I thought, well, maybe that is the thing which has transformed governance in the bottom billion. Maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy. So, I looked. Democracy does have significant effects \u2014 and unfortunately, they're adverse. Democracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies.At that stage I just wanted to abandon the research, but \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that. Because there are two distinct aspects of democracy: there's electoral competition, which determines how you acquire power, and there are checks and balances, which determine how you use power. It turns out that electoral competition is the thing that's doing the damage with democracy, whereas strong checks and balances make resource booms good. And so, what the countries of the bottom billion need is very strong checks and balances. They haven't got them. They got instant democracy in the 1990s: elections without checks and balances.How can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances? In all the societies of the bottom billion, there are intense struggles to do just that. The simple proposal is that we should have some international standards, which will be voluntary, but which would spell out the key decision points that need to be taken in order to harness these resource revenues. We know these international standards work because we've already got one. It's called the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. That is the very simple idea that governments should report to their citizens what revenues they have. No sooner was it proposed than reformers in Nigeria adopted it, pushed it and published the revenues in the paper. Nigerian newspapers circulations spiked. People wanted to know what their government was getting in terms of revenue.So, we know it works. What would the content be of these international standards? I can't go through all of them, but I'll give you an example. The first is how to take the resources out of the ground \u2014 the economic processes, taking the resources out of the ground and putting assets on top of the ground. And the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction. You know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment, how they've been sold over the last 40 years? A company flies in, does a deal with a minister. And that's great for the company, and it's quite often great for the minister \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 and it's not great for their country. There's a very simple institutional technology which can transform that, and it's called verified auctions. The public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth is of course the treasury \u2014 that is, the British Treasury. And the British Treasury decided that it would sell the rights to third-generation mobile phones by working out what those rights were worth. They worked out they were worth two billion pounds. Just in time, a set of economists got there and said, \"Why not try an auction? It'll reveal the value.\" It went for 20 billion pounds through auction. If the British Treasury can be out by a factor of 10, think what the ministry of finance in Sierra Leone is going to be like. (Laughter) When I put that to the President of Sierra Leone, the next day he asked the World Bank to send him a team to give expertise on how to conduct auctions.There are five such decision points; each one needs an international standard. If we could do it, we would change the world. We would be helping the reformers in these societies, who are struggling for change. That's our modest role. We cannot change these societies, but we can help the people in these societies who are struggling and usually failing, because the odds are so stacked against them. And yet, we've not got these rules. If you think about it, the cost of promulgating international rules is zilch \u2014 nothing. Why on Earth are they not there? I realized that the reason they're not there is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies, politicians will get away with gestures. That unless we have an informed society, what politicians do, especially in relation to Africa, is gestures: things that look good, but don't work. And so I realized we had to go through the business of building an informed citizenry.That's why I broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist, and I wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach. (Laughter). However, I have to say, the process of communication does not come naturally to me. This is why I'm on this stage, but it's alarming. I grew up in a culture of self-effacement. My wife showed me a blog comment on one of my last talks, and the blog comment said, \"Collier is not charismatic \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 but his arguments are compelling.\" (Laughter) (Applause) If you agree with that sentiment, and if you agree that we need a critical mass of informed citizenry, you will realize that I need you. Please, become ambassadors. Thank you.

Thank you very much.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nThat was Marshall aid: we need to do it again. Aid is part of the solution.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nBut what else did you do?\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nWell, you tore up your trade policy, and totally reversed it.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nBefore the war, America had been highly protectionist.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nAfter the war, you opened your markets to Europe,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nyou dragged Europe into the then-global economy, which was your economy,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nand you institutionalized that trade liberalization\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nthrough founding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nSo, total reversal of trade policy.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nDid you do anything else?\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nYes, you totally reversed your security policy.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nBefore the war, your security policy had been isolationist.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nAfter the war, you tear that up, you put 100,000 troops in Europe\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nfor over 40 years.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nSo, total reversal of security policy. Anything else?\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nYes, you tear up the \"Eleventh Commandment\" --\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nnational sovereignty.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nBefore the war, you treated national sovereignty as so sacrosanct\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nthat you weren't even willing to join the League of Nations.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nAfter the war, you found the United Nations,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nyou found the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nyou found the IMF, you encouraged Europe to create the European Community --\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nall systems for mutual government support.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nThat is still the waterfront of effective policies:\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:44.958\naid, trade, security, governments.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nOf course, the details of policy are going to be different,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nbecause the challenge is different.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nIt's not rebuilding Europe, it's reversing the divergence\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nfor the bottom billion, so that they actually catch up.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nIs that easier or harder?\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nWe need to be at least as serious as we were then.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nNow, today I'm going to take just one of those four.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nI'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nthe one that's just motherhood and apple pie --\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\ngovernments, mutual systems of support for governments --\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nand I'm going to show you one idea\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nin how we could do something to strengthen governance,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nand I'm going to show you that that is enormously important now.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nThe opportunity we're going to look to\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nis a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nand that is the commodity booms.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nThe commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:03.958\ninto many, though not all, of the countries of the bottom billion.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nPartly, they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nbut it's not just that. There's also a range of new discoveries.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nUganda has just discovered oil, in about the most disastrous location on Earth;\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nGhana has discovered oil;\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nGuinea has got a huge new exploitation of iron ore coming out of the ground.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nSo, a mass of new discoveries.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nBetween them, these new revenue flows dwarf aid.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nJust to give you one example:\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nAngola alone is getting 50 billion dollars a year in oil revenue.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nThe entire aid flows to the 60 countries of the bottom billion last year were 34 billion.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nSo, the flow of resources from the commodity booms\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nto the bottom billion are without precedent.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nSo there's the optimism.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nThe question is, how is it going to help their development?\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nIt's a huge opportunity for transformational development.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nWill it be taken?\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nSo, here comes a bit of science, and this is a bit of science I've done\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nsince \"The Bottom Billion,\" so it's new.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nI've looked to see what is the relationship between\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nhigher commodity prices of exports,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nand the growth of commodity-exporting countries.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nAnd I've looked globally, I've taken all the countries in the world\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nfor the last 40 years,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nand looked to see what the relationship is.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nAnd the short run -- say, the first five to seven years -- is just great.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nIn fact, it's hunky dory: everything goes up.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nYou get more money because your terms of trade have improved,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nbut also that drives up output across the board.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nSo GDP goes up a lot -- fantastic! That's the short run.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nAnd how about the long run?\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nCome back 15 years later.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nWell, the short run, it's hunky dory,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nbut the long run, it's humpty dumpty.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nYou go up in the short run, but then most societies\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nhistorically have ended up worse than if they'd had no booms at all.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nThat is not a forecast about how commodity prices go;\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nit's a forecast of the consequences, the long-term consequences,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nfor growth of an increase in prices.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nSo, what goes wrong? Why is there this \"resource curse,\" as it's called?\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nAnd again, I've looked at that, and it turns out\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nthat the critical issue is the level of governance,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nthe initial level of economic governance,\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nwhen the resource booms accrue.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nIn fact, if you've got good enough governance,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nthere is no resource boom.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nYou go up in the short term, and then you go up even more in the long term.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nThat's Norway, the richest country in Europe. It's Australia. It's Canada.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nThe resource curse is entirely confined to countries\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nbelow a threshold of governance.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nThey still go up in the short run.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nThat's what we're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nThe best growth rates they've had -- ever.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nAnd the question is whether the short run will persist.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nAnd with bad governance historically, over the last 40 years, it hasn't.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nIt's countries like Nigeria, which are worse off than if they'd never had oil.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nSo, there's a threshold level above which you go up in the long term,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nand below which you go down.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nJust to benchmark that threshold,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nit's about the governance level of Portugal in the mid 1980s.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nSo, the question is, are the bottom billion above or below that threshold?\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nNow, there's one big change since the commodity booms of the 1970s,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nand that is the spread of democracy.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nSo I thought, well, maybe that is the thing\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nwhich has transformed governance in the bottom billion.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nMaybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nSo, I looked. Democracy does have significant effects --\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nand unfortunately, they're adverse.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nDemocracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nAt that stage I just wanted to abandon the research, but --\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\n-- it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nBecause there are two distinct aspects of democracy:\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nthere's electoral competition, which determines how you acquire power,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nand there are checks and balances, which determine how you use power.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nIt turns out that electoral competition is the thing\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nthat's doing the damage with democracy,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nwhereas strong checks and balances make resource booms good.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nAnd so, what the countries of the bottom billion need\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nis very strong checks and balances.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nThey haven't got them.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nThey got instant democracy in the 1990s:\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nelections without checks and balances.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nHow can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances?\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nIn all the societies of the bottom billion,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nthere are intense struggles to do just that.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nThe simple proposal is that we should have some international standards,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nwhich will be voluntary, but which would spell out the key decision points\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nthat need to be taken in order\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nto harness these resource revenues.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nWe know these international standards work\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nbecause we've already got one.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nIt's called the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nThat is the very simple idea that governments should report\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nto their citizens what revenues they have.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nNo sooner was it proposed\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nthan reformers in Nigeria adopted it, pushed it and published the revenues in the paper.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nNigerian newspapers circulations spiked.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nPeople wanted to know what their government was getting\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nin terms of revenue.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nSo, we know it works. What would the content be of these international standards?\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nI can't go through all of them, but I'll give you an example.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nThe first is how to take the resources out of the ground --\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nthe economic processes, taking the resources out of the ground\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nand putting assets on top of the ground.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nAnd the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nYou know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nhow they've been sold over the last 40 years?\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nA company flies in, does a deal with a minister.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nAnd that's great for the company,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nand it's quite often great for the minister --\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\n-- and it's not great for their country.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nThere's a very simple institutional technology\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nwhich can transform that,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nand it's called verified auctions.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nThe public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nis of course the treasury -- that is, the British Treasury.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nAnd the British Treasury decided that it would sell the rights\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nto third-generation mobile phones\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nby working out what those rights were worth.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nThey worked out they were worth two billion pounds.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nJust in time, a set of economists got there and said,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\n\"Why not try an auction? It'll reveal the value.\"\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nIt went for 20 billion pounds through auction.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nIf the British Treasury can be out by a factor of 10,\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nthink what the ministry of finance in Sierra Leone is going to be like.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nWhen I put that to the President of Sierra Leone,\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nthe next day he asked the World Bank to send him a team\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nto give expertise on how to conduct auctions.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nThere are five such decision points;\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:00.958\neach one needs an international standard.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nIf we could do it, we would change the world.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nWe would be helping the reformers in these societies,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nwho are struggling for change.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nThat's our modest role. We cannot change these societies,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nbut we can help the people in these societies\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nwho are struggling and usually failing,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nbecause the odds are so stacked against them.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nAnd yet, we've not got these rules.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nIf you think about it, the cost of promulgating international rules\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nis zilch -- nothing.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nWhy on Earth are they not there?\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nI realized that the reason they're not there\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nis that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies,\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\npoliticians will get away with gestures.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nThat unless we have an informed society,\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nwhat politicians do, especially in relation to Africa, is gestures:\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nthings that look good, but don't work.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nAnd so I realized we had to go through the business\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nof building an informed citizenry.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nThat's why I broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nand I wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:28.958\n(Laughter).\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nHowever, I have to say, the process of communication\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\ndoes not come naturally to me.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nThis is why I'm on this stage, but it's alarming.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nI grew up in a culture of self-effacement.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nMy wife showed me a blog comment on one of my last talks,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nand the blog comment said, \"Collier is not charismatic --\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\n-- but his arguments are compelling.\"\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:06.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:13.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nIf you agree with that sentiment,\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nand if you agree that we need a critical mass of informed citizenry,\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nyou will realize that I need you.\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nPlease, become ambassadors.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nThank you.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:43.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Memes and \"temes\"", "duration": "1168", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/susan_blackmore_on_memes_and_temes", "transcript": "Cultural evolution is a dangerous child for any species to let loose on its planet. By the time you realize what's happening, the child is a toddler, up and causing havoc, and it's too late to put it back. We humans are Earth's Pandoran species. We're the ones who let the second replicator out of its box, and we can't push it back in. We're seeing the consequences all around us.Now that, I suggest, is the view that comes out of taking memetics seriously. And it gives us a new way of thinking about not only what's going on on our planet, but what might be going on elsewhere in the cosmos. So first of all, I'd like to say something about memetics and the theory of memes, and secondly, how this might answer questions about who's out there, if indeed anyone is.So, memetics: memetics is founded on the principle of Universal Darwinism. Darwin had this amazing idea. Indeed, some people say it's the best idea anybody ever had. Isn't that a wonderful thought, that there could be such a thing as a best idea anybody ever had? Do you think there could? Audience: No. (Laughter) Susan Blackmore: Someone says no, very loudly, from over there. Well, I say yes, and if there is, I give the prize to Darwin.Why? Because the idea was so simple, and yet it explains all design in the universe. I would say not just biological design, but all of the design that we think of as human design. It's all just the same thing happening. What did Darwin say? I know you know the idea, natural selection, but let me just paraphrase \"The Origin of Species,\" 1859, in a few sentences.What Darwin said was something like this: if you have creatures that vary, and that can't be doubted \u2014 I've been to the Galapagos, and I've measured the size of the beaks and the size of the turtle shells and so on, and so on. And 100 pages later. (Laughter) And if there is a struggle for life, such that nearly all of these creatures die \u2014 and this can't be doubted, I've read Malthus and I've calculated how long it would take for elephants to cover the whole world if they bred unrestricted, and so on and so on. And another 100 pages later. And if the very few that survive pass onto their offspring whatever it was that helped them survive, then those offspring must be better adapted to the circumstances in which all this happened than their parents were.You see the idea? If, if, if, then. He had no concept of the idea of an algorithm, but that's what he described in that book, and this is what we now know as the evolutionary algorithm. The principle is you just need those three things \u2014 variation, selection and heredity. And as Dan Dennett puts it, if you have those, then you must get evolution. Or design out of chaos, without the aid of mind.There's one word I love on that slide. What do you think my favorite word is? Audience: Chaos. SB: Chaos? No. What? Mind? No. Audience: Without. SB: No, not without. (Laughter) You try them all in order: Mmm...? Audience: Must. SB: Must, at must. Must, must. This is what makes it so amazing. You don't need a designer, or a plan, or foresight, or anything else. If there's something that is copied with variation and it's selected, then you must get design appearing out of nowhere. You can't stop it. Must is my favorite word there.Now, what's this to do with memes? Well, the principle here applies to anything that is copied with variation and selection. We're so used to thinking in terms of biology, we think about genes this way. Darwin didn't, of course; he didn't know about genes. He talked mostly about animals and plants, but also about languages evolving and becoming extinct. But the principle of Universal Darwinism is that any information that is varied and selected will produce design.And this is what Richard Dawkins was on about in his 1976 bestseller, \"The Selfish Gene.\" The information that is copied, he called the replicator. It selfishly copies. Not meaning it kind of sits around inside cells going, \"I want to get copied.\" But that it will get copied if it can, regardless of the consequences. It doesn't care about the consequences because it can't, because it's just information being copied. And he wanted to get away from everybody thinking all the time about genes, and so he said, \"Is there another replicator out there on the planet?\" Ah, yes, there is.Look around you \u2014 here will do, in this room. All around us, still clumsily drifting about in its primeval soup of culture, is another replicator. Information that we copy from person to person, by imitation, by language, by talking, by telling stories, by wearing clothes, by doing things. This is information copied with variation and selection. This is design process going on. He wanted a name for the new replicator. So, he took the Greek word \"mimeme,\" which means that which is imitated. Remember that, that's the core definition: that which is imitated. And abbreviated it to meme, just because it sounds good and made a good meme, an effective spreading meme. So that's how the idea came about. It's important to stick with that definition.The whole science of memetics is much maligned, much misunderstood, much feared. But a lot of these problems can be avoided by remembering the definition. A meme is not equivalent to an idea. It's not an idea. It's not equivalent to anything else, really. Stick with the definition. It's that which is imitated, or information which is copied from person to person. So, let's see some memes.Well, you sir, you've got those glasses hung around your neck in that particularly fetching way. I wonder whether you invented that idea for yourself, or copied it from someone else? If you copied it from someone else, it's a meme. And what about, oh, I can't see any interesting memes here. All right everyone, who's got some interesting memes for me? Oh, well, your earrings, I don't suppose you invented the idea of earrings. You probably went out and bought them. There are plenty more in the shops. That's something that's passed on from person to person. All the stories that we're telling \u2014 well, of course, TED is a great meme-fest, masses of memes.The way to think about memes, though, is to think, why do they spread? They're selfish information, they will get copied, if they can. But some of them will be copied because they're good, or true, or useful, or beautiful. Some of them will be copied even though they're not. Some, it's quite hard to tell why.There's one particular curious meme which I rather enjoy. And I'm glad to say, as I expected, I found it when I came here, and I'm sure all of you found it, too. You go to your nice, posh, international hotel somewhere, and you come in and you put down your clothes and you go to the bathroom, and what do you see? Audience: Bathroom soap. SB: Pardon? Audience: Soap. SB: Soap, yeah. What else do you see? Audience: (Inaudible) SB: Mmm mmm. Audience: Sink, toilet! SB: Sink, toilet, yes, these are all memes, they're all memes, but they're sort of useful ones, and then there's this one. (Laughter) What is this one doing? (Laughter) This has spread all over the world. It's not surprising that you all found it when you arrived in your bathrooms here. But I took this photograph in a toilet at the back of a tent in the eco-camp in the jungle in Assam. (Laughter) Who folded that thing up there, and why? (Laughter) Some people get carried away. (Laughter) Other people are just lazy and make mistakes. Some hotels exploit the opportunity to put even more memes with a little sticker. (Laughter) What is this all about? I suppose it's there to tell you that somebody's cleaned the place, and it's all lovely. And you know, actually, all it tells you is that another person has potentially spread germs from place to place. (Laughter)So, think of it this way. Imagine a world full of brains and far more memes than can possibly find homes. The memes are all trying to get copied \u2014 trying, in inverted commas \u2014 i.e., that's the shorthand for, if they can get copied, they will. They're using you and me as their propagating, copying machinery, and we are the meme machines.Now, why is this important? Why is this useful, or what does it tell us? It gives us a completely new view of human origins and what it means to be human, all conventional theories of cultural evolution, of the origin of humans, and what makes us so different from other species. All other theories explaining the big brain, and language, and tool use and all these things that make us unique, are based upon genes. Language must have been useful for the genes. Tool use must have enhanced our survival, mating and so on. It always comes back, as Richard Dawkins complained all that long time ago, it always comes back to genes.The point of memetics is to say, \"Oh no, it doesn't.\" There are two replicators now on this planet. From the moment that our ancestors, perhaps two and a half million years ago or so, began imitating, there was a new copying process. Copying with variation and selection. A new replicator was let loose, and it could never be \u2014 right from the start \u2014 it could never be that human beings who let loose this new creature, could just copy the useful, beautiful, true things, and not copy the other things. While their brains were having an advantage from being able to copy \u2014 lighting fires, keeping fires going, new techniques of hunting, these kinds of things \u2014 inevitably they were also copying putting feathers in their hair, or wearing strange clothes, or painting their faces, or whatever.So, you get an arms race between the genes which are trying to get the humans to have small economical brains and not waste their time copying all this stuff, and the memes themselves, like the sounds that people made and copied \u2014 in other words, what turned out to be language \u2014 competing to get the brains to get bigger and bigger. So, the big brain, on this theory, is driven by the memes.This is why, in \"The Meme Machine,\" I called it memetic drive. As the memes evolve, as they inevitably must, they drive a bigger brain that is better at copying the memes that are doing the driving. This is why we've ended up with such peculiar brains, that we like religion, and music, and art. Language is a parasite that we've adapted to, not something that was there originally for our genes, on this view. And like most parasites, it can begin dangerous, but then it coevolves and adapts, and we end up with a symbiotic relationship with this new parasite.And so, from our perspective, we don't realize that that's how it began. So, this is a view of what humans are. All other species on this planet are gene machines only, they don't imitate at all well, hardly at all. We alone are gene machines and meme machines as well. The memes took a gene machine and turned it into a meme machine.But that's not all. We have a new kind of memes now. I've been wondering for a long time, since I've been thinking about memes a lot, is there a difference between the memes that we copy \u2014 the words we speak to each other, the gestures we copy, the human things \u2014 and all these technological things around us? I have always, until now, called them all memes, but I do honestly think now we need a new word for technological memes.Let's call them techno-memes or temes. Because the processes are getting different. We began, perhaps 5,000 years ago, with writing. We put the storage of memes out there on a clay tablet, but in order to get true temes and true teme machines, you need to get the variation, the selection and the copying, all done outside of humans. And we're getting there. We're at this extraordinary point where we're nearly there, that there are machines like that. And indeed, in the short time I've already been at TED, I see we're even closer than I thought we were before.So actually, now the temes are forcing our brains to become more like teme machines. Our children are growing up very quickly learning to read, learning to use machinery. We're going to have all kinds of implants, drugs that force us to stay awake all the time. We'll think we're choosing these things, but the temes are making us do it. So, we're at this cusp now of having a third replicator on our planet. Now, what about what else is going on out there in the universe? Is there anyone else out there? People have been asking this question for a long time. We've been asking it here at TED already. In 1961, Frank Drake made his famous equation, but I think he concentrated on the wrong things. It's been very productive, that equation. He wanted to estimate N, the number of communicative civilizations out there in our galaxy, and he included in there the rate of star formation, the rate of planets, but crucially, intelligence.I think that's the wrong way to think about it. Intelligence appears all over the place, in all kinds of guises. Human intelligence is only one kind of a thing. But what's really important is the replicators you have and the levels of replicators, one feeding on the one before. So, I would suggest that we don't think intelligence, we think replicators.And on that basis, I've suggested a different kind of equation. A very simple equation. N, the same thing, the number of communicative civilizations out there [that] we might expect in our galaxy. Just start with the number of planets there are in our galaxy. The fraction of those which get a first replicator. The fraction of those that get the second replicator. The fraction of those that get the third replicator. Because it's only the third replicator that's going to reach out \u2014 sending information, sending probes, getting out there, and communicating with anywhere else.OK, so if we take that equation, why haven't we heard from anybody out there? Because every step is dangerous. Getting a new replicator is dangerous. You can pull through, we have pulled through, but it's dangerous. Take the first step, as soon as life appeared on this earth. We may take the Gaian view. I loved Peter Ward's talk yesterday \u2014 it's not Gaian all the time. Actually, life forms produce things that kill themselves. Well, we did pull through on this planet.But then, a long time later, billions of years later, we got the second replicator, the memes. That was dangerous, all right. Think of the big brain. How many mothers do we have here? You know all about big brains. They are dangerous to give birth to, are agonizing to give birth to. (Laughter) My cat gave birth to four kittens, purring all the time. Ah, mm \u2014 slightly different. (Laughter)But not only is it painful, it kills lots of babies, it kills lots of mothers, and it's very expensive to produce. The genes are forced into producing all this myelin, all the fat to myelinate the brain. Do you know, sitting here, your brain is using about 20 percent of your body's energy output for two percent of your body weight? It's a really expensive organ to run. Why? Because it's producing the memes.Now, it could have killed us off. It could have killed us off, and maybe it nearly did, but you see, we don't know. But maybe it nearly did. Has it been tried before? What about all those other species? Louise Leakey talked yesterday about how we're the only one in this branch left. What happened to the others? Could it be that this experiment in imitation, this experiment in a second replicator, is dangerous enough to kill people off?Well, we did pull through, and we adapted. But now, we're hitting, as I've just described, we're hitting the third replicator point. And this is even more dangerous \u2014 well, it's dangerous again. Why? Because the temes are selfish replicators and they don't care about us, or our planet, or anything else. They're just information, why would they? They are using us to suck up the planet's resources to produce more computers, and more of all these amazing things we're hearing about here at TED. Don't think, \"Oh, we created the Internet for our own benefit.\" That's how it seems to us. Think, temes spreading because they must. We are the old machines.Now, are we going to pull through? What's going to happen? What does it mean to pull through? Well, there are kind of two ways of pulling through. One that is obviously happening all around us now, is that the temes turn us into teme machines, with these implants, with the drugs, with us merging with the technology. And why would they do that? Because we are self-replicating. We have babies. We make new ones, and so it's convenient to piggyback on us, because we're not yet at the stage on this planet where the other option is viable. Although it's closer, I heard this morning, it's closer than I thought it was. Where the teme machines themselves will replicate themselves. That way, it wouldn't matter if the planet's climate was utterly destabilized, and it was no longer possible for humans to live here. Because those teme machines, they wouldn't need \u2014 they're not squishy, wet, oxygen-breathing, warmth-requiring creatures. They could carry on without us.So, those are the two possibilities. The second, I don't think we're that close. It's coming, but we're not there yet. The first, it's coming too. But the damage that is already being done to the planet is showing us how dangerous the third point is, that third danger point, getting a third replicator. And will we get through this third danger point, like we got through the second and like we got through the first? Maybe we will, maybe we won't. I have no idea. (Applause) Chris Anderson: That was an incredible talk. SB: Thank you. I scared myself. CA: (Laughter)", "id": 269, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nCultural evolution is a dangerous child\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nfor any species to let loose on its planet.\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nBy the time you realize what's happening, the child is a toddler,\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nup and causing havoc, and it's too late to put it back.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nWe humans are Earth's Pandoran species.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nWe're the ones who let the second replicator out of its box,\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nand we can't push it back in.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nWe're seeing the consequences all around us.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nNow that, I suggest, is the view that\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\ncomes out of taking memetics seriously.\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nAnd it gives us a new way of thinking about\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nnot only what's going on on our planet,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nbut what might be going on elsewhere in the cosmos.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nSo first of all, I'd like to say something about memetics\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nand the theory of memes,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nand secondly, how this might answer questions about who's out there,\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nif indeed anyone is.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nSo, memetics:\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nmemetics is founded on the principle of Universal Darwinism.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nDarwin had this amazing idea.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nIndeed, some people say\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nit's the best idea anybody ever had.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nIsn't that a wonderful thought, that there could be such a thing\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nas a best idea anybody ever had?\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nDo you think there could?\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nAudience: No.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nSusan Blackmore: Someone says no, very loudly, from over there.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nWell, I say yes, and if there is, I give the prize to Darwin.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nWhy?\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nBecause the idea was so simple,\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nand yet it explains all design in the universe.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nI would say not just biological design,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nbut all of the design that we think of as human design.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nIt's all just the same thing happening.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nWhat did Darwin say?\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nI know you know the idea, natural selection,\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nbut let me just paraphrase \"The Origin of Species,\" 1859,\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nin a few sentences.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nWhat Darwin said was something like this:\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nif you have creatures that vary, and that can't be doubted --\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nI've been to the Galapagos, and I've measured the size of the beaks\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nand the size of the turtle shells and so on, and so on.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nAnd 100 pages later.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAnd if there is a struggle for life,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nsuch that nearly all of these creatures die --\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nand this can't be doubted, I've read Malthus\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nand I've calculated how long it would take for elephants\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nto cover the whole world if they bred unrestricted, and so on and so on.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAnd another 100 pages later.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nAnd if the very few that survive pass onto their offspring\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nwhatever it was that helped them survive,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nthen those offspring must be better adapted\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nto the circumstances in which all this happened\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nthan their parents were.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nYou see the idea?\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nIf, if, if, then.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nHe had no concept of the idea of an algorithm,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nbut that's what he described in that book,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nand this is what we now know as the evolutionary algorithm.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nThe principle is you just need those three things --\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nvariation, selection and heredity.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nAnd as Dan Dennett puts it, if you have those,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nthen you must get evolution.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nOr design out of chaos, without the aid of mind.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nThere's one word I love on that slide.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nWhat do you think my favorite word is?\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nAudience: Chaos.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nSB: Chaos? No. What? Mind? No.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nAudience: Without.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nSB: No, not without.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:35.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nYou try them all in order: Mmm...?\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nAudience: Must.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nSB: Must, at must. Must, must.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nThis is what makes it so amazing.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nYou don't need a designer,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nor a plan, or foresight, or anything else.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nIf there's something that is copied with variation\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nand it's selected, then you must get design appearing out of nowhere.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nYou can't stop it.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nMust is my favorite word there.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nNow, what's this to do with memes?\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nWell, the principle here applies to anything\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nthat is copied with variation and selection.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nWe're so used to thinking in terms of biology,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nwe think about genes this way.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nDarwin didn't, of course; he didn't know about genes.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nHe talked mostly about animals and plants,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nbut also about languages evolving and becoming extinct.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nBut the principle of Universal Darwinism\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nis that any information that is varied and selected\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nwill produce design.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nAnd this is what Richard Dawkins was on about\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nin his 1976 bestseller, \"The Selfish Gene.\"\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nThe information that is copied, he called the replicator.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nIt selfishly copies.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nNot meaning it kind of sits around inside cells going, \"I want to get copied.\"\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nBut that it will get copied if it can,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nregardless of the consequences.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nIt doesn't care about the consequences because it can't,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nbecause it's just information being copied.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nAnd he wanted to get away\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nfrom everybody thinking all the time about genes,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nand so he said, \"Is there another replicator out there on the planet?\"\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nAh, yes, there is.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nLook around you -- here will do, in this room.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nAll around us, still clumsily drifting about\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nin its primeval soup of culture, is another replicator.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nInformation that we copy from person to person, by imitation,\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nby language, by talking, by telling stories,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nby wearing clothes, by doing things.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nThis is information copied with variation and selection.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nThis is design process going on.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nHe wanted a name for the new replicator.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nSo, he took the Greek word \"mimeme,\" which means that which is imitated.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nRemember that, that's the core definition:\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nthat which is imitated.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nAnd abbreviated it to meme, just because it sounds good\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand made a good meme, an effective spreading meme.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nSo that's how the idea came about.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nIt's important to stick with that definition.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nThe whole science of memetics is much maligned,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nmuch misunderstood, much feared.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nBut a lot of these problems can be avoided\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nby remembering the definition.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nA meme is not equivalent to an idea.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nIt's not an idea. It's not equivalent to anything else, really.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nStick with the definition.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nIt's that which is imitated,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nor information which is copied from person to person.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nSo, let's see some memes.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nWell, you sir, you've got those glasses hung around your neck\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nin that particularly fetching way.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nI wonder whether you invented that idea for yourself,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nor copied it from someone else?\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nIf you copied it from someone else, it's a meme.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nAnd what about, oh, I can't see any interesting memes here.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAll right everyone, who's got some interesting memes for me?\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nOh, well, your earrings,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nI don't suppose you invented the idea of earrings.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nYou probably went out and bought them.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nThere are plenty more in the shops.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nThat's something that's passed on from person to person.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nAll the stories that we're telling -- well, of course,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nTED is a great meme-fest, masses of memes.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nThe way to think about memes, though,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nis to think, why do they spread?\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nThey're selfish information, they will get copied, if they can.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nBut some of them will be copied because they're good,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nor true, or useful, or beautiful.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nSome of them will be copied even though they're not.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nSome, it's quite hard to tell why.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nThere's one particular curious meme which I rather enjoy.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nAnd I'm glad to say, as I expected, I found it when I came here,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nand I'm sure all of you found it, too.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nYou go to your nice, posh, international hotel somewhere,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nand you come in and you put down your clothes\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nand you go to the bathroom, and what do you see?\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nAudience: Bathroom soap.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nSB: Pardon?\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nAudience: Soap.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nSB: Soap, yeah. What else do you see?\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nAudience: (Inaudible)\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nSB: Mmm mmm.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nAudience: Sink, toilet!\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nSB: Sink, toilet, yes, these are all memes, they're all memes,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nbut they're sort of useful ones, and then there's this one.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nWhat is this one doing?\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nThis has spread all over the world.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nIt's not surprising that you all found it\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nwhen you arrived in your bathrooms here.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nBut I took this photograph in a toilet at the back of a tent\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nin the eco-camp in the jungle in Assam.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nWho folded that thing up there, and why?\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nSome people get carried away.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nOther people are just lazy and make mistakes.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nSome hotels exploit the opportunity to put even more memes\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nwith a little sticker.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:28.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nWhat is this all about?\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nI suppose it's there to tell you that somebody's\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\ncleaned the place, and it's all lovely.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nAnd you know, actually, all it tells you is that another person\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nhas potentially spread germs from place to place.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nSo, think of it this way.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nImagine a world full of brains\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nand far more memes than can possibly find homes.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nThe memes are all trying to get copied --\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\ntrying, in inverted commas -- i.e.,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nthat's the shorthand for, if they can get copied, they will.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nThey're using you and me as their propagating, copying machinery,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nand we are the meme machines.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nNow, why is this important?\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nWhy is this useful, or what does it tell us?\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nIt gives us a completely new view of human origins\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nand what it means to be human,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nall conventional theories of cultural evolution,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nof the origin of humans,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nand what makes us so different from other species.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nAll other theories explaining the big brain, and language, and tool use\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nand all these things that make us unique,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nare based upon genes.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nLanguage must have been useful for the genes.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nTool use must have enhanced our survival, mating and so on.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nIt always comes back, as Richard Dawkins complained\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nall that long time ago, it always comes back to genes.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nThe point of memetics is to say, \"Oh no, it doesn't.\"\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nThere are two replicators now on this planet.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nFrom the moment that our ancestors,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nperhaps two and a half million years ago or so,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nbegan imitating, there was a new copying process.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nCopying with variation and selection.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nA new replicator was let loose, and it could never be --\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nright from the start -- it could never be\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nthat human beings who let loose this new creature,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\ncould just copy the useful, beautiful, true things,\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nand not copy the other things.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nWhile their brains were having an advantage from being able to copy --\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nlighting fires, keeping fires going, new techniques of hunting,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nthese kinds of things --\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\ninevitably they were also copying putting feathers in their hair,\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nor wearing strange clothes, or painting their faces,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nor whatever.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nSo, you get an arms race between the genes\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nwhich are trying to get the humans to have small economical brains\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nand not waste their time copying all this stuff,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nand the memes themselves, like the sounds that people made and copied --\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nin other words, what turned out to be language --\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\ncompeting to get the brains to get bigger and bigger.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nSo, the big brain, on this theory, is driven by the memes.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nThis is why, in \"The Meme Machine,\" I called it memetic drive.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nAs the memes evolve, as they inevitably must,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nthey drive a bigger brain that is better at copying the memes\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nthat are doing the driving.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nThis is why we've ended up with such peculiar brains,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nthat we like religion, and music, and art.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nLanguage is a parasite that we've adapted to,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nnot something that was there originally for our genes,\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\non this view.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nAnd like most parasites, it can begin dangerous,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nbut then it coevolves and adapts,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nand we end up with a symbiotic relationship\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nwith this new parasite.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nAnd so, from our perspective,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nwe don't realize that that's how it began.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nSo, this is a view of what humans are.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nAll other species on this planet are gene machines only,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nthey don't imitate at all well, hardly at all.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nWe alone are gene machines and meme machines as well.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nThe memes took a gene machine and turned it into a meme machine.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nBut that's not all.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nWe have a new kind of memes now.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nI've been wondering for a long time,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nsince I've been thinking about memes a lot,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nis there a difference between the memes that we copy --\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nthe words we speak to each other,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nthe gestures we copy, the human things --\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nand all these technological things around us?\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nI have always, until now, called them all memes,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nbut I do honestly think now\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nwe need a new word for technological memes.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nLet's call them techno-memes or temes.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nBecause the processes are getting different.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nWe began, perhaps 5,000 years ago, with writing.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nWe put the storage of memes out there on a clay tablet,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nbut in order to get true temes and true teme machines,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nyou need to get the variation, the selection and the copying,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nall done outside of humans.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nAnd we're getting there.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nWe're at this extraordinary point where we're nearly there,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nthat there are machines like that.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nAnd indeed, in the short time I've already been at TED,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nI see we're even closer than I thought we were before.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nSo actually, now the temes are forcing our brains\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nto become more like teme machines.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nOur children are growing up very quickly learning to read,\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nlearning to use machinery.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nWe're going to have all kinds of implants,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\ndrugs that force us to stay awake all the time.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nWe'll think we're choosing these things,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nbut the temes are making us do it.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nSo, we're at this cusp now\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nof having a third replicator on our planet.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nNow, what about what else is going on out there in the universe?\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nIs there anyone else out there?\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nPeople have been asking this question for a long time.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nWe've been asking it here at TED already.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nIn 1961, Frank Drake made his famous equation,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nbut I think he concentrated on the wrong things.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nIt's been very productive, that equation.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nHe wanted to estimate N,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nthe number of communicative civilizations out there in our galaxy,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nand he included in there the rate of star formation,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nthe rate of planets, but crucially, intelligence.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nI think that's the wrong way to think about it.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nIntelligence appears all over the place, in all kinds of guises.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nHuman intelligence is only one kind of a thing.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nBut what's really important is the replicators you have\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nand the levels of replicators, one feeding on the one before.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nSo, I would suggest that we don't think intelligence,\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nwe think replicators.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd on that basis, I've suggested a different kind of equation.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nA very simple equation.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nN, the same thing,\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nthe number of communicative civilizations out there\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\n[that] we might expect in our galaxy.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nJust start with the number of planets there are in our galaxy.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nThe fraction of those which get a first replicator.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nThe fraction of those that get the second replicator.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nThe fraction of those that get the third replicator.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nBecause it's only the third replicator that's going to reach out --\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nsending information, sending probes, getting out there,\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nand communicating with anywhere else.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nOK, so if we take that equation,\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nwhy haven't we heard from anybody out there?\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nBecause every step is dangerous.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nGetting a new replicator is dangerous.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nYou can pull through, we have pulled through,\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nbut it's dangerous.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nTake the first step, as soon as life appeared on this earth.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nWe may take the Gaian view.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nI loved Peter Ward's talk yesterday -- it's not Gaian all the time.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nActually, life forms produce things that kill themselves.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nWell, we did pull through on this planet.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nBut then, a long time later, billions of years later,\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nwe got the second replicator, the memes.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nThat was dangerous, all right.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nThink of the big brain.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nHow many mothers do we have here?\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nYou know all about big brains.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nThey are dangerous to give birth to,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nare agonizing to give birth to.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nMy cat gave birth to four kittens, purring all the time.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nAh, mm -- slightly different.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nBut not only is it painful, it kills lots of babies,\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nit kills lots of mothers,\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nand it's very expensive to produce.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nThe genes are forced into producing all this myelin,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nall the fat to myelinate the brain.\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nDo you know, sitting here,\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nyour brain is using about 20 percent of your body's energy output\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nfor two percent of your body weight?\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nIt's a really expensive organ to run.\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nWhy? Because it's producing the memes.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nNow, it could have killed us off. It could have killed us off,\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nand maybe it nearly did, but you see, we don't know.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nBut maybe it nearly did.\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nHas it been tried before?\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nWhat about all those other species?\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nLouise Leakey talked yesterday\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nabout how we're the only one in this branch left.\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nWhat happened to the others?\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nCould it be that this experiment in imitation,\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nthis experiment in a second replicator,\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nis dangerous enough to kill people off?\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nWell, we did pull through, and we adapted.\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nBut now, we're hitting, as I've just described,\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nwe're hitting the third replicator point.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nAnd this is even more dangerous --\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nwell, it's dangerous again.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nWhy? Because the temes are selfish replicators\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nand they don't care about us, or our planet, or anything else.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nThey're just information, why would they?\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nThey are using us to suck up the planet's resources\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nto produce more computers,\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nand more of all these amazing things we're hearing about here at TED.\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nDon't think, \"Oh, we created the Internet for our own benefit.\"\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nThat's how it seems to us.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nThink, temes spreading because they must.\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nWe are the old machines.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nNow, are we going to pull through?\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nWhat's going to happen?\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nWhat does it mean to pull through?\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nWell, there are kind of two ways of pulling through.\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nOne that is obviously happening all around us now,\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nis that the temes turn us into teme machines,\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nwith these implants, with the drugs,\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nwith us merging with the technology.\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nAnd why would they do that?\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nBecause we are self-replicating.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nWe have babies.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nWe make new ones, and so it's convenient to piggyback on us,\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nbecause we're not yet at the stage on this planet\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nwhere the other option is viable.\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nAlthough it's closer, I heard this morning,\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nit's closer than I thought it was.\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nWhere the teme machines themselves will replicate themselves.\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:15.958\nThat way, it wouldn't matter if the planet's climate\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nwas utterly destabilized,\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nand it was no longer possible for humans to live here.\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nBecause those teme machines, they wouldn't need --\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:23.958\nthey're not squishy, wet, oxygen-breathing,\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nwarmth-requiring creatures.\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nThey could carry on without us.\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:31.958\nSo, those are the two possibilities.\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nThe second, I don't think we're that close.\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nIt's coming, but we're not there yet.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nThe first, it's coming too.\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nBut the damage that is already being done\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nto the planet is showing us how dangerous the third point is,\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nthat third danger point, getting a third replicator.\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nAnd will we get through this third danger point,\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nlike we got through the second and like we got through the first?\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:18:59.958\nMaybe we will, maybe we won't.\n\n00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nI have no idea.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:16.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:19.958\nChris Anderson: That was an incredible talk.\n\n00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nSB: Thank you. I scared myself.\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:22.958\nCA: (Laughter)"}, {"title": "Archeology, animal photography, BBQ ...", "duration": "1034", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/nathan_myhrvold_on_archeology_animal_photography_bbq", "transcript": "So, I'm in Chile, in the Atacama desert, sitting in a hotel lobby, because that's the only place that I can get a Wi-Fi connection, and I have this picture up on my screen, and a woman comes up behind me. She says, \"Oh, that's beautiful. What is it? Is that Jackson Pollock?\" And unfortunately, I can be a little too honest. I said, \"No, it's \u2014 it's penguin shit.\"(Laughter)And, you know, \"Excuse me!\" And I could sense that she thought I was speaking synecdochically.(Laughter)So, I said, \"No, no, really \u2014 it's penguin shit.\"(Laughter)Because I had just been in the Falkland Islands taking pictures of penguins. This is a Gentoo penguin. And she was still skeptical. So, literally, a few minutes before that, I downloaded this scientific paper about calculations on avian defecation, which is really quite interesting, because it turns out you can model this as something called \"Poiseuille flow,\" and you can learn an awful lot about the physics of the avian rectum. Actually, technically, it's not a rectum. It's called a cloaca.At this point, she stops me, and she says, \"Who are you? Wha \u2014 what do you do?\" And I was stuck, because I didn't have any way to describe what I do. And so, in some sense, this talk today is my answer to that. It's a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that I do. And it's very hard for me to make sense of it, so I'm not sure that you can. It's the kind of thing that I sit up late at night thinking about sometimes \u2014 often at four in the morning.So, some people are afraid of what I do. Some people think I am the nerd Tony Soprano, and in response, I have ordered a bulletproof pocket protector. I'm not sure what these people think, because I don't speak Norsk.(Laughter)But I'm not thinking \"monsteret\" is a good thing. I don't know, you know? So, one of the things that I love to do is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites. Because archaeology gives us an opportunity to study past civilizations, and see where they succeeded and where they failed. Use science to, you know, work backwards and say, \"Well, really, what were they thinking?\"And recently, I was in Easter Island, which is an incredibly beautiful place, and an incredibly mysterious place, because no matter where you go in Easter Island, you're struck by these statues, called the moai. The place is 64 square miles. They made, so far as we can tell, 900 of them. Why on Earth? And if you haven't read Jared Diamond's book, \"Collapse,\" I totally recommend that you do. He's got a great chapter about it. Basically, these people committed ecological suicide in order to make more of these. And somewhere along the line, somebody said, \"I know! Let's cut down the last tree and commit suicide, because we need more identical statues.\"(Laughter)And, one thing that isn't a mystery, actually, was when I grew up \u2014 because when I was a little kid, I'd seen these pictures \u2014 and I thought, \"Well, why that look on the face? Why that brow?\" I mean, it's such a powerful thing. Where did they get that inspiration? And then I met Yoyo, who is the native Rapa Nui-an guide, and if you look at Yoyo's face, you kind of figure out where they got it.There's many mysteries, these statues. Everyone wants to know, how did they make them, how did they transport them? This woman in the foreground is Jo Anne Van Tilberg. She's the leading archaeologist working Easter Island today. And she has studied the statues for 20-some years, and she has detailed records of every single statue. The one on the page here is the same that's up there. One interesting problem is the stone isn't very hard. So, this used to be completely smooth. In fact, in many of the statues, when you excavate them, the backs are totally smooth \u2014 almost glass smooth. But after 1,000 years out in the weather, they look like this.Jo Anne and I have just embarked on a project to digitize them all, and we're going to do a very high-res digitization, first because it's a way of preserving them. Second, we have these ideas about how you can algorithmically, then, learn a few of the mysteries about them. How long have they been standing in what positions? And maybe, indirectly, get at some of the issues of what caused them to be the way they are. While I was in Easter Island, comet McNaught was there also, so you get a gratuitous picture of a moai with a comet.I also have an archaeological project going on in Egypt. \"Going on\" is perhaps a little bit strong. We're trying to get all of the permissions to get everything all set, to get it going. So, I'll talk about it at a future TED. But there's some amazing opportunities in Egypt as well. Another thing I do is I invent stuff. In fact, I design nuclear reactors. Not a joke. This is the conventional nuclear fuel cycle. The red line is what is done in most nuclear reactors. It's called the open fuel cycle. The white lines are what's called an advance fuel cycle, where you reprocess.Now, this is the normal way it's done. It's got the huge advantage that it does not create carbon pollution. It has a lot of disadvantages: each one of these steps is extremely expensive, it's potentially dangerous and they have the interesting property that the step cannot be performed in anyone's backyard, which is a problem. So, our reactor eliminates these steps, which, if we can actually make it work, is a really cool thing. Now, it's kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor. There's \u2014 no reactor's been even built to an old design, much less a new one, in the United States for 25 years. It's the kind of very high-risk, but potentially very high-return thing that we do.Changing into a totally different field, we do a lot of stuff in solid state physics, particularly in an area called metamaterials. A metamaterial is an artificial material, which manipulates, in this case, electromagnetic radiation, in a way that you couldn't otherwise. So, this device here is an invisibility cloak. It may not seem that, but if you were a microwave, this is how you would view it. Rays of light \u2014 in this case, microwave light \u2014 come in, and they just squish around the cell, and they come back the other side. Now, you could do that with mirrors from one angle. The cool thing is, this does it from all angles. Metamaterials, unfortunately \u2014 A, it only works on microwave, and B, it doesn't work all that well yet. But metamaterials are an incredibly exciting field. It's \u2014 you know, today I'd like to say it's a zero billion dollar business, but, in fact, it's negative. But some day, some day, maybe it's going to work.We do a lot of work in biomedical fields. In this case, we're working with a major medical foundation to develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing diseases in developing countries. So, they say the eyes are the windows of the soul \u2014 turns out they're a window to a whole lot more stuff. And these happen to be my eyes, by the way.Now, I'm also very interested in cooking. While I was at Microsoft, I took a leave of absence and went to a chef school in France. I used to work, also while at Microsoft, at a leading restaurant in Seattle, so I do a lot of cooking. I've been on a team that won the world championship of barbecue. But barbecue's interesting, because it's one of these cult foods like chili, or bouillabaisse. Various parts of the world will have a cult food that people get enormously attached to \u2014 there's tremendous traditions, there's secrecy. And I'm trying to use a very scientific approach. So, this is my latest cooker, and if this looks more complicated than the nuclear reactor, that's because it is. But if you get to play with all those knobs and dials \u2014 and of course, really the controller over there does it all on software \u2014 you can make some terrific ribs.(Laughter)This is a high-speed centrifuge. You should all have one in your kitchen, beside your Turbochef. This subjects food to a force about 50,000 times that of normal gravity, and oh boy, does it clarify chicken stock. You would not believe it! I perform a series of ghoulish experiments on food \u2014 in this case, trying to calibrate a mathematical model so that one can predict exactly what the internal cooking times are. It turns out, A, it's useful, and for a geek like me, it's fun. Theory is red, black is experiment. So, I'm either really good at faking it, or this particular model seems to work.So, another random thing I do is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI. And you may be familiar with the movie \"Contact,\" which sort of popularized that. It turns out there are real people who go out and search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way. In fact, almost everybody in the movie is based on a real character, a real person. So, the Jodie Foster character here is actually this woman, Jill Tarter, and Jill has dedicated her life to this. You know, a lot of people risk their lives in a brief act of heroism, which is kind of cool, but Jill has what I call slow heroism. She is risking her professional life on something that her own calculations show may not work for a thousand years \u2014 may not ever. So, I like to support people that are risking their lives.After the movie came out, of course, there was a lot of interest in SETI. My kids saw the movie, and afterwards they came to me and they said, \"So, Dad, so \u2014 so \u2014 that character \u2014 that's Jill, right?\" I said, \"Oh, yeah, yeah \u2014 absolutely.\" \"And that other person, that's someone \u2014 \" I said, \"Yes.\" They said, \"Well, you know that creepy rich guy in the movie? Is that you?\" I said, \"Well, you know, it's just a movie! Come on.\"(Laughter)So, the SETI Institute, with a little bit of help from me, and a lot of help from Paul Allen and a variety of other people, is building a dedicated radio telescope in Hat Creek, California, so they can do this SETI work. Now, I travel a lot, and I change cell phones a lot, and the one person who always gets updated on all my cell phones and pagers and everything else is Jill, because I really don't want to miss \"the call.\"(Laughter)I mean, can you imagine? E.T.'s phoning home, and I'm not, like, there? You know, horrible! So, I do a lot of work on dinosaurs. I'm known to TEDsters as the guy that has sex with dinosaurs. And I resemble that remark. I'm going to talk about a different aspect of dinosaurs, which is the finding of them. Now, to find dinosaurs, you hike around in horrible conditions looking for a dinosaur. It sounds really dumb, but that's what it is. It's horrible conditions, because wherever you have nice weather, plants grow, and you don't get any erosion, and you don't see any dinosaurs. So, you always find dinosaurs in deserts or badlands, areas that have very little plant growth and have flash floods in the spring. You know, skiers pray for snow? Paleontologists pray for erosion.So, you hike around and \u2014 this is after you dig them up, they look like this. You hike around, you see something like this. Now, this is something I found, so look at it very closely here. You've got this bentonite clay, which is \u2014 sort of swells up and expands. And there's some stuff poking out. So, you look at that, and you look up close, and you say, \"Well, gee, that's kind of interesting. What are all of these pieces?\" Well, if you look closely, you can recognize, actually, from the shape, that these are skull fragments. And then when you look at this, you say, \"That's a tooth. It's a big tooth.\" It's about the size of a banana. It has a big serration on the edge. This is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in the ground. And this is what it's like to find a Tyrannosaurus rex, which I was lucky enough to do a few years ago.Now, this is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in my living room. Not the same one, actually. This is a cast, which I had bought, and then, after buying the cast, I found my own, and I don't have room for two. You know. So, the thing that's wonderful for me about finding dinosaurs is that it is both an intellectual thing, because you're trying to reconstruct the environment of millions of years ago. It's something that can inform all sorts of science in unexpected ways. The study of dinosaurs led to the realization that there's a problem with asteroid impact, for example. The study of dinosaurs may, literally, one day save the planet.Study of the ancient climate is very important. In fact, the Mesozoic, when dinosaurs lived, had much higher CO2 than today, was much warmer than today, and is one of the interesting proof points for the effects of CO2 on climate. But, besides being intellectually and scientifically interesting, it's also very different than the other things I do, because you get to hike around in the badlands. This is actually what most dinosaur research looks like. This is one of my papers: \"A pygostyle from a non-avian theropod.\" It's not as gripping as dinosaur sex, so we're not going to go into it further.Now, I'm also really big on photography. I travel all over the world taking pictures \u2014 some of them good, most of them not. These days, bits are cheap. Unfortunately, that means you've got to spend more time sorting through them. Here's a picture I took in the Falkland Islands of king penguins on a beach. Here's a picture I took in Alaska, a few years ago, of Orcas. I'd gone up to photograph Orcas, and we had looked for a week, and we hadn't seen a damn Orca. And the last day, the sun comes out, the Orcas come, they're right by the boat. It's fantastic. And I get lots of pictures like this. Then, a little bit later, I start getting some pictures like this. Now, to a human audience, I need to explain that if Penthouse magazine had a marine mammal edition, this would be the centerfold. It's true. So, there's more and more activity near the boat, and all of a sudden somebody shouts, \"What's that in the water?\" I said, \"Well, I think that's what you call a free willy.\"(Laughter)There's a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have sex.(Laughter) The first thing you learn is the overwhelming importance of hands. They don't have them.(Laughter)I think Paul Simon is in the audience, and he has \u2014 he may not realize it, but he wrote a song all about whale sex, \"Slip-Slidin' Away.\" That's kind of what it's like. The other interesting thing that I learned about whale sex: they curl their toes too.(Laughter)So \u2014 where do you go putting all of these disparate pieces together? You know, there's a tremendous amount of wisdom in finding a great thing, passion in life, and focusing all your energy on it, and I've never been able to do that. I just \u2014 you know, because, yes, I'll focus passion on something, but then there will be something else, and then there's something else again. And for a long time I fought this, and I thought, \"Well, gee, I really ought to buckle down.\" And you know, when I was at Microsoft, that was so engrossing, and the whole industry was expanding so much, that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life.But ultimately, I decided that what I really ought to do is not fight being who I am, but embrace it. And say, \"Yeah, you know, I \u2014 this whole talk has been a mile wide and an inch deep, but that's really what works for me.\" And regardless of whether it's nuclear reactors or metamaterials or whale sex, the common \u2014 or lowest common denominator \u2014 is me. That's it, thank you.(Applause)", "id": 271, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nSo, I'm in Chile,\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nin the Atacama desert, sitting in a hotel lobby,\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nbecause that's the only place that I can get a Wi-Fi connection,\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nand I have this picture up on my screen,\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nand a woman comes up behind me.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nShe says, \"Oh, that's beautiful.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nWhat is it?

And she was still skeptical.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nSo, literally, a few minutes before that,\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nI downloaded this scientific paper\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nabout calculations on avian defecation,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nwhich is really quite interesting, because it turns out\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nyou can model this as something called \"Poiseuille flow,\"\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nand you can learn an awful lot\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nabout the physics of the avian rectum.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nActually, technically, it's not a rectum. It's called a cloaca.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nAt this point, she stops me,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nand she says, \"Who are you?\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nWha -- what do you do?\"\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nAnd I was stuck,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nbecause I didn't have any way to describe what I do.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nAnd so, in some sense,\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nthis talk today\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nis my answer to that.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nIt's a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that I do.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nAnd it's very hard for me to make sense of it,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nso I'm not sure that you can.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nIt's the kind of thing that I sit up late at night thinking about sometimes --\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\noften at four in the morning.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nSo, some people are afraid of what I do.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nSome people think I am the nerd Tony Soprano,\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nand in response, I have ordered\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\na bulletproof pocket protector.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nI'm not sure what these people think,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nbecause I don't speak Norsk.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nBut I'm not thinking \"monsteret\" is a good thing.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nI don't know, you know?\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nSo, one of the things that I love to do\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nis travel around the world and look at archaeological sites.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nBecause archaeology gives us an opportunity\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nto study past civilizations,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nand see where they succeeded\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nand where they failed.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nUse science to, you know,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nwork backwards and say, \"Well, really, what were they thinking?\"\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nAnd recently, I was in Easter Island,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nwhich is an incredibly beautiful place,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nand an incredibly mysterious place,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nbecause no matter where you go in Easter Island,\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nyou're struck by these statues, called the moai.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nThe place is 64 square miles.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nThey made, so far as we can tell, 900 of them.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nWhy on Earth? And if you haven't read\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nJared Diamond's book, \"Collapse,\"\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nI totally recommend that you do.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nHe's got a great chapter about it.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nBasically, these people\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\ncommitted ecological suicide\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nin order to make more of these.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd somewhere along the line, somebody said,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\n\"I know! Let's cut down the last tree\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nand commit suicide, because\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nwe need more identical statues.\"\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nAnd,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\none thing that isn't a mystery, actually,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nwas when I grew up -- because when I was a little kid, I'd seen these pictures --\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nand I thought, \"Well, why that look on the face?\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nWhy that brow?\" I mean, it's such a powerful thing.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nWhere did they get that inspiration?\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nAnd then I met Yoyo,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nwho is the native Rapa Nui-an guide,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nand if you look at Yoyo's face,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nyou kind of figure out where they got it.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nThere's many mysteries, these statues.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nEveryone wants to know, how did they make them,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nhow did they transport them?\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nThis woman in the foreground is Jo Anne Van Tilberg.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nShe's the leading archaeologist working Easter Island today.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nAnd she has studied the statues for 20-some years,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nand she has detailed records of every single statue.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nThe one on the page here is the same that's up there.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nOne interesting problem is the stone isn't very hard.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nSo, this used to be completely smooth.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nIn fact, in many of the statues, when you excavate them,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nthe backs are totally smooth -- almost glass smooth.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nBut after 1,000 years out in the weather,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nthey look like this.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nJo Anne and I have just embarked on a project to digitize them all,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nand we're going to do a very high-res digitization,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nfirst because it's a way of preserving them.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nSecond, we have these ideas about how you can algorithmically, then,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nlearn a few of the mysteries about them.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nHow long have they been standing in what positions?\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nAnd maybe, indirectly, get at some of the issues of\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nwhat caused them to be the way they are.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nWhile I was in Easter Island, comet McNaught was there also,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nso you get a gratuitous picture\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nof a moai with a comet.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nI also have an archaeological project going on\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nin Egypt.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\n\"Going on\" is perhaps a little bit strong.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nWe're trying to get all of the permissions\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nto get everything all set, to get it going.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nSo, I'll talk about it at a future TED.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nBut there's some amazing opportunities in Egypt as well.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nAnother thing I do is I invent stuff.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nIn fact, I design nuclear reactors.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nNot a joke.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nThis is the conventional\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nnuclear fuel cycle.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nThe red line is what is done in\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nmost nuclear reactors. It's called the open fuel cycle.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nThe white lines are what's called an advance fuel cycle,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nwhere you reprocess.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nNow, this is the normal way it's done.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nIt's got the huge advantage that it\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\ndoes not create carbon pollution.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nIt has a lot of disadvantages:\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\neach one of these steps is extremely expensive,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nit's potentially dangerous\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nand they have the interesting property that the step\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\ncannot be performed in anyone's backyard,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nwhich is a problem.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nSo, our reactor eliminates these steps,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nwhich, if we can actually make it work, is a really cool thing.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nNow, it's kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nThere's -- no reactor's been even built\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nto an old design, much less a new one, in the United States\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nfor 25 years.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nIt's the kind of very high-risk, but potentially very high-return\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nthing that we do.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nChanging into a totally different field,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nwe do a lot of stuff in solid state physics,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nparticularly in an area called metamaterials.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nA metamaterial is an artificial material,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nwhich manipulates, in this case, electromagnetic radiation,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nin a way that you couldn't otherwise.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nSo, this device here is an invisibility cloak.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nIt may not seem that, but if you were a microwave,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nthis is how you would view it.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nRays of light -- in this case, microwave light --\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\ncome in, and they just squish around the cell,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nand they come back the other side.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nNow, you could do that with mirrors from one angle.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nThe cool thing is, this does it from all angles.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nMetamaterials, unfortunately --\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nA, it only works on microwave,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nand B, it doesn't work all that well yet.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nBut metamaterials are an incredibly exciting field.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nIt's -- you know, today I'd like to say\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nit's a zero billion dollar business, but,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nin fact, it's negative.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nBut some day, some day, maybe it's going to work.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nWe do a lot of work in biomedical fields.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nIn this case, we're working with a major medical foundation\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nto develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\ndiseases in developing countries.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nSo, they say the eyes are the windows of the soul --\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nturns out they're a window to a whole lot more stuff.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd these happen to be my eyes, by the way.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nNow, I'm also very interested in cooking.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nWhile I was at Microsoft, I took a leave of absence\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nand went to a chef school in France.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nI used to work, also while at Microsoft,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nat a leading restaurant in Seattle,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nso I do a lot of cooking.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nI've been on a team that won\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nthe world championship of barbecue.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nBut barbecue's interesting, because it's one of these cult foods\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nlike chili, or bouillabaisse.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nVarious parts of the world will have a cult food\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nthat people get enormously attached to --\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nthere's tremendous traditions, there's secrecy.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nAnd I'm trying to use a very\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nscientific approach.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nSo, this is my latest cooker,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nand if this looks more complicated than the nuclear reactor,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nthat's because it is.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nBut if you get to play with all those knobs and dials --\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nand of course, really the controller over there does it all on software --\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nyou can make some terrific ribs.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nThis is a high-speed centrifuge.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nYou should all have one in your kitchen,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nbeside your Turbochef.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nThis subjects food to a force about 50,000 times\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nthat of normal gravity,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nand oh boy, does it clarify chicken stock.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nYou would not believe it!\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nI perform a series of ghoulish experiments\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\non food --\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nin this case, trying to calibrate a mathematical model\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nso that one can predict exactly\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nwhat the internal cooking times are.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nIt turns out, A, it's useful, and for a geek like me, it's fun.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nTheory is red,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nblack is experiment.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nSo, I'm either really good at faking it,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nor this particular model seems to work.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nSo, another random thing I do\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nis the search for extraterrestrial intelligence,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nor SETI.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nAnd you may be familiar with the movie \"Contact,\"\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nwhich sort of popularized that.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nIt turns out there are real people who go out\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nand search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nIn fact, almost everybody in the movie\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nis based on a real character, a real person.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nSo, the Jodie Foster character here\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nis actually this woman, Jill Tarter,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nand Jill has dedicated her life to this.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nYou know, a lot of people risk their lives\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nin a brief act of heroism,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nwhich is kind of cool,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nbut Jill has\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nwhat I call slow heroism.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nShe is risking her professional life on something\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nthat her own calculations show\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nmay not work for a thousand years -- may not ever.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nSo, I like to support people that are risking their lives.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nAfter the movie came out, of course, there was a lot of interest in SETI.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nMy kids saw the movie,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nand afterwards they came to me and they said,\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\n\"So, Dad, so -- so --\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nthat character -- that's Jill, right?\"\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nI said, \"Oh, yeah, yeah -- absolutely.\"\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\n\"And that other person, that's someone -- \" I said, \"Yes.\"\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nThey said, \"Well, you know that creepy rich guy in the movie?\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nIs that you?\"\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nI said, \"Well, you know, it's just a movie! Come on.\"\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:48.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nSo, the SETI Institute,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nwith a little bit of help from me, and a lot of help from Paul Allen\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nand a variety of other people,\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nis building a dedicated radio telescope\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nin Hat Creek, California,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nso they can do this SETI work.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nNow, I travel a lot, and I change cell phones a lot,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nand the one person who always gets updated\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\non all my cell phones and pagers and everything else\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nis Jill, because I really don't want to miss\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\n\"the call.\"\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nI mean, can you imagine? E.T.'s phoning home,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nand I'm not, like, there? You know, horrible!\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nSo, I do a lot of work on dinosaurs.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nI'm known to TEDsters as the guy that has sex with dinosaurs.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nAnd I resemble that remark.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nI'm going to talk about a different aspect of dinosaurs,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nwhich is the finding of them.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nNow, to find dinosaurs, you hike around in horrible conditions\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nlooking for a dinosaur.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nIt sounds really dumb, but that's what it is.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nIt's horrible conditions, because\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nwherever you have nice weather,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nplants grow,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nand you don't get any erosion, and you don't see any dinosaurs.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nSo, you always find dinosaurs\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nin deserts or badlands,\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nareas that have very little plant growth\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nand have flash floods in the spring.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nYou know, skiers pray for snow?\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nPaleontologists pray for erosion.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nSo, you hike around\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand -- this is after you dig them up, they look like this.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nYou hike around, you see something like this.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nNow, this is something I found, so look at it very closely here.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nYou've got this bentonite clay,\n\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nwhich is -- sort of swells up and expands.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nAnd there's some stuff poking out. So, you look at that,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand you look up close, and you say,\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:27.958\n\"Well, gee, that's kind of interesting. What are all of these pieces?\"\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nWell, if you look closely, you can recognize, actually,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nfrom the shape, that these are skull fragments.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nAnd then when you look at this,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nyou say, \"That's a tooth.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nIt's a big tooth.\"\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nIt's about the size of a banana.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nIt has a big serration on the edge.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nThis is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in the ground.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nAnd this is what it's like to find a Tyrannosaurus rex,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nwhich I was lucky enough to do a few years ago.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nNow, this is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in my living room.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nNot the same one, actually. This is a cast, which I had bought,\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nand then, after buying the cast, I found my own,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nand I don't have room for two.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nYou know.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nSo, the thing that's wonderful for me about finding dinosaurs\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nis that it is both an intellectual thing,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nbecause you're trying to reconstruct the environment\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nof millions of years ago.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nIt's something that can inform all sorts of science\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nin unexpected ways.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nThe study of dinosaurs led to the realization\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nthat there's a problem with asteroid impact,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nfor example.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nThe study of dinosaurs may, literally,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\none day save the planet.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nStudy of the ancient climate is very important.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nIn fact, the Mesozoic, when dinosaurs lived,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nhad much higher CO2 than today,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nwas much warmer than today, and is one of the interesting proof points\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nfor the effects of CO2 on climate.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nBut, besides being intellectually\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nand scientifically interesting, it's also very different\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nthan the other things I do, because you get to hike around in the badlands.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nThis is actually what most dinosaur research looks like.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nThis is one of my papers: \"A pygostyle from a non-avian theropod.\"\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nIt's not as gripping as dinosaur sex,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nso we're not going to go into it further.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nNow, I'm also really big on photography.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nI travel all over the world taking pictures --\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nsome of them good, most of them not.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nThese days, bits are cheap. Unfortunately, that means\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nyou've got to spend more time sorting through them.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nHere's a picture I took in the Falkland Islands\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nof king penguins on a beach.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nHere's a picture I took in Alaska, a few years ago, of Orcas.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nI'd gone up to photograph Orcas,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nand we had looked for a week,\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nand we hadn't seen a damn Orca.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nAnd the last day, the sun comes out,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nthe Orcas come, they're right by the boat. It's fantastic.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nAnd I get lots of pictures like this.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nThen, a little bit later,\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nI start getting some pictures like this.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nNow, to a human audience, I need to explain that\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nif Penthouse magazine had a marine mammal edition,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nthis would be the centerfold.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nIt's true.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nSo, there's more and more activity near the boat,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nand all of a sudden somebody shouts,\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\n\"What's that in the water?\"\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nI said, \"Well, I think that's what you call a free willy.\"\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nThere's a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have sex.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nThe first thing you learn\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nis the overwhelming importance of hands.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nThey don't have them.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nI think Paul Simon is in the audience,\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nand he has --\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nhe may not realize it, but he wrote a song all about whale sex,\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:46.958\n\"Slip-Slidin' Away.\"\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nThat's kind of what it's like.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nThe other interesting thing that I learned about whale sex:\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nthey curl their toes too.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nSo --\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nwhere do you go putting all of these disparate pieces together?\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nYou know, there's a tremendous amount of wisdom\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nin finding a great thing, passion in life,\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nand focusing all your energy on it,\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nand I've never been able to do that.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nI just -- you know, because, yes,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nI'll focus passion on something,\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nbut then there will be something else, and then there's something else again.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nAnd for a long time I fought this, and I thought,\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\n\"Well, gee, I really ought to buckle down.\"\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nAnd you know, when I was at Microsoft,\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nthat was so engrossing,\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nand the whole industry was expanding so much,\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nthat it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life.\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nBut ultimately,\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nI decided\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nthat what I really ought to do is not fight being who I am,\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nbut embrace it.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nAnd say, \"Yeah, you know, I --\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nthis whole talk has been a mile wide and an inch deep,\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nbut that's really what works for me.\"\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nAnd regardless of whether it's nuclear reactors\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nor metamaterials or whale sex,\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nthe common -- or lowest common denominator -- is me.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nThat's it, thank you.\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The worldwide web of belief and ritual", "duration": "1152", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/wade_davis_on_the_worldwide_web_of_belief_and_ritual", "transcript": "You know, culture was born of the imagination, and the imagination \u2014 the imagination as we know it \u2014 came into being when our species descended from our progenitor, Homo erectus, and, infused with consciousness, began a journey that would carry it to every corner of the habitable world. For a time, we shared the stage with our distant cousins, Neanderthal, who clearly had some spark of awareness, but \u2014 whether it was the increase in the size of the brain, or the development of language, or some other evolutionary catalyst \u2014 we quickly left Neanderthal gasping for survival. By the time the last Neanderthal disappeared in Europe, 27,000 years ago, our direct ancestors had already, and for 5,000 years, been crawling into the belly of the earth, where in the light of the flickers of tallow candles, they had brought into being the great art of the Upper Paleolithic.And I spent two months in the caves of southwest France with the poet Clayton Eshleman, who wrote a beautiful book called \"Juniper Fuse.\" And you could look at this art and you could, of course, see the complex social organization of the people who brought it into being. But more importantly, it spoke of a deeper yearning, something far more sophisticated than hunting magic. And the way Clayton put it was this way. He said, \"You know, clearly at some point, we were all of an animal nature, and at some point, we weren't.\" And he viewed proto-shamanism as a kind of original attempt, through ritual, to rekindle a connection that had been irrevocably lost. So, he saw this art not as hunting magic, but as postcards of nostalgia. And viewed in that light, it takes on a whole other resonance.And the most amazing thing about the Upper Paleolithic art is that as an aesthetic expression, it lasted for almost 20,000 years. If these were postcards of nostalgia, ours was a very long farewell indeed. And it was also the beginning of our discontent, because if you wanted to distill all of our experience since the Paleolithic, it would come down to two words: how and why. And these are the slivers of insight upon which cultures have been forged. Now, all people share the same raw, adaptive imperatives. We all have children. We all have to deal with the mystery of death, the world that waits beyond death, the elders who fall away into their elderly years. All of this is part of our common experience, and this shouldn't surprise us, because, after all, biologists have finally proven it to be true, something that philosophers have always dreamt to be true. And that is the fact that we are all brothers and sisters. We are all cut from the same genetic cloth. All of humanity, probably, is descended from a thousand people who left Africa roughly 70,000 years ago.But the corollary of that is that, if we all are brothers and sisters and share the same genetic material, all human populations share the same raw human genius, the same intellectual acuity. And so whether that genius is placed into \u2014 technological wizardry has been the great achievement of the West \u2014 or by contrast, into unraveling the complex threads of memory inherent in a myth, is simply a matter of choice and cultural orientation. There is no progression of affairs in human experience. There is no trajectory of progress. There's no pyramid that conveniently places Victorian England at the apex and descends down the flanks to the so-called primitives of the world. All peoples are simply cultural options, different visions of life itself. But what do I mean by different visions of life making for completely different possibilities for existence?Well, let's slip for a moment into the greatest culture sphere ever brought into being by the imagination, that of Polynesia. 10,000 square kilometers, tens of thousands of islands flung like jewels upon the southern sea. I recently sailed on the Hokulea, named after the sacred star of Hawaii, throughout the South Pacific to make a film about the navigators. These are men and women who, even today, can name 250 stars in the night sky. These are men and women who can sense the presence of distant atolls of islands beyond the visible horizon, simply by watching the reverberation of waves across the hull of their vessel, knowing full well that every island group in the Pacific has its unique refractive pattern that can be read with the same perspicacity with which a forensic scientist would read a fingerprint. These are sailors who in the darkness, in the hull of the vessel, can distinguish as many as 32 different sea swells moving through the canoe at any one point in time, distinguishing local wave disturbances from the great currents that pulsate across the ocean, that can be followed with the same ease that a terrestrial explorer would follow a river to the sea. Indeed, if you took all of the genius that allowed us to put a man on the moon and applied it to an understanding of the ocean, what you would get is Polynesia.And if we slip from the realm of the sea into the realm of the spirit of the imagination, you enter the realm of Tibetan Buddhism. And I recently made a film called \"The Buddhist Science of the Mind.\" Why did we use that word, science? What is science but the empirical pursuit of the truth? What is Buddhism but 2,500 years of empirical observation as to the nature of mind? I travelled for a month in Nepal with our good friend, Matthieu Ricard, and you'll remember Matthieu famously said to all of us here once at TED, \"Western science is a major response to minor needs.\" We spend all of our lifetime trying to live to be 100 without losing our teeth. The Buddhist spends all their lifetime trying to understand the nature of existence.Our billboards celebrate naked children in underwear. Their billboards are manuals, prayers to the well-being of all sentient creatures. And with the blessing of Trulshik Rinpoche, we began a pilgrimage to a curious destination, accompanied by a great doctor. And the destination was a single room in a nunnery, where a woman had gone into lifelong retreat 55 years before. And en route, we took darshan from Rinpoche, and he sat with us and told us about the Four Noble Truths, the essence of the Buddhist path. All life is suffering. That doesn't mean all life is negative. It means things happen. The cause of suffering is ignorance. By that, the Buddha did not mean stupidity; he meant clinging to the illusion that life is static and predictable. The third noble truth said that ignorance can be overcome. And the fourth and most important, of course, was the delineation of a contemplative practice that not only had the possibility of a transformation of the human heart, but had 2,500 years of empirical evidence that such a transformation was a certainty.And so, when this door opened onto the face of a woman who had not been out of that room in 55 years, you did not see a mad woman. You saw a woman who was more clear than a pool of water in a mountain stream. And of course, this is what the Tibetan monks told us. They said, at one point, you know, we don't really believe you went to the moon, but you did. You may not believe that we achieve enlightenment in one lifetime, but we do. And if we move from the realm of the spirit to the realm of the physical, to the sacred geography of Peru \u2014 I've always been interested in the relationships of indigenous people that literally believe that the Earth is alive, responsive to all of their aspirations, all of their needs. And, of course, the human population has its own reciprocal obligations.I spent 30 years living amongst the people of Chinchero and I always heard about an event that I always wanted to participate in. Once each year, the fastest young boy in each hamlet is given the honor of becoming a woman. And for one day, he wears the clothing of his sister and he becomes a transvestite, a waylaka. And for that day, he leads all able-bodied men on a run, but it's not your ordinary run. You start off at 11,500 feet. You run down to the base of the sacred mountain, Antakillqa. You run up to 15,000 feet, descend 3,000 feet. Climb again over the course of 24 hours. And of course, the waylakama spin, the trajectory of the route, is marked by holy mounds of Earth, where coke is given to the Earth, libations of alcohol to the wind, the vortex of the feminine is brought to the mountaintop. And the metaphor is clear: you go into the mountain as an individual, but through exhaustion, through sacrifice, you emerge as a community that has once again reaffirmed its sense of place in the planet. And at 48, I was the only outsider ever to go through this, only one to finish it. I only managed to do it by chewing more coca leaves in one day than anyone in the 4,000-year history of the plant.But these localized rituals become pan-Andean, and these fantastic festivals, like that of the Qoyllur Rit'i, which occurs when the Pleiades reappear in the winter sky. It's kind of like an Andean Woodstock: 60,000 Indians on pilgrimage to the end of a dirt road that leads to the sacred valley, called the Sinakara, which is dominated by three tongues of the great glacier. The metaphor is so clear. You bring the crosses from your community, in this wonderful fusion of Christian and pre-Columbian ideas. You place the cross into the ice, in the shadow of Ausangate, the most sacred of all Apus, or sacred mountains of the Inca. And then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses.Now, these ideas and these events allow us even to deconstruct iconic places that many of you have been to, like Machu Picchu. Machu Picchu was never a lost city. On the contrary, it was completely linked in to the 14,000 kilometers of royal roads the Inca made in less than a century. But more importantly, it was linked in to the Andean notions of sacred geography. The intiwatana, the hitching post to the sun, is actually an obelisk that constantly reflects the light that falls on the sacred Apu of Machu Picchu, which is Sugarloaf Mountain, called Huayna Picchu. If you come to the south of the intiwatana, you find an altar. Climb Huayna Picchu, find another altar. Take a direct north-south bearing, you find to your astonishment that it bisects the intiwatana stone, goes to the skyline, hits the heart of Salcantay, the second of the most important mountains of the Incan empire. And then beyond Salcantay, of course, when the southern cross reaches the southernmost point in the sky, directly in that same alignment, the Milky Way overhead. But what is enveloping Machu Picchu from below? The sacred river, the Urubamba, or the Vilcanota, which is itself the Earthly equivalent of the Milky Way, but it's also the trajectory that Viracocha walked at the dawn of time when he brought the universe into being. And where does the river rise? Right on the slopes of the Koariti.So, 500 years after Columbus, these ancient rhythms of landscape are played out in ritual. Now, when I was here at the first TED, I showed this photograph: two men of the Elder Brothers, the descendants, survivors of El Dorado. These, of course, are the descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization. If those of you who are here remember that I mentioned that they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood, but the training for the priesthood is extraordinary. Taken from their families, sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness for 18 years \u2014 two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to evoke the nine months they spend in the natural mother's womb. All that time, the world only exists as an abstraction, as they are taught the values of their society. Values that maintain the proposition that their prayers, and their prayers alone, maintain the cosmic balance. Now, the measure of a society is not only what it does, but the quality of its aspirations.And I always wanted to go back into these mountains, to see if this could possibly be true, as indeed had been reported by the great anthropologist, Reichel-Dolmatoff. So, literally two weeks ago, I returned from having spent six weeks with the Elder Brothers on what was clearly the most extraordinary trip of my life. These really are a people who live and breathe the realm of the sacred, a baroque religiosity that is simply awesome. They consume more coca leaves than any human population, half a pound per man, per day. The gourd you see here is \u2014 everything in their lives is symbolic. Their central metaphor is a loom. They say, \"Upon this loom, I weave my life.\" They refer to the movements as they exploit the ecological niches of the gradient as \"threads.\" When they pray for the dead, they make these gestures with their hands, spinning their thoughts into the heavens.You can see the calcium buildup on the head of the poporo gourd. The gourd is a feminine aspect; the stick is a male. You put the stick in the powder to take the sacred ashes \u2014 well, they're not ashes, they're burnt limestone \u2014 to empower the coca leaf, to change the pH of the mouth to facilitate the absorption of cocaine hydrochloride. But if you break a gourd, you cannot simply throw it away, because every stroke of that stick that has built up that calcium, the measure of a man's life, has a thought behind it. Fields are planted in such an extraordinary way, that the one side of the field is planted like that by the women. The other side is planted like that by the men. Metaphorically, you turn it on the side, and you have a piece of cloth. And they are the descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization, the greatest goldsmiths of South America, who in the wake of the conquest, retreated into this isolated volcanic massif that soars to 20,000 feet above the Caribbean coastal plain.There are four societies: the Kogi, the Wiwa, the Kankwano and the Arhuacos. I traveled with the Arhuacos, and the wonderful thing about this story was that this man, Danilo Villafane \u2014 if we just jump back here for a second. When I first met Danilo, in the Colombian embassy in Washington, I couldn't help but say, \"You know, you look a lot like an old friend of mine.\" Well, it turns out he was the son of my friend, Adalberto, from 1974, who had been killed by the FARC. And I said, \"Danilo, you won't remember this, but when you were an infant, I carried you on my back, up and down the mountains.\" And because of that, Danilo invited us to go to the very heart of the world, a place where no journalist had ever been permitted. Not simply to the flanks of the mountains, but to the very iced peaks which are the destiny of the pilgrims.And this man sitting cross-legged is now a grown-up Eugenio, a man who I've known since 1974. And this is one of those initiates. No, it's not true that they're kept in the darkness for 18 years, but they are kept within the confines of the ceremonial men's circle for 18 years. This little boy will never step outside of the sacred fields that surround the men's hut for all that time, until he begins his journey of initiation. For that entire time, the world only exists as an abstraction, as he is taught the values of society, including this notion that their prayers alone maintain the cosmic balance. Before we could begin our journey, we had to be cleansed at the portal of the Earth. And it was extraordinary to be taken by a priest. And you see that the priest never wears shoes because holy feet \u2014 there must be nothing between the feet and the Earth for a mamo. And this is actually the place where the Great Mother sent the spindle into the world that elevated the mountains and created the homeland that they call the heart of the world.We traveled high into the paramo, and as we crested the hills, we realized that the men were interpreting every single bump on the landscape in terms of their own intense religiosity. And then of course, as we reached our final destination, a place called Mamancana, we were in for a surprise, because the FARC were waiting to kidnap us. And so we ended up being taken aside into these huts, hidden away until the darkness. And then, abandoning all our gear, we were forced to ride out in the middle of the night, in a quite dramatic scene. It's going to look like a John Ford Western. And we ran into a FARC patrol at dawn, so it was quite harrowing. It will be a very interesting film. But what was fascinating is that the minute there was a sense of dangers, the mamos went into a circle of divination.And of course, this is a photograph literally taken the night we were in hiding, as they divine their route to take us out of the mountains. We were able to, because we had trained people in filmmaking, continue with our work, and send our Wiwa and Arhuaco filmmakers to the final sacred lakes to get the last shots for the film, and we followed the rest of the Arhuaco back to the sea, taking the elements from the highlands to the sea. And here you see how their sacred landscape has been covered by brothels and hotels and casinos, and yet, still they pray. And it's an amazing thing to think that this close to Miami, two hours from Miami, there is an entire civilization of people praying every day for your well-being. They call themselves the Elder Brothers. They dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world as the Younger Brothers. They cannot understand why it is that we do what we do to the Earth.Now, if we slip to another end of the world, I was up in the high Arctic to tell a story about global warming, inspired in part by the former Vice President's wonderful book. And what struck me so extraordinary was to be again with the Inuit \u2014 a people who don't fear the cold, but take advantage of it. A people who find a way, with their imagination, to carve life out of that very frozen. A people for whom blood on ice is not a sign of death, but an affirmation of life. And yet tragically, when you now go to those northern communities, you find to your astonishment that whereas the sea ice used to come in in September and stay till July, in a place like Kanak in northern Greenland, it literally comes in now in November and stays until March. So, their entire year has been cut in half.Now, I want to stress that none of these peoples that I've been quickly talking about here are disappearing worlds. These are not dying peoples. On the contrary, you know, if you have the heart to feel and the eyes to see, you discover that the world is not flat. The world remains a rich tapestry. It remains a rich topography of the spirit. These myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being new, failed attempts at being modern. They're unique facets of the human imagination. They're unique answers to a fundamental question: what does it mean to be human and alive? And when asked that question, they respond with 6,000 different voices. And collectively, those voices become our human repertoire for dealing with the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia.Our industrial society is scarcely 300 years old. That shallow history shouldn't suggest to anyone that we have all of the answers for all of the questions that will confront us in the ensuing millennia. The myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being us. They are unique answers to that fundamental question: what does it mean to be human and alive? And there is indeed a fire burning over the Earth, taking with it not only plants and animals, but the legacy of humanity's brilliance.Right now, as we sit here in this room, of those 6,000 languages spoken the day that you were born, fully half aren't being taught to children. So, you're living through a time when virtually half of humanity's intellectual, social and spiritual legacy is being allowed to slip away. This does not have to happen. These peoples are not failed attempts at being modern \u2014 quaint and colorful and destined to fade away as if by natural law.In every case, these are dynamic, living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces. That's actually an optimistic observation, because it suggests that if human beings are the agents of cultural destruction, we can also be, and must be, the facilitators of cultural survival.Thank you very much.", "id": 273, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nYou know, culture was born of the imagination,\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nand the imagination -- the imagination as we know it --\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:21.958\ncame into being when our species descended\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nfrom our progenitor, Homo erectus,\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nand, infused with consciousness, began a journey that would carry it\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nto every corner of the habitable world.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nFor a time, we shared the stage with our distant cousins, Neanderthal,\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nwho clearly had some spark of awareness,\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nbut -- whether it was the increase in the size of the brain,\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nor the development of language,\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nor some other evolutionary catalyst --\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nwe quickly left Neanderthal gasping for survival.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nBy the time the last Neanderthal disappeared in Europe,\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\n27,000 years ago,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nour direct ancestors had already,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nand for 5,000 years,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nbeen crawling into the belly of the earth,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nwhere in the light of the flickers of tallow candles,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nthey had brought into being\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nthe great art of the Upper Paleolithic.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nAnd I spent two months in the caves of southwest France\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nwith the poet Clayton Eshleman, who wrote a beautiful book called \"Juniper Fuse.\"\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nAnd you could look at this art and you could, of course,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nsee the complex social organization\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nof the people who brought it into being.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nBut more importantly, it spoke of a deeper yearning,\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nsomething far more sophisticated than hunting magic.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nAnd the way Clayton put it was this way.\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nHe said, \"You know, clearly at some point,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nwe were all of an animal nature, and at some point, we weren't.\"\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nAnd he viewed proto-shamanism as a kind of original attempt,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nthrough ritual, to rekindle a connection\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nthat had been irrevocably lost.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nSo, he saw this art not as\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nhunting magic, but as postcards of nostalgia.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nAnd viewed in that light,\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nit takes on a whole other resonance.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nAnd the most amazing thing about the Upper Paleolithic art\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nis that as an aesthetic expression,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nit lasted for almost 20,000 years.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nIf these were postcards of nostalgia,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nours was a very long farewell indeed.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nAnd it was also the beginning of our discontent,\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nbecause if you wanted to distill all of our experience\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nsince the Paleolithic, it would come down to two words:\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nhow and why.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nAnd these are the slivers of insight upon which cultures have been forged.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nNow, all people share the same\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nraw, adaptive imperatives.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nWe all have children.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nWe all have to deal with the mystery of death,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nthe world that waits beyond death,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nthe elders who fall away into their elderly years.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nAll of this is part of our common experience,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nand this shouldn't surprise us, because, after all,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nbiologists have finally proven it to be true,\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nsomething that philosophers have always dreamt to be true.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nAnd that is the fact that we are all brothers and sisters.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nWe are all cut from the same genetic cloth.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nAll of humanity, probably, is descended from a thousand people\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nwho left Africa roughly 70,000 years ago.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nBut the corollary of that is that,\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nif we all are brothers and sisters\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nand share the same genetic material,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nall human populations share the same raw human genius,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nthe same intellectual acuity.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nAnd so whether that genius is placed\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\ninto -- technological wizardry\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nhas been the great achievement of the West --\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nor by contrast, into unraveling the complex threads\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nof memory inherent in a myth,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nis simply a matter of choice and cultural orientation.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nThere is no progression of affairs\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nin human experience.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nThere is no trajectory of progress. There's no pyramid\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nthat conveniently places Victorian England at the apex\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nand descends down the flanks\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nto the so-called primitives of the world.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nAll peoples are simply cultural options,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\ndifferent visions of life itself.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nBut what do I mean by different visions of life\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nmaking for completely different\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\npossibilities for existence?\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nWell, let's slip for a moment into the greatest culture sphere\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\never brought into being by the imagination,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nthat of Polynesia.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\n10,000 square kilometers,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\ntens of thousands of islands flung like jewels upon the southern sea.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nI recently sailed on the Hokulea,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nnamed after the sacred star of Hawaii,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nthroughout the South Pacific to make a film\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nabout the navigators.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nThese are men and women who, even today, can name\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\n250 stars in the night sky.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nThese are men and women who can sense the presence of distant atolls\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nof islands beyond the visible horizon,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nsimply by watching the reverberation of waves\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nacross the hull of their vessel, knowing full well\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nthat every island group in the Pacific\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nhas its unique refractive pattern\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nthat can be read with the same perspicacity\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nwith which a forensic scientist would read a fingerprint.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nThese are sailors who in the darkness, in the hull of the vessel,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\ncan distinguish as many as 32 different sea swells\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nmoving through the canoe at any one point in time,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\ndistinguishing local wave disturbances\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nfrom the great currents that pulsate across the ocean,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nthat can be followed with the same ease\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nthat a terrestrial explorer would follow a river to the sea.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nIndeed, if you took all of the genius\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nthat allowed us to put a man on the moon\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nand applied it to an understanding of the ocean,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nwhat you would get is Polynesia.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nAnd if we slip from the realm of the sea\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\ninto the realm of the spirit of the imagination,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nyou enter the realm of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nAnd I recently made a film called \"The Buddhist Science of the Mind.\"\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nWhy did we use that word, science?\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nWhat is science but the empirical pursuit of the truth?\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nWhat is Buddhism but 2,500 years\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nof empirical observation\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nas to the nature of mind?\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nI travelled for a month in Nepal with our good friend, Matthieu Ricard,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nand you'll remember Matthieu famously said to all of us\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nhere once at TED,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\n\"Western science is a major response to minor needs.\"\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nWe spend all of our lifetime trying to live to be 100\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nwithout losing our teeth.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nThe Buddhist spends all their lifetime trying to understand the nature of existence.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nOur billboards celebrate naked children in underwear.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nTheir billboards are manuals,\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nprayers to the well-being of all sentient creatures.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nAnd with the blessing of Trulshik Rinpoche, we began a pilgrimage\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nto a curious destination,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\naccompanied by a great doctor.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nAnd the destination was a single room in a nunnery,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nwhere a woman had gone into lifelong retreat\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\n55 years before.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nAnd en route, we took darshan from Rinpoche,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nand he sat with us and told us about the Four Noble Truths,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nthe essence of the Buddhist path.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nAll life is suffering. That doesn't mean all life is negative.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nIt means things happen.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nThe cause of suffering is ignorance.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nBy that, the Buddha did not mean stupidity;\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nhe meant clinging to the illusion\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nthat life is static and predictable.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nThe third noble truth said that ignorance can be overcome.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nAnd the fourth and most important, of course,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nwas the delineation of a contemplative practice\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nthat not only had the possibility\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nof a transformation of the human heart,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nbut had 2,500 years of empirical evidence\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nthat such a transformation was a certainty.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nAnd so, when this door opened onto the face of a woman\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nwho had not been out of that room in 55 years,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nyou did not see a mad woman.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nYou saw a woman who was more clear\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nthan a pool of water in a mountain stream.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nAnd of course, this is what the Tibetan monks told us.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nThey said, at one point, you know, we don't really believe\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nyou went to the moon, but you did.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nYou may not believe that we achieve enlightenment\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nin one lifetime, but we do.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd if we move from the realm of the spirit\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nto the realm of the physical,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nto the sacred geography of Peru --\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nI've always been interested in the relationships of indigenous people\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nthat literally believe that the Earth is alive,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nresponsive to all of their aspirations,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nall of their needs.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nAnd, of course, the human population\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nhas its own reciprocal obligations.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nI spent 30 years living amongst\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nthe people of Chinchero\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nand I always heard about an event that I always wanted to participate in.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nOnce each year, the fastest young boy\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nin each hamlet is given the honor of becoming a woman.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd for one day, he wears the clothing of his sister\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nand he becomes a transvestite,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\na waylaka. And for that day,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nhe leads all able-bodied men on a run,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nbut it's not your ordinary run.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nYou start off at 11,500 feet.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nYou run down to the base of the sacred mountain, Antakillqa.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nYou run up to 15,000 feet,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\ndescend 3,000 feet.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nClimb again over the course of 24 hours.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nAnd of course, the waylakama spin,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nthe trajectory of the route,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nis marked by holy mounds of Earth,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nwhere coke is given to the Earth, libations of alcohol to the wind,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nthe vortex of the feminine is brought to the mountaintop.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nAnd the metaphor is clear: you go into the mountain as an individual,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nbut through exhaustion, through sacrifice,\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nyou emerge as a community that has once again\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nreaffirmed its sense of place in the planet.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nAnd at 48, I was the only outsider ever to go through this,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nonly one to finish it.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nI only managed to do it by chewing more coca leaves in one day\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nthan anyone in the 4,000-year history of the plant.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nBut these localized rituals become pan-Andean,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nand these fantastic festivals,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nlike that of the Qoyllur Rit'i, which occurs\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nwhen the Pleiades reappear in the winter sky.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nIt's kind of like an Andean Woodstock:\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\n60,000 Indians on pilgrimage\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nto the end of a dirt road\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nthat leads to the sacred valley, called the Sinakara,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nwhich is dominated by three tongues\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nof the great glacier.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nThe metaphor is so clear. You bring the crosses from your community,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nin this wonderful fusion of Christian\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nand pre-Columbian ideas.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nYou place the cross into the ice,\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nin the shadow of Ausangate, the most sacred of all Apus,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nor sacred mountains of the Inca.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nAnd then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nNow, these ideas and these events\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nallow us even to deconstruct iconic places\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nthat many of you have been to, like Machu Picchu.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nMachu Picchu was never a lost city.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nOn the contrary, it was completely linked in\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nto the 14,000 kilometers of royal roads\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nthe Inca made in less than a century.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nBut more importantly, it was linked in\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nto the Andean notions of sacred geography.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nThe intiwatana, the hitching post to the sun,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nis actually an obelisk that constantly reflects the light\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nthat falls on the sacred Apu of Machu Picchu,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nwhich is Sugarloaf Mountain, called Huayna Picchu.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nIf you come to the south of the intiwatana, you find an altar.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nClimb Huayna Picchu, find another altar.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nTake a direct north-south bearing,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nyou find to your astonishment\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nthat it bisects the intiwatana stone,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\ngoes to the skyline,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nhits the heart of Salcantay, the second of the most important mountains\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nof the Incan empire.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nAnd then beyond Salcantay, of course,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nwhen the southern cross reaches the southernmost point in the sky,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\ndirectly in that same alignment, the Milky Way overhead.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nBut what is enveloping Machu Picchu from below?\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nThe sacred river, the Urubamba, or the Vilcanota,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nwhich is itself the Earthly equivalent of the Milky Way,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nbut it's also the trajectory that Viracocha walked\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nat the dawn of time when he brought the universe into being.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nAnd where does the river rise?\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nRight on the slopes of the Koariti.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nSo, 500 years after Columbus,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nthese ancient rhythms of landscape\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nare played out in ritual.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nNow, when I was here at the first TED,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nI showed this photograph: two men of the Elder Brothers,\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nthe descendants, survivors of El Dorado.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nThese, of course, are the descendants\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nof the ancient Tairona civilization.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nIf those of you who are here remember that I mentioned\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nthat they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nbut the training for the priesthood is extraordinary.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nTaken from their families, sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nfor 18 years -- two nine-year periods deliberately chosen\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nto evoke the nine months they spend in the natural mother's womb.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nAll that time, the world only exists as an abstraction,\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nas they are taught the values of their society.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nValues that maintain the proposition that their prayers,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nand their prayers alone, maintain the cosmic balance.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nNow, the measure of a society is not only what it does,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nbut the quality of its aspirations.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nAnd I always wanted to go back into these mountains,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nto see if this could possibly be true,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nas indeed had been reported by the great anthropologist,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nReichel-Dolmatoff.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nSo, literally two weeks ago,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nI returned from having spent six weeks with the Elder Brothers\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\non what was clearly the most\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nextraordinary trip of my life.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nThese really are a people who live and breathe\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nthe realm of the sacred,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\na baroque religiosity that is simply awesome.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nThey consume more coca leaves than any human population,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nhalf a pound per man, per day.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nThe gourd you see here is --\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\neverything in their lives is symbolic.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nTheir central metaphor is a loom.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nThey say, \"Upon this loom, I weave my life.\"\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nThey refer to the movements as they exploit the ecological niches of the gradient\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nas \"threads.\"\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nWhen they pray for the dead, they make these gestures with their hands,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nspinning their thoughts into the heavens.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nYou can see the calcium buildup on the head of the poporo gourd.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nThe gourd is a feminine aspect; the stick is a male.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nYou put the stick in the powder\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nto take the sacred ashes -- well, they're not ashes,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nthey're burnt limestone --\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nto empower the coca leaf, to change\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nthe pH of the mouth to facilitate the absorption\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nof cocaine hydrochloride.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nBut if you break a gourd, you cannot simply throw it away,\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nbecause every stroke of that stick\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nthat has built up that calcium,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nthe measure of a man's life,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nhas a thought behind it.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nFields are planted in such an extraordinary way,\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nthat the one side of the field\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nis planted like that by the women.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nThe other side is planted like that by the men. Metaphorically,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nyou turn it on the side, and you have a piece of cloth.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nAnd they are the descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nthe greatest goldsmiths of South America,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nwho in the wake of the conquest,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nretreated into this isolated volcanic massif\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nthat soars to 20,000 feet\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nabove the Caribbean coastal plain.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nThere are four societies:\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nthe Kogi, the Wiwa, the Kankwano and the Arhuacos.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nI traveled with the Arhuacos,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nand the wonderful thing about this story\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nwas that this man, Danilo Villafane --\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nif we just jump back here for a second.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nWhen I first met Danilo, in the Colombian embassy in Washington,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nI couldn't help but say, \"You know,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nyou look a lot like an old friend of mine.\"\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nWell, it turns out he was the son of my friend, Adalberto,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nfrom 1974, who had been killed by the FARC.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd I said, \"Danilo, you won't remember this,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nbut when you were an infant, I carried you on my back,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nup and down the mountains.\"\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nAnd because of that, Danilo invited us\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nto go to the very heart of the world,\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\na place where no journalist had ever been permitted.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nNot simply to the flanks of the mountains,\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nbut to the very iced peaks which are the destiny of the pilgrims.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nAnd this man sitting cross-legged\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nis now a grown-up Eugenio,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\na man who I've known since 1974.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nAnd this is one of those initiates.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nNo, it's not true that they're kept in the darkness for 18 years,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nbut they are kept within the confines\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nof the ceremonial men's circle\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nfor 18 years.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nThis little boy will never step outside\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nof the sacred fields\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nthat surround the men's hut for all that time,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nuntil he begins his journey of initiation.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nFor that entire time, the world only exists as an abstraction,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nas he is taught the values of society,\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nincluding this notion that their prayers alone\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nmaintain the cosmic balance.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nBefore we could begin our journey,\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nwe had to be cleansed at the portal of the Earth.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd it was extraordinary to be taken by a priest.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nAnd you see that the priest never wears shoes because holy feet --\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nthere must be nothing between the feet\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nand the Earth for a mamo.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nAnd this is actually the place where the Great Mother\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nsent the spindle into the world\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nthat elevated the mountains and created the homeland\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nthat they call the heart of the world.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nWe traveled high into the paramo,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nand as we crested the hills,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nwe realized that the men were interpreting\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nevery single bump on the landscape\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nin terms of their own intense religiosity.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nAnd then of course, as we reached our final destination,\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\na place called Mamancana,\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nwe were in for a surprise,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nbecause the FARC were waiting to kidnap us.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nAnd so we ended up being taken aside into these huts,\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nhidden away until the darkness.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nAnd then, abandoning all our gear,\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nwe were forced to ride out in the middle of the night,\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nin a quite dramatic scene.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nIt's going to look like a John Ford Western.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nAnd we ran into a FARC patrol at dawn, so it was quite harrowing.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nIt will be a very interesting film. But what was fascinating\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nis that the minute there was a sense of dangers,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nthe mamos went into a circle of divination.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nAnd of course, this is a photograph\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nliterally taken the night we were in hiding,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nas they divine their route\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nto take us out of the mountains.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nWe were able to, because we had trained\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\npeople in filmmaking,\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\ncontinue with our work,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nand send our Wiwa and Arhuaco filmmakers\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nto the final sacred lakes\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nto get the last shots for the film,\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nand we followed the rest of the Arhuaco back to the sea,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\ntaking the elements from the highlands to the sea.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nAnd here you see how their sacred landscape\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nhas been covered by brothels and hotels and casinos,\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nand yet, still they pray.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nAnd it's an amazing thing to think\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nthat this close to Miami,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\ntwo hours from Miami, there is an entire civilization of people\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\npraying every day for your well-being.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nThey call themselves the Elder Brothers.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nThey dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nas the Younger Brothers. They cannot understand\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nwhy it is that we do what we do to the Earth.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nNow, if we slip to another end of the world,\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nI was up in the high Arctic\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nto tell a story about global warming,\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:31.958\ninspired in part by\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nthe former Vice President's wonderful book.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nAnd what struck me so extraordinary\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nwas to be again with the Inuit --\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.958\na people who don't fear the cold, but take advantage of it.\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nA people who\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nfind a way, with their imagination,\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nto carve life out of that very frozen.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nA people for whom blood on ice\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nis not a sign of death, but an affirmation of life.\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nAnd yet tragically, when you now go to those northern communities,\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nyou find to your astonishment\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nthat whereas the sea ice used to come in in September\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nand stay till July,\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nin a place like Kanak in northern Greenland,\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nit literally comes in now in November\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nand stays until March.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nSo, their entire year has been cut in half.\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nNow, I want to stress that none of these peoples\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nthat I've been quickly talking about here\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nare disappearing worlds.\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nThese are not dying peoples.\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nOn the contrary, you know,\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nif you have the heart to feel and the eyes to see,\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nyou discover that the world is not flat.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nThe world remains a rich tapestry.\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nIt remains a rich topography of the spirit.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nThese myriad voices of humanity\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nare not failed attempts at being new,\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nfailed attempts at being modern.\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nThey're unique facets of the human imagination.\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nThey're unique answers to a fundamental question:\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nwhat does it mean to be human and alive?\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nAnd when asked that question, they respond\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nwith 6,000 different voices.\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nAnd collectively, those voices become our human repertoire\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nfor dealing with the challenges that will confront us\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nin the ensuing millennia.\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nOur industrial society is scarcely\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:58.958\n300 years old.\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nThat shallow history shouldn't suggest to anyone\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nthat we have all of the answers\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nfor all of the questions that will confront us\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nin the ensuing millennia.\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nThe myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being us.\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:12.958\nThey are unique answers to that fundamental question:\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nwhat does it mean to be human and alive?\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nAnd there is indeed a fire burning over the Earth,\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:20.958\ntaking with it not only plants and animals,\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nbut the legacy of humanity's brilliance.\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nRight now, as we sit here in this room,\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nof those 6,000 languages spoken the day that you were born,\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nfully half aren't being taught to children.\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:31.958\nSo, you're living through a time\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nwhen virtually half of humanity's intellectual,\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nsocial and spiritual legacy\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:38.958\nis being allowed to slip away.\n\n00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nThis does not have to happen.\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nThese peoples are not failed attempts at being modern --\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nquaint and colorful and destined to fade away\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nas if by natural law.\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nIn every case, these are dynamic, living peoples\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:52.958\nbeing driven out of existence by identifiable forces.\n\n00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nThat's actually an optimistic observation,\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nbecause it suggests that if human beings\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:18:59.958\nare the agents of cultural destruction,\n\n00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nwe can also be, and must be,\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:03.958\nthe facilitators of cultural survival.\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nThank you very much."}, {"title": "The ancestor of

[{"title": "Creative houses from reclaimed stuff", "duration": "1077", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_phillips_creative_houses_from_reclaimed_stuff", "transcript": "(Applause)Thank you very much. I have a few pictures, and I'll talk a little bit about how I'm able to do what I do. All these houses are built from between 70 and 80 percent recycled material, stuff that was headed to the mulcher, the landfill, the burn pile. It was all just gone. This is the first house I built. This double front door here with the three-light transom, that was headed to the landfill. Have a little turret there. And then these buttons on the corbels here \u2014 right there \u2014 those are hickory nuts. And these buttons there \u2014 those are chicken eggs.(Laughter)Of course, first you have breakfast, and then you fill the shell full of Bondo and paint it and nail it up, and you have an architectural button in just a fraction of the time.This is a look at the inside. You can see the three-light transom there with the eyebrow windows. Certainly an architectural antique headed to the landfill \u2014 even the lockset is probably worth 200 dollars. Everything in the kitchen was salvaged. There's a 1952 O'Keefe & Merritt stove, if you like to cook \u2014 cool stove. This is going up into the turret. I got that staircase for 20 dollars, including delivery to my lot.(Laughter)Then, looking up in the turret, you see there are bulges and pokes and sags and so forth. Well, if that ruins your life, well, then, you shouldn't live there.(Laughter)This is a laundry chute. And this right here is a shoe last \u2014 those are those cast-iron things you see at antique shops. So I had one of those, so I made some low-tech gadgetry, where you just stomp on the shoe last, and then the door flies open and you throw your laundry down. And then if you're smart enough, it goes on a basket on top of the washer. If not, it goes into the toilet.(Laughter)This is a bathtub I made, made out of scrap two-by-four. Started with the rim, and then glued and nailed it up into a flat, corbeled it up and flipped it over, then did the two profiles on this side. It's a two-person tub. After all, it's not just a question of hygiene, but there's a possibility of recreation as well.(Laughter)Then, this faucet here is just a piece of Osage orange. It looks a little phallic, but after all, it's a bathroom.(Laughter)This is a house based on a Budweiser can. It doesn't look like a can of beer, but the design take-offs are absolutely unmistakable: the barley hops design worked up into the eaves, then the dentil work comes directly off the can's red, white, blue and silver. Then, these corbels going down underneath the eaves are that little design that comes off the can. I just put a can on a copier and kept enlarging it until I got the size I want. Then, on the can it says, \"This is the famous Budweiser beer, we know of no other beer, blah, blah, blah.\" So we changed that and put, \"This is the famous Budweiser house. We don't know of any other house ...\" and so forth and so on. This is a deadbolt. It's a fence from a 1930s shaper, which is a very angry woodworking machine. And they gave me the fence, but they didn't give me the shaper, so we made a deadbolt out of it. That'll keep bull elephants out, I promise.(Laughter)And sure enough, we've had no problems with bull elephants.(Laughter)The shower is intended to simulate a glass of beer. We've got bubbles going up there, then suds at the top with lumpy tiles. Where do you get lumpy tiles? Well, of course, you don't. But I get a lot of toilets, and so you just dispatch a toilet with a hammer, and then you have lumpy tiles. And then the faucet is a beer tap.(Laughter)Then, this panel of glass is the same panel of glass that occurs in every middle-class front door in America. We're getting tired of it. It's kind of clich\u00e9d now. If you put it in the front door, your design fails. So don't put it in the front door; put it somewhere else. It's a pretty panel of glass. But if you put it in the front door, people say, \"Oh, you're trying to be like those guys, and you didn't make it.\" So don't put it there. Then, another bathroom upstairs. This light up here is the same light that occurs in every middle-class foyer in America. Don't put it in the foyer. Put it in the shower, or in the closet, but not in the foyer. Then, somebody gave me a bidet, so it got a bidet.(Laughter)This little house here, those branches there are made out of Bois d'arc or Osage orange. These pictures will keep scrolling as I talk a little bit.In order to do what I do, you have to understand what causes waste in the building industry. Our housing has become a commodity, and I'll talk a little bit about that. But the first cause of waste is probably even buried in our DNA. Human beings have a need for maintaining consistency of the apperceptive mass. What does that mean? What it means is, for every perception we have, it needs to tally with the one like it before, or we don't have continuity, and we become a little bit disoriented. So I can show you an object you've never seen before. Oh, that's a cell phone. But you've never seen this one before. What you're doing is sizing up the pattern of structural features, and then you go through your databanks: Cell phone. Oh! That's a cell phone. If I took a bite out of it, you'd go, \"Wait a second.(Laughter)\"That's not a cell phone. That's one of those new chocolate cell phones.\"(Laughter)You'd have to start a new category, right between cell phones and chocolate.(Laughter)That's how we process information.You translate that to the building industry. If we have a wall of windowpanes and one pane is cracked, we go, \"Oh, dear. That's cracked. Let's repair it. Let's take it out and throw it away so nobody can use it and put a new one in.\" Because that's what you do with a cracked pane. Never mind that it doesn't affect our lives at all. It only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural features. However, if we took a small hammer, and we added cracks to all the other windows \u2014(Laughter)then we have a pattern. Because Gestalt psychology emphasizes recognition of pattern over parts that comprise a pattern. We'll go, \"Ooh, that's nice.\" So, that serves me every day. Repetition creates pattern. If I have 100 of these, 100 of those, it makes no difference what these and those are. If I can repeat anything, I have the possibility of a pattern, from hickory nuts and chicken eggs, shards of glass, branches. It doesn't make any difference. That causes a lot of waste in the building industry.The second cause is, Friedrich Nietzsche, along about 1885, wrote a book titled \"The Birth of Tragedy.\" And in there, he said cultures tend to swing between one of two perspectives: on the one hand, we have an Apollonian perspective, which is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized and perfect. On the other end of the spectrum, we have a Dionysian perspective, which is more given to the passions and intuition, tolerant of organic texture and human gesture. So the way the Apollonian personality takes a picture or hangs a picture is, they'll get out a transit and a laser level and a micrometer. \"OK, honey. A thousandth of an inch to the left. That's where we want the picture. Right. Perfect!\" Predicated on plumb level, square and centered. The Dionysian personality takes the picture and goes:(Laughter)That's the difference. I feature blemish. I feature organic process. Dead center John Dewey. Apollonian mindset creates mountains of waste. If something isn't perfect, if it doesn't line up with that premeditated model? Dumpster. \"Oops. Scratch. Dumpster.\" \"Oops\" this, \"oops\" that. Landfill, landfill, landfill.The third thing is arguably \u2014 The Industrial Revolution started in the Renaissance with the rise of humanism, then got a little jump start along about the French Revolution. By the middle of the 19th century, it's in full flower. And we have dumaflaches and gizmos and contraptions that will do anything that we, up to that point, had to do by hand. So now we have standardized materials. Well, trees don't grow two inches by four inches, eight, ten and twelve feet tall.(Laughter)We create mountains of waste. And they're doing a pretty good job there in the forest, working all the byproduct of their industry \u2014 with OSB and particle board and so forth and so on \u2014 but it does no good to be responsible at the point of harvest in the forest if consumers are wasting the harvest at the point of consumption. And that's what's happening. And so if something isn't standard, \"Oops, dumpster.\" \"Oops\" this. \"Oops, warped.\" If you buy a two-by-four and it's not straight, you can take it back. \"Oh, I'm so sorry, sir. We'll get you a straight one.\" Well, I feature all those warped things because repetition creates pattern, and it's from a Dionysian perspective.The fourth thing is labor is disproportionately more expensive than materials. Well, that's just a myth. And there's a story: Jim Tulles, one of the guys I trained \u2014 I said, \"Jim, it's time now. I got a job for you as a foreman on a framing crew. Time for you to go.\" \"Dan, I just don't think I'm ready.\" \"Jim, now it's time. You're the down \u2014 oh!\" So we hired on. And he was out there with a tape measure, going through the trash heap, looking for header material, or the board that goes over a door, thinking he'd impress his boss \u2014 that's how we taught him to do it. The superintendent walked up and said, \"What are you doing?\" \"Oh, just looking for header material,\" waiting for that kudos. He said, \"I'm not paying you to go through the trash. Get back to work.\" And Jim had the wherewithal to say, \"You know, if you were paying me 300 dollars an hour, I can see how you might say that. But right now, I'm saving you five dollars a minute. Do the math.\"(Laughter)\"Good call, Tulles. From now on, you guys hit this pile first.\" And the irony is that he wasn't very good at math.(Laughter)But once in a while, you get access to the control room, and then you can kind of mess with the dials. And that's what happened there.The fifth thing is that maybe, after 2,500 years, Plato is still having his way with us in his notion of perfect forms. He said that we have in our noggin the perfect idea of what we want, and we force environmental resources to accommodate that. So we all have in our head the perfect house, the American dream, which is a house, the dream house. The problem is we can't afford it. So we have the American dream look-alike, which is a mobile home. Now there's a blight on the planet.(Laughter)It's a chattel mortgage, just like furniture, just like a car. You write the check, and instantly, it depreciates 30 percent. After a year, you can't get insurance on everything you have in it, only on 70 percent. Wired with 14-Gauge wire, typically. Nothing wrong with that, unless you ask it to do what 12-Gauge wire's supposed to do, and that's what happens. It out-gasses formaldehyde \u2014 so much so that there is a federal law in place to warn new mobile home buyers of the formaldehyde atmosphere danger. Are we just being numbingly stupid? The walls are this thick. The whole thing has the structural value of corn.(Laughter)\"So ... I thought Palm Harbor Village was over there.\" \"No, no. We had a wind last night. It's gone now.\"(Laughter)Then when they degrade, what do you do with them?Now, all that \u2014 that Apollonian, Platonic model \u2014 is what the building industry is predicated on, and there are a number of things that exacerbate that. One is that all the professionals, all the tradesmen, vendors, inspectors, engineers, architects all think like this. And then it works its way back to the consumer, who demands the same model. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. We can't get out of it. Then here come the marketeers and the advertisers. \"Woo. Woo-hoo.\" We buy stuff we didn't know we needed. All we have to do is look at what one company did with carbonated prune juice. How disgusting.(Laughter)But you know what they did? They hooked a metaphor into it and said, \"I drink Dr. Pepper ...\" And pretty soon, we're swilling that stuff by the lake-ful, by the billions of gallons. It doesn't even have real prunes! Doesn't even keep you regular.(Laughter)My oh my, that makes it worse. And we get sucked into that faster than anything.Then, a man named Jean-Paul Sartre wrote a book titled \"Being and Nothingness.\" It's a pretty quick read. You can snap through it in maybe \u2014(Laughter)maybe two years, if you read eight hours a day. In there, he talked about the divided self. He said human beings act differently when they know they're alone than when they know somebody else is around. So if I'm eating spaghetti, and I know I'm alone, I can eat like a backhoe. I can wipe my mouth on my sleeve, napkin on the table, chew with my mouth open, make little noises, scratch wherever I want.(Laughter)But as soon as you walk in, I go, \"Oops! Lil' spaghetti sauce there.\" Napkin in my lap, half-bites, chew with my mouth closed, no scratching. Now, what I'm doing is fulfilling your expectations of how I should live my life. I feel that expectation, and so I accommodate it, and I'm living my life according to what you expect me to do. That happens in the building industry as well. That's why all subdivisions look the same. Sometimes, we even have these formalized cultural expectations. I'll bet all your shoes match. Sure enough, we all buy into that ...(Laughter)And with gated communities, we have a formalized expectation, with a homeowners' association. Sometimes those guys are Nazis, my oh my. That exacerbates and continues this model.The last thing is gregariousness. Human beings are a social species. We like to hang together in groups, just like wildebeests, just like lions. Wildebeests don't hang with lions, because lions eat wildebeests. Human beings are like that. We do what that group does that we're trying to identify with. You see this in junior high a lot. Those kids, they'll work all summer long \u2014 kill themselves \u2014 so that they can afford one pair of designer jeans. So along about September, they can stride in and go, \"I'm important today. See? Don't touch my designer jeans! I see you don't have designer jeans. You're not one of the beautiful \u2014 See, I'm one of the beautiful people. See my jeans?\" Right there is reason enough to have uniforms. And so that happens in the building industry as well.We have confused Maslow's hierarchy of needs, just a little bit. On the bottom tier, we have basic needs: shelter, clothing, food, water, mating and so forth. Second: security. Third: relationships. Fourth: status, self-esteem \u2014 that is, vanity \u2014 and we're taking vanity and shoving it down here. And so we end up with vain decisions, and we can't even afford our mortgage. We can't afford to eat anything except beans;that is, our housing has become a commodity. And it takes a little bit of nerve to dive into those primal, terrifying parts of ourselves and make our own decisions and not make our housing a commodity, but make it something that bubbles up from seminal sources. That takes a little bit of nerve, and, darn it, once in a while, you fail. But that's okay. If failure destroys you, then you can't do this. I fail all the time, every day, and I've had some whopping failures, I promise \u2014 big, public, humiliating, embarrassing failures.Everybody points and laughs, and they say, \"He tried it a fifth time, and it still didn't work! What a moron!\" Early on, contractors come by and say, \"Dan, you're a cute little bunny, but you know, this just isn't going to work. What don't you do this? Why don't you do that?\" And your instinct is to say, \"Well, why don't you suck an egg?\"(Laughter)But you don't say that, because they're the guys you're targeting.And so what we've done \u2014 and this isn't just in housing; it's in clothing and food and our transportation needs, our energy \u2014 we sprawl just a little bit. And when I get a little bit of press, I hear from people all over the world. And we may have invented excess, but the problem of waste is worldwide. We're in trouble. And I don't wear ammo belts crisscrossing my chest and a red bandana. But we're clearly in trouble. And what we need to do is reconnect with those really primal parts of ourselves and make some decisions and say, \"You know, I think I would like to put CDs across the wall there. What do you think, honey?\" If it doesn't work, take it down. What we need to do is reconnect with who we really are, and that's thrilling indeed.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1015, "subtitle":

design\nworked up into the eaves,\n\n00:02:55.187 --> 00:02:58.935\nthen the dentil work comes directly\noff the can's red, white, blue and silver.\n\n00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.397\nThen, these corbels going\ndown underneath the eaves\n\n00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:03.599\nare that little design\nthat comes off the can.\n\n00:03:03.623 --> 00:03:06.242\nI just put a can on a copier\nand kept enlarging it\n\n00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:07.782\nuntil I got the size I want.\n\n00:03:07.806 --> 00:03:10.353\nThen, on the can it says,\n\n00:03:10.377 --> 00:03:12.084\n\"This is the famous Budweiser beer,\n\n00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:14.166\nwe know of no other beer,\nblah, blah, blah.\"\n\n00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.483\nSo we changed that and put,\n\n00:03:15.507 --> 00:03:19.006\n\"This is the famous Budweiser house.\nWe don't know of any other house ...\"\n\n00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.182\nand so forth and so on.\n\n00:03:20.206 --> 00:03:21.363\nThis is a deadbolt.\n\n00:03:21.387 --> 00:03:25.129\nIt's a fence from a 1930s shaper,\nwhich is a very angry woodworking machine.\n\n00:03:25.153 --> 00:03:28.129\nAnd they gave me the fence,\nbut they didn't give me the shaper,\n\n00:03:28.153 --> 00:03:29.824\nso we made a deadbolt out of it.\n\n00:03:29.848 --> 00:03:32.089\nThat'll keep bull elephants\nout, I promise.\n\n00:03:32.113 --> 00:03:33.118\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:33.142 --> 00:03:35.996\nAnd sure enough, we've had\nno problems with bull elephants.\n\n00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.182\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:37.206 -->

My name is Birke Baehr, and I'm 11 years old. I came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system. First of all, I would like to say that I'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe all the marketing and advertising on TV, at public schools and pretty much everywhere else you look. It seems to me like corporations are always trying to get kids, like me, to get their parents to buy stuff that really isn't good for us or the planet. Little kids, especially, are attracted by colorful packaging and plastic toys. I must admit, I used to be one of them. I also used to think that all of our food came from these happy, little farms where pigs rolled in mud and cows grazed on grass all day.What I discovered was this is not true. I began to look into this stuff on the Internet, in books and in documentary films, in my travels with my family. I discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system. First, there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms. That is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory to do something not intended by nature \u2014 like taking the DNA of a fish and putting it into the DNA of a tomato. Yuck. Don't get me wrong, I like fish and tomatoes, but this is just creepy. (Laughter) The seeds are then planted, then grown. The food they produce have been proven to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals, and people have been eating food produced this way since the 1990s. And most folks don't even know they exist. Did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity? These include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight. Yet almost all the corn we eat has been altered genetically in some way. And let me tell you, corn is in everything. And don't even get me started on the Confined Animal Feeding Operations called CAFOS.(Laughter)Conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers made from fossil fuels that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow. They do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients from growing the same crop over and over again. Next, more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables, like pesticides and herbicides, to kill weeds and bugs. When it rains, these chemicals seep into the ground, or run off into our waterways, poisoning our water too. Then they irradiate our food, trying to make it last longer, so it can travel thousands of miles from where it's grown to the supermarkets.So I ask myself, how can I change? How can I change these things? This is what I found out. I discovered that there's a movement for a better way. Now a while back, I wanted to be an NFL football player. I decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead. (Applause) Thank you. And that way I can have a greater impact on the world. This man, Joel Salatin, they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system. Since I'm home-schooled, I went to go hear him speak one day. This man, this \"lunatic farmer,\" doesn't use any pesticides, herbicides, or genetically modified seeds. And so for that, he's called crazy by the system.I want you to know that we can all make a difference by making different choices, by buying our food directly from local farmers, or our neighbors who we know in real life. Some people say organic or local food is more expensive, but is it really? With all these things I've been learning about the food system, it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer, or we can pay the hospital. (Applause) Now I know definitely which one I would choose. I want you to know that there are farms out there \u2014 like Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee \u2014 whose cows do eat grass and whose pigs do roll in the mud, just like I thought. Sometimes I go to Bill's farm and volunteer, so I can see up close and personal where the meat I eat comes from. I want you to know that I believe kids will eat fresh vegetables and good food if they know more about it and where it really comes from. I want you to know that there are farmers' markets in every community popping up. I want you to know that me, my brother and sister actually like eating baked kale chips. I try to share this everywhere I go.Not too long ago, my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal. He asked him if he wanted organic Toasted O's or the sugarcoated flakes \u2014 you know, the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front. My little cousin told his dad that he would rather have the organic Toasted O's cereal because Birke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal. And that, my friends, is how we can make a difference one kid at a time.So next time you're at the grocery store, think local, choose organic, know your farmer and know your food. Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1016, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nHello.

To the first son, he left half the camels; to the second son, he left a third of the camels; and to the youngest son, he left a ninth of the camels. The three sons got into a negotiation \u2014 17 doesn't divide by two. It doesn't divide by three. It doesn't divide by nine. Brotherly tempers started to get strained. Finally, in desperation, they went and they consulted a wise old woman. The wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time, and finally she came back and said, \"Well, I don't know if I can help you, but at least, if you want, you can have my camel.\" So then, they had 18 camels. The first son took his half \u2014 half of 18 is nine. The second son took his third \u2014 a third of 18 is six. The youngest son took his ninth \u2014 a ninth of 18 is two. You get 17. They had one camel left over. They gave it back to the wise old woman.(Laughter)Now, if you think about that story for a moment, I think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in. They start off like 17 camels, no way to resolve it. Somehow, what we need to do is step back from those situations, like that wise old woman, look at the situation through fresh eyes and come up with an 18th camel. Finding that 18th camel in the world's conflicts has been my life passion.I basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers. We're all one family. We know that scientifically, thanks to the communications revolution, all the tribes on the planet \u2014 all 15,000 tribes \u2014 are in touch with each other. And it's a big family reunion. And yet, like many family reunions, it's not all peace and light. There's a lot of conflict, and the question is: How do we deal with our differences? How do we deal with our deepest differences, given the human propensity for conflict and the human genius at devising weapons of enormous destruction? That's the question.As I've spent the last better part of three decades, almost four, traveling the world, trying to work, getting involved in conflicts ranging from Yugoslavia to the Middle East to Chechnya to Venezuela \u2014 some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet \u2014 I've been asking myself that question. And I think I've found, in some ways, what is the secret to peace. It's actually surprisingly simple. It's not easy, but it's simple. It's not even new. It may be one of our most ancient human heritages. The secret to peace is us. It's us who act as a surrounding community around any conflict, who can play a constructive role.Let me give you just a story, an example. About 20 years ago, I was in South Africa, working with the parties in that conflict, and I had an extra month, so I spent some time living with several groups of San Bushmen. I was curious about them, about the way in which they resolve conflict. Because, after all, within living memory, they were hunters and gatherers, living pretty much like our ancestors lived for maybe 99 percent of the human story. And all the men have these poison arrows that they use for hunting \u2014 absolutely fatal. So how do they deal with their differences? Well, what I learned is, whenever tempers rise in those communities, someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush, and then everyone sits around in a circle like this, and they sit and they talk and they talk. It may take two days, three days, four days, but they don't rest until they find a resolution or better yet \u2014 a reconciliation. And if tempers are still too high, then they send someone off to visit some relatives, as a cooling-off period.Well, that system is, I think, probably the system that kept us alive to this point, given our human tendencies. That system, I call \"the third side.\" Because if you think about it, normally when we think of conflict, when we describe it, there's always two sides \u2014 it's Arabs versus Israelis, labor versus management, husband versus wife, Republicans versus Democrats. But what we don't often see is that there's always a third side, and the third side of the conflict is us, it's the surrounding community, it's the friends, the allies, the family members, the neighbors. And we can play an incredibly constructive role.Perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what's really at stake. For the sake of the kids, for the sake of the family, for the sake of the community, for the sake of the future, let's stop fighting for a moment and start talking. Because, the thing is, when we're involved in conflict, it's very easy to lose perspective. It's very easy to react. Human beings \u2014 we're reaction machines. And as the saying goes, when angry, you will make the best speech you will ever regret.(Laughter)And so the third side reminds us of that. The third side helps us go to the balcony, which is a metaphor for a place of perspective, where we can keep our eyes on the prize.Let me tell you a little story from my own negotiating experience. Some years ago, I was involved as a facilitator in some very tough talks between the leaders of Russia and the leaders of Chechnya. There was a war going on, as you know. And we met in the Hague, in the Peace Palace, in the same room where the Yugoslav war-crimes tribunal was taking place. And the talks got off to a rather rocky start when the vice president of Chechnya began by pointing at the Russians and said, \"You should stay right here in your seats, because you're going to be on trial for war crimes.\" And then he turned to me and said, \"You're an American. Look at what you Americans are doing in Puerto Rico.\" And my mind started racing, \"Puerto Rico? What do I know about Puerto Rico?\" I started reacting.(Laughter)But then, I tried to remember to go to the balcony. And then when he paused and everyone looked at me for a response, from a balcony perspective, I was able to thank him for his remarks and say, \"I appreciate your criticism of my country and I take it as a sign that we're among friends and can speak candidly to one another.\"(Laughter)\"And what we're here to do is not to talk about Puerto Rico or the past. We're here to see if we can figure out a way to stop the suffering and the bloodshed in Chechnya.\" The conversation got back on track. That's the role of the third side, to help the parties go to the balcony.Now let me take you, for a moment, to what's widely regarded as the world's most difficult conflict, or the most impossible conflict, the Middle East. Question is: where's the third side there? How could we possibly go to the balcony? Now, I don't pretend to have an answer to the Middle East conflict, but I think I've got a first step \u2014 literally, a first step \u2014 something that any one of us could do as third-siders. Let me just ask you one question first. How many of you in the last years have ever found yourself worrying about the Middle East and wondering what anyone could do? Just out of curiosity, how many of you? OK, so the great majority of us. And here, it's so far away. Why do we pay so much attention to this conflict? Is it the number of deaths? There are a hundred times more people who die in a conflict in Africa than in the Middle East. No, it's because of the story, because we feel personally involved in that story. Whether we're Christians, Muslims or Jews, religious or non-religious, we feel we have a personal stake in it.Stories matter; as an anthropologist, I know that. Stories are what we use to transmit knowledge. They give meaning to our lives. That's what we tell here at TED, we tell stories. Stories are the key. And so my question is \u2014 yes, let's try and resolve the politics there in the Middle East, but let's also take a look at the story. Let's try to get at the root of what it's all about. Let's see if we can apply the third side to it. What would that mean? What is the story there?Now, as anthropologists, we know that every culture has an origin story. What's the origin story of the Middle East? In a phrase, it's: Four thousand years ago, a man and his family walked across the Middle East, and the world has never been the same since. That man, of course, was Abraham. And what he stood for was unity, the unity of the family; he's the father of us all. But it's not just what he stood for, it's what his message was. His basic message was unity too, the interconnectedness of it all, the unity of it all. And his basic value was respect, was kindness toward strangers. That's what he's known for, his hospitality. So in that sense, he's the symbolic third side of the Middle East. He's the one who reminds us that we're all part of a greater whole. Now, think about that for a moment.Today, we face the scourge of terrorism. What is terrorism? Terrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger and treating them as an enemy whom you kill in order to create fear. What's the opposite of terrorism? It's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home, in order to sow and create understanding or respect, or love.So what if, then, you took the story of Abraham, which is a third-side story, what if that could be \u2014 because Abraham stands for hospitality \u2014 what if that could be an antidote to terrorism? What if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance? How would you bring that story to life? Now, it's not enough just to tell a story. That's powerful, but people need to experience the story. They need to be able to live the story. How would you do that? And that was my thinking of how would you do that. And that's what comes to the first step here. Because the simple way to do that is: you go for a walk. You go for a walk in the footsteps of Abraham. You retrace the footsteps of Abraham. Because walking has a real power. You know, as an anthropologist, walking is what made us human. It's funny \u2014 when you walk, you walk side-by-side, in the same common direction. Now if I were to come to you face-to-face and come this close to you, you would feel threatened. But if I walk shoulder-to-shoulder, even touching shoulders, it's no problem. Who fights while they walk? That's why in negotiations, often, when things get tough, people go for walks in the woods.So the idea came to me of, what about inspiring a path, a route \u2014 think the Silk Route, think the Appalachian Trail \u2014 that followed in the footsteps of Abraham? People said, \"That's crazy. You can't. You can't retrace the footsteps of Abraham \u2014 it's too insecure, you've got to cross all these borders, it goes across 10 different countries in the Middle East, because it unites them all.\" And so we studied the idea at Harvard. We did our due diligence. And then a few years ago, a group of us, about 25 of us from 10 different countries, decided to see if we could retrace the footsteps of Abraham, going from his initial birthplace in the city of Urfa in Southern Turkey, Northern Mesopotamia. And we then took a bus and took some walks and went to Harran, where, in the Bible, he sets off on his journey. Then we crossed the border into Syria, went to Aleppo, which, turns out, is named after Abraham. We went to Damascus, which has a long history associated with Abraham. We then came to Northern Jordan, to Jerusalem \u2014 which is all about Abraham \u2014 to Bethlehem, and finally, to the place where he's buried, in Hebron. So effectively, we went from womb to tomb. We showed it could be done. It was an amazing journey.Let me ask you a question. How many of you have had the experience of being in a strange neighborhood or strange land, and a total stranger, perfect stranger, comes up to you and shows you some kindness \u2014 maybe invites you into their home, gives you a drink, gives you a coffee, gives you a meal? How many of you have ever had that experience? That's the essence of the Abraham Path. That's what you discover as you go into these villages in the Middle East where you expect hostility, and you get the most amazing hospitality, all associated with Abraham: \"In the name of Father Ibrahim, let me offer you some food.\" So what we discovered is that Abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people; he's alive, he's a living presence.And to make a long story short, in the last couple of years now, thousands of people have begun to walk parts of the path of Abraham in the Middle East, enjoying the hospitality of the people there. They've begun to walk in Israel and Palestine, in Jordan, in Turkey, in Syria. It's an amazing experience. Men, women, young people, old people \u2014 more women than men, actually, interestingly.For those who can't walk, who are unable to get there right now, people started to organize walks in cities, in their own communities. In Cincinnati, for instance, they organized a walk from a church to a mosque to a synagogue and all had an Abrahamic meal together. It was Abraham Path Day. In S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, it's become an annual event for thousands of people to run in a virtual Abraham Path Run, uniting the different communities. The media love it; they really adore it. They lavish attention on it because it's visual and it spreads the idea, this idea of Abrahamic hospitality, of kindness towards strangers. And just a couple weeks ago, there was an NPR story on it. Last month, there was a piece in the Manchester Guardian about it, two whole pages. And they quoted a villager who said, \"This walk connects us to the world.\" He said, \"It was like a light that went on in our lives \u2014 it brought us hope.\" And so that's what it's about.But it's not just about psychology; it's about economics. Because as people walk, they spend money. And this woman right here, Um Ahmad, is a woman who lives on the path in Northern Jordan. She's desperately poor. She's partially blind, her husband can't work, she's got seven kids. But what she can do is cook. And so she's begun to cook for some groups of walkers who come through the village and have a meal in her home. They sit on the floor \u2014 she doesn't even have a tablecloth. She makes the most delicious food, that's fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside. And so more and more walkers have come, and lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family. And so she told our team there, she said, \"You have made me visible in a village where people were once ashamed to look at me.\" That's the potential of the Abraham Path.There are literally hundreds of those kinds of communities across the Middle East, across the path. The potential is basically to change the game. And to change the game, you have to change the frame, the way we see things \u2014 to change the frame from hostility to hospitality, from terrorism to tourism. And in that sense, the Abraham Path is a game-changer.Let me just show you one thing. I have a little acorn here that I picked up while I was walking on the path earlier this year. Now, the acorn is associated with the oak tree, of course \u2014 grows into an oak tree, which is associated with Abraham. The path right now is like an acorn; it's still in its early phase. What would the oak tree look like? When I think back to my childhood, a good part of which I spent, after being born here in Chicago, I spent in Europe. If you had been in the ruins of, say, London in 1945, or Berlin, and you had said, \"Sixty years from now, this is going to be the most peaceful, prosperous part of the planet,\" people would have thought you were certifiably insane. But they did it, thanks to a common identity, Europe, and a common economy. So my question is, if it can be done in Europe, why not in the Middle East? Why not, thanks to a common identity, which is the story of Abraham, and thanks to a common economy that would be based, in good part, on tourism?So let me conclude, then, by saying that in the last 35 years, as I've worked in some of the most dangerous, difficult and intractable conflicts around the planet, I have yet to see one conflict that I felt could not be transformed. It's not easy, of course. But it's possible. It was done in South Africa. It was done in Northern Ireland. It could be done anywhere. It simply depends on us. It depends on us taking the third side. So let me invite you to consider taking the third side, even as a very small step. We're about to take a break in a moment. Just go up to someone who's from a different culture, a different country, a different ethnicity \u2014 some difference \u2014 and engage them in a conversation. Listen to them. That's a third-side act. That's walking Abraham's Path. After a TED Talk, why not a TED Walk?(Laughter)So let me just leave you with three things. One is, the secret to peace is the third side. The third side is us. Each of us, with a single step, can take the world, can bring the world a step closer to peace. There's an old African proverb that goes: \"When spiderwebs unite, they can halt even the lion.\" If we're able to unite our third-side webs of peace, we can even halt the lion of war.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1017, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:15.132\nWell, the subject of difficult negotiation\n\n00:00:15.156 --> 00:00:18.934\nreminds me of one of my favorite stories\nfrom the Middle East,\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:22.712\nof a man who left\nto his three sons, 17 camels.\n\n00:00:22.736 --> 00:00:24.934\nTo the first son, he left half the camels;\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.348\nto the second son,\nhe left a third of the camels;\n\n00:00:27.372 --> 00:00:29.967\nand to the youngest son,\nhe left a ninth of the camels.\n\n00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:33.805\nThe three sons got into a negotiation --\n17 doesn't divide by two.\n\n00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.567\nIt doesn't divide by three.\n\n00:00:35.591 --> 00:00:37.130\nIt doesn't divide by nine.\n\n00:00:37.154 --> 00:00:39.400\nBrotherly tempers started to get strained.\n\n00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:40.703\nFinally, in desperation,\n\n00:00:40.727 --> 00:00:44.388\nthey went and they consulted\na wise old woman.\n\n00:00:44.412 --> 00:00:47.387\nThe wise old woman thought\nabout their problem for a long time,\n\n00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:50.915\nand finally she came back and said,\n\"Well, I don't know if I can help you,\n\n00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:53.316\nbut at least, if you want,\nyou can have my camel.\"\n\n00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.808\nSo then, they had 18 camels.\n\n00:00:54.832 --> 00:00:57.690\nThe first son took his half --\nhalf of 18 is nine.\n\n00:00:57.714 --> 00:01:00.408\nThe second son took his third --\na third of 18 is six.\n\n00:01:00.432 --> 00:01:03.934\nThe youngest son took his ninth --\na ninth of 18 is two.\n\n00:01:04.328 --> 00:01:06.517\nYou get 17.\n\n00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:08.351\nThey had one camel left over.\n\n00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:10.303\nThey gave it back to the wise old woman.\n\n00:01:10.327 --> 00:01:11.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.197\nNow, if you think\nabout that story for a moment,\n\n00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:17.792\nI think it resembles a lot\nof the difficult negotiations\n\n00:01:17.816 --> 00:01:19.030\nwe get involved in.\n\n00:01:19.054 --> 00:01:21.530\nThey start off like 17 camels,\nno way to resolve it.\n\n00:01:21.554 --> 00:01:22.990\nSomehow, what we need to do\n\n00:01:23.014 --> 00:01:26.695\nis step back from those situations,\nlike that wise old woman,\n\n00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.751\nlook at the situation through fresh eyes\n\n00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:30.712\nand come up with an 18th camel.\n\n00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:34.597\nFinding that 18th camel\nin the world's conflicts\n\n00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:36.779\nhas been my life passion.\n\n00:01:36.803 --> 00:01:39.934\nI basically see humanity\na bit like those three brothers.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.548\nWe're all one family.\n\n00:01:42.103 --> 00:01:44.052\nWe know that scientifically,\n\n00:01:44.076 --> 00:01:46.022\nthanks to the communications revolution,\n\n00:01:46.046 --> 00:01:49.614\nall the tribes on the planet --\nall 15,000 tribes --\n\n00:01:49.638 --> 00:01:51.249\nare in touch with each other.\n\n00:01:52.241 --> 00:01:54.634\nAnd it's a big family reunion.\n\n00:01:54.658 --> 00:01:56.340\nAnd yet, like many family reunions,\n\n00:01:56.364 --> 00:01:58.587\nit's not all peace and light.\n\n00:01:58.611 --> 00:02:00.512\nThere's a lot of conflict,\n\n00:02:00.536 --> 00:02:03.934\nand the question is:\nHow do we deal with our differences?\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.054\nHow do we deal with\nour deepest differences,\n\n00:02:06.078 --> 00:02:08.787\ngiven the human propensity for conflict\n\n00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:13.338\nand the human genius at devising\nweapons of enormous destruction?\n\n00:02:13.362 --> 00:02:15.111\nThat's the question.\n\n00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:19.934\nAs I've spent the last better part\nof three decades, almost four,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.013\ntraveling the world,\n\n00:02:22.037 --> 00:02:25.406\ntrying to work, getting\ninvolved in conflicts\n\n00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.810\nranging from Yugoslavia to the Middle East\n\n00:02:28.834 --> 00:02:30.558\nto Chechnya to Venezuela --\n\n00:02:30.582 --> 00:02:33.655\nsome of the most difficult conflicts\non the face of the planet --\n\n00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:35.770\nI've been asking myself that question.\n\n00:02:35.794 --> 00:02:39.190\nAnd I think I've found, in some ways,\nwhat is the secret to peace.\n\n00:02:39.214 --> 00:02:41.934\nIt's actually surprisingly simple.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:45.134\nIt's not easy, but it's simple.\n\n00:02:45.158 --> 00:02:46.389\nIt's not even new.\n\n00:02:46.413 --> 00:02:49.787\nIt may be one of our most\nancient human heritages.\n\n00:02:49.811 --> 00:02:52.128\nThe secret to peace is us.\n\n00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.762\nIt's us who act as a surrounding\ncommunity around any conflict,\n\n00:02:57.786 --> 00:02:59.934\nwho can play a constructive role.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nLet me give you just a story, an example.\n\n00:03:03.902 --> 00:03:05.054\nAbout 20 years ago,\n\n00:03:05.078 --> 00:03:08.319\nI was in South Africa,\nworking with the parties in that conflict,\n\n00:03:08.343 --> 00:03:09.606\nand I had an extra month,\n\n00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.196\nso I spent some time living\nwith several groups of San Bushmen.\n\n00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.164\nI was curious about them, about the way\nin which they resolve conflict.\n\n00:03:18.188 --> 00:03:21.934\nBecause, after all, within living memory,\nthey were hunters and gatherers,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.314\nliving pretty much\nlike our ancestors lived\n\n00:03:24.338 --> 00:03:26.600\nfor maybe 99 percent of the human story.\n\n00:03:27.171 --> 00:03:30.534\nAnd all the men have these poison arrows\nthat they use for hunting --\n\n00:03:30.558 --> 00:03:32.076\nabsolutely fatal.\n\n00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.394\nSo how do they deal\nwith their differences?\n\n00:03:34.418 --> 00:03:39.007\nWell, what I learned is, whenever\ntempers rise in those communities,\n\n00:03:39.031 --> 00:03:42.602\nsomeone goes and hides\nthe poison arrows out in the bush,\n\n00:03:42.626 --> 00:03:46.261\nand then everyone sits around\nin a circle like this,\n\n00:03:46.285 --> 00:03:49.237\nand they sit and they talk and they talk.\n\n00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:51.572\nIt may take two days,\nthree days, four days,\n\n00:03:51.596 --> 00:03:54.934\nbut they don't rest\nuntil they find a resolution\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.934\nor better yet -- a reconciliation.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.991\nAnd if tempers are still too high,\n\n00:03:59.015 --> 00:04:01.554\nthen they send someone\noff to visit some relatives,\n\n00:04:01.578 --> 00:04:02.934\nas a cooling-off period.\n\n00:04:03.356 --> 00:04:06.341\nWell, that system is, I think,\nprobably the system\n\n00:04:06.365 --> 00:04:08.101\nthat kept us alive to this point,\n\n00:04:08.125 --> 00:04:09.934\ngiven our human tendencies.\n\n00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.990\nThat system, I call \"the third side.\"\n\n00:04:14.014 --> 00:04:17.133\nBecause if you think about it,\nnormally when we think of conflict,\n\n00:04:17.157 --> 00:04:18.308\nwhen we describe it,\n\n00:04:18.332 --> 00:04:19.705\nthere's always two sides --\n\n00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.435\nit's Arabs versus Israelis,\nlabor versus management,\n\n00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:25.610\nhusband versus wife,\nRepublicans versus Democrats.\n\n00:04:25.634 --> 00:04:27.419\nBut what we don't often see\n\n00:04:27.443 --> 00:04:29.809\nis that there's always a third side,\n\n00:04:29.833 --> 00:04:33.505\nand the third side of the conflict is us,\nit's the surrounding community,\n\n00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:34.934\nit's the friends, the allies,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.766\nthe family members, the neighbors.\n\n00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.718\nAnd we can play\nan incredibly constructive role.\n\n00:04:40.178 --> 00:04:44.993\nPerhaps the most fundamental way\nin which the third side can help\n\n00:04:45.017 --> 00:04:47.934\nis to remind the parties\nof what's really at stake.\n\n00:04:48.294 --> 00:04:50.798\nFor the sake of the kids,\nfor the sake of the family,\n\n00:04:50.822 --> 00:04:53.592\nfor the sake of the community,\nfor the sake of the future,\n\n00:04:53.616 --> 00:04:56.057\nlet's stop fighting for a moment\nand start talking.\n\n00:04:56.764 --> 00:04:58.239\nBecause, the thing is,\n\n00:04:58.263 --> 00:04:59.836\nwhen we're involved in conflict,\n\n00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.419\nit's very easy to lose perspective.\n\n00:05:02.443 --> 00:05:04.482\nIt's very easy to react.\n\n00:05:04.506 --> 00:05:07.379\nHuman beings -- we're reaction machines.\n\n00:05:07.403 --> 00:05:08.776\nAnd as the saying goes,\n\n00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.323\nwhen angry, you will make the best speech\n\n00:05:11.347 --> 00:05:12.832\nyou will ever regret.\n\n00:05:12.856 --> 00:05:14.514\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:14.538 --> 00:05:17.534\nAnd so the third side reminds us of that.\n\n00:05:17.558 --> 00:05:19.583\nThe third side helps us go to the balcony,\n\n00:05:19.607 --> 00:05:22.313\nwhich is a metaphor\nfor a place of perspective,\n\n00:05:22.337 --> 00:05:24.743\nwhere we can keep our eyes on the prize.\n\n00:05:24.767 --> 00:05:28.347\nLet me tell you a little story\nfrom my own negotiating experience.\n\n00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:33.442\nSome years ago, I was involved\nas a facilitator in some very tough talks\n\n00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:36.689\nbetween the leaders of Russia\nand the leaders of Chechnya.\n\n00:05:37.387 --> 00:05:39.364\nThere was a war going on, as you know.\n\n00:05:39.753 --> 00:05:42.934\nAnd we met in the Hague,\nin the Peace Palace,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:48.065\nin the same room where the Yugoslav\nwar-crimes tribunal was taking place.\n\n00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:50.961\nAnd the talks got off\nto a rather rocky start\n\n00:05:50.985 --> 00:05:54.393\nwhen the vice president of Chechnya\nbegan by pointing at the Russians\n\n00:05:54.417 --> 00:05:56.934\nand said, \"You should stay\nright here in your seats,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.769\nbecause you're going\nto be on trial for war crimes.\"\n\n00:05:59.793 --> 00:06:01.603\nAnd then he turned to me and said,\n\n00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:02.809\n\"You're an American.\n\n00:06:02.833 --> 00:06:06.059\nLook at what you Americans\nare doing in Puerto Rico.\"\n\n00:06:06.083 --> 00:06:09.706\nAnd my mind started racing, \"Puerto Rico?\nWhat do I know about Puerto Rico?\"\n\n00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:10.882\nI started reacting.\n\n00:06:10.906 --> 00:06:11.907\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:14.767\nBut then, I tried to remember\nto go to the balcony.\n\n00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:15.989\nAnd then when he paused\n\n00:06:16.013 --> 00:06:18.094\nand everyone looked at me for a response,\n\n00:06:18.118 --> 00:06:21.496\nfrom a balcony perspective,\nI was able to thank him for his remarks\n\n00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.297\nand say, \"I appreciate\nyour criticism of my country\n\n00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:26.768\nand I take it as a sign\nthat we're among friends\n\n00:06:26.792 --> 00:06:28.683\nand can speak candidly to one another.\"\n\n00:06:28.707 --> 00:06:29.708\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:29.732 --> 00:06:33.113\n\"And what we're here to do is not\nto talk about Puerto Rico or the past.\n\n00:06:33.137 --> 00:06:35.318\nWe're here to see\nif we can figure out a way\n\n00:06:35.342 --> 00:06:37.934\nto stop the suffering\nand the bloodshed in Chechnya.\"\n\n00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:41.124\nThe conversation got back on track.\n\n00:06:41.148 --> 00:06:42.807\nThat's the role of the third side,\n\n00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:44.912\nto help the parties go to the balcony.\n\n00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.007\nNow let me take you, for a moment,\n\n00:06:48.031 --> 00:06:51.096\nto what's widely regarded as the world's\nmost difficult conflict,\n\n00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.661\nor the most impossible conflict,\nthe Middle East.\n\n00:06:53.685 --> 00:06:56.934\nQuestion is: where's the third side there?\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.122\nHow could we possibly go to the balcony?\n\n00:06:59.463 --> 00:07:03.440\nNow, I don't pretend to have an answer\nto the Middle East conflict,\n\n00:07:03.464 --> 00:07:07.424\nbut I think I've got a first step --\nliterally, a first step --\n\n00:07:07.448 --> 00:07:10.435\nsomething that any one of us\ncould do as third-siders.\n\n00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:12.666\nLet me just ask you one question first.\n\n00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.683\nHow many of you in the last years\n\n00:07:16.707 --> 00:07:19.742\nhave ever found yourself\nworrying about the Middle East\n\n00:07:19.766 --> 00:07:21.518\nand wondering what anyone could do?\n\n00:07:21.542 --> 00:07:23.659\nJust out of curiosity, how many of you?\n\n00:07:23.683 --> 00:07:26.175\nOK, so the great majority of us.\n\n00:07:26.675 --> 00:07:28.279\nAnd here, it's so far away.\n\n00:07:28.303 --> 00:07:31.219\nWhy do we pay so much attention\nto this conflict?\n\n00:07:31.243 --> 00:07:32.934\nIs it the number of deaths?\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:36.355\nThere are a hundred times more people\nwho die in a conflict in Africa\n\n00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:37.530\nthan in the Middle East.\n\n00:07:37.554 --> 00:07:39.641\nNo, it's because of the story,\n\n00:07:39.665 --> 00:07:43.373\nbecause we feel personally\ninvolved in that story.\n\n00:07:43.397 --> 00:07:47.226\nWhether we're Christians, Muslims or Jews,\nreligious or non-religious,\n\n00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.123\nwe feel we have a personal stake in it.\n\n00:07:49.147 --> 00:07:50.298\nStories matter;\n\n00:07:50.322 --> 00:07:52.080\nas an anthropologist, I know that.\n\n00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:55.722\nStories are what we use\nto transmit knowledge.\n\n00:07:55.746 --> 00:07:57.267\nThey give meaning to our lives.\n\n00:07:57.291 --> 00:07:59.988\nThat's what we tell here\nat TED, we tell stories.\n\n00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:01.166\nStories are the key.\n\n00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.761\nAnd so my question is --\n\n00:08:04.428 --> 00:08:08.604\nyes, let's try and resolve the politics\nthere in the Middle East,\n\n00:08:08.628 --> 00:08:11.152\nbut let's also take a look at the story.\n\n00:08:11.176 --> 00:08:13.620\nLet's try to get at the root\nof what it's all about.\n\n00:08:13.644 --> 00:08:15.864\nLet's see if we can apply\nthe third side to it.\n\n00:08:15.888 --> 00:08:18.692\nWhat would that mean?\nWhat is the story there?\n\n00:08:18.716 --> 00:08:22.934\nNow, as anthropologists, we know\nthat every culture has an origin story.\n\n00:08:23.454 --> 00:08:25.555\nWhat's the origin story\nof the Middle East?\n\n00:08:25.579 --> 00:08:26.934\nIn a phrase, it's:\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.549\nFour thousand years ago,\n\n00:08:28.573 --> 00:08:32.563\na man and his family walked\nacross the Middle East,\n\n00:08:32.587 --> 00:08:35.158\nand the world has never\nbeen the same since.\n\n00:08:35.769 --> 00:08:38.204\nThat man, of course, was Abraham.\n\n00:08:39.267 --> 00:08:42.934\nAnd what he stood for was unity,\nthe unity of the family;\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.934\nhe's the father of us all.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.947\nBut it's not just what he stood for,\nit's what his message was.\n\n00:08:47.971 --> 00:08:49.934\nHis basic message was unity too,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:53.168\nthe interconnectedness of it all,\nthe unity of it all.\n\n00:08:53.192 --> 00:08:56.502\nAnd his basic value was respect,\n\n00:08:56.526 --> 00:08:58.394\nwas kindness toward strangers.\n\n00:08:58.418 --> 00:09:01.435\nThat's what he's known for,\nhis hospitality.\n\n00:09:02.006 --> 00:09:03.633\nSo in that sense,\n\n00:09:03.657 --> 00:09:07.617\nhe's the symbolic third side\nof the Middle East.\n\n00:09:07.641 --> 00:09:12.064\nHe's the one who reminds us\nthat we're all part of a greater whole.\n\n00:09:12.405 --> 00:09:15.698\nNow, think about that for a moment.\n\n00:09:16.372 --> 00:09:18.820\nToday, we face the scourge of terrorism.\n\n00:09:19.249 --> 00:09:20.527\nWhat is terrorism?\n\n00:09:21.106 --> 00:09:24.365\nTerrorism is basically\ntaking an innocent stranger\n\n00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:28.934\nand treating them as an enemy\nwhom you kill in order to create fear.\n\n00:09:29.561 --> 00:09:31.347\nWhat's the opposite of terrorism?\n\n00:09:31.934 --> 00:09:33.654\nIt's taking an innocent stranger\n\n00:09:33.678 --> 00:09:38.065\nand treating them as a friend\nwhom you welcome into your home,\n\n00:09:38.089 --> 00:09:40.781\nin order to sow and create understanding\n\n00:09:40.805 --> 00:09:42.593\nor respect, or love.\n\n00:09:43.551 --> 00:09:48.211\nSo what if, then, you took\nthe story of Abraham,\n\n00:09:48.235 --> 00:09:49.868\nwhich is a third-side story,\n\n00:09:49.892 --> 00:09:51.934\nwhat if that could be --\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.279\nbecause Abraham stands for hospitality --\n\n00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:58.517\nwhat if that could be\nan antidote to terrorism?\n\n00:09:58.541 --> 00:10:02.363\nWhat if that could be a vaccine\nagainst religious intolerance?\n\n00:10:02.387 --> 00:10:04.934\nHow would you bring that story to life?\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.720\nNow, it's not enough just to tell a story.\n\n00:10:07.744 --> 00:10:11.138\nThat's powerful, but people need\nto experience the story.\n\n00:10:11.162 --> 00:10:13.116\nThey need to be able to live the story.\n\n00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.416\nHow would you do that?\n\n00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.934\nAnd that was my thinking\nof how would you do that.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.101\nAnd that's what comes\nto the first step here.\n\n00:10:19.125 --> 00:10:21.848\nBecause the simple way to do that is:\n\n00:10:21.872 --> 00:10:23.657\nyou go for a walk.\n\n00:10:23.681 --> 00:10:27.096\nYou go for a walk\nin the footsteps of Abraham.\n\n00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.048\nYou retrace the footsteps of Abraham.\n\n00:10:30.072 --> 00:10:32.981\nBecause walking has a real power.\n\n00:10:33.368 --> 00:10:36.425\nYou know, as an anthropologist,\nwalking is what made us human.\n\n00:10:36.449 --> 00:10:40.644\nIt's funny -- when you walk,\nyou walk side-by-side,\n\n00:10:40.668 --> 00:10:42.934\nin the same common direction.\n\n00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.371\nNow if I were to come to you face-to-face\n\n00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:47.641\nand come this close to you,\n\n00:10:47.665 --> 00:10:51.064\nyou would feel threatened.\n\n00:10:51.675 --> 00:10:53.730\nBut if I walk shoulder-to-shoulder,\n\n00:10:53.754 --> 00:10:55.635\neven touching shoulders,\n\n00:10:55.659 --> 00:10:56.934\nit's no problem.\n\n00:10:57.366 --> 00:10:58.934\nWho fights while they walk?\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.934\nThat's why in negotiations,\noften, when things get tough,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.353\npeople go for walks in the woods.\n\n00:11:04.377 --> 00:11:09.799\nSo the idea came to me\nof, what about inspiring a path,\n\n00:11:09.823 --> 00:11:13.461\na route -- think the Silk Route,\nthink the Appalachian Trail --\n\n00:11:13.485 --> 00:11:17.711\nthat followed in the footsteps of Abraham?\n\n00:11:17.735 --> 00:11:19.560\nPeople said, \"That's crazy. You can't.\n\n00:11:19.584 --> 00:11:22.596\nYou can't retrace the footsteps\nof Abraham -- it's too insecure,\n\n00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.478\nyou've got to cross all these borders,\n\n00:11:24.502 --> 00:11:27.184\nit goes across 10 different countries\nin the Middle East,\n\n00:11:27.208 --> 00:11:28.605\nbecause it unites them all.\"\n\n00:11:29.048 --> 00:11:30.884\nAnd so we studied the idea at Harvard.\n\n00:11:30.908 --> 00:11:32.138\nWe did our due diligence.\n\n00:11:32.162 --> 00:11:33.361\nAnd then a few years ago,\n\n00:11:33.385 --> 00:11:36.115\na group of us, about 25 of us\nfrom 10 different countries,\n\n00:11:36.139 --> 00:11:39.319\ndecided to see if we could retrace\nthe footsteps of Abraham,\n\n00:11:39.343 --> 00:11:41.843\ngoing from his initial birthplace\nin the city of Urfa\n\n00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:44.038\nin Southern Turkey, Northern Mesopotamia.\n\n00:11:44.546 --> 00:11:47.506\nAnd we then took a bus and took some walks\n\n00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:51.687\nand went to Harran, where, in the Bible,\nhe sets off on his journey.\n\n00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:54.264\nThen we crossed the border\ninto Syria, went to Aleppo,\n\n00:11:54.288 --> 00:11:56.636\nwhich, turns out, is named after Abraham.\n\n00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.934\nWe went to Damascus,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.702\nwhich has a long history\nassociated with Abraham.\n\n00:12:00.726 --> 00:12:03.488\nWe then came to Northern Jordan,\n\n00:12:03.512 --> 00:12:08.538\nto Jerusalem -- which is all\nabout Abraham -- to Bethlehem,\n\n00:12:08.562 --> 00:12:11.933\nand finally, to the place\nwhere he's buried, in Hebron.\n\n00:12:11.957 --> 00:12:14.240\nSo effectively, we went from womb to tomb.\n\n00:12:14.264 --> 00:12:15.565\nWe showed it could be done.\n\n00:12:15.589 --> 00:12:16.958\nIt was an amazing journey.\n\n00:12:17.292 --> 00:12:18.934\nLet me ask you a question.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:23.321\nHow many of you have had the experience\nof being in a strange neighborhood\n\n00:12:23.345 --> 00:12:25.561\nor strange land,\n\n00:12:25.585 --> 00:12:28.750\nand a total stranger, perfect stranger,\n\n00:12:28.774 --> 00:12:31.496\ncomes up to you\nand shows you some kindness --\n\n00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.019\nmaybe invites you into their home,\ngives you a drink,\n\n00:12:34.043 --> 00:12:35.822\ngives you a coffee, gives you a meal?\n\n00:12:35.846 --> 00:12:38.016\nHow many of you have ever\nhad that experience?\n\n00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.831\nThat's the essence of the Abraham Path.\n\n00:12:40.855 --> 00:12:44.372\nThat's what you discover as you go\ninto these villages in the Middle East\n\n00:12:44.396 --> 00:12:45.731\nwhere you expect hostility,\n\n00:12:45.755 --> 00:12:48.302\nand you get the most amazing hospitality,\n\n00:12:48.326 --> 00:12:49.735\nall associated with Abraham:\n\n00:12:49.759 --> 00:12:53.519\n\"In the name of Father Ibrahim,\nlet me offer you some food.\"\n\n00:12:53.543 --> 00:12:54.726\nSo what we discovered\n\n00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.958\nis that Abraham is not just a figure\nout of a book for those people;\n\n00:12:57.982 --> 00:13:01.138\nhe's alive, he's a living presence.\n\n00:13:01.162 --> 00:13:03.289\nAnd to make a long story short,\n\n00:13:03.313 --> 00:13:05.375\nin the last couple of years now,\n\n00:13:05.399 --> 00:13:10.235\nthousands of people have begun to walk\nparts of the path of Abraham\n\n00:13:10.259 --> 00:13:11.592\nin the Middle East,\n\n00:13:11.616 --> 00:13:14.671\nenjoying the hospitality\nof the people there.\n\n00:13:14.695 --> 00:13:17.934\nThey've begun to walk\nin Israel and Palestine,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.678\nin Jordan, in Turkey, in Syria.\n\n00:13:20.702 --> 00:13:22.011\nIt's an amazing experience.\n\n00:13:22.035 --> 00:13:24.320\nMen, women, young people, old people --\n\n00:13:24.344 --> 00:13:27.175\nmore women than men,\nactually, interestingly.\n\n00:13:27.199 --> 00:13:29.134\nFor those who can't walk,\n\n00:13:29.158 --> 00:13:31.673\nwho are unable to get there right now,\n\n00:13:31.697 --> 00:13:35.317\npeople started to organize walks\nin cities, in their own communities.\n\n00:13:35.341 --> 00:13:37.715\nIn Cincinnati, for instance,\nthey organized a walk\n\n00:13:37.739 --> 00:13:41.581\nfrom a church to a mosque to a synagogue\nand all had an Abrahamic meal together.\n\n00:13:41.605 --> 00:13:43.067\nIt was Abraham Path Day.\n\n00:13:43.091 --> 00:13:45.497\nIn S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil,\nit's become an annual event\n\n00:13:45.521 --> 00:13:49.349\nfor thousands of people to run\nin a virtual Abraham Path Run,\n\n00:13:49.373 --> 00:13:51.144\nuniting the different communities.\n\n00:13:51.168 --> 00:13:54.148\nThe media love it; they really adore it.\n\n00:13:54.172 --> 00:13:57.626\nThey lavish attention on it\nbecause it's visual\n\n00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:59.314\nand it spreads the idea,\n\n00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:03.720\nthis idea of Abrahamic hospitality,\nof kindness towards strangers.\n\n00:14:03.744 --> 00:14:07.934\nAnd just a couple weeks ago,\nthere was an NPR story on it.\n\n00:14:08.547 --> 00:14:09.715\nLast month,\n\n00:14:09.739 --> 00:14:15.656\nthere was a piece\nin the Manchester Guardian about it,\n\n00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.545\ntwo whole pages.\n\n00:14:18.307 --> 00:14:21.527\nAnd they quoted a villager\n\n00:14:21.551 --> 00:14:24.638\nwho said, \"This walk connects\nus to the world.\"\n\n00:14:24.662 --> 00:14:27.479\nHe said, \"It was like a light\nthat went on in our lives --\n\n00:14:27.503 --> 00:14:28.934\nit brought us hope.\"\n\n00:14:29.394 --> 00:14:31.476\nAnd so that's what it's about.\n\n00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.306\nBut it's not just about psychology;\n\n00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:34.806\nit's about economics.\n\n00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.934\nBecause as people walk, they spend money.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.934\nAnd this woman right here, Um Ahmad,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:44.108\nis a woman who lives on the path\nin Northern Jordan.\n\n00:14:44.132 --> 00:14:45.934\nShe's desperately poor.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:49.603\nShe's partially blind,\nher husband can't work,\n\n00:14:49.627 --> 00:14:51.579\nshe's got seven kids.\n\n00:14:52.071 --> 00:14:53.934\nBut what she can do is cook.\n\n00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:57.170\nAnd so she's begun to cook\nfor some groups of walkers\n\n00:14:57.194 --> 00:15:00.798\nwho come through the village\nand have a meal in her home.\n\n00:15:00.822 --> 00:15:04.122\nThey sit on the floor --\nshe doesn't even have a tablecloth.\n\n00:15:04.146 --> 00:15:05.934\nShe makes the most delicious food,\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:09.080\nthat's fresh from the herbs\nin the surrounding countryside.\n\n00:15:09.104 --> 00:15:11.231\nAnd so more and more walkers have come,\n\n00:15:11.255 --> 00:15:15.149\nand lately she's begun to earn an income\nto support her family.\n\n00:15:15.173 --> 00:15:18.050\nAnd so she told our team there, she said,\n\n00:15:18.074 --> 00:15:21.240\n\"You have made me visible\n\n00:15:21.264 --> 00:15:24.934\nin a village where people\nwere once ashamed to look at me.\"\n\n00:15:25.713 --> 00:15:27.934\nThat's the potential of the Abraham Path.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.720\nThere are literally hundreds\nof those kinds of communities\n\n00:15:30.744 --> 00:15:33.210\nacross the Middle East, across the path.\n\n00:15:34.154 --> 00:15:37.060\nThe potential is basically\nto change the game.\n\n00:15:37.417 --> 00:15:41.123\nAnd to change the game, you have to change\nthe frame, the way we see things --\n\n00:15:41.147 --> 00:15:46.465\nto change the frame\nfrom hostility to hospitality,\n\n00:15:46.489 --> 00:15:48.934\nfrom terrorism to tourism.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.695\nAnd in that sense, the Abraham Path\n\n00:15:51.719 --> 00:15:53.330\nis a game-changer.\n\n00:15:53.845 --> 00:15:55.623\nLet me just show you one thing.\n\n00:15:55.647 --> 00:15:57.257\nI have a little acorn here\n\n00:15:57.281 --> 00:16:00.768\nthat I picked up while I was walking\non the path earlier this year.\n\n00:16:01.324 --> 00:16:04.171\nNow, the acorn is associated\nwith the oak tree, of course --\n\n00:16:04.195 --> 00:16:07.273\ngrows into an oak tree,\nwhich is associated with Abraham.\n\n00:16:07.297 --> 00:16:09.240\nThe path right now is like an acorn;\n\n00:16:09.264 --> 00:16:10.934\nit's still in its early phase.\n\n00:16:11.351 --> 00:16:13.271\nWhat would the oak tree look like?\n\n00:16:13.295 --> 00:16:14.934\nWhen I think back to my childhood,\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.911\na good part of which I spent,\nafter being born here in Chicago,\n\n00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:19.290\nI spent in Europe.\n\n00:16:19.769 --> 00:16:26.475\nIf you had been in the ruins of, say,\nLondon in 1945, or Berlin,\n\n00:16:26.499 --> 00:16:27.698\nand you had said,\n\n00:16:27.722 --> 00:16:29.405\n\"Sixty years from now,\n\n00:16:29.429 --> 00:16:32.754\nthis is going to be the most peaceful,\nprosperous part of the planet,\"\n\n00:16:32.778 --> 00:16:36.092\npeople would have thought\nyou were certifiably insane.\n\n00:16:36.116 --> 00:16:39.934\nBut they did it, thanks\nto a common identity, Europe,\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.934\nand a common economy.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:45.267\nSo my question is,\nif it can be done in Europe,\n\n00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:46.934\nwhy not in the Middle East?\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:51.645\nWhy not, thanks to a common identity,\nwhich is the story of Abraham,\n\n00:16:51.669 --> 00:16:56.363\nand thanks to a common economy that\nwould be based, in good part, on tourism?\n\n00:16:57.148 --> 00:16:59.355\nSo let me conclude, then,\n\n00:16:59.379 --> 00:17:02.728\nby saying that in the last 35 years,\n\n00:17:02.752 --> 00:17:05.169\nas I've worked\nin some of the most dangerous,\n\n00:17:05.193 --> 00:17:08.120\ndifficult and intractable conflicts\naround the planet,\n\n00:17:08.144 --> 00:17:13.749\nI have yet to see one conflict\nthat I felt could not be transformed.\n\n00:17:14.296 --> 00:17:16.149\nIt's not easy, of course.\n\n00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:17.934\nBut it's possible.\n\n00:17:18.424 --> 00:17:20.364\nIt was done in South Africa.\n\n00:17:20.388 --> 00:17:22.273\nIt was done in Northern Ireland.\n\n00:17:22.297 --> 00:17:23.814\nIt could be done anywhere.\n\n00:17:23.838 --> 00:17:26.464\nIt simply depends on us.\n\n00:17:26.488 --> 00:17:29.340\nIt depends on us taking the third side.\n\n00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.492\nSo let me invite you to consider\ntaking the third side,\n\n00:17:33.516 --> 00:17:35.182\neven as a very small step.\n\n00:17:35.206 --> 00:17:37.428\nWe're about to take a break in a moment.\n\n00:17:37.452 --> 00:17:39.429\nJust go up to someone\n\n00:17:39.453 --> 00:17:42.096\nwho's from a different culture,\na different country,\n\n00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.475\na different ethnicity --\nsome difference --\n\n00:17:44.499 --> 00:17:46.136\nand engage them in a conversation.\n\n00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.394\nListen to them.\n\n00:17:47.418 --> 00:17:48.934\nThat's a third-side act.\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:51.242\nThat's walking Abraham's Path.\n\n00:17:51.266 --> 00:17:52.791\nAfter a TED Talk,\n\n00:17:52.815 --> 00:17:54.264\nwhy not a TED Walk?\n\n00:17:54.288 --> 00:17:55.709\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:55.733 --> 00:17:59.896\nSo let me just leave you\nwith three things.\n\n00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.629\nOne is, the secret to peace\nis the third side.\n\n00:18:05.344 --> 00:18:07.764\nThe third side is us.\n\n00:18:07.788 --> 00:18:11.359\nEach of us, with a single step,\n\n00:18:11.383 --> 00:18:14.103\ncan take the world, can bring the world\n\n00:18:14.127 --> 00:18:16.033\na step closer to peace.\n\n00:18:17.276 --> 00:18:19.332\nThere's an old African proverb that goes:\n\n00:18:19.356 --> 00:18:21.522\n\"When spiderwebs unite,\n\n00:18:21.546 --> 00:18:24.109\nthey can halt even the lion.\"\n\n00:18:24.628 --> 00:18:28.903\nIf we're able to unite\nour third-side webs of peace,\n\n00:18:28.927 --> 00:18:31.935\nwe can even halt the lion of war.\n\n00:18:31.959 --> 00:18:33.110\nThank you very much.\n\n00:18:33.134 --> 00:18:36.453\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why not eat insects?", "duration": "994", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/marcel_dicke_why_not_eat_insects", "transcript": "Okay, I'm going to show you again something about our diets. And I would like to know what the audience is, and so who of you ever ate insects? That's quite a lot. (Laughter) But still, you're not representing the overall population of the Earth. (Laughter) Because there's 80 percent out there that really eats insects. But this is quite good.Why not eat insects? Well first, what are insects? Insects are animals that walk around on six legs. And here you see just a selection. There's six million species of insects on this planet, six million species. There's a few hundreds of mammals \u2014 six million species of insects. In fact, if we count all the individual organisms, we would come at much larger numbers. In fact, of all animals on Earth, of all animal species, 80 percent walks on six legs. But if we would count all the individuals, and we take an average weight of them, it would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms for each of you and me on Earth. That means that in terms of biomass, insects are more abundant than we are, and we're not on a planet of men, but we're on a planet of insects. Insects are not only there in nature, but they also are involved in our economy, usually without us knowing.There was an estimation, a conservative estimation, a couple of years ago that the U.S. economy benefited by 57 billion dollars per year. It's a number \u2014 very large \u2014 a contribution to the economy of the United States for free. And so I looked up what the economy was paying for the war in Iraq in the same year. It was 80 billion U.S. dollars. Well we know that that was not a cheap war. So insects, just for free, contribute to the economy of the United States with about the same order of magnitude, just for free, without everyone knowing. And not only in the States, but in any country, in any economy.What do they do? They remove dung, they pollinate our crops. A third of all the fruits that we eat are all a result of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants. They control pests, and they're food for animals. They're at the start of food chains. Small animals eat insects. Even larger animals eat insects. But the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals, still larger animals. And at the end of the food chain, we are eating them as well. There's quite a lot of people that are eating insects. And here you see me in a small, provincial town in China, Lijiang \u2014 about two million inhabitants. If you go out for dinner, like in a fish restaurant, where you can select which fish you want to eat, you can select which insects you would like to eat. And they prepare it in a wonderful way. And here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars, locusts, bee pupae \u2014 delicacies. And you can eat something new everyday. There's more than 1,000 species of insects that are being eaten all around the globe. That's quite a bit more than just a few mammals that we're eating, like a cow or a pig or a sheep. More than 1,000 species \u2014 an enormous variety. And now you may think, okay, in this provincial town in China they're doing that, but not us.Well we've seen already that quite some of you already ate insects maybe occasionally, but I can tell you that every one of you is eating insects, without any exception. You're eating at least 500 grams per year. What are you eating? Tomato soup, peanut butter, chocolate, noodles \u2014 any processed food that you're eating contains insects, because insects are here all around us, and when they're out there in nature they're also in our crops. Some fruits get some insect damage. Those are the fruits, if they're tomato, that go to the tomato soup. If they don't have any damage, they go to the grocery. And that's your view of a tomato. But there's tomatoes that end up in a soup, and as long as they meet the requirements of the food agency, there can be all kinds of things in there, no problem. In fact, why would we put these balls in the soup, there's meat in there anyway? (Laughter) In fact, all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of. So anything is a good protein source already.Now you may say, \"Okay, so we're eating 500 grams just by accident.\" We're even doing this on purpose. In a lot of food items that we have \u2014 I have only two items here on the slide \u2014 pink cookies or surimi sticks or, if you like, Campari \u2014 a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye. The surimi sticks [of] crabmeat, or is being sold as crab meat, is white fish that's being dyed with cochineal. Cochineal is a product of an insect that lives off these cacti. It's being produced in large amounts, 150 to 180 metric tons per year in the Canary Islands in Peru, and it's big business. One gram of cochineal costs about 30 euros. One gram of gold is 30 euros. So it's a very precious thing that we're using to dye our foods.Now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me, for everyone on this Earth. The human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially. Where, at the moment, we have something between six and seven billion people, it will grow to about nine billion in 2050. That means that we have a lot more mouths to feed, and this is something that worries more and more people. There was an FAO conference last October that was completely devoted to this. How are we going to feed this world? And if you look at the figures up there, it says that we have a third more mouths to feed, but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent. And that's especially because this world population is increasing, and it's increasing, not only in numbers, but we're also getting wealthier, and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more and also starts to eat more meat. And meat, in fact, is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production.Our diet consists, [in] some part, of animal proteins, and at the moment, most of us here get it from livestock, from fish, from game. And we eat quite a lot of it. In the developed world it's on average 80 kilograms per person per year, which goes up to 120 in the United States and a bit lower in some other countries, but on average 80 kilograms per person per year. In the developing world it's much lower. It's 25 kilograms per person per year. But it's increasing enormously. In China in the last 20 years, it increased from 20 to 50, and it's still increasing. So if a third of the world population is going to increase its meat consumption from 25 to 80 on average, and a third of the world population is living in China and in India, we're having an enormous demand on meat. And of course, we are not there to say that's only for us, it's not for them. They have the same share that we have.Now to start with, I should say that we are eating way too much meat in the Western world. We could do with much, much less \u2014 and I know, I've been a vegetarian for a long time, and you can easily do without anything. You'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway. But then there's a lot of problems that come with meat production, and we're being faced with that more and more often. The first problem that we're facing is human health. Pigs are quite like us. They're even models in medicine, and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human. That means that pigs also share diseases with us. And a pig disease, a pig virus, and a human virus can both proliferate, and because of their kind of reproduction, they can combine and produce a new virus. This has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s during the classical swine fever outbreak. You get a new disease that can be deadly. We eat insects \u2014 they're so distantly related from us that this doesn't happen. So that's one point for insects.(Laughter)And there's the conversion factor. You take 10 kilograms of feed, you can get one kilogram of beef, but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat. So if you would be an entrepreneur, what would you do? With 10 kilograms of input, you can get either one or nine kg. of output. So far we're taking the one, or up to five kilograms of output. We're not taking the bonus yet. We're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet. So that's two points for insects.(Laughter)And there's the environment. If we take 10 kilograms of food \u2014 (Laughter) and it results in one kilogram of beef, the other nine kilograms are waste, and a lot of that is manure. If you produce insects, you have less manure per kilogram of meat that you produce. So less waste. Furthermore, per kilogram of manure, you have much, much less ammonia and fewer greenhouse gases when you have insect manure than when you have cow manure. So you have less waste, and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung. So that's three points for insects.(Laughter)Now there's a big \"if,\" of course, and it is if insects produce meat that is of good quality. Well there have been all kinds of analyses and in terms of protein, or fat, or vitamins, it's very good. In fact, it's comparable to anything we eat as meat at the moment. And even in terms of calories, it is very good. One kilogram of grasshoppers has the same amount of calories as 10 hot dogs, or six Big Macs. So that's four points for insects.(Laughter)I can go on, and I could make many more points for insects, but time doesn't allow this. So the question is, why not eat insects? I gave you at least four arguments in favor. We'll have to. Even if you don't like it, you'll have to get used to this because at the moment, 70 percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock. That's not only the land where the livestock is walking and feeding, but it's also other areas where the feed is being produced and being transported. We can increase it a bit at the expense of rainforests, but there's a limitation very soon. And if you remember that we need to increase agricultural production by 70 percent, we're not going to make it that way. We could much better change from meat, from beef, to insects. And then 80 percent of the world already eats insects, so we are just a minority \u2014 in a country like the U.K., the USA, the Netherlands, anywhere. On the left-hand side, you see a market in Laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night. On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper. So people there are eating them, not because they're hungry, but because they think it's a delicacy. It's just very good food. You can vary enormously. It has many benefits.In fact, we have delicacy that's very much like this grasshopper: shrimps, a delicacy being sold at a high price. Who wouldn't like to eat a shrimp? There are a few people who don't like shrimp, but shrimp, or crabs, or crayfish, are very closely related. They are delicacies. In fact, a locust is a \"shrimp\" of the land, and it would make very good into our diet. So why are we not eating insects yet? Well that's just a matter of mindset. We're not used to it, and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us. That's why we're changing the perception of insects. And I'm working very hard with my colleague, Arnold van Huis, in telling people what insects are, what magnificent things they are, what magnificent jobs they do in nature. And in fact, without insects, we would not be here in this room, because if the insects die out, we will soon die out as well. If we die out, the insects will continue very happily.(Laughter)So we have to get used to the idea of eating insects. And some might think, well they're not yet available. Well they are. There are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them, and one of them is here in the audience, Marian Peeters, who's in the picture. I predict that later this year, you'll get them in the supermarkets \u2014 not visible, but as animal protein in the food. And maybe by 2020, you'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat. And they're being made in the most wonderful ways. A Dutch chocolate maker. (Music) (Applause) So there's even a lot of design to it.(Laughter)Well in the Netherlands, we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture, and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry. And when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U. over to the Hague recently, she went to a high-class restaurant, and they ate insects all together. It's not something that is a hobby of mine. It's really taken off the ground. So why not eat insects? You should try it yourself. A couple of years ago, we had 1,750 people all together in a square in Wageningen town, and they ate insects at the same moment, and this was still big, big news. I think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects, because it's just a normal way of doing.So you can try it yourself today, and I would say, enjoy. And I'm going to show to Bruno some first tries, and he can have the first bite.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Look at them first. Look at them first.Marcel Dicke: It's all protein.BG: That's exactly the same [one] you saw in the video actually. And it looks delicious.

come at much larger numbers.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nIn fact, of all animals on Earth,\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nof all animal species,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\n80 percent

00:01:39.958\nusually without us knowing.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nThere was an estimation,\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\na conservative estimation, a couple of years ago\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nthat the U.S. economy\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nbenefited by 57 billion\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\ndollars per year.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nIt's a number -- very large --\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\na contribution to the economy of the United States for free.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nAnd so I looked up what the economy was paying\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nfor the war in Iraq\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nin the same year.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nIt was 80 billion U.S. dollars.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nWell we know that that\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nwas not a cheap war.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nSo insects, just for free,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\ncontribute to the economy of the United States\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nwith about the same order of magnitude,\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\njust for free, without everyone knowing.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nAnd not only in the States,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nbut in any country, in any economy.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nWhat do they do?\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nThey remove dung, they pollinate our crops.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nA third of all the fruits that we eat\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nare all a result\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nof insects taking care of the reproduction of plants.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nThey control pests,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nand they're food for animals.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nThey're at the start of food chains.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nSmall animals eat insects.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nEven larger animals eat insects.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nBut the small animals that eat insects\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nare being eaten by larger animals,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nstill larger animals.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nAnd at the end of the food chain, we are eating them as well.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nThere's quite a lot of people that are eating insects.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nAnd here you see me\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nin a small, provincial town in China, Lijiang --\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nabout two million inhabitants.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nIf you go out for dinner, like in a fish restaurant,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nwhere you can select which fish you want to eat,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nyou can select which insects you would like to eat.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nAnd they prepare it in a wonderful way.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nAnd here you see me enjoying a meal\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nwith caterpillars, locusts,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nbee pupae -- delicacies.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd you can eat something new everyday.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nThere's more than 1,000 species of insects\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nthat are being eaten all around the globe.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nThat's quite a bit more\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nthan just a few mammals that we're eating,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nlike a cow or a pig\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nor a sheep.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nMore than 1,000 species --\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nan enormous variety.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nAnd now you may think, okay,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nin this provincial town in China they're doing that, but not us.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nWell we've seen already that quite some of you\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nalready ate insects maybe occasionally,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nbut I can tell you that every one of you\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nis eating insects, without any exception.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nYou're eating at least\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\n500 grams per year.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nWhat are you eating?\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nTomato soup, peanut butter,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nchocolate, noodles --\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nany processed food that you're eating\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\ncontains insects,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nbecause insects are here all around us,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nand when they're out there in nature\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nthey're also in our crops.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nSome fruits get some insect damage.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nThose are the fruits, if they're tomato,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nthat go to the tomato soup.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nIf they don't have any damage, they go to the grocery.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nAnd that's your view of a tomato.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nBut there's tomatoes that end up in a soup,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand as long as they meet\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nthe requirements of the food agency,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nthere can be all kinds of things in there,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nno problem.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nIn fact, why would we put these balls in the soup,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nthere's meat in there anyway?\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nIn fact, all our processed foods\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\ncontain more proteins\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nthan we would be aware of.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nSo anything is a good protein source already.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nNow you may say,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\n\"Okay, so we're eating 500 grams just by accident.\"\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nWe're even doing this on purpose.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nIn a lot of food items that we have --\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nI have only two items\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nhere on the slide --\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\npink cookies or surimi sticks\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nor, if you like, Campari --\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\na lot of our food products that are of a red color\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nare dyed with a natural dye.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nThe surimi sticks\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\n[of] crabmeat, or is being sold as crab meat,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nis white fish\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nthat's being dyed with cochineal.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nCochineal is a product\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nof an insect that lives off these cacti.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nIt's being produced in large amounts,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\n150 to 180 metric tons per year\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nin the Canary Islands in Peru,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nand it's big business.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nOne gram of cochineal\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\ncosts about 30 euros.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nOne gram of gold\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nis 30 euros.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nSo it's a very precious thing\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nthat we're using to dye our foods.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nNow the situation in the world is going to change\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nfor you and me, for everyone on this Earth.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nThe human population is growing very rapidly\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nand is growing exponentially.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nWhere, at the moment, we have\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nsomething between six and seven billion people,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nit will grow to about nine billion\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nin 2050.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nThat means that we have a lot more mouths to feed,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nand this is something that worries more and more people.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nThere was an FAO conference last October\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nthat was completely devoted to this.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nHow are we going to feed this world?\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nAnd if you look at the figures up there,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nit says that we have a third more mouths to feed,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nbut we need an agricultural production increase\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nof 70 percent.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd that's especially because this world population\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nis increasing,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nand it's increasing, not only in numbers,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nbut we're also getting wealthier,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nand anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nand also starts to eat more meat.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nAnd meat, in fact, is something\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nthat costs a lot\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nof our agricultural production.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nOur diet consists, [in] some part, of animal proteins,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nand at the moment, most of us here\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nget it from livestock,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nfrom fish, from game.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nAnd we eat quite a lot of it.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nIn the developed world it's on average\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\n80 kilograms per person per year,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nwhich goes up to 120\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nin the United States\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nand a bit lower in some other countries,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nbut on average 80 kilograms\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nper person per year.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nIn the developing world it's much lower.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nIt's 25 kilograms per person per year.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nBut it's increasing enormously.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nIn China in the last 20 years,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nit increased from 20 to 50,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nand it's still increasing.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nSo if a third of the world population\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nis going to increase its meat consumption\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nfrom 25 to 80 on average,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nand a third of the world population\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nis living in China and in India,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nwe're having an enormous demand on meat.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nAnd of course, we are not there to say\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nthat's only for us, it's not for them.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nThey have the same share that we have.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nNow to start with, I should say\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nthat we are eating way too much meat\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nin the Western world.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nWe could do with much, much less --\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nand I know, I've been a vegetarian for a long time,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nand you can easily do without anything.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nYou'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nBut then there's a lot of problems\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nthat come with meat production,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nand we're being faced with that more and more often.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nThe first problem that we're facing is human health.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nPigs are quite like us.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nThey're even models in medicine,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nand we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nThat means that pigs also share diseases with us.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nAnd a pig disease,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\na pig virus, and a human virus\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\ncan both proliferate,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nand because of their kind of reproduction,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nthey can combine and produce a new virus.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nThis has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nduring the classical swine fever outbreak.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nYou get a new disease that can be deadly.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nWe eat insects -- they're so distantly related from us\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nthat this doesn't happen.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nSo that's one point for insects.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nAnd there's the conversion factor.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nYou take 10 kilograms of feed,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nyou can get one kilogram of beef,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nbut you can get nine kilograms of locust meat.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nSo if you would be an entrepreneur,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nwhat would you do?\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nWith 10 kilograms of input,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nyou can get either one or nine kg. of output.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nSo far we're taking\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nthe one, or up to five kilograms of output.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nWe're not taking the bonus yet.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nWe're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nSo that's two points for insects.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nAnd there's the environment.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nIf we take 10 kilograms of food --\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nand it results in one kilogram of beef,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nthe other nine kilograms are waste,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nand a lot of that is manure.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nIf you produce insects, you have less manure\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nper kilogram of meat that you produce.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nSo less waste.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nFurthermore, per kilogram of manure,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nyou have much, much less ammonia\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nand fewer greenhouse gases\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nwhen you have insect manure\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nthan when you have cow manure.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nSo you have less waste,\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nand the waste that you have is not as environmental malign\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nas it is with cow dung.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nSo that's three points for insects.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nNow there's a big \"if,\" of course,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nand it is if insects produce meat\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nthat is of good quality.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nWell there have been all kinds of analyses\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nand in terms of protein, or fat, or vitamins,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nit's very good.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nIn fact, it's comparable\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nto anything we eat as meat at the moment.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nAnd even in terms of calories, it is very good.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nOne kilogram of grasshoppers\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nhas the same amount of calories\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nas 10 hot dogs, or six Big Macs.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nSo that's four points for insects.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nI can go on,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nand I could make many more points for insects,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nbut time doesn't allow this.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nSo the question is, why not eat insects?\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nI gave you at least four arguments in favor.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nWe'll have to.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nEven if you don't like it,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nyou'll have to get used to this\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nbecause at the moment,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\n70 percent of all our agricultural land\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nis being used to produce livestock.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nThat's not only the land\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nwhere the livestock is walking and feeding,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nbut it's also other areas\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nwhere the feed is being produced and being transported.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nWe can increase it a bit\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nat the expense of rainforests,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nbut there's a limitation very soon.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nAnd if you remember that we need to increase\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nagricultural production by 70 percent,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nwe're not going to make it that way.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nWe could much better change\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nfrom meat, from beef,\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nto insects.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nAnd then 80 percent of the world\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nalready eats insects,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nso we are just a minority --\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nin a country like the U.K., the USA,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nthe Netherlands, anywhere.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nOn the left-hand side, you see a market in Laos\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nwhere they have abundantly present\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nall kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nOn the right-hand side you see a grasshopper.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nSo people there are eating them,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nnot because they're hungry,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nbut because they think it's a delicacy.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nIt's just very good food.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nYou can vary enormously.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nIt has many benefits.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nIn fact, we have delicacy\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nthat's very much like this grasshopper:\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nshrimps, a delicacy\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nbeing sold at a high price.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nWho wouldn't like to eat a shrimp?\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nThere are a few people who don't like shrimp,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nbut shrimp, or crabs,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nor crayfish,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nare very closely related.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nThey are delicacies.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nIn fact, a locust is a \"shrimp\" of the land,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nand it would make very good into our diet.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nSo why are we not eating insects yet?\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nWell that's just a matter of mindset.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nWe're not used to it,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nand we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nThat's why we're changing the perception of insects.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nAnd I'm working very hard with my colleague, Arnold van Huis,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nin telling people what insects are,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nwhat magnificent things they are,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nwhat magnificent jobs they do in nature.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd in fact, without insects,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nwe would not be here in this room,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nbecause if the insects die out,\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nwe will soon die out as well.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nIf we die out, the insects will continue very happily.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nSo we have to get used to the idea of eating insects.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nAnd some might think, well they're not yet available.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nWell they are.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nThere are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nand one of them is here in the audience,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nMarian Peeters, who's in the picture.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nI predict that later this year, you'll get them in the supermarkets --\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nnot visible, but as animal protein\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nin the food.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nAnd maybe by 2020,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nyou'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nAnd they're being made in the most wonderful ways.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nA Dutch chocolate maker.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\n(Music)\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nSo there's even a lot of design to it.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nWell in the Netherlands, we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nand she puts the insects on the menu\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nin her restaurant in her ministry.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nAnd when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nover to the Hague recently,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nshe went to a high-class restaurant,\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nand they ate insects all together.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nIt's not something that is a hobby of mine.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nIt's really taken off the ground.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nSo why not eat insects?\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nYou should try it yourself.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nA couple of years ago, we had 1,750 people all together\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nin a square in Wageningen town,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nand they ate insects at the same moment,\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nand this was still big, big news.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nI think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects,\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nbecause it's just a normal way of doing.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nSo you can try it yourself today,\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nand I would say, enjoy.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nAnd I'm going to show to Bruno some first tries,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nand he can have the first bite.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:16:03.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nBruno Giussani: Look at them first. Look at them first.\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nMarcel Dicke: It's all protein.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nBG: That's exactly the same [one] you saw in the video actually.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nAnd it looks delicious.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nThey just make it [with] nuts or something.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nMD: Thank you.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How I taught rats to sniff out land mines", "duration": "731", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/bart_weetjens_how_i_taught_rats_to_sniff_out_land_mines", "transcript": "I'm here today to share with you an extraordinary journey - extraordinarily rewarding journey, actually - which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis. As a child, I had two passions. One was a passion for rodents. I had all kinds of rats, mice, hamsters, gerbils, squirrels. You name it, I bred it, and I sold them to pet shops. (Laughter) I also had a passion for Africa. Growing up in a multicultural environment, we had African students in the house, and I learned about their stories, so different backgrounds, dependency on imported know-how, goods, services, exuberant cultural diversity. Africa was truly fascinating for me.I became an industrial engineer, engineer in product development, and I focused on appropriate detection technologies, actually the first appropriate technologies for developing countries. I started working in the industry, but I wasn't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear, extracting and manufacturing mode. I quit my job to focus on the real world problem: landmines. We're talking '95 now. Princess Diana is announcing on TV that landmines form a structural barrier to any development, which is really true. As long as these devices are there, or there is suspicion of landmines, you can't really enter into the land. Actually, there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where they're needed to produce, which is mainly in the developing world. We chose rats.Why would you choose rats? Because, aren't they vermin? Well, actually rats are, in contrary to what most people think about them, rats are highly sociable creatures. And actually, our product \u2014 what you see here. There's a target somewhere here. You see an operator, a trained African with his rats in front who actually are left and right. There, the animal finds a mine. It scratches on the soil. And the animal comes back for a food reward. Very, very simple. Very sustainable in this environment. Here, the animal gets its food reward. And that's how it works. Very, very simple.Now why would you use rats? Rats have been used since the '50s last century, in all kinds of experiments. Rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species. They're extremely sensitive to smell. Moreover, they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it. Now how do we communicate with rats? Well don't talk rat, but we have a clicker, a standard method for animal training, which you see there. A clicker, which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors. First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward, which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe. Once the animal knows click, food, click, food, click, food \u2014 so click is food \u2014 we bring it in a cage with a hole, and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed, and to do that for five seconds \u2014 five seconds, which is long for a rat. Once the animal knows this, we make the task a bit more difficult. It learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes.Then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets. In the next step, animals learn to find real mines in real minefields. They are tested and accredited according to International Mine Action Standards, just like dogs have to pass a test. This consists of 400 square meters. There's a number of mines placed blindly, and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets. If the animal does that, it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field \u2014 just like dogs, by the way. Maybe one slight difference: we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog.This is our team in Mozambique: one Tanzanian trainer, who transfers the skills to these three Mozambican fellows. And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people. They have a skill, which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid. Moreover, this small team together with, of course, you need the heavy vehicles and the manual de-miners to follow-up. But with this small investment in a rat capacity, we have demonstrated in Mozambique that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter up to 60 percent of what is currently normal \u2014 two dollars per square meter, we do it at $1.18, and we can still bring that price down. Question of scale. If you can bring in more rats, we can actually make the output even bigger. We have a demonstration site in Mozambique. Eleven African governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology. They have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the Great Lakes region, and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines.But let me bring you to a very different problem. And there's about 6,000 people last year that walked on a landmine, but worldwide last year, almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection. Especially in Africa where T.B. and HIV are strongly linked, there is a huge common problem. Microscopy, the standard WHO procedure, reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability. In Tanzania \u2014 the numbers don't lie \u2014 45 percent of people \u2014 T.B. patients \u2014 get diagnosed with T.B. before they die. It means that, if you have T.B., you have more chance that you won't be detected, but will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on. And if, however, you are detected very early, diagnosed early, treatment can start, and even in HIV-positives, it makes sense. You can actually cure T.B., even in HIV-positives.So in our common language, Dutch, the name for T.B. is \"tering,\" which, etymologically, refers to the smell of tar. Already the old Chinese and the Greek, Hippocrates, have actually published, documented, that T.B. can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients. So what we did is we collected some samples \u2014 just as a way of testing \u2014 from hospitals, trained rats on them and see if this works, and wonder, well, we can reach 89 percent sensitivity, 86 percent specificity using multiple rats in a row. This is how it works, and really, this is a generic technology. We're talking now explosives, tuberculosis, but can you imagine, you can actually put anything under there.So how does it work? You have a cassette with 10 samples. You put these 10 samples at once in the cage. An animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent, so it goes extremely fast. Here it's already at the third sample. This is a positive sample. It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward. And by doing so, very fast, we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive, which are negative. Just as an indication, whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day, a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only. A cage like this \u2014 (Applause) A cage like this \u2014 provided that you have rats, and we have now currently 25 tuberculosis rats \u2014 a cage like this, operating throughout the day, can process 1,680 samples. Can you imagine the potential offspring applications \u2014 environmental detection of pollutants in soils, customs applications, detection of illicit goods in containers and so on.But let's stick first to tuberculosis. I just want to briefly highlight, the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam on a population of 500,000 people, where 15,000 reported to get a test done. Microscopy for 1,800 patients. And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back, we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent. Throughout last year, we've been \u2014 depending on which intervals you take \u2014 we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam between 30 and 40 percent. So this is really considerable. Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to 15 people, healthy people, per year, you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives. At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives.The way forward for us is now to standardize this technology. And there are simple things like, for instance, we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds. So, to standardize this. Also, to standardize the pellets, the food rewards, and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people. To conclude, there are also other applications at the horizon. Here is a first prototype of our camera rat, which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on. This is in a prototype stage. We don't have a working system here yet.To conclude, I would actually like to say, you may think this is about rats, these projects, but in the end it is about people. It is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult, expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks, and doing that with a local resource, plenty available. So something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you, whether they are environmental, technological, animal, or human. And to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable world.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1019, "subtitle":

-\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nextraordinarily rewarding journey,\nactually -\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nwhich brought me into\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.958\ntraining rats\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nto save human lives\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nby detecting landmines\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nand tuberculosis.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nAs a child, I had two passions.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nOne was a passion for rodents.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nI had all kinds of rats,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nmice, hamsters,\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\ngerbils, squirrels.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nYou name it, I bred it, and I sold them to pet shops.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nI also had a passion for Africa.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nGrowing up in a multicultural environment,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nwe had African students in the house,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nand I learned about their stories,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nso different backgrounds,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\ndependency on imported know-how,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\ngoods, services,\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nexuberant cultural diversity.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nAfrica was truly fascinating for me.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nI became an industrial engineer,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nengineer in product development,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nand I focused on appropriate detection technologies,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nactually the first appropriate technologies\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nfor developing countries.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nI started working in the industry,\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nbut I wasn't really happy to contribute\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nto a material consumer society\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nin a linear, extracting\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nand manufacturing mode.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nI quit my job to focus on the real world problem:\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nlandmines.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nWe're talking '95 now.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nPrincess Diana is announcing on TV\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nthat landmines form a structural barrier\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nto any development, which is really true.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nAs long as these devices are there,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nor there is suspicion of landmines,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nyou can't really enter into the land.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nActually, there was an appeal worldwide\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nfor new detectors\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nsustainable in the environments\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nwhere they're needed to produce,\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nwhich is mainly in the developing world.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nWe chose rats.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nWhy would you choose rats?\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nBecause, aren't they vermin?\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nWell, actually rats are,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nin contrary to what most people think about them,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nrats are highly sociable creatures.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nAnd actually, our product -- what you see here.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nThere's a target somewhere here.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nYou see an operator, a trained African\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nwith his rats in front\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nwho actually are left and right.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nThere, the animal finds a mine.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nIt scratches on the soil.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nAnd the animal comes back for a food reward.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nVery, very simple.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nVery sustainable in this environment.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nHere, the animal gets its food reward.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nAnd that's how it works.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nVery, very simple.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nNow why would you use rats?\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nRats have been used since the '50s last century,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nin all kinds of experiments.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nRats have more genetic material\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nallocated to olfaction\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nthan any other mammal species.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nThey're extremely sensitive to smell.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nMoreover, they have the mechanisms to map all these smells\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nand to communicate about it.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nNow how do we communicate with rats?\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nWell don't talk rat,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nbut we have a clicker,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\na standard method for animal training,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nwhich you see there.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nA clicker, which makes a particular sound\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nwith which you can reinforce particular behaviors.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nFirst of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nwhich is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nOnce the animal knows click, food,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nclick, food, click, food --\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nso click is food --\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nwe bring it in a cage with a hole,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nand actually the animal learns\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nto stick the nose in the hole\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nunder which a target scent is placed,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nand to do that for five seconds --\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nfive seconds, which is long for a rat.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nOnce the animal knows this, we make the task a bit more difficult.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nIt learns how to find the target smell\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nin a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nThen the animal learns\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nto walk on a leash in the open\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nand find targets.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nIn the next step, animals learn\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nto find real mines in real minefields.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nThey are tested and accredited\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\naccording to International Mine Action Standards,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\njust like dogs have to pass a test.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nThis consists of 400 square meters.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nThere's a number of mines\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nplaced blindly,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nand the team of trainer and their rat\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nhave to find all the targets.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nIf the animal does that, it gets a license\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nas an accredited animal\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nto be operational in the field --\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\njust like dogs, by the way.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nMaybe one slight difference:\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nwe can train rats at a fifth of the price\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nof training the mining dog.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nThis is our team in Mozambique:\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\none Tanzanian trainer,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nwho transfers the skills\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nto these three Mozambican fellows.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nAnd you should see the pride in the eyes of these people.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nThey have a skill,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nwhich makes them much less dependent\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\non foreign aid.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nMoreover, this small team\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\ntogether with, of course, you need the heavy vehicles\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nand the manual de-miners to follow-up.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nBut with this small investment in a rat capacity,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nwe have demonstrated in Mozambique\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nthat we can reduce the cost-price per square meter\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nup to 60 percent\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nof what is currently normal --\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\ntwo dollars per square meter, we do it at $1.18,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nand we can still bring that price down.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nQuestion of scale.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nIf you can bring in more rats,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nwe can actually make the output even bigger.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nWe have a demonstration site in Mozambique.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nEleven African governments\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nhave seen that they can become less dependent\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nby using this technology.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nThey have signed the pact for peace\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nand treaty in the Great Lakes region,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nand they endorse hero rats\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nto clear their common borders of landmines.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nBut let me bring you to a very different problem.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nAnd there's about 6,000 people last year\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthat walked on a landmine,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nbut worldwide last year,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nalmost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nas a first cause of infection.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nEspecially in Africa\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nwhere T.B. and HIV are strongly linked,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nthere is a huge common problem.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nMicroscopy, the standard WHO procedure,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nreaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nIn Tanzania -- the numbers don't lie --\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\n45 percent of people -- T.B. patients --\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nget diagnosed with T.B. before they die.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nIt means that, if you have T.B.,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nyou have more chance that you won't be detected,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nbut will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nAnd if, however,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nyou are detected very early, diagnosed early,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\ntreatment can start,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nand even in HIV-positives, it makes sense.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nYou can actually cure T.B.,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\neven in HIV-positives.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nSo in our common language, Dutch,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nthe name for T.B.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nis \"tering,\"\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nwhich, etymologically,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nrefers to the smell of tar.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nAlready the old Chinese\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nand the Greek, Hippocrates,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nhave actually published,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\ndocumented, that T.B. can be diagnosed\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nbased on the volatiles\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nexuding from patients.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nSo what we did is we collected some samples --\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\njust as a way of testing --\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nfrom hospitals,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\ntrained rats on them\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nand see if this works,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nand wonder, well,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nwe can reach 89 percent sensitivity,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\n86 percent specificity\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nusing multiple rats in a row.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nThis is how it works,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nand really, this is a generic technology.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nWe're talking now explosives, tuberculosis,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nbut can you imagine,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nyou can actually put anything under there.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nSo how does it work?\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nYou have a cassette with 10 samples.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nYou put these 10 samples at once in the cage.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nAn animal only needs two hundredths of a second\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nto discriminate the scent, so it goes extremely fast.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nHere it's already at the third sample.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nThis is a positive sample.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nIt gets a click sound and comes for the food reward.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nAnd by doing so, very fast,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nwe can have like a second-line opinion\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nto see which patients are positive,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nwhich are negative.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nJust as an indication,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nwhereas a microscopist can process\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\n40 samples in a day,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\na rat can process\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nthe same amount of samples\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nin seven minutes only.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nA cage like this --\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:02.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nA cage like this -- provided that you have rats,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nand we have now currently\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\n25 tuberculosis rats --\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\na cage like this, operating throughout the day,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\ncan process 1,680 samples.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nCan you imagine the potential offspring applications --\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nenvironmental detection\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nof pollutants in soils,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\ncustoms applications,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\ndetection of illicit goods in containers and so on.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nBut let's stick first to tuberculosis.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nI just want to briefly highlight,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nthe blue rods\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nare the scores of microscopy only\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nat the five clinics in Dar es Salaam\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\non a population of 500,000 people,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nwhere 15,000 reported to get a test done.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nMicroscopy for 1,800 patients.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nAnd by just presenting the samples once more to the rats\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nand looping those results back,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nwe were able to increase case detection rates\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nby over 30 percent.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nThroughout last year,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nwe've been -- depending on which intervals you take --\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nwe've been consistently\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nincreasing case detection rates\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nin five hospitals in Dar es Salaam\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nbetween 30 and 40 percent.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nSo this is really considerable.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nKnowing that a missed patient by microscopy\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\ninfects up to 15 people,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nhealthy people, per year,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nyou can be sure\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nthat we have saved lots of lives.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nAt least our hero rats have saved lots of lives.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nThe way forward for us\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nis now to standardize this technology.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nAnd there are simple things\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nlike, for instance, we have a small laser in the sniffer hole\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nwhere the animal has to stick for five seconds.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nSo, to standardize this.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAlso, to standardize the pellets,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nthe food rewards,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nand to semi-automate this\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nin order to replicate this on a much larger scale\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nand affect the lives of many more people.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nTo conclude, there are also other applications at the horizon.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nHere is a first prototype\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nof our camera rat,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nwhich is a rat with a rat backpack\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nwith a camera that can go under rubble\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nto detect for victims\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nafter earthquake and so on.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nThis is in a prototype stage.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nWe don't have a working system here yet.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nTo conclude, I would actually like to say,\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nyou may think this is about rats, these projects,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nbut in the end it is about people.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nIt is about empowering vulnerable communities\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nto tackle difficult, expensive\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nand dangerous humanitarian detection tasks,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nand doing that with a local resource,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nplenty available.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nSo something completely different\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nis to keep on challenging your perception\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nabout the resources surrounding you,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nwhether they are environmental,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\ntechnological, animal, or human.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nAnd to respectfully harmonize with them\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nin order to foster a sustainable world.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A vision for sustainable restaurants", "duration": "529", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/arthur_potts_dawson_a_vision_for_sustainable_restaurants", "transcript": "Restaurants and the food industry in general are pretty much the most wasteful industry in the world. For every calorie of food that we consume here in Britain today, 10 calories are taken to produce it. That's a lot. I want to take something rather humble to discuss. I found this in the farmers' market today, and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later, you're very welcome to. The humble potato \u2014 and I've spent a long time, 25 years, preparing these. And it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime. First of all, it's planted, and that takes energy. It grows and is nurtured. It's then harvested. It's then distributed, and distribution is a massive issue. It's then sold and bought, and it's then delivered to me. I basically take it, prepare it, and then people consume it \u2014 hopefully they enjoy it. The last stage is basically waste, and this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it. There are different types of waste. There's a waste of time; there's a waste of space; there's a waste of energy; and there's a waste of waste. And every business I've been working on over the past five years, I'm trying to lower each one of these elements.Okay, so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like. Basically a restaurant just like any other. This is the restaurant, Acorn House. Front and back. So let me run you through a few ideas. Floor: sustainable, recyclable. Chairs: recycled and recyclable. Tables: Forestry Commission. This is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood. This bench, although it was uncomfortable for my mom \u2014 she didn't like sitting on it, so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale \u2014 reusing, a job that was pretty good. I hate waste, especially walls. If they're not working, put a shelf on it, which I did, and that shows all the customers my products. The whole business is run on sustainable energy. This is powered by wind. All of the lights are daylight bulbs. Paint is all low-volume chemical, which is very important when you're working in the room all the time. I was experimenting with these \u2014 I don't know if you can see it \u2014 but there's a work surface there. And that's a plastic polymer. And I was thinking, well I'm trying to think nature, nature, nature. But I thought, no, no, experiment with resins, experiment with polymers. Will they outlive me? They probably might. Right, here's a reconditioned coffee machine. It actually looks better than a brand new one \u2014 so looking good there. Now reusing is vital. And we filter our own water. We put them in bottles, refrigerate them, and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again. Here's a great little example. If you can see this orange tree, it's actually growing in a car tire, which has been turned inside out and sewn up. It's got my compost in it, which is growing an orange tree, which is great.This is the kitchen, which is in the same room. I basically created a menu that allowed people to choose the amount and volume of food that they wanted to consume. Rather than me putting a dish down, they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted. Okay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters. It serves 220 people a day. We generate quite a lot of waste. This is the waste room. You can't get rid of waste. But this story's not about eliminating it, it's about minimizing it. In here, I have produce and boxes that are unavoidable. I put my food waste into this dehydrating, desiccating macerator \u2014 turns food into an inner material, which I can store and then compost later.I compost it in this garden. All of the soil you can see there is basically my food, which is generated by the restaurant, and it's growing in these tubs, which I made out of storm-felled trees and wine casks and all kinds of things. Three compost bins \u2014 go through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week \u2014 really good, makes fantastic compost. A couple of wormeries in there too. And actually one of the wormeries was a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it. And I tried taking the dried food waste, putting it to the worms, going, \"There you go, dinner.\" It was like vegetable jerky, and killed all of them. I don't know how many worms [were] in there, but I've got some heavy karma coming, I tell you. (Laughter) What you're seeing here is a water filtration system. This takes the water out of the restaurant, runs it through these stone beds \u2014 this is going to be mint in there \u2014 and I sort of water the garden with it. And I ultimately want to recycle that, put it back into the loos, maybe wash hands with it, I don't know.So, water is a very important aspect. I started meditating on that and created a restaurant called Waterhouse. If I could get Waterhouse to be a no-carbon restaurant that is consuming no gas to start with, that would be great. I managed to do it. This restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House \u2014 same chairs, same tables. They're all English and a little bit more sustainable. But this is an electrical restaurant. The whole thing is electric, the restaurant and the kitchen. And it's run on hydroelectricity, so I've gone from air to water. Now it's important to understand that this room is cooled by water, heated by water, filters its own water, and it's powered by water. It literally is Waterhouse. The air handling system inside it \u2014 I got rid of air-conditioning because I thought there was too much consumption going on there. This is basically air-handling. I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside, pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism, it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof, and that, in turn, is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant, cooling them, or heating them, as the need may be. And this is an English willow air diffuser, and that's softly moving that air current through the room. Very advanced, no air-conditioning \u2014 I love it. In the canal, which is just outside the restaurant, there is hundreds of meters of coil piping. This takes the temperature of the canal and turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange. I have no idea how it works, but I paid a lot of money for it. (Laughter) And what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant lives on this boat \u2014 it's off-grid; it generates all its own power. He's growing all his own fruit, and that's fantastic.There's no accident in names of these restaurants. Acorn House is the element of wood; Waterhouse is the element of water; and I'm thinking, well, I'm going to be making five restaurants based on the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities. I've got water and wood. I'm just about to do fire. I've got metal and earth to come. So you've got to watch your space for that. Okay. So this is my next project. Five weeks old, it's my baby, and it's hurting real bad. The People's Supermarket. So basically, the restaurants only really hit people who believed in what I was doing anyway. What I needed to do was get food out to a broader spectrum of people. So people \u2014 i.e., perhaps, more working-class \u2014 or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative. This is a social enterprise, not-for-profit cooperative supermarket. It really is about the social disconnect between food, communities in urban settings and their relationship to rural growers \u2014 connecting communities in London to rural growers. Really important. So I'm committing to potatoes; I'm committing to milk; I'm committing to leeks and broccoli \u2014 all very important stuff. I've kept the tiles; I've kept the floors; I've kept the trunking; I've got in some recycled fridges; I've got some recycled tills; I've got some recycled trolleys. I mean, the whole thing is is super-sustainable. In fact, I'm trying and I'm going to make this the most sustainable supermarket in the world. That's zero food waste. And no one's doing that just yet. In fact, Sainsbury's, if you're watching, let's have a go. Try it on. I'm going to get there before you.So nature doesn't create waste doesn't create waste as such. Everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle with waste being the end of the beginning, and that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time, and it's an important statement to understand. If we don't stand up and make a difference and think about sustainable food, think about the sustainable nature of it, then we may fail. But, I wanted to get up and show you that we can do it if we're more responsible. Environmentally conscious businesses are doable. They're here. You can see I've done three so far; I've got a few more to go. The idea is embryonic. I think it's important. I think that if we reduce, reuse, refuse and recycle \u2014 right at the end there \u2014 recycling is the last point I want to make; but it's the four R's, rather than the three R's \u2014 then I think we're going to be on our way. So these three are not perfect \u2014 they're ideas. I think that there are many problems to come, but with help, I'm sure I'm going to find solutions. And I hope you all take part.Thank you very much.

All of the lights are daylight bulbs.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nPaint is all low-volume chemical,\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nwhich is very important when you're working in the room all the time.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nI was experimenting with these -- I don't know if you can see it --\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nbut there's a work surface there.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nAnd that's a plastic polymer.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nAnd I was thinking, well I'm trying to think nature, nature, nature.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nBut I thought, no, no, experiment with resins,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nexperiment with polymers.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nWill they outlive me? They probably might.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nRight, here's a reconditioned coffee machine.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nIt actually looks better than a brand new one -- so looking good there.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nNow reusing is vital.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nAnd we filter our own water.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nWe put them in bottles, refrigerate them,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nand then we reuse that bottle again and again and again.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nHere's a great little example.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nIf you can see this orange tree, it's actually growing in a car tire,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nwhich has been turned inside out and sewn up.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nIt's got my compost in it, which is growing an orange tree, which is great.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThis is the kitchen, which is in the same room.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nI basically created a menu that allowed people\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nto choose the amount and volume of food\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nthat they wanted to consume.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nRather than me putting a dish down,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nthey were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nOkay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nIt serves 220 people a day.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nWe generate quite a lot of waste.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nThis is the waste room.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nYou can't get rid of waste.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nBut this story's not about eliminating it, it's about minimizing it.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nIn here, I have produce and boxes\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nthat are unavoidable.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nI put my food waste into this dehydrating, desiccating macerator --\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nturns food into an inner material,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nwhich I can store and then compost later.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nI compost it in this garden.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nAll of the soil you can see there is basically my food,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nwhich is generated by the restaurant,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nand it's growing in these tubs, which I made out of storm-felled trees\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nand wine casks and all kinds of things.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nThree compost bins --\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\ngo through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week --\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nreally good, makes fantastic compost.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nA couple of wormeries in there too.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nAnd actually one of the wormeries\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nwas a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nAnd I tried taking the dried food waste,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nputting it to the worms, going, \"There you go, dinner.\"\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nIt was like vegetable jerky,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nand killed all of them.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nI don't know how many worms [were] in there,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nbut I've got some heavy karma coming, I tell you.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nWhat you're seeing here is a water filtration system.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nThis takes the water out of the restaurant,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nruns it through these stone beds -- this is going to be mint in there --\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nand I sort of water the garden with it.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nAnd I ultimately want to recycle that, put it back into the loos,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nmaybe wash hands with it, I don't know.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nSo, water is a very important aspect.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nI started meditating on that\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nand created a restaurant called Waterhouse.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nIf I could get Waterhouse to be a no-carbon restaurant\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nthat is consuming no gas to start with, that would be great.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nI managed to do it.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nThis restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House --\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nsame chairs, same tables.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nThey're all English and a little bit more sustainable.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nBut this is an electrical restaurant.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nThe whole thing is electric, the restaurant and the kitchen.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nAnd it's run on hydroelectricity,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nso I've gone from air to water.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nNow it's important to understand\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nthat this room\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nis cooled by water, heated by water,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nfilters its own water,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nand it's powered by water.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nIt literally is Waterhouse.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nThe air handling system inside it --\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nI got rid of air-conditioning\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nbecause I thought there was too much consumption going on there.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nThis is basically air-handling.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nI'm taking the temperature of the canal outside,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\npumping it through the heat exchange mechanism,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nit's turning through these amazing sails on the roof,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nand that, in turn, is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\ncooling them, or heating them, as the need may be.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nAnd this is an English willow air diffuser,\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nand that's softly moving\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nthat air current through the room.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nVery advanced, no air-conditioning -- I love it.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nIn the canal, which is just outside the restaurant,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nthere is hundreds of meters of coil piping.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nThis takes the temperature of the canal\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nand turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nI have no idea how it works, but I paid a lot of money for it.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nAnd what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nlives on this boat -- it's off-grid; it generates all its own power.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nHe's growing all his own fruit, and that's fantastic.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nThere's no accident in names of these restaurants.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nAcorn House is the element of wood; Waterhouse is the element of water;\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nand I'm thinking, well, I'm going to be making\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nfive restaurants based\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:11.958\non the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nI've got water and wood. I'm just about to do fire.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nI've got metal and earth to come.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nSo you've got to watch your space for that.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nOkay. So this is my next project.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nFive weeks old,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nit's my baby, and it's hurting real bad.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nThe People's Supermarket.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nSo basically, the restaurants only really hit\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\npeople who believed in what I was doing anyway.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nWhat I needed to do was get food out\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nto a broader spectrum of people.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nSo people -- i.e., perhaps, more working-class --\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nor perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nThis is a social enterprise,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nnot-for-profit cooperative supermarket.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nIt really is about the social disconnect\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nbetween food, communities\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nin urban settings\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nand their relationship to rural growers --\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nconnecting communities in London to rural growers.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nReally important.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nSo I'm committing to potatoes; I'm committing to milk;\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nI'm committing to leeks and broccoli -- all very important stuff.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nI've kept the tiles; I've kept the floors;\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nI've kept the trunking; I've got in some recycled fridges;\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nI've got some recycled tills; I've got some recycled trolleys.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nI mean, the whole thing is is super-sustainable.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nIn fact, I'm trying and I'm going to make this\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nthe most sustainable supermarket in the world.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nThat's zero food waste.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nAnd no one's doing that just yet.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nIn fact, Sainsbury's, if you're watching,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nlet's have a go. Try it on.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nI'm going to get there before you.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nSo nature doesn't create waste\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\ndoesn't create waste as such.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nEverything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nwith waste being the end of the beginning,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nand that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nand it's an important statement to understand.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nIf we don't stand up\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nand make a difference\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nand think about sustainable food,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nthink about the sustainable nature of it,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nthen we may fail.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nBut, I wanted to get up and show you\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nthat we can do it if we're more responsible.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nEnvironmentally conscious businesses are doable.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nThey're here. You can see I've done three so far;\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nI've got a few more to go.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nThe idea is embryonic.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nI think it's important.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nI think that if we reduce, reuse, refuse\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nand recycle -- right at the end there --\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nrecycling is the last point I want to make;\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nbut it's the four R's, rather than the three R's --\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nthen I think we're going to be on our way.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nSo these three are not perfect -- they're ideas.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nI think that there are many problems to come,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nbut with help, I'm sure I'm going to find solutions.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nAnd I hope you all take part.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nThank you very much.

But in the last couple of years we've become infamous for a couple of things. First, of course, the economic meltdown. It actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale on eBay. (Laughter) Ninety-nine pence was the starting price and no reserve. Then there was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends, including President Obama. By the way, the pronunciation is \"Eyjafjallajokull.\" None of your media got it right.(Laughter)But I'm not here to share these stories about these two things exactly. I'm here to tell you the story of Audur Capital, which is a financial firm founded by me and Kristin \u2014 who you see in the picture \u2014 in the spring of 2007, just over a year before the economic collapse hit. Why would two women who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking in the corporate sector leave to found a financial services firm? Well let it suffice to say that we felt a bit overwhelmed with testosterone. And I'm not here to say that men are to blame for the crisis and what happened in my country. But I can surely tell you that in my country, much like on Wall Street and the city of London and elsewhere, men were at the helm of the game of the financial sector, and that kind of lack of diversity and sameness leads to disastrous problems.(Applause)So we decided, a bit fed-up with this world and also with the strong feeling in our stomach that this wasn't sustainable, to found a financial services firm based on our values, and we decided to incorporate feminine values into the world of finance. Raised quite a few eyebrows in Iceland. We weren't known as the typical \"women\" women in Iceland up until then. So it was almost like coming out of the closet to actually talk about the fact that we were women and that we believed that we had a set of values and a way of doing business that would be more sustainable than what we had experienced until then. And we got a great group of people to join us \u2014 principled people with great skills, and investors with a vision and values to match ours. And together we got through the eye of the financial storm in Iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients. And although I want to thank the talented people of our company foremost for that \u2014 and also there's a factor of luck and timing \u2014 we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values.So let me share with you our values. We believe in risk awareness. What does that mean? We believe that you should always understand the risks that you're taking, and we will not invest in things we don't understand. Not a complicated thing. But in 2007, at the height of the sub-prime and all the complicated financial structures, it was quite opposite to the reckless risk-taking behaviors that we saw on the market. We also believe in straight-talking, telling it as it is, using simple language that people understand, telling people about the downsides as well as the potential upsides, and even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter, like our lack of belief in the sustainability of the Icelandic financial sector that already we had months before the collapse hit us. And, although we do work in the financial sector, where Excel is king, we believe in emotional capital. And we believe that doing emotional due diligence is just as important as doing financial due diligence. It is actually people that make money and lose money, not Excel spreadsheets.(Applause)Last, but not least, we believe in profit with principles. We care how we make our profit. So while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers, we are willing to do it with a long-term view, and we like to have a wider definition of profits than just the economic profit in the next quarter. So we like to see profits, plus positive social and environmental benefits, when we invest.But it wasn't just about the values, although we are convinced that they matter. It was also about a business opportunity. It's the female trend, and it's the sustainability trend, that are going to create some of the most interesting investment opportunities in the years to come. The whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men; it is actually about women being different from men, bringing different values and different ways to the table. So what do you get? You get better decision-making, and you get less herd behavior, and both of those things hit your bottom line with very positive results.But one has to wonder, now that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland \u2014 and by the way, Europe looks pretty bad right now, and many would say that you in America are heading for some more trouble as well. Now that we've had all that happen, and we have all this data out there telling us that it's much better to have diversity around the decision-making tables, will we see business and finance change? Will government change?Well I'll give you my straight talk about this. I have days that I believe, but I have days that I'm full of doubt. Have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us? (Applause) Einstein said that this was the definition of insanity \u2014 to do the same things over and over again, hoping for a different outcome. So I guess the world is insane, because I see entirely too much of doing the same things over and over again, hoping that this time it's not going to collapse upon us. I want to see more revolutionary thinking, and I remain hopeful. Like TED, I believe in people. And I know that consumers are becoming more conscious, and they are going to start voting with their wallets, and they are going to change the face of business and finance from the outside, if they don't do it from the inside.But I'm more of the revolutionary, and I should be; I'm from Iceland. We have a long history of strong, courageous, independent women, ever since the Viking age. And I want to tell you when I first realized that women matter to the economy and to the society, I was seven \u2014 it happened to be my mother's birthday \u2014 October 24, 1975. Women in Iceland took the day off. From work or from home, they took the day off, and nothing worked in Iceland. (Laughter) They marched into the center of Reykjavik, and they put women's issues onto the agenda. And some say this was the start of a global movement. For me it was the start of a long journey, but I decided that day to matter. Five years later, Iceland elected Vigdis Finnbogadottir as their president \u2014 first female to become head of state, single mom, a breast cancer survivor who had had one of her breasts removed. And at one of the campaign sessions, she had one of her male contenders allude to the fact that she couldn't become president \u2014 she was a woman, and even half a woman. That night she won the election, because she came back \u2014 not just because of his crappy behavior \u2014 but she came back and said, \"Well, I'm actually not going to breastfeed the Icelandic nation; I'm going to lead it.\"(Applause)So I've had incredibly many women role models that have influenced who I am and where I am today. But in spite of that, I went through the first 10 or 15 years of my career mostly in denial of being a woman. Started in corporate America, and I was absolutely convinced that it was just about the individual, that women and men would have just the same opportunities. But I've come to conclude lately that it isn't like that. We are not the same, and it's great. Because of our differences, we create and sustain life. So we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge.The final thought I want to leave with you is that I'm fed up with this tyranny of either/or choices in life \u2014 either it's men or it's women. We need to start embracing the beauty of balance. So let's move away from thinking about business here and philanthropy there, and let's start thinking about doing good business. That's how we change the world. That's the only sustainable future.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1030, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nIt sure used to be a lot

market.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nWe also believe in straight-talking,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\ntelling it as it is,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nusing simple language that people understand,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\ntelling people about the downsides\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nas well as the potential upsides,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nand even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nlike our lack of belief in the sustainability\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nof the Icelandic financial sector\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nthat already we had\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nmonths before the collapse hit us.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nAnd, although we do work in the financial sector,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nwhere Excel is king,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nwe believe in emotional capital.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nAnd we believe\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nthat doing emotional due diligence\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nis just as important\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nas doing financial due diligence.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nIt is actually people\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nthat make money and lose money,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nnot Excel

principles.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nWe care how we make our profit.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nSo while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nwe are willing to do it with a long-term view,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nand we like to have a wider definition of profits\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nthan just the economic profit in the next quarter.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nSo we like to see profits,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nplus positive social\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nand environmental benefits, when we invest.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nBut it wasn't just about the values,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nalthough we are convinced that they matter.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nIt was also about a business opportunity.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nIt's the female trend, and it's the sustainability trend,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nthat are going to create\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nsome of the most interesting investment opportunities\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nin the years to come.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nThe whole thing about the female trend\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nis not about women being better than men;\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nit is actually about\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nwomen being different from men,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nbringing different values and different ways to the table.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nSo what do you get? You get better decision-making,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nand you get less herd behavior,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nand both of those things hit your bottom line\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nwith very positive results.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nBut one has to wonder,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nnow that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland --\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nand by the way, Europe looks pretty bad right now,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nand many would say that you in America\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nare heading for some more trouble as well.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nNow that we've had all that happen,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nand we have all this data out there\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\ntelling us that it's much better to have diversity\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\naround the decision-making tables,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nwill we see business and finance change?\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nWill government change?\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nWell I'll give you my straight talk about this.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nI have days that I believe,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nbut I have days that I'm full of doubt.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nHave you seen the incredible urge out there\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nto rebuild the very things that failed us?\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nEinstein said\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nthat this was the definition of insanity --\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nto do the same things\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nover and over again,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nhoping for a different outcome.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nSo I guess the world is insane,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nbecause I see entirely too much\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nof doing the same things over and over again,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nhoping that this time it's not going to collapse upon us.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nI want to see more revolutionary thinking,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nand I remain hopeful.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nLike TED, I believe in people.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nAnd I know that consumers\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nare becoming more conscious,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nand they are going to start voting with their wallets,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nand they are going to change the face\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nof business and finance from the outside,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nif they don't do it from the inside.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nBut I'm more of the revolutionary,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nand I should be;

Growing up as a boy, we were taught that men had to be tough, had to be strong, had to be courageous, dominating \u2014 no pain, no emotions, with the exception of anger \u2014 and definitely no fear; that men are in charge, which means women are not; that men lead, and you should just follow and do what we say; that men are superior; women are inferior; that men are strong; women are weak; that women are of less value, property of men, and objects, particularly sexual objects. I've later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men, better known as the \"man box.\" See this man box has in it all the ingredients of how we define what it means to be a man. Now I also want to say, without a doubt, there are some wonderful, wonderful, absolutely wonderful things about being a man. But at the same time, there's some stuff that's just straight up twisted, and we really need to begin to challenge, look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing, redefining, what we come to know as manhood.This is my two at home, Kendall and Jay. They're 11 and 12. Kendall's 15 months older than Jay. There was a period of time when my wife \u2014 her name is Tammie \u2014 and I, we just got real busy and whip, bam, boom: Kendall and Jay. (Laughter) And when they were about five and six, four and five, Jay could come to me, come to me crying. It didn't matter what she was crying about, she could get on my knee, she could snot my sleeve up, just cry, cry it out. Daddy's got you. That's all that's important.Now Kendall on the other hand \u2014 and like I said, he's only 15 months older than her \u2014 he'd come to me crying, it's like as soon as I would hear him cry, a clock would go off. I would give the boy probably about 30 seconds, which means, by the time he got to me, I was already saying things like, \"Why are you crying? Hold your head up. Look at me. Explain to me what's wrong. Tell me what's wrong. I can't understand you. Why are you crying?\" And out of my own frustration of my role and responsibility of building him up as a man to fit into these guidelines and these structures that are defining this man box, I would find myself saying things like, \"Just go in your room. Just go on, go on in your room. Sit down, get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a \u2014\" what? (Audience: Man.) Like a man. And he's five years old. And as I grow in life, I would say to myself, \"My God, what's wrong with me? What am I doing? Why would I do this?\" And I think back. I think back to my father.There was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family. My brother, Henry, he died tragically when we were teenagers. We lived in New York City, as I said. We lived in the Bronx at the time, and the burial was in a place called Long Island, it was about two hours outside of the city. And as we were preparing to come back from the burial, the cars stopped at the bathroom to let folks take care of themselves before the long ride back to the city. And the limousine empties out. My mother, my sister, my auntie, they all get out, but my father and I stayed in the limousine, and no sooner than the women got out, he burst out crying. He didn't want cry in front of me, but he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city, and it was better me than to allow himself to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women. And this is a man who, 10 minutes ago, had just put his teenage son in the ground \u2014 something I just can't even imagine. The thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me for crying in front of me, and at the same time, he was also giving me props, lifting me up, for not crying.I come to also look at this as this fear that we have as men, this fear that just has us paralyzed, holding us hostage to this man box. I can remember speaking to a 12-year-old boy, a football player, and I asked him, I said, \"How would you feel if, in front of all the players, your coach told you you were playing like a girl?\" Now I expected him to say something like, I'd be sad; I'd be mad; I'd be angry, or something like that. No, the boy said to me \u2014 the boy said to me, \"It would destroy me.\" And I said to myself, \"God, if it would destroy him to be called a girl, what are we then teaching him about girls?\"(Applause)It took me back to a time when I was about 12 years old. I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city. At this time we're living in the Bronx, and in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny. He was about 16 years old, and we were all about 12 years old \u2014 younger guys. And he was hanging out with all us younger guys. And this guy, he was up to a lot of no good. He was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder, \"What is this 16-year-old boy doing with these 12-year-old boys?\" And he did spend a lot of time up to no good. He was a troubled kid. His mother had died from a heroin overdose. He was being raised by his grandmother. His father wasn't on the set. His grandmother had two jobs. He was home alone a lot. But I've got to tell you, we young guys, we looked up to this dude, man. He was cool. He was fine. That's what the sisters said, \"He was fine.\" He was having sex. We all looked up to him.So one day, I'm out in front of the house doing something \u2014 just playing around, doing something \u2014 I don't know what. He looks out his window; he calls me upstairs; he said, \"Hey Anthony.\" They called me Anthony growing up as a kid. \"Hey Anthony, come on upstairs.\" Johnny call, you go. So I run right upstairs. As he opens the door, he says to me, \"Do you want some?\" Now I immediately knew what he meant. Because for me growing up at that time, and our relationship with this man box, \"Do you want some?\" meant one of two things: sex or drugs \u2014 and we weren't doing drugs. Now my box, my card, my man box card, was immediately in jeopardy. Two things: One, I never had sex. We don't talk about that as men. You only tell your dearest, closest friend, sworn to secrecy for life, the first time you had sex. For everybody else, we go around like we've been having sex since we were two. There ain't no first time. (Laughter) The other thing I couldn't tell him is that I didn't want any. That's even worse. We're supposed to always be on the prowl. Women are objects, especially sexual objects.Anyway, so I couldn't tell him any of that. So, like my mother would say, make a long story short, I just simply said to Johnny, \"Yes.\" He told me to go in his room. I go in his room. On his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named Sheila. She's 16 years old. She's nude. She's what I know today to be mentally ill, higher-functioning at times than others. We had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her. Anyway, Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her. Well actually, he raped her, but he would say he had sex with her. Because, while Sheila never said no, she also never said yes.So he was offering me the opportunity to do the same. So when I go in the room, I close the door. Folks, I'm petrified. I stand with my back to the door so Johnny can't bust in the room and see that I'm not doing anything, and I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something. So now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do; I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room. So in my 12 years of wisdom, I zip my pants down, I walk out into the room, and lo and behold to me, while I was in the room with Sheila, Johnny was back at the window calling guys up. So now there's a living room full of guys. It was like the waiting room in the doctor's office. And they asked me how was it, and I say to them, \"It was good,\" and I zip my pants up in front of them, and I head for the door.Now I say this all with remorse, and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time, but I was conflicted, because, while I was feeling remorse, I was excited, because I didn't get caught. But I knew I felt bad about what was happening. This fear, getting outside the man box, totally enveloped me. It was way more important to me, about me and my man box card than about Sheila and what was happening to her.See collectively, we as men are taught to have less value in women, to view them as property and the objects of men. We see that as an equation that equals violence against women. We as men, good men, the large majority of men, we operate on the foundation of this whole collective socialization. We kind of see ourselves separate, but we're very much a part of it. You see, we have to come to understand that less value, property and objectification is the foundation and the violence can't happen without it. So we're very much a part of the solution as well as the problem. The center for disease control says that men's violence against women is at epidemic proportions, is the number one health concern for women in this country and abroad.So quickly, I'd like to just say, this is the love of my life, my daughter Jay. The world I envision for her \u2014 how do I want men to be acting and behaving? I need you on board. I need you with me. I need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men \u2014 that it's okay to not be dominating, that it's okay to have feelings and emotions, that it's okay to promote equality, that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it, that it's okay to be whole, that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman.

It's an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey. Let me begin with my parents. I'm a product of this visionary mother and father. Many years ago, when I was born in the '50s \u2014 '50s and '60s didn't belong to girls in India. They belonged to boys. They belonged to boys who would join business and inherit business from parents, and girls would be dolled up to get married. My family, in my city, and almost in the country, was unique. We were four of us, not one, and fortunately no boys. We were four girls and no boys. And my parents were part of a landed property family. My father defied his own grandfather, almost to the point of disinheritance, because he decided to educate all four of us. He sent us to one of the best schools in the city and gave us the best education. As I've said, when we're born, we don't choose our parents, and when we go to school, we don't choose our school. Children don't choose a school. They just get the school which parents choose for them. So this is the foundation time which I got. I grew up like this, and so did my other three sisters. And my father used to say at that time, \"I'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world.\" I don't know if he really meant [that], but it happened. I'm the only one who's left in India. One is a British, another is an American and the third is a Canadian. So we are four of us in four corners of the world.And since I said they're my role models, I followed two things which my father and mother gave me. One, they said, \"Life is on an incline. You either go up, or you come down.\" And the second thing, which has stayed with me, which became my philosophy of life, which made all the difference, is: 100 things happen in your life, good or bad. Out of 100, 90 are your creation. They're good. They're your creation. Enjoy it. If they're bad, they're your creation. Learn from it. Ten are nature-sent over which you can't do a thing. It's like a death of a relative, or a cyclone, or a hurricane, or an earthquake. You can't do a thing about it. You've got to just respond to the situation. But that response comes out of those 90 points. Since I'm a product of this philosophy, of 90/10, and secondly, \"life on an incline,\" that's the way I grew up to be valuing what I got. I'm a product of opportunities, rare opportunities in the '50s and the '60s, which girls didn't get, and I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me was something unique. Because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up to get married with a lot of dowry, and here I was with a tennis racket and going to school and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities. I thought I must tell you this. Why I said this, is the background.This is what comes next. I joined the Indian Police Service as a tough woman, a woman with indefatigable stamina, because I used to run for my tennis titles, etc. But I joined the Indian Police Service, and then it was a new pattern of policing. For me the policing stood for power to correct, power to prevent and power to detect. This is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India \u2014 the power to prevent. Because normally it was always said, power to detect, and that's it, or power to punish. But I decided no, it's a power to prevent, because that's what I learned when I was growing up. How do I prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10? So this was how it came into my service, and it was different from the men. I didn't want to make it different from the men, but it was different, because this was the way I was different. And I redefined policing concepts in India. I'm going to take you on two journeys, my policing journey and my prison journey. What you see, if you see the title called \"PM's car held.\" This was the first time a prime minister of India was given a parking ticket. (Laughter) That's the first time in India, and I can tell you, that's the last time you're hearing about it. It'll never happen again in India, because now it was once and forever. And the rule was, because I was sensitive, I was compassionate, I was very sensitive to injustice, and I was very pro-justice. That's the reason, as a woman, I joined the Indian Police Service. I had other options, but I didn't choose them.So I'm going to move on. This is about tough policing, equal policing. Now I was known as \"here's a woman that's not going to listen.\" So I was sent to all indiscriminate postings, postings which others would say no. I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer. Normally police officers don't want to do prison. They sent me to prison to lock me up, thinking, \"Now there will be no cars and no VIPs to be given tickets to. Let's lock her up.\" Here I got a prison assignment. This was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals. Obviously, it was. But 10,000 men, of which only 400 were women \u2014 10,000 \u2014 9,000 plus about 600 were men. Terrorists, rapists, burglars, gangsters \u2014 some of them I'd sent to jail as a police officer outside. And then how did I deal with them? The first day when I went in, I didn't know how to look at them. And I said, \"Do you pray?\" When I looked at the group, I said, \"Do you pray?\" They saw me as a young, short woman wearing a pathan suit. I said, \"Do you pray?\" And they didn't say anything. I said, \"Do you pray? Do you want to pray?\" They said, \"Yes.\" I said, \"All right, let's pray.\" I prayed for them, and things started to change. This is a visual of education inside the prison.Friends, this has never happened, where everybody in the prison studies. I started this with community support. Government had no budget. It was one of the finest, largest volunteerism in any prison in the world. This was initiated in Delhi prison. You see one sample of a prisoner teaching a class. These are hundreds of classes. Nine to eleven, every prisoner went into the education program \u2014 the same den in which they thought they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten. We converted this into an ashram \u2014 from a prison to an ashram through education. I think that's the bigger change. It was the beginning of a change. Teachers were prisoners. Teachers were volunteers. Books came from donated schoolbooks. Stationery was donated. Everything was donated, because there was no budget of education for the prison. Now if I'd not done that, it would have been a hellhole.That's the second landmark. I want to show you some moments of history in my journey, which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world. One, the numbers you'll never get to see. Secondly, this concept. This was a meditation program inside the prison of over 1,000 prisoners. One thousand prisoners who sat in meditation. This was one of the most courageous steps I took as a prison governor. And this is what transformed. You want to know more about this, go and see this film, \"Doing Time, Doing Vipassana.\" You will hear about it, and you will love it. And write to me on KiranBedi.com, and I'll respond to you. Let me show you the next slide. I took the same concept of mindfulness, because, why did I bring meditation into the Indian prison? Because crime is a product of a distorted mind. It was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control. Not by preaching, not by telling, not by reading, but by addressing your mind. I took the same thing to the police, because police, equally, were prisoners of their minds, and they felt as if it was \"we\" and \"they,\" and that the people don't cooperate. This worked.This is a feedback box called a petition box. This is a concept which I introduced to listen to complaints, listen to grievances. This was a magic box. This was a sensitive box. This is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison. If you see somebody in the blue \u2014 yeah, this guy \u2014 he was a prisoner, and he was a teacher. And you see, everybody's busy. There was no time to waste.Let me wrap it up. I'm currently into movements, movements of education of the under-served children, which is thousands \u2014 India is all about thousands. Secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in India. That's a big way we, as a small group of activists, have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of India. Friends, you will hear a lot about it. That's the movement at the moment I'm driving, and that's the movement and ambition of my life.Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you very much.

In my mother's day, she didn't go to college. Not a lot of women did. And now, for every two men who get a college degree, three women will do the same. Women, for the first time this year, became the majority of the American workforce. And they're starting to dominate lots of professions \u2014 doctors, lawyers, bankers, accountants. Over 50 percent of managers are women these days, and in the 15 professions projected to grow the most in the next decade, all but two of them are dominated by women. So the global economy is becoming a place where women are more successful than men, believe it or not, and these economic changes are starting to rapidly affect our culture \u2014 what our romantic comedies look like, what our marriages look like, what our dating lives look like, and our new set of superheroes.For a long time, this is the image of American manhood that dominated \u2014 tough, rugged, in control of his own environment. A few years ago, the Marlboro Man was retired and replaced by this much less impressive specimen, who is a parody of American manhood, and that's what we have in our commercials today. The phrase \"first-born son\" is so deeply ingrained in our consciousness that this statistic alone shocked me. In American fertility clinics, 75 percent of couples are requesting girls and not boys. And in places where you wouldn't think, such as South Korea, India and China, the very strict patriarchal societies are starting to break down a little, and families are no longer strongly preferring first-born sons.If you think about this, if you just open your eyes to this possibility and start to connect the dots, you can see the evidence everywhere. You can see it in college graduation patterns, in job projections, in our marriage statistics, you can see it in the Icelandic elections, which you'll hear about later, and you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference, that something amazing and unprecedented is happening with women. Certainly this is not the first time that we've had great progress with women. The '20s and the '60s also come to mind. But the difference is that, back then, it was driven by a very passionate feminist movement that was trying to project its own desires, whereas this time, it's not about passion, and it's not about any kind of movement. This is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in. The 200,000-year period in which men have been top dog is truly coming to an end, believe it or not, and that's why I talk about the \"end of men.\"Now all you men out there, this is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes, because the point is that this is happening to all of us. I myself have a husband and a father and two sons whom I dearly love. And this is why I like to talk about this, because if we don't acknowledge it, then the transition will be pretty painful. But if we do take account of it, then I think it will go much more smoothly. I first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago. I was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else, and I started to notice a distinct pattern \u2014 that the recession was affecting men much more deeply than it was affecting women. And I remembered back to about 10 years ago when I read a book by Susan Faludi called \"Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man,\" in which she described how hard the recession had hit men, and I started to think about whether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession. And I realized that two things were different this time around. The first was that these were no longer just temporary hits that the recession was giving men \u2014 that this was reflecting a deeper underlying shift in our global economy. And second, that the story was no longer just about the crisis of men, but it was also about what was happening to women.And now look at this second set of slides. These are headlines about what's been going on with women in the next few years. These are things we never could have imagined a few years ago. Women, a majority of the workplace. And labor statistics: women take up most managerial jobs. This second set of headlines \u2014 you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift. And look at that last headline \u2014 young women earning more than young men. That particular headline comes to me from a market research firm. They were basically asked by one of their clients who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future. And they expected that it would be young families, or young men, just like it had always been. But in fact, they found something very surprising. It was young, single women who were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood. And so they decided, because they were intrigued by this finding, to do a nationwide survey. So they spread out all the census data, and what they found, the guy described to me as a shocker, which is that in 1,997 out of 2,000 communities, women, young women, were making more money than young men. So here you have a generation of young women who grow up thinking of themselves as being more powerful earners than the young men around them.Now, I've just laid out the picture for you, but I still haven't explained to you why this is happening. And in a moment, I'm going to show you a graph, and what you'll see on this graph \u2014 it begins in 1973, just before women start flooding the workforce, and it brings us up to our current day. And basically what you'll see is what economists talk about as the polarization of the economy. Now what does that mean? It means that the economy is dividing into high-skill, high-wage jobs and low-skill, low-wage jobs \u2014 and that the middle, the middle-skill jobs, and the middle-earning jobs, are starting to drop out of the economy. This has been going on for 40 years now. But this process is affecting men very differently than it's affecting women. You'll see the women in red, and you'll see the men in blue. You'll watch them both drop out of the middle class, but see what happens to women and see what happens to men. There we go. So watch that. You see them both drop out of the middle class. Watch what happens to the women. Watch what happens to the men. The men sort of stagnate there, while the women zoom up in those high-skill jobs. So what's that about? It looks like women got some power boost on a video game, or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills that lets them shoot up high. But of course, it's not about that.What it's about is that the economy has changed a lot. We used to have a manufacturing economy, which was about building goods and products, and now we have a service economy and an information and creative economy. Those two economies require very different skills, and as it happens, women have been much better at acquiring the new set of skills than men have been. It used to be that you were a guy who went to high school who didn't have a college degree, but you had a specific set of skills, and with the help of a union, you could make yourself a pretty good middle-class life. But that really isn't true anymore. This new economy is pretty indifferent to size and strength, which is what's helped men along all these years. What the economy requires now is a whole different set of skills. You basically need intelligence, you need an ability to sit still and focus, to communicate openly, to be able to listen to people and to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be, and those are things that women do extremely well, as we're seeing.If you look at management theory these days, it used to be that our ideal leader sounded something like General Patton, right? You would be issuing orders from above. You would be very hierarchical. You would tell everyone below you what to do. But that's not what an ideal leader is like now. If you read management books now, a leader is somebody who can foster creativity, who can get his \u2014 get the employees \u2014 see, I still say \"his\" \u2014 who can get the employees to talk to each other, who can basically build teams and get them to be creative. And those are all things that women do very well.And then on top of that, that's created a kind of cascading effect. Women enter the workplace at the top, and then at the working class, all the new jobs that are created are the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home. So that's childcare, elder care and food preparation. So those are all the jobs that are growing, and those are jobs that women tend to do. Now one day it might be that mothers will hire an out-of-work, middle-aged, former steelworker guy to watch their children at home, and that would be good for the men, but that hasn't quite happened yet.To see what's going to happen, you can't just look at the workforce that is now, you have to look at our future workforce. And here the story is fairly simple. Women are getting college degrees at a faster rate than men. Why? This is a real mystery. People have asked men, why don't they just go back to college, to community college, say, and retool themselves, learn a new set of skills? Well it turns out that they're just very uncomfortable doing that. They're used to thinking of themselves as providers, and they can't seem to build the social networks that allow them to get through college. So for some reason men just don't end up going back to college. And what's even more disturbing is what's happening with younger boys. There's been about a decade of research about what people are calling the \"boy crisis.\" Now the boy crisis is this idea that very young boys, for whatever reason, are doing worse in school than very young girls, and people have theories about that. Is it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum, and little girls are better at that than little boys? Or that we require kids to sit still too much, and so boys initially feel like failures? And some people say it's because, in 9th grade, boys start dropping out of school. Because I'm writing a book about all this, I'm still looking into it, so I don't have the answer. But in the mean time, I'm going to call on the worldwide education expert, who's my 10-year-old daughter, Noa, to talk to you about why the boys in her class do worse.(Video) Noa: The girls are obviously smarter. I mean they have much larger vocabulary. They learn much faster. They are more controlled. On the board today for losing recess tomorrow, only boys.Hanna Rosin: And why is that?Noa: Why? They were just not listening to the class while the girls sat there very nicely.HR: So there you go. This whole thesis really came home to me when I went to visit a college in Kansas City \u2014 working-class college. Certainly, when I was in college, I had certain expectations about my life \u2014 that my husband and I would both work, and that we would equally raise the children. But these college girls had a completely different view of their future. Basically, the way they said it to me is that they would be working 18 hours a day, that their husband would maybe have a job, but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies. And this was kind of a shocker to me. And then here's my favorite quote from one of the girls: \"Men are the new ball and chain.\"(Laughter)Now you laugh, but that quote has kind of a sting to it, right? And I think the reason it has a sting is because thousands of years of history don't reverse themselves without a lot of pain, and that's why I talk about us all going through this together. The night after I talked to these college girls, I also went to a men's group in Kansas, and these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy which I spoke to you about earlier. They were men who had been contractors, or they had been building houses and they had lost their jobs after the housing boom, and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support. And the instructor was up there in the class explaining to them all the ways in which they had lost their identity in this new age. He was telling them they no longer had any moral authority, that nobody needed them for emotional support anymore, and they were not really the providers. So who were they? And this was very disheartening for them. And what he did was he wrote down on the board \"$85,000,\" and he said, \"That's her salary,\" and then he wrote down \"$12,000.\" \"That's your salary. So who's the man now?\" he asked them. \"Who's the damn man? She's the man now.\" And that really sent a shudder through the room. And that's part of the reason I like to talk about this, because I think it can be pretty painful, and we really have to work through it.And the other reason it's kind of urgent is because it's not just happening in the U.S. It's happening all over the world. In India, poor women are learning English faster than their male counterparts in order to staff the new call centers that are growing in India. In China, a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship is happening because women are starting businesses, small businesses, faster than men. And here's my favorite example, which is in South Korea. Over several decades, South Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about. They basically enshrined the second-class status of women in the civil code. And if women failed to birth male children, they were basically treated like domestic servants. And sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child so they could have a male child. But over the '70s and '80s, the South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize, and so what they did was, they started to push women into the workforce. Now they've been asking a question since 1985: \"How strongly do you prefer a first-born son?\" And now look at the chart. That's from 1985 to 2003. How much do you prefer a first-born son?So you can see that these economic changes really do have a strong effect on our culture. Now because we haven't fully processed this information, it's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways, where you can see that the stereotypes are changing. And so we have on the male side what one of my colleagues likes to call the \"omega males\" popping up, who are the males who are romantically challenged losers who can't find a job. And they come up in lots of different forms. So we have the perpetual adolescent. We have the charmless misanthrope. Then we have our Bud Light guy who's the happy couch potato. And then here's a shocker: even America's most sexiest man alive, the sexiest man alive gets romantically played these days in a movie. And then on the female side, you have the opposite, in which you have these crazy superhero women. You've got Lady Gaga. You've got our new James Bond, who's Angelina Jolie. And it's not just for the young, right? Even Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days. And so it feels like we have to move from this place where we've got these uber-exaggerated images into something that feels a little more normal.So for a long time in the economic sphere, we've lived with the term \"glass ceiling.\" Now I've never really liked this term. For one thing, it puts men and women in a really antagonistic relationship with one another, because the men are these devious tricksters up there who've put up this glass ceiling. And we're always below the glass ceiling, the women. And we have a lot of skill and experience, but it's a trick, so how are you supposed to prepare to get through that glass ceiling? And also, \"shattering the glass ceiling\" is a terrible phrase. What crazy person would pop their head through a glass ceiling?So the image that I like to think of, instead of glass ceiling, is the high bridge. It's definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge, but it's also pretty exhilarating, because it's beautiful up there, and you're looking out on a beautiful view. And the great thing is there's no trick like with the glass ceiling. There's no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the cables. There's no hole in the middle that you're going to fall through. And the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you. You can bring your husband along. You can bring your friends, or your colleagues, or your babysitter to walk along with you. And husbands can drag their wives across, if their wives don't feel ready. But the point about the high bridge is that you have to have the confidence to know that you deserve to be on that bridge, that you have all the skills and experience you need in order to walk across the high bridge, but you just have to make the decision to take the first step and do it.Thanks very much.(Applause)", "id": 1033, "subtitle":

--\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\ndoctors, lawyers,\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nbankers, accountants.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nOver 50 percent of managers are women these days,\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nand in the 15 professions\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nprojected to grow the most in the next decade,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nall but two of them are dominated by women.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nSo the global economy is becoming a place\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nwhere women are more successful than men,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nbelieve it or not,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nand these economic changes\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nare starting to rapidly affect our culture --\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nwhat our romantic comedies look like,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nwhat our marriages look like,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nwhat our dating lives look like,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nand our new set of superheroes.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nFor a long time, this is the image of American manhood that dominated --\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\ntough, rugged,\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nin control of his own environment.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nA few years ago, the Marlboro Man was retired\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nand replaced by this\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nmuch less impressive specimen,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nwho is a parody of American manhood,\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nand that's what we have in our commercials today.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nThe phrase \"first-born son\"\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nis so deeply ingrained in our consciousness\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nthat this statistic alone shocked me.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nIn American fertility clinics,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\n75 percent of couples\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nare requesting girls and not boys.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nAnd in places where you wouldn't think,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nsuch as South Korea, India and China,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nthe very strict patriarchal societies\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nare starting to break down a little,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nand families are no longer\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nstrongly preferring first-born sons.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nIf you think about this, if you just open your eyes to this possibility\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nand start to connect the dots,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nyou can see the evidence everywhere.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nYou can see it in college graduation patterns,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nin job projections,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nin our marriage statistics,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nyou can see it in the Icelandic elections, which you'll hear about later,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nand you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nthat something amazing and unprecedented\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nis happening with women.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nCertainly this is not the first time that we've had great progress with women.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nThe '20s and the '60s also come to mind.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nBut the difference is that, back then,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nit was driven by a very passionate feminist movement\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nthat was trying to project its own desires,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nwhereas this time, it's not about passion,\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nand it's not about any kind of movement.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nThis is really just about the facts\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nof this economic moment that we live in.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nThe 200,000-year period\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nin which men have been top dog\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nis truly coming to an end, believe it or not,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nand that's why I talk about the \"end of men.\"\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nNow all you men out there,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nthis is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nbecause the point is that this\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nis happening to all of us.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nI myself have a husband and a father\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nand two sons whom I dearly love.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nAnd this is why I like to talk about this,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nbecause if we don't acknowledge it,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nthen the transition will be pretty painful.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nBut if we do take account of it,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nthen I think it will go much more smoothly.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nI first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nI was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nand I started to notice a distinct pattern --\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nthat the recession was affecting men\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nmuch more deeply than it was affecting women.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAnd I remembered back to about 10 years ago\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nwhen I read a book by Susan Faludi\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\ncalled \"Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man,\"\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nin which she described how hard the recession had hit men,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nand I started to think about\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nwhether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nAnd I realized that two things were different this time around.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nThe first was that\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nthese were no longer just temporary hits\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nthat the recession was giving men --\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthat this was reflecting a deeper\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nunderlying shift in our global economy.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nAnd second, that the story was no longer\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\njust about the crisis of men,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nbut it was also about what was happening to women.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nAnd now look at this second set of slides.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nThese are headlines about what's been going on with women in the next few years.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nThese are things we never could have imagined a few years ago.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nWomen, a majority of the workplace.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nAnd labor statistics: women take up most managerial jobs.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nThis second set of headlines --\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nyou can see that families and marriages are starting to shift.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nAnd look at that last headline --\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nyoung women earning more than young men.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nThat particular headline comes to me from a market research firm.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nThey were basically asked by one of their clients\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nwho was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nAnd they expected that it would be young families,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nor young men, just like it had always been.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nBut in fact, they found something very surprising.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nIt was young, single women\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nwho were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nAnd so they decided, because they were intrigued by this finding,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nto do a nationwide survey.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nSo they spread out all the census data,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nand what they found, the guy described to me as a shocker,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nwhich is that in 1,997\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nout of 2,000 communities,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nwomen, young women,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nwere making more money than young men.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nSo here you have a generation of young women\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nwho grow up thinking of themselves\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nas being more powerful earners\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nthan the young men around them.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nNow, I've just laid out the picture for you,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nbut I still haven't explained to you why this is happening.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nAnd in a moment, I'm going to show you a graph,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nand what you'll see on this graph --\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nit begins in 1973,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\njust before women start flooding the workforce,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nand it brings us up to our current day.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nAnd basically what you'll see\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nis what economists talk about\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nas the polarization of the economy.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nNow what does that mean?\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nIt means that the economy is dividing into high-skill, high-wage jobs\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nand low-skill, low-wage jobs --\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nand that the middle, the middle-skill jobs,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nand the middle-earning jobs, are starting to drop out of the economy.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nThis has been going on for 40 years now.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nBut this process is affecting men\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nvery differently than it's affecting women.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nYou'll see the women in red, and you'll see the men in blue.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nYou'll watch them both drop out of the middle class,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nbut see what happens to women and see what happens to men.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nThere we go.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nSo watch that. You see them both drop out of the middle class.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nWatch what happens to the women. Watch what happens to the men.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nThe men sort of stagnate there,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nwhile the women zoom up in those high-skill jobs.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nSo what's that about?\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nIt looks like women got some power boost on a video game,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nor like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nthat lets them shoot up high.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nBut of course, it's not about that.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nWhat it's about is that the economy has changed a lot.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nWe used to have a manufacturing economy,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nwhich was about building goods and products,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nand now we have a service economy\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nand an information and creative economy.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nThose two economies require very different skills,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand as it happens, women have been much better\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nat acquiring the new set of skills than men have been.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nIt used to be that you were\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\na guy who went to high school\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nwho didn't have a college degree,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nbut you had a specific set of skills,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nand with the help of a union,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nyou could make yourself a pretty good middle-class life.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nBut that really isn't true anymore.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nThis new economy is pretty indifferent\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nto size and strength,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nwhich is what's helped men along all these years.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nWhat the economy requires now\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nis a whole different set of skills.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nYou basically need intelligence,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nyou need an ability to sit still and focus,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nto communicate openly,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nto be able to listen to people\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nand to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nand those are things that women do extremely well,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nas we're seeing.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nIf you look at management theory these days,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nit used to be that our ideal leader\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nsounded something like General Patton, right?\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nYou would be issuing orders from above.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nYou would be very hierarchical.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nYou would tell everyone below you what to do.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nBut that's not what an ideal leader is like now.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nIf you read management books now,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\na leader is somebody who can foster creativity,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nwho can get his -- get the employees -- see, I still say \"his\" --\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nwho can get the employees to talk to each other,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nwho can basically build teams and get them to be creative.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nAnd those are all things that women do very well.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nAnd then on top of that, that's created a kind of cascading effect.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nWomen enter the workplace at the top,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nand then at the working class,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nall the new jobs that are created\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nare the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nSo that's childcare,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nelder care and food preparation.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nSo those are all the jobs that are growing,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nand those are jobs that women tend to do.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nNow one day it might be\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nthat mothers will hire an out-of-work,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nmiddle-aged, former steelworker guy\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nto watch their children at home,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nand that would be good for the men, but that hasn't quite happened yet.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nTo see what's going to happen, you can't just look at the workforce that is now,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nyou have to look at our future workforce.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nAnd here the story is fairly simple.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nWomen are getting college degrees\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nat a faster rate than men.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nWhy? This is a real mystery.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nPeople have asked men, why don't they just go back to college,\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nto community college, say, and retool themselves,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nlearn a new set of skills?\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nWell it turns out that they're just very uncomfortable doing that.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nThey're used to thinking of themselves as providers,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nand they can't seem to build the social networks\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nthat allow them to get through college.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nSo for some reason\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nmen just don't end up going back to college.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nAnd what's even more disturbing\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nis what's happening with younger boys.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nThere's been about a decade of research\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nabout what people are calling the \"boy crisis.\"\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nNow the boy crisis is this idea\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nthat very young boys, for whatever reason,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nare doing worse in school than very young girls,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nand people have theories about that.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nIs it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nand little girls are better at that than little boys?\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nOr that we require kids to sit still too much,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nand so boys initially feel like failures?\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nAnd some people say it's because,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nin 9th grade, boys start dropping out of school.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nBecause I'm writing a book about all this, I'm still looking into it,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nso I don't have the answer.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nBut in the mean time, I'm going to call on the worldwide education expert,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nwho's my 10-year-old daughter, Noa,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nto talk to you about\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nwhy the boys in her class do worse.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\n(Video) Noa: The girls are obviously smarter.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nI mean they have much larger vocabulary.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nThey learn much faster.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nThey are more controlled.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nOn the board today for losing recess tomorrow, only boys.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nHanna Rosin: And why is that?\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nNoa: Why? They were just not listening to the class\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nwhile the girls sat there very nicely.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nHR: So there you go.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nThis whole thesis really came home to me\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nwhen I went to visit a college in Kansas City --\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nworking-class college.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nCertainly, when I was in college, I had certain expectations about my life --\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nthat my husband and I would both work,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nand that we would equally raise the children.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nBut these college girls\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nhad a completely different view of their future.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nBasically, the way they said it to me is\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nthat they would be working 18 hours a day,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nthat their husband would maybe have a job,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nbut that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nAnd this was kind of a shocker to me.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAnd then here's my favorite quote from one of the girls:\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\n\"Men are the new ball and chain.\"\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nNow you laugh,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nbut that quote has kind of a sting to it, right?\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nAnd I think the reason it has a sting\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nis because thousands of years of history\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\ndon't reverse themselves\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nwithout a lot of pain,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nand that's why I talk about\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nus all going through this together.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nThe night after I talked to these college girls,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nI also went to a men's group in Kansas,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nand these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nwhich I spoke to you about earlier.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nThey were men who had been contractors,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nor they had been building houses\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nand they had lost their jobs after the housing boom,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nand they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nAnd the instructor was up there in the class\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nexplaining to them all the ways\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nin which they had lost their identity in this new age.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nHe was telling them they no longer had any moral authority,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nthat nobody needed them for emotional support anymore,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nand they were not really the providers.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nSo who were they?\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nAnd this was very disheartening for them.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nAnd what he did was he wrote down on the board\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\n\"$85,000,\"\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nand he said, \"That's her salary,\"\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nand then he wrote down \"$12,000.\"\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\n\"That's your salary.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nSo who's the man now?\" he asked them.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\n\"Who's the damn man?\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nShe's the man now.\"\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAnd that really sent a shudder through the room.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nAnd that's part of the reason I like to talk about this,\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nbecause I think it can be pretty painful,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand we really have to work through it.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nAnd the other reason it's kind of urgent\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nis because it's not just happening in the U.S.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nIt's happening all over the world.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nIn India, poor women are learning English\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nfaster than their male counterparts\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nin order to staff the new call centers\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nthat are growing in India.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nIn China, a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nis happening because women are starting businesses,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nsmall businesses, faster than men.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nAnd here's my favorite example, which is in South Korea.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nOver several decades,\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nSouth Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nThey basically enshrined the second-class status of women\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nin the civil code.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nAnd if women failed to birth male children,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nthey were basically treated like domestic servants.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nAnd sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nso they could have a male child.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nBut over the '70s and '80s,\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nthe South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize,\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nand so what they did was,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nthey started to push women into the workforce.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nNow they've been asking a question since 1985:\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\n\"How strongly do you prefer a first-born son?\"\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nAnd now look at the chart.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nThat's from 1985 to 2003.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nHow much do you prefer a first-born son?\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nSo you can see that these economic changes\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nreally do have a strong effect on our culture.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nNow because we haven't fully processed this information,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nit's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nin these kind of weird and exaggerated ways,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nwhere you can see that the stereotypes are changing.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nAnd so we have on the male side\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nwhat one of my colleagues likes to call the \"omega males\" popping up,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nwho are the males who are romantically challenged losers\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nwho can't find a job.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nAnd they come up in lots of different forms.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nSo we have the perpetual adolescent.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nWe have the charmless misanthrope.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nThen we have our Bud Light guy\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nwho's the happy couch potato.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nAnd then here's a shocker: even America's most sexiest man alive,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nthe sexiest man alive\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\ngets romantically played these days in a movie.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nAnd then on the female side, you have the opposite,\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nin which you have these crazy superhero women.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nYou've got Lady Gaga.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nYou've got our new James Bond, who's Angelina Jolie.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nAnd it's not just for the young, right?\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nEven Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nAnd so it feels like we have to move from this place\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nwhere we've got these uber-exaggerated images\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\ninto something that feels a little more normal.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nSo for a long time in the economic sphere,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nwe've lived with the term \"glass ceiling.\"\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nNow I've never really liked this term.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nFor one thing, it puts men and women\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nin a really antagonistic relationship with one another,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nbecause the men are these devious tricksters up there\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nwho've put up this glass ceiling.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nAnd we're always below the glass ceiling, the women.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nAnd we have a lot of skill and experience,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nbut it's a trick, so how are you supposed to prepare\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nto get through that glass ceiling?\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nAnd also, \"shattering the glass ceiling\" is a terrible phrase.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nWhat crazy person\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nwould pop their head through a glass ceiling?\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nSo the image that I like to think of,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\ninstead of glass ceiling,\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nis the high bridge.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nIt's definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nbut it's also pretty exhilarating,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nbecause it's beautiful up there,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nand you're looking out on a beautiful view.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nAnd the great thing is there's no trick like with the glass ceiling.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nThere's no man or woman standing in the middle\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nabout to cut the cables.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nThere's no hole in the middle that you're going to fall through.\n\n00:15:23.958 -->

From mistakes", "duration": "605", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/diana_laufenberg_3_ways_to_teach", "transcript": "I have been teaching for a long time, and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students. In 1931, my grandmother \u2014 bottom left for you guys over here \u2014 graduated from the eighth grade. She went to school to get the information because that's where the information lived. It was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head; and she needed to go there to get the information, because that's how you learned. Fast-forward a generation: this is the one-room schoolhouse, Oak Grove, where my father went to a one-room schoolhouse. And he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher, stored it in the only portable memory he has, which is inside his own head, and take it with him, because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world. When I was a kid, we had a set of encyclopedias at my house. It was purchased the year I was born, and it was extraordinary, because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information. The information was inside my house and it was awesome. This was different than either generation had experienced before, and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level. But the information was closer to me. I could get access to it.In the time that passes between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teaching, we really see the advent of the Internet. Right about the time that the Internet gets going as an educational tool, I take off from Wisconsin and move to Kansas, small town Kansas, where I had an opportunity to teach in a lovely, small-town, rural Kansas school district, where I was teaching my favorite subject, American government. My first year \u2014 super gung-ho \u2014 going to teach American government, loved the political system. Kids in the 12th grade: not exactly all that enthusiastic about the American government system. Year two: learned a few things \u2014 had to change my tactic. And I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves. I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it. I posed a problem in front of them, which was to put on an election forum for their own community.They produced flyers. They called offices. They checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries. They produced an election forum booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates. They invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and whether or not the streets were done well, and really had this robust experiential learning. The older teachers \u2014 more experienced \u2014 looked at me and went, \"Oh, there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done.\" (Laughter) \"She doesn't know what she's in for.\" But I knew that the kids would show up, and I believed it, and I told them every week what I expected out of them. And that night, all 90 kids \u2014 dressed appropriately, doing their job, owning it. I had to just sit and watch. It was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic. It meant something to them. And they will step up.From Kansas, I moved on to lovely Arizona, where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years, this time with middle school students. Luckily, I didn't have to teach them American government. Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography. Again, \"thrilled\" to learn. But what was interesting about this position I found myself in in Arizona, was I had this really extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school, and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities. And one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina, which is the gentleman that the movie \"Hotel Rwanda\" is based after. And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us. We could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses. There was no expense cost. Perfect field trip.The problem then becomes how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful, and they know what to do with it. And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive. I then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life, or in their own story, or in their own world, that they could identify that had done a similar thing. I asked them to produce a little movie about it. It's the first time we'd done this. Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer, but they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it. It was the most awesome moment of revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves, what they're willing to share. The last question of the assignment is: how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people? The things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary.Fast-forward to Pennsylvania, where I find myself today. I teach at the Science Leadership Academy, which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute and the school district of Philadelphia. We are a nine through 12 public school, but we do school quite differently. I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learned, and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past, of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school, and to a moment when we have information surplus. So what do you do when the information is all around you? Why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information?In Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program, so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday, taking them home, getting access to information. And here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you've given the tool to acquire information to students, is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process. We deal right now in the educational landscape with an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test, and I am here to share with you: it is not learning. That is the absolute wrong thing to ask, to tell kids to never be wrong. To ask them to always have the right answer doesn't allow them to learn. So we did this project, and this is one of the artifacts of the project. I almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure.My students produced these info-graphics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill. I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the info-graphics that existed in a lot of mass media, and take a look at what were the interesting components of it, and produce one for themselves of a different man-made disaster from American history. And they had certain criteria to do it. They were a little uncomfortable with it, because we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it. They can talk \u2014 they're very smooth, and they can write very, very well, but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them. But I gave them the room to just do the thing. Go create. Go figure it out. Let's see what we can do. And the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint. This was done in like two or three days. And this is the work of the student that consistently did it.And when I sat the students down, I said, \"Who's got the best one?\" And they immediately went, \"There it is.\" Didn't read anything. \"There it is.\" And I said, \"Well what makes it great?\" And they're like, \"Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color. And there's some ... \" And they went through all that we processed out loud. And I said, \"Go read it.\" And they're like, \"Oh, that one wasn't so awesome.\" And then we went to another one \u2014 it didn't have great visuals, but it had great information \u2014 and spent an hour talking about the learning process, because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect, or whether or not it was what I could create. It asked them to create for themselves, and it allowed them to fail, process, learn from. And when we do another round of this in my class this year, they will do better this time, because learning has to include an amount of failure, because failure is instructional in the process.There are a million pictures that I could click through here, and had to choose carefully \u2014 this is one of my favorites \u2014 of students learning, of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information, but instead, ask them what they can do with it. Ask them really interesting questions. They will not disappoint. Ask them to go to places, to see things for themselves, to actually experience the learning, to play, to inquire. This is one of my favorite photos, because this was taken on Tuesday, when I asked the students to go to the polls. This is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting, and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that. But this is learning too, because we asked them to go out into real spaces.The main point is that, if we continue to look at education as if it's about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning, empowering student voice and embracing failure, we're missing the mark. And everything that everybody is talking about today isn't possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities, because we won't get there with a standardized test, and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer. We know how to do this better, and it's time to do better.(Applause)", "id": 1034, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nI have been teaching for a long time,\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nand in doing so\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nhave acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nthat I really wish more people would understand\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nabout the potential of students.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nIn 1931, my grandmother --\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nbottom left for you guys over here --\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\ngraduated from the eighth grade.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nShe went to school to get the information\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nbecause that's where the information lived.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nIt was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head;\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nand she needed to go there to get the information,\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nbecause that's how you learned.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nFast-forward a generation:\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nthis is the one-room schoolhouse, Oak Grove,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nwhere my father went to a one-room schoolhouse.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nAnd he again had to travel to the school\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nto get the information from the teacher,\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nstored it in the only portable memory he has, which is inside his own head,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nand take it with him,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nbecause that is how information was being transported\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nfrom teacher to student and then used in the world.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nWhen I was a kid,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nwe had a set of encyclopedias at my house.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nIt was purchased the year I was born,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nand it was extraordinary,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nbecause I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nThe information was inside my house\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nand it was awesome.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nThis was different\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nthan either generation had experienced before,\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nand it changed the way I interacted with information\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\neven at just a small level.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nBut the information was closer to me.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nI could get access to it.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nIn the time that passes\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nbetween when I was a kid in high school\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nand when I started teaching,\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nwe really see the advent of the Internet.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nRight about the time that the Internet gets going\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nas an educational tool,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nI take off from Wisconsin\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nand move to Kansas, small town Kansas,\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nwhere I had an opportunity to teach\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nin a lovely, small-town,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nrural Kansas school district,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nwhere I was teaching my favorite subject,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nAmerican government.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nMy first year -- super gung-ho -- going to teach American government,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nloved the political system.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nKids in the 12th grade:\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nnot exactly all that enthusiastic\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nabout the American government system.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nYear two: learned a few things -- had to change my tactic.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nAnd I put in front of them an authentic experience\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nthat allowed them to learn for themselves.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nI didn't tell them what to do or how to do it.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nI posed a problem in front of them,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nwhich was to put on an election forum for their own community.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nThey produced flyers.

Perfect field trip.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nThe problem then becomes\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nhow do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nand deal with the subject in a way\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nthat is responsible and respectful,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nand they know what to do with it.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nAnd so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nas an example of a gentleman\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nwho singularly used his life to do something positive.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nI then challenged the kids to identify\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nsomeone in their own life, or in their own story, or in their own world,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nthat they could identify that had done a similar thing.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nI asked them to produce a little movie about it.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nIt's the first time we'd done this.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nNobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nbut they were into it.

00:05:04.958\nFast-forward to Pennsylvania, where I find myself today.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nI teach at the Science Leadership Academy,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nwhich is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nand the school district of Philadelphia.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nWe are a nine through 12 public school,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nbut we do school quite differently.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nI moved there primarily\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nto be part of a learning environment\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nthat validated the way that I knew that kids learned,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nand that really wanted to investigate\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nwhat was possible\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nwhen you are willing to let go\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nof some of the paradigms of the past,\n\n00:05:31.958 -->

00:05:39.958\nand to a moment when we have information surplus.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nSo what do you do when the information is all around you?\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nWhy do you have kids come to school\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nif they no longer have to come there to get the information?\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nIn Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program,\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nso the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\ntaking them home, getting access to information.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nAnd here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nwhen you've given the tool\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nto acquire information to students,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nis that you have to be comfortable with this idea\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nof allowing kids to fail\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nas part of

culture of one right answer\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nthat can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nand I am here to share with you:\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nit is not learning.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nThat is the absolute wrong thing to ask,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nto tell kids to never be wrong.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nTo ask them to always have the right answer\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\ndoesn't allow them to learn.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nSo we did this project,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nand this is one of the artifacts of the project.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nI almost never show them off\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nbecause of the issue of the idea of failure.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nMy students produced these info-graphics\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nas a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nresponding to the oil spill.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nI asked them to take the examples that we were seeing\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nof the info-graphics that existed\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nin a lot of mass media,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nand take a look at what were the interesting components of it,\n\n00:06:58.958

criteria to do it.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nThey were a little uncomfortable with it,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nbecause we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nThey can talk -- they're very smooth,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nand they can write very, very well,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nbut asking them to communicate ideas in a different way\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nwas a little uncomfortable for them.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nBut I gave them the room to just do the thing.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nGo create. Go figure it out.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nLet's see what we can do.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nAnd the student that persistently\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nturns out the best visual product did not disappoint.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nThis was done in like two or three days.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nAnd this is the work of the student that consistently did it.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nAnd when I sat the students down, I said, \"Who's got the best one?\"\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nAnd they immediately went, \"There it is.\"\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nDidn't read anything. \"There it is.\"\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nAnd I said, \"Well what makes it great?\"\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd they're like, \"Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nAnd there's some ... \" And they went through all that we processed out loud.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nAnd I said, \"Go read it.\"\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nAnd they're like, \"Oh, that one wasn't so awesome.\"\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAnd then we went to another one --\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nit didn't have great visuals, but it had great information --\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nand spent an hour talking about the learning process,\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nbecause it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nor whether or not it was what I could create.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nIt asked them to create for themselves,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nand it allowed them to fail,\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nprocess, learn from.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nAnd when we do another round of this in my class this year,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nthey will do better this time,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nbecause learning\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nhas to include an amount of failure,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nbecause failure is instructional\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nin the process.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nThere are a million pictures\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nthat I could click through here,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nand had to choose carefully -- this is one of my favorites --\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nof students learning,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nof what learning can look like\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nin a landscape where we let go of the idea\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nthat kids have to come to school to get the information,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nbut instead, ask them what they can do with it.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nAsk them really interesting questions.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nThey will not disappoint.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nAsk them to go to places,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nto see things for themselves,\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nto actually experience the learning,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nto play, to inquire.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nThis is one of my favorite photos,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nbecause this was taken on Tuesday,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nwhen I asked the students to go to the polls.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nThis is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nand he wanted to share that with everybody and do that.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nBut this is learning too,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nbecause we asked them to go out into real spaces.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nThe main point\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nis that, if we continue to look at education\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nas if it's about coming to school\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nto get the information\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nand not about experiential learning,\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nempowering student voice and embracing failure,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nwe're missing the mark.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nAnd everything that everybody is talking about today\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nisn't possible if we keep having an educational system\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nthat does not value these qualities,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nbecause we won't get there with a standardized test,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nand we won't get there with a culture of one right answer.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nWe know how to do this better,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nand it's time to do better.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:54.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Let's talk parenting taboos", "duration": "1028", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/rufus_griscom_alisa_volkman_let_s_talk_parenting_taboos", "transcript": "Alisa Volkman: So this is where our story begins \u2014 the dramatic moments of the birth of our first son, Declan. Obviously a really profound moment, and it changed our lives in many ways. It also changed our lives in many unexpected ways, and those unexpected ways we later reflected on, that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us, and a year later, we launched Babble, a website for parents.Rufus Griscom: Now I think of our story as starting a few years earlier. AV: That's true.RG: You may remember, we fell head over heels in love.AV: We did.RG: We were at the time running a very different kind of website. It was a website called Nerve.com, the tagline of which was \"literate smut.\" It was in theory, and hopefully in practice, a smart online magazine about sex and culture.AV: That spawned a dating site. But you can understand the jokes that we get. Sex begets babies. You follow instructions on Nerve and you should end up on Babble, which we did. And we might launch a geriatric site as our third. We'll see.RG: But for us, the continuity between Nerve and Babble was not just the life stage thing, which is, of course, relevant, but it was really more about our desire to speak very honestly about subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about. It seems to us that when people start dissembling, people start lying about things, that's when it gets really interesting. That's a subject that we want to dive into. And we've been surprised to find, as young parents, that there are almost more taboos around parenting than there are around sex.AV: It's true. So like we said, the early years were really wonderful, but they were also really difficult. And we feel like some of that difficulty was because of this false advertisement around parenting. (Laughter) We subscribed to a lot of magazines, did our homework, but really everywhere you look around, we were surrounded by images like this. And we went into parenting expecting our lives to look like this. The sun was always streaming in, and our children would never be crying. I would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested, and in fact, it was not like that at all.RG: When we lowered the glossy parenting magazine that we were looking at, with these beautiful images, and looked at the scene in our actual living room, it looked a little bit more like this. These are our three sons. And of course, they're not always crying and screaming, but with three boys, there's a decent probability that at least one of them will not be comporting himself exactly as he should.AV: Yes, you can see where the disconnect was happening for us. We really felt like what we went in expecting had nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing, and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight. We really wanted to let them understand what the realities of parenting were in an honest way.RG: So today, what we would love to do is share with you four parenting taboos. And of course, there are many more than four things you can't say about parenting, but we would like to share with you today four that are particularly relevant for us personally. So the first, taboo number one: you can't say you didn't fall in love with your baby in the very first minute. I remember vividly, sitting there in the hospital. We were in the process of giving birth to our first child.AV: We, or I?RG: I'm sorry. Misuse of the pronoun. Alisa was very generously in the process of giving birth to our first child \u2014 (AV: Thank you.) \u2014 and I was there with a catcher's mitt. And I was there with my arms open. The nurse was coming at me with this beautiful, beautiful child, and I remember, as she was approaching me, the voices of friends saying, \"The moment they put the baby in your hands, you will feel a sense of love that will come over you that is [on] an order of magnitude more powerful than anything you've ever experienced in your entire life.\" So I was bracing myself for the moment. The baby was coming, and I was ready for this Mack truck of love to just knock me off my feet. And instead, when the baby was placed in my hands, it was an extraordinary moment. This picture is from literally a few seconds after the baby was placed in my hands and I brought him over. And you can see, our eyes were glistening. I was overwhelmed with love and affection for my wife, with deep, deep gratitude that we had what appeared to be a healthy child. And it was also, of course, surreal. I mean, I had to check the tags and make sure. I was incredulous, \"Are you sure this is our child?\" And this was all quite remarkable. But what I felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection, but nothing like what I feel for him now, five years later.And so we've done something here that is heretical. We have charted our love for our child over time. (Laughter) This, as you know, is an act of heresy. You're not allowed to chart love. The reason you're not allowed to chart love is because we think of love as a binary thing. You're either in love, or you're not in love. You love, or you don't love. And I think the reality is that love is a process, and I think the problem with thinking of love as something that's binary is that it causes us to be unduly concerned that love is fraudulent, or inadequate, or what have you. And I think I'm speaking obviously here to the father's experience. But I think a lot of men do go through this sense in the early months, maybe their first year, that their emotional response is inadequate in some fashion.AV: Well, I'm glad Rufus is bringing this up, because you can notice where he dips in the first years where I think I was doing most of the work. But we like to joke, in the first few months of all of our children's lives, this is Uncle Rufus. (Laughter)RG: I'm a very affectionate uncle, very affectionate uncle.AV: Yes, and I often joke with Rufus when he comes home that I'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line-up amongst other babies. So I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus.RG: Uh oh.AV: I don't want to embarrass him too much. But I am going to give him three seconds.RG: That is not fair. This is a trick question. He's not up there, is he?AV: Our eight-week-old son is somewhere in here, and I want to see if Rufus can actually quickly identify him.RG: The far left. AV: No!(Laughter)RG: Cruel.AV: Nothing more to be said.(Laughter)I'll move on to taboo number two. You can't talk about how lonely having a baby can be. I enjoyed being pregnant. I loved it. I felt incredibly connected to the community around me. I felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy, all around me, tracking it down till the actual due-date. I felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity. That continued into the the hospital. It was really exhilarating. I was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors. It was a really wonderful experience, but when I got home, I suddenly felt very disconnected and suddenly shut in and shut out, and I was really surprised by those feelings. I did expect it to be difficult, have sleepless nights, constant feedings, but I did not expect the feelings of isolation and loneliness that I experienced, and I was really surprised that no one had talked to me, that I was going to be feeling this way. And I called my sister whom I'm very close to \u2014 and had three children \u2014 and I asked her, \"Why didn't you tell me I was going to be feeling this way, that I was going to have these \u2014 feeling incredibly isolated?\" And she said \u2014 I'll never forget \u2014 \"It's just not something you want to say to a mother that's having a baby for the first time.\"RG: And of course, we think it's precisely what you really should be saying to mothers who have kids for the first time. And that this, of course, one of the themes for us is that we think that candor and brutal honesty is critical to us collectively being great parents. And it's hard not to think that part of what leads to this sense of isolation is our modern world. So Alisa's experience is not isolated. So your 58 percent of mothers surveyed report feelings of loneliness. Of those, 67 percent are most lonely when their kids are zero to five \u2014 probably really zero to two. In the process of preparing this, we looked at how some other cultures around the world deal with this period of time, because here in the Western world, less than 50 percent of us live near our family members, which I think is part of why this is such a tough period. So to take one example among many: in Southern India there's a practice known as jholabhari, in which the pregnant woman, when she's seven or eight months pregnant, moves in with her mother and goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies, give birth and returns home to her nuclear family several months after the child is born. And this is one of many ways that we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period.AV: So taboo number three: you can't talk about your miscarriage \u2014 but today I'll talk about mine. So after we had Declan, we kind of recalibrated our expectations. We thought we actually could go through this again and thought we knew what we would be up against. And we were grateful that I was able to get pregnant, and I soon learned that we were having a boy, and then when I was five months, we learned that we had lost our child. This is actually the last little image we have of him. And it was obviously a very difficult time \u2014 really painful. As I was working through that mourning process, I was amazed that I didn't want to see anybody. I really wanted to crawl into a hole, and I didn't really know how I was going to work my way back into my surrounding community. And I realize, I think, the way I was feeling that way, is on a really deep gut level, I was feeling a lot of shame and embarrassed, frankly, that, in some respects, I had failed at delivering what I'm genetically engineered to do. And of course, it made me question, if I wasn't able to have another child, what would that mean for my marriage, and just me as a woman. So it was a very difficult time. As I started working through it more, I started climbing out of that hole and talking with other people. I was really amazed by all the stories that started flooding in. People I interacted with daily, worked with, was friends with, family members that I had known a long time, had never shared with me their own stories. And I just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork, and I felt like I happened upon this secret society of women that I now was a part of, which was reassuring and also really concerning. And I think, miscarriage is an invisible loss. There's not really a lot of community support around it. There's really no ceremony, rituals, or rites. And I think, with a death, you have a funeral, you celebrate the life, and there's a lot of community support, and it's something women don't have with miscarriage.RG: Which is too bad because, of course, it's a very common and very traumatic experience. Fifteen to 20 percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage, and I find this astounding. In a survey, 74 percent of women said that miscarriage, they felt, was partly their fault, which is awful. And astoundingly, 22 percent said they would hide a miscarriage from their spouse.So taboo number four: you can't say that your average happiness has declined since having a child. The party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since I participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family. I'll never forget, I remember vividly to this day, our first son, Declan, was nine months old, and I was sitting there on the couch, and I was reading Daniel Gilbert's wonderful book, \"Stumbling on Happiness.\" And I got about two-thirds of the way through, and there was a chart on the right-hand side \u2014 on the right-hand page \u2014 that we've labeled here \"The Most Terrifying Chart Imaginable for a New Parent.\" This chart is comprised of four completely independent studies. Basically, there's this precipitous drop of marital satisfaction, which is closely aligned, we all know, with broader happiness, that doesn't rise again until your first child goes to college. So I'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life, this chasm of happiness that we're driving our proverbial convertible straight into. We were despondent.AV: So you can imagine, I mean again, the first few months were difficult, but we'd come out of it, and were really shocked to see this study. So we really wanted to take a deeper look at it in hopes that we would find a silver lining.RG: And that's when it's great to be running a website for parents, because we got this incredible reporter to go and interview all the scientists who conducted these four studies. We said, something is wrong here. There's something missing from these studies. It can't possibly be that bad. So Liz Mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece, and she interviewed four scientists, and she also interviewed Daniel Gilbert, and we did indeed find a silver lining. So this is our guess as to what this baseline of average happiness arguably looks like throughout life. Average happiness is, of course, inadequate, because it doesn't speak to the moment-by-moment experience, and so this is what we think it looks like when you layer in moment-to-moment experience. And so we all remember as children, the tiniest little thing \u2014 and we see it on the faces of our children \u2014 the teeniest little thing can just rocket them to these heights of just utter adulation, and then the next teeniest little thing can cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair. And it's just extraordinary to watch, and we remember it ourselves. And then, of course, as you get older, it's almost like age is a form of lithium.As you get older, you become more stable. And part of what happens, I think, in your '20s and '30s, is you start to learn to hedge your happiness. You start to realize that \"Hey, I could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps, but it's more likely that I'll feel claustrophobic and I won't be able to get a beer. So I'm not going to go. I've got a good stereo at home. So, I'm not going to go.\" So your average happiness goes up, but you lose those transcendent moments.AV: Yeah, and then you have your first child, and then you really resubmit yourself to these highs and lows \u2014 the highs being the first steps, the first smile, your child reading to you for the first time \u2014 the lows being, our house, any time from six to seven every night. But you realize you resubmit yourself to losing control in a really wonderful way, which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives and is quite gratifying.RG: And so in effect, we trade average happiness. We trade the sort of security and safety of a certain level of contentment for these transcendent moments. So where does that leave the two of us as a family with our three little boys in the thick of all this? There's another factor in our case. We have violated yet another taboo in our own lives, and this is a bonus taboo.AV: A quick bonus taboo for you, that we should not be working together, especially with three children \u2014 and we are.RG: And we had reservations about this on the front end. Everybody knows, you should absolutely not work with your spouse. In fact, when we first went out to raise money to start Babble, the venture capitalists said, \"We categorically don't invest in companies founded by husbands and wives, because there's an extra point of failure. It's a bad idea. Don't do it.\" And we obviously went forward. We did. We raised the money, and we're thrilled that we did, because in this phase of one's life, the incredibly scarce resource is time. And if you're really passionate about what you do every day \u2014 which we are \u2014 and you're also passionate about your relationship, this is the only way we know how to do it. And so the final question that we would ask is: can we collectively bend that happiness chart upwards? It's great that we have these transcendent moments of joy, but they're sometimes pretty quick. And so how about that average baseline of happiness? Can we move that up a little bit?AV: And we kind of feel that the happiness gap, which we talked about, is really the result of walking into parenting \u2014 and really any long-term partnership for that matter \u2014 with the wrong expectations. And if you have the right expectations and expectation management, we feel like it's going to be a pretty gratifying experience.RG: And so this is what \u2014 And we think that a lot of parents, when you get in there \u2014 in our case anyway \u2014 you pack your bags for a trip to Europe, and you're really excited to go. Get out of the airplane, it turns out you're trekking in Nepal. And trekking in Nepal is an extraordinary experience, particularly if you pack your bags properly and you know what you're getting in for and you're psyched. So the point of all this for us today is not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty, but a hope that by being more honest and candid about these experiences, that we can all collectively bend that happiness baseline up a little bit.RG + AV: Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1036, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nAlisa Volkman: So this is where our story begins --\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nthe dramatic moments of the birth\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nof our first son, Declan.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nObviously a really profound moment,\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nand it changed our lives in many ways.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nIt also changed our lives in many unexpected ways,\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nand those unexpected ways we later reflected on,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nthat eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us,\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nand a year later, we launched Babble,\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\na website for parents.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nRufus Griscom: Now I think of our story\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nas starting a few years earlier. AV: That's true.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nRG: You may remember, we fell head over heels in love.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nAV: We did.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nRG: We were at the time running a very different kind of website.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nIt was a website called Nerve.com,\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nthe tagline of which was \"literate smut.\"\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nIt was in theory, and hopefully in practice,\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\na smart online magazine\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nabout sex and culture.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nAV: That spawned a dating site.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nBut you can understand the jokes that we get. Sex begets babies.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nYou follow instructions on Nerve and you should end up on Babble,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nwhich we did.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nAnd we might launch a geriatric site as our third. We'll see.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nRG: But for us, the continuity between Nerve and Babble\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nwas not just the life stage thing,\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nwhich is, of course, relevant,\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nbut it was really more about\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nour desire to speak very honestly\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nabout subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nIt seems to us that\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nwhen people start dissembling, people start lying about things,\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nthat's when it gets really interesting.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nThat's a subject that we want to dive into.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nAnd we've been surprised to find, as young parents,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nthat there are almost more taboos around parenting\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nthan there are around sex.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nAV: It's true. So like we said,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nthe early years were really wonderful,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nbut they were also really difficult.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nAnd we feel like some of that difficulty\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nwas because of this false advertisement around parenting.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nWe subscribed to a lot of magazines, did our homework,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nbut really everywhere you look around, we were surrounded by images like this.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nAnd we went into parenting\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nexpecting our lives to look like this.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nThe sun was always streaming in, and our children would never be crying.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nI would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nand in fact, it was not like that at all.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nRG: When we lowered the glossy parenting magazine\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nthat we were looking at, with these beautiful images,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nand looked at the scene in our actual living room,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nit looked a little bit more like this.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nThese are our three sons.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nAnd of course, they're not always crying and screaming,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nbut with three boys, there's a decent probability\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nthat at least one of them will not be comporting himself\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nexactly as he should.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAV: Yes, you can see where the disconnect was happening for us.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nWe really felt like what we went in expecting\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nhad nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nand so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nWe really wanted to let them understand\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nwhat the realities of parenting were in an honest way.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nRG: So today, what we would love to do\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nis share with you four parenting taboos.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nAnd of course, there are many more than four things\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nyou can't say about parenting,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nbut we would like to share with you today\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nfour that are particularly relevant for us personally.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nSo the first, taboo number one:\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nyou can't say you didn't fall in love with your baby\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nin the very first minute.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nI remember vividly, sitting there in the hospital.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nWe were in the process of giving birth to our first child.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nAV: We, or I?\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nRG: I'm sorry.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nMisuse of the pronoun.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAlisa was very generously in the process\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nof giving birth to our first child -- (AV: Thank you.)\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\n-- and I was there with a catcher's mitt.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd I was there with my arms open.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nThe nurse was coming at me\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nwith this beautiful, beautiful child,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nand I remember, as she was approaching me,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nthe voices of friends saying,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\n\"The moment they put the baby in your hands,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nyou will feel a sense of love that will come over you\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nthat is [on] an order of magnitude more powerful\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthan anything you've ever experienced in your entire life.\"\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nSo I was bracing myself for the moment.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nThe baby was coming,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nand I was ready for this Mack truck of love\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nto just knock me off my feet.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nAnd instead, when the baby was placed in my hands,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nit was an extraordinary moment.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nThis picture is from literally a few seconds after\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nthe baby was placed in my hands and I brought him over.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nAnd you can see, our eyes were glistening.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nI was overwhelmed with love and affection for my wife,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nwith deep, deep gratitude\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nthat we had what appeared to be a healthy child.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nAnd it was also, of course, surreal.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nI mean, I had to check the tags and make sure.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nI was incredulous, \"Are you sure this is our child?\"\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd this was all quite remarkable.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nBut what I felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nbut nothing like what I feel for him now, five years later.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nAnd so we've done something here\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nthat is heretical.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nWe have charted\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nour love for our child over time.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nThis, as you know, is an act of heresy.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nYou're not allowed to chart love.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nThe reason you're not allowed to chart love\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nis because we think of love as a binary thing.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nYou're either in love, or you're not in love.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nYou love, or you don't love.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nAnd I think the reality is that love is a process,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nand I think the problem with thinking of love\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nas something that's binary\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nis that it causes us\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nto be unduly concerned\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nthat love is fraudulent, or inadequate, or what have you.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nAnd I think I'm speaking obviously here to the father's experience.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nBut I think a lot of men do go through this sense\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nin the early months, maybe their first year,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nthat their emotional response is inadequate in some fashion.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nAV: Well, I'm glad Rufus is bringing this up,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nbecause you can notice where he dips in the first years\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nwhere I think I was doing most of the work.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nBut we like to joke,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nin the first few months of all of our children's lives,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nthis is Uncle Rufus.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nRG: I'm a very affectionate uncle, very affectionate uncle.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nAV: Yes, and I often joke with Rufus when he comes home\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nthat I'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line-up\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\namongst other babies.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nSo I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nRG: Uh oh.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nAV: I don't want to embarrass him too much. But I am going to give him three seconds.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nRG: That is not fair. This is a trick question. He's not up there, is he?\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nAV: Our eight-week-old son is somewhere in here,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nand I want to see if Rufus can actually quickly identify him.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nRG: The far left. AV: No!\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:19.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nRG: Cruel.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nAV: Nothing more to be said.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nI'll move on to taboo number two.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nYou can't talk about how lonely having a baby can be.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nI enjoyed being pregnant. I loved it.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nI felt incredibly connected to the community around me.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nI felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy, all around me,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\ntracking it down till the actual due-date.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nI felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nThat continued into the the hospital. It was really exhilarating.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nI was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nIt was a really wonderful experience,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nbut when I got home,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nI suddenly felt very disconnected\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nand suddenly shut in and shut out,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nand I was really surprised by those feelings.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nI did expect it to be difficult,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nhave sleepless nights, constant feedings,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nbut I did not expect the feelings\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nof isolation and loneliness that I experienced,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nand I was really surprised that no one had talked to me,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nthat I was going to be feeling this way.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nAnd I called my sister\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nwhom I'm very close to -- and had three children --\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nand I asked her, \"Why didn't you tell me\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nI was going to be feeling this way,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nthat I was going to have these -- feeling incredibly isolated?\"\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nAnd she said -- I'll never forget --\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\n\"It's just not something you want to say to a mother\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nthat's having a baby for the first time.\"\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nRG: And of course, we think\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nit's precisely what you really should be saying\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nto mothers who have kids for the first time.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nAnd that this, of course, one of the themes for us\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nis that we think\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nthat candor and brutal honesty\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nis critical to us collectively\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nbeing great parents.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nAnd it's hard not to think\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nthat part of what leads to this sense of isolation\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nis our modern world.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nSo Alisa's experience is not isolated.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nSo your 58 percent of mothers surveyed\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nreport feelings of loneliness.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nOf those, 67 percent are most lonely\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nwhen their kids are zero to five -- probably really zero to two.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nIn the process of preparing this,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nwe looked at how some other cultures around the world\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\ndeal with this period of time,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nbecause here in the Western world,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nless than 50 percent of us live near our family members,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nwhich I think is part of why this is such a tough period.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nSo to take one example among many:\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nin Southern India\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nthere's a practice known as jholabhari,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nin which the pregnant woman, when she's seven or eight months pregnant,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nmoves in with her mother\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\ngive birth and returns home to her nuclear family\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nseveral months after the child is born.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nAnd this is one of many ways\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nthat we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nAV: So taboo number three:\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nyou can't talk about your miscarriage -- but today I'll talk about mine.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nSo after we had Declan,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nwe kind of recalibrated our expectations.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nWe thought we actually could go through this again\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nand thought we knew what we would be up against.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nAnd we were grateful that I was able to get pregnant,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nand I soon learned that we were having a boy,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nand then when I was five months,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nwe learned that we had lost our child.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nThis is actually the last little image we have of him.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nAnd it was obviously a very difficult time --\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nreally painful.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nAs I was working through that mourning process,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nI was amazed that I didn't want to see anybody.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nI really wanted to crawl into a hole,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nand I didn't really know how I was going\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nto work my way back into my surrounding community.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nAnd I realize, I think, the way I was feeling that way,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nis on a really deep gut level,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nI was feeling a lot of shame\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nand embarrassed, frankly,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nthat, in some respects, I had failed\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nat delivering what I'm genetically engineered to do.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nAnd of course, it made me question,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nif I wasn't able to have another child,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nwhat would that mean for my marriage,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nand just me as a woman.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nSo it was a very difficult time.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nAs I started working through it more,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nI started climbing out of that hole and talking with other people.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nI was really amazed\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nby all the stories that started flooding in.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nPeople I interacted with daily,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nworked with, was friends with,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nfamily members that I had known a long time,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nhad never shared with me their own stories.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nAnd I just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork,\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nand I felt like I happened upon\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nthis secret society of women that I now was a part of,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nwhich was reassuring and also really concerning.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nAnd I think,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nmiscarriage is an invisible loss.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nThere's not really a lot of community support around it.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nThere's really no ceremony,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nrituals, or rites.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAnd I think, with a death, you have a funeral, you celebrate the life,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nand there's a lot of community support,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nand it's something women don't have with miscarriage.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nRG: Which is too bad because, of course,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nit's a very common and very traumatic experience.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nFifteen to 20 percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nand I find this astounding.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nIn a survey, 74 percent of women said\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nthat miscarriage, they felt, was partly their fault, which is awful.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nAnd astoundingly, 22 percent\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nsaid they would hide a miscarriage from their spouse.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nSo taboo number four:\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nyou can't say that your average happiness\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nhas declined since having a child.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nThe party line is that every single aspect of my life\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nhas just gotten dramatically better\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\never since I participated\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nin the miracle that is childbirth and family.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nI'll never forget, I remember vividly to this day,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nour first son, Declan, was nine months old,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nand I was sitting there on the couch,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nand I was reading Daniel Gilbert's wonderful book, \"Stumbling on Happiness.\"\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nAnd I got about two-thirds of the way through,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nand there was a chart on the right-hand side --\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\non the right-hand page --\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nthat we've labeled here\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\n\"The Most Terrifying Chart Imaginable\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nfor a New Parent.\"\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nThis chart is comprised of four completely independent studies.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nBasically, there's this precipitous drop\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nof marital satisfaction,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nwhich is closely aligned, we all know, with broader happiness,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nthat doesn't rise again\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nuntil your first child goes to college.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nSo I'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nthis chasm of happiness\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nthat we're driving our proverbial convertible straight into.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nWe were despondent.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nAV: So you can imagine, I mean again, the first few months were difficult,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nbut we'd come out of it,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nand were really shocked to see this study.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nSo we really wanted to take a deeper look at it\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nin hopes that we would find a silver lining.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nRG: And that's when it's great to be running a website for parents,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nbecause we got this incredible reporter\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nto go and interview all the scientists\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nwho conducted these four studies.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nWe said, something is wrong here.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nThere's something missing from these studies.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nIt can't possibly be that bad.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nSo Liz Mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nand she interviewed four scientists,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nand she also interviewed Daniel Gilbert,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nand we did indeed find a silver lining.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nSo this is our guess\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nas to what this baseline of average happiness\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\narguably looks like throughout life.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nAverage happiness is, of course, inadequate,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nbecause it doesn't speak\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nto the moment-by-moment experience,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nand so this is what we think it looks like\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nwhen you layer in\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nmoment-to-moment experience.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nAnd so we all remember as children,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nthe tiniest little thing -- and we see it on the faces of our children --\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nthe teeniest little thing\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\ncan just rocket them to these heights\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nof just utter adulation,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nand then the next teeniest little thing\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\ncan cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nAnd it's just extraordinary to watch, and we remember it ourselves.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nAnd then, of course, as you get older,\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nit's almost like age is a form of lithium.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nAs you get older, you become more stable.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nAnd part of what happens, I think, in your '20s and '30s,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nis you start to learn to hedge your happiness.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nYou start to realize that\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.958\n\"Hey, I could go to this live music event\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nand have an utterly transforming

I'm going to explain what it is and try and convince you \u2014 in just 15 minutes \u2014 that this isn't a flimsy idea, or a short-term trend, but a powerful cultural and economic force reinventing not just what we consume, but how we consume.Now I'm going to start with a deceptively simple example. Hands up \u2014 how many of you have books, CDs, DVDs, or videos lying around your house that you probably won't use again, but you can't quite bring yourself to throw away? Can't see all the hands, but it looks like all of you, right? On our shelves at home, we have a box set of the DVD series \"24,\" season six to be precise. I think it was bought for us around three years ago for a Christmas present. Now my husband, Chris, and I love this show. But let's face it, when you've watched it once maybe, or twice, you don't really want to watch it again, because you know how Jack Bauer is going to defeat the terrorists. So there it sits on our shelves obsolete to us, but with immediate latent value to someone else. Now before we go on, I have a confession to make. I lived in New York for 10 years, and I am a big fan of \"Sex and the City.\" Now I'd love to watch the first movie again as sort of a warm-up to the sequel coming out next week. So how easily could I swap our unwanted copy of \"24\" for a wanted copy of \"Sex and the City?\" Now you may have noticed there's a new sector emerging called swap-trading. Now the easiest analogy for swap-trading is like an online dating service for all your unwanted media. What it does is use the Internet to create an infinite marketplace to match person A's \"haves\" with person C's \"wants,\" whatever they may be.The other week, I went on one of these sites, appropriately called Swaptree, and there were over 59,300 items that I could instantly swap for my copy of \"24.\" Lo and behold, there in Reseda, CA was Rondoron who wanted swap his or her \"like new\" copy of \"Sex and the City\" for my copy of \"24.\" So in other words, what's happening here is that Swaptree solves my carrying company's sugar rush problem, a problem the economists call \"the coincidence of wants,\" in approximately 60 seconds. What's even more amazing is it will print out a postage label on the spot, because it knows the way of the item. Now there are layers of technical wonder behind sites such as Swaptree, but that's not my interest, and nor is swap trading, per se.My passion, and what I've spent the last few years dedicated to researching, is the collaborative behaviors and trust-mechanics inherent in these systems. When you think about it, it would have seemed like a crazy idea, even a few years ago, that I would swap my stuff with a total stranger whose real name I didn't know and without any money changing hands. Yet 99 percent of trades on Swaptree happen successfully, and the one percent that receive a negative rating, it's for relatively minor reasons, like the item didn't arrive on time.So what's happening here? An extremely powerful dynamic that has huge commercial and cultural implications is at play. Namely, that technology is enabling trust between strangers. We now live in a global village where we can mimic the ties that used to happen face to face, but on a scale and in ways that have never been possible before. So what's actually happening is that social networks and real-time technologies are taking us back. We're bartering, trading, swapping, sharing, but they're being reinvented into dynamic and appealing forms. What I find fascinating is that we've actually wired our world to share, whether that's our neighborhood, our school, our office, or our Facebook network, and that's creating an economy of \"what's mine is yours.\" From the mighty eBay, the grandfather of exchange marketplaces, to car-sharing companies such as GoGet, where you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour, to social lending platforms such as Zopa, that will take anyone in this audience with 100 dollars to lend, and match them with a borrower anywhere in the world, we're sharing and collaborating again in ways that I believe are more hip than hippie. I call this \"groundswell collaborative consumption.\"Now before I dig into the different systems of collaborative consumption, I'd like to try and answer the question that every author rightfully gets asked, which is, where did this idea come from? Now I'd like to say I woke up one morning and said, \"I'm going to write about collaborative consumption,\" but actually it was a complicated web of seemingly disconnected ideas. Over the next minute, you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display of all the dots that went on in my head. The first thing I began to notice: how many big concepts were emerging \u2014 from the wisdom of crowds to smart mobs \u2014 around how ridiculously easy it is to form groups for a purpose. And linked to this crowd mania were examples all around the world \u2014 from the election of a president to the infamous Wikipedia, and everything in between \u2014 on what the power of numbers could achieve.Now, you know when you learn a new word, and then you start to see that word everywhere? That's what happened to me when I noticed that we are moving from passive consumers to creators, to highly enabled collaborators. What's happening is the Internet is removing the middleman, so that anyone from a T-shirt designer to a knitter can make a living selling peer-to-peer. And the ubiquitous force of this peer-to-peer revolution means that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates. I mean, it's amazing to think that, in every single minute of this speech, 25 hours of YouTube video will be loaded. Now what I find fascinating about these examples is how they're actually tapping into our primate instincts. I mean, we're monkeys, and we're born and bred to share and cooperate. And we were doing so for thousands of years, whether it's when we hunted in packs, or farmed in cooperatives, before this big system called hyper-consumption came along and we built these fences and created out own little fiefdoms. But things are changing, and one of the reasons why is the digital natives, or Gen-Y. They're growing up sharing \u2014 files, video games, knowledge. It's second nature to them. So we, the millennials \u2014 I am just a millennial \u2014 are like foot soldiers, moving us from a culture of \"me\" to a culture of \"we.\"The reason why it's happening so fast is because of mobile collaboration. We now live in a connected age where we can locate anyone, anytime, in real-time, from a small device in our hands. All of this was going through my head towards the end of 2008, when, of course, the great financial crash happened. Thomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists, and he poignantly commented that 2008 is when we hit a wall, when Mother Nature and the market both said, \"No more.\" Now we rationally know that an economy built on hyper-consumption is a Ponzi scheme. It's a house of cards. Yet, it's hard for us to individually know what to do.So all of this is a lot of twittering, right? Well it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head, until actually I realized it was happening because of four key drivers. One, a renewed belief in the importance of community, and a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means. A torrent of peer-to-peer social networks and real-time technologies, fundamentally changing the way we behave. Three, pressing unresolved environmental concerns. And four, a global recession that has fundamentally shocked consumer behaviors. These four drivers are fusing together and creating the big shift \u2014 away from the 20th century, defined by hyper-consumption, towards the 21st century, defined by collaborative consumption. I generally believe we're at an inflection point where the sharing behaviors \u2014 through sites such as Flickr and Twitter that are becoming second nature online \u2014 are being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives. From morning commutes to the way fashion is designed to the way we grow food, we are consuming and collaborating once again.So my co-author, Roo Rogers, and I have actually gathered thousands of examples from all around the world of collaborative consumption. And although they vary enormously in scale, maturity and purpose, when we dived into them, we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems. The first is redistribution markets. Redistribution markets, just like Swaptree, are when you take a used, or pre-owned, item and move it from where it's not needed to somewhere, or someone, where it is. They're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R' \u2014 reduce, reuse, recycle, repair and redistribute \u2014 because they stretch the life cycle of a product and thereby reduce waste.The second is collaborative lifestyles. This is the sharing of resources of things like money, skills and time. I bet, in a couple of years, that phrases like \"coworking\" and \"couchsurfing\" and \"time banks\" are going to become a part of everyday vernacular. One of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles is called Landshare. It's a scheme in the U.K. that matches Mr. Jones, with some spare space in his back garden, with Mrs. Smith, a would-be grower. Together they grow their own food. It's one of those ideas that's so simple, yet brilliant, you wonder why it's never been done before.Now, the third system is product-service systems. This is where you pay for the benefit of the product \u2014 what it does for you \u2014 without needing to own the product outright. This idea is particularly powerful for things that have high-idling capacity. And that can be anything from baby goods to fashions to \u2014 how many of you have a power drill, own a power drill? Right. That power drill will be used around 12 to 13 minutes in its entire lifetime. (Laughter) It's kind of ridiculous, right? Because what you need is the hole, not the drill. (Laughter) (Applause) So why don't you rent the drill, or, even better, rent out your own drill to other people and make some money from it? These three systems are coming together, allowing people to share resources without sacrificing their lifestyles, or their cherished personal freedoms. I'm not asking people to share nicely in the sandpit.So I want to just give you an example of how powerful collaborative consumption can be to change behaviors. The average car costs 8,000 dollars a year to run. Yet, that car sits idle for 23 hours a day. So when you consider these two facts, it starts to make a little less sense that we have to own one outright. So this is where car-sharing companies such as Zipcar and GoGet come in. In 2009, Zipcar took 250 participants from across 13 cities \u2014 and they're all self-confessed car addicts and car-sharing rookies \u2014 and got them to surrender their keys for a month. Instead, these people had to walk, bike, take the train, or other forms of public transport. They could only use their Zipcar membership when absolutely necessary. The results of this challenge after just one month was staggering. It's amazing that 413 lbs were lost just from the extra exercise. But my favorite statistic is that 100 out of the 250 participants did not want their keys back. In other words, the car addicts had lost their urge to own.Now products-service systems have been around for years. Just think of libraries and laundrettes. But I think they're entering a new age, because technology makes sharing frictionless and fun. There's a great quote that was written in the New York Times that said, \"Sharing is to ownership what the iPod is to the 8-track, what solar power is to the coal mine.\" I believe also, our generation, our relationship to satisfying what we want is far less tangible than any other previous generation. I don't want the DVD; I want the movie it carries. I don't want a clunky answering machine; I want the message it saves. I don't want a CD; I want the music it plays. In other words, I don't want stuff; I want the needs or experiences it fulfills. This is fueling a massive shift from where usage trumps possessions \u2014 or as Kevin Kelly, the editor of Wired magazine, puts it, \"where access is better than ownership.\"Now as our possessions dematerialize into the cloud, a blurry line is appearing between what's mine, what's yours, and what's ours. I want to give you one example that shows how fast this evolution is happening. This represents an eight-year time span. We've gone from traditional car-ownership to car-sharing companies, such as Zipcar and GoGet, to ride-sharing platforms that match rides to the newest entry, which is peer-to-peer car rental, where you can actually make money out of renting that car that sits idle for 23 hours a day to your neighbor. Now all of these systems require a degree of trust, and the cornerstone to this working is reputation.Now in the old consumer system, our reputation didn't matter so much, because our credit history was far more important that any kind of peer-to-peer review. But now with the Web, we leave a trail. With every spammer we flag, with every idea we post, comment we share, we're actually signaling how well we collaborate, and whether we can or can't be trusted. Let's go back to my first example, Swaptree. I can see that Rondoron has completed 553 trades with a 100 percent success rate. In other words, I can trust him or her. Now mark my words, it's only a matter of time before we're going to be able to perform a Google-like search and see a cumulative picture of our reputation capital. And this reputation capital will determine our access to collaborative consumption. It's a new social currency, so to speak, that could become as powerful as our credit rating.Now as a closing thought, I believe we're actually in a period where we're waking up from this humongous hangover of emptiness and waste, and we're taking a leap to create a more sustainable system built to serve our innate needs for community and individual identity. I believe it will be referred to as a revolution, so to speak \u2014 when society, faced with great challenges, made a seismic shift from individual getting and spending towards a rediscovery of collective good. I'm on a mission to make sharing cool. I'm on a mission to make sharing hip. Because I really believe it can disrupt outdated modes of business, help us leapfrog over wasteful forms of hyper-consumption and teach us when enough really is enough.Thank you very much.(Applause)",

sequel coming out next week.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nSo how easily could I swap\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nour unwanted copy of \"24\"\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nfor a wanted copy of \"Sex and the City?\"\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nNow you may have noticed\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nthere's a new sector emerging called swap-trading.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nNow the easiest analogy for swap-trading\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nis like an online dating service\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nfor all your unwanted media.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nWhat it does is use the Internet\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nto create an infinite marketplace\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nto match person A's \"haves\"\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nwith person C's \"wants,\"\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nwhatever they may be.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nThe other week, I went on one of these sites,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nappropriately called Swaptree,\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nand there were over 59,300 items\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nthat I could instantly swap\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nfor my copy of \"24.\"\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nLo and behold,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nthere in Reseda, CA was Rondoron\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nwho wanted swap his or her\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\n\"like new\" copy of \"Sex and the City\"\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nfor my copy of \"24.\"\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nSo in other words, what's happening here\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nis that Swaptree\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nsolves my carrying company's sugar rush problem,\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\na problem the economists call \"the coincidence of wants,\"\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nin approximately 60 seconds.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nWhat's even more amazing is it will print out a postage label on the spot,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nbecause it knows the way of the item.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nNow there are layers of technical wonder\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nbehind sites such as Swaptree,\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nbut that's not my interest,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nand nor is swap trading, per se.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nMy passion, and what I've spent the last few years\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\ndedicated to researching,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nis the collaborative behaviors and trust-mechanics\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\ninherent in these systems.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nWhen you think about it,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nit would have seemed like a crazy idea, even a few years ago,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nthat I would swap my stuff with a total stranger\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nwhose real name I didn't know\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nand without any money changing hands.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nYet 99 percent of trades on Swaptree\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nhappen successfully,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nand the one percent that receive a negative rating,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nit's for relatively minor reasons,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nlike the item didn't arrive on time.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nSo what's happening here?\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nAn extremely powerful dynamic\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nthat has huge commercial and cultural implications\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nis at play.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nNamely, that technology\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nis enabling\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\ntrust between strangers.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nWe now live in a global village\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nwhere we can mimic the ties\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nthat used to happen face to face,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nbut on a scale and in ways\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthat have never been possible before.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nSo what's actually happening\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nis that social networks and real-time technologies\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nare taking us back.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nWe're bartering, trading,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nswapping, sharing,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nbut they're being reinvented\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\ninto dynamic and appealing forms.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nWhat I find fascinating\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nis that we've actually wired our world to share,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nwhether that's our neighborhood, our school,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nour office, or our Facebook network,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nand that's creating an economy\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nof \"what's mine is yours.\"\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nFrom the mighty eBay,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nthe grandfather of exchange marketplaces,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nto car-sharing companies such as GoGet,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nwhere you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nto social lending platforms such as Zopa,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nthat will take anyone in this audience\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nwith 100 dollars to lend,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nand match them with a borrower anywhere in the world,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nwe're sharing and collaborating again\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nin ways that I believe\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nare more hip than hippie.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nI call this \"groundswell collaborative consumption.\"\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nNow before I dig into the different systems\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nof collaborative consumption,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nI'd like to try and answer the question\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nthat every author rightfully gets asked,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nwhich is, where did this idea come from?\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nNow I'd like to say I woke up one morning\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nand said, \"I'm going to write about collaborative consumption,\"\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nbut actually it was a complicated web\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nof seemingly disconnected ideas.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nOver the next minute,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nyou're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nof all the dots that went on in my head.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nThe first thing I began to notice:\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nhow many big concepts were emerging --\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nfrom the wisdom of crowds to smart mobs --\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\naround how ridiculously easy it is\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nto form groups for a purpose.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nAnd linked to this crowd mania\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nwere examples all around the world --\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nfrom the election of a president\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nto the infamous Wikipedia, and everything in between --\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\non what the power of numbers could achieve.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nNow, you know when you learn a new word,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand then you start to see that word everywhere?\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nThat's what happened to me\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nwhen I noticed that we are moving\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nfrom passive consumers\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nto creators,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nto highly enabled collaborators.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nWhat's happening\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nis the Internet is removing the middleman,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nso that anyone from a T-shirt designer\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nto a knitter\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\ncan make a living selling peer-to-peer.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd the ubiquitous force\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nof this peer-to-peer revolution\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nmeans that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nI mean, it's amazing to think\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nthat, in every single minute of this speech,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\n25 hours\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nof YouTube video will be loaded.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nNow what I find fascinating about these examples\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nis how they're actually tapping into\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nour primate instincts.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nI mean, we're monkeys,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nand we're born and bred to share and cooperate.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nAnd we were doing so for thousands of years,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nwhether it's when we hunted in packs,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nor farmed in cooperatives,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nbefore this big system called hyper-consumption came along\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nand we built these fences\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nand created out own little fiefdoms.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nBut things are changing,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nand one of the reasons why\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nis the digital natives, or Gen-Y.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nThey're growing up sharing --\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nfiles, video games, knowledge.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nIt's second nature to them.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nSo we, the millennials -- I am just a millennial --\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nare like foot soldiers,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nmoving us from a culture of \"me\" to a culture of \"we.\"\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nThe reason why it's happening so fast\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nis because of mobile collaboration.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nWe now live in a connected age\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nwhere we can locate anyone, anytime, in real-time,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nfrom a small device in our hands.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nAll of this was going through my head\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\ntowards the end of 2008,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nwhen, of course, the great financial crash happened.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nThomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nand he poignantly commented\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nthat 2008 is when we hit a wall,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nwhen Mother Nature and the market\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nboth said, \"No more.\"\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nNow we rationally know\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nthat an economy built on hyper-consumption\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nis a Ponzi scheme. It's a house of cards.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nYet, it's hard for us to individually know what to do.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nSo all of this is a lot of twittering, right?\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nWell it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nuntil actually I realized it was happening\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nbecause of four key drivers.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nOne, a renewed belief in the importance of community,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nand a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nA torrent of peer-to-peer social networks\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nand real-time technologies,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nfundamentally changing the way we behave.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nThree, pressing unresolved environmental concerns.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nAnd four, a global recession\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nthat has fundamentally shocked\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nconsumer behaviors.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nThese four drivers\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nare fusing together\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nand creating the big shift --\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\naway from the 20th century,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\ndefined by hyper-consumption,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\ntowards the 21st century,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\ndefined by collaborative consumption.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nI generally believe we're at an inflection point\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nwhere the sharing behaviors --\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nthrough sites such as Flickr and Twitter\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nthat are becoming second nature online --\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nare being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nFrom morning commutes to the way fashion is designed\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nto the way we grow food,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nwe are consuming and collaborating once again.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nSo my co-author, Roo Rogers, and I\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nhave actually gathered thousands of examples\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nfrom all around the world of collaborative consumption.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nAnd although they vary enormously\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nin scale, maturity and purpose,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nwhen we dived into them,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nwe realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nThe first is redistribution markets.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nRedistribution markets, just like Swaptree,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nare when you take a used, or pre-owned, item\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nand move it from where it's not needed\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nto somewhere, or someone, where it is.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nThey're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R' --\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nreduce, reuse, recycle, repair\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nand redistribute --\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nbecause they stretch the life cycle of a product\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nand thereby reduce waste.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nThe second is collaborative lifestyles.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nThis is the sharing of resources\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nof things like money, skills and time.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nI bet, in a couple of years,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nthat phrases like \"coworking\"\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nand \"couchsurfing\" and \"time banks\"\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nare going to become a part of everyday vernacular.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nOne of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nis called Landshare.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nIt's a scheme in the U.K.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nthat matches Mr. Jones,\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nwith some spare space in his back garden,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nwith Mrs. Smith, a would-be grower.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nTogether they grow their own food.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nIt's one of those ideas that's so simple, yet brilliant,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nyou wonder why it's never been done before.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nNow, the third system\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nis product-service systems.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nThis is where you pay for the benefit of the product --\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nwhat it does for you --\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nwithout needing to own the product outright.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nThis idea is particularly powerful\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nfor things that have\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nhigh-idling capacity.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nAnd that can be anything from baby goods\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nto fashions to --\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nhow many of you have a power drill,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nown a power drill? Right.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nThat power drill will be used around 12 to 13 minutes\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nin its entire lifetime.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nIt's kind of ridiculous, right?\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nBecause what you need is the hole, not the drill.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nSo why don't you rent the drill,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nor, even better, rent out your own drill to other people\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nand make some money from it?\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nThese three systems are coming together,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nallowing people to share resources\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nwithout sacrificing their lifestyles,\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nor their cherished personal freedoms.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nI'm not asking people\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nto share nicely in the sandpit.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nSo I want to just give you an example\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nof how powerful collaborative consumption can be\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nto change behaviors.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nThe average car\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\ncosts 8,000 dollars a year to run.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nYet, that car sits idle\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nfor 23 hours a day.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nSo when you consider these two facts,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nit starts to make a little less sense\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nthat we have to own one outright.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nSo this is where car-sharing companies\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nsuch as Zipcar and GoGet come in.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nIn 2009,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nZipcar took 250 participants\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nfrom across 13 cities --\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nand they're all self-confessed car addicts\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand car-sharing rookies --\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nand got them to surrender their keys for a month.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nInstead, these people had to walk,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nbike, take the train,\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nor other forms of public transport.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nThey could only use their Zipcar membership\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nwhen absolutely necessary.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nThe results of this challenge after just one month\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nwas staggering.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nIt's amazing that 413 lbs were lost\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\njust from the extra exercise.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nBut my favorite statistic\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nis that 100\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nout of the 250 participants\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\ndid not want their keys back.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nIn other words, the car addicts\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nhad lost their urge to own.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nNow products-service systems have been around for years.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nJust think of libraries and laundrettes.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nBut I think they're entering a new age,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nbecause technology makes sharing\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nfrictionless and fun.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nThere's a great quote that was written in the New York Times\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nthat said, \"Sharing is to ownership\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nwhat the iPod is to the 8-track,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nwhat solar power is to the coal mine.\"\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nI believe also, our generation,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nour relationship to satisfying what we want\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nis far less tangible\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nthan any other previous generation.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nI don't want the DVD; I want the movie it carries.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nI don't want a clunky answering machine;\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nI want the message it saves.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nI don't want a CD; I want the music it plays.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nIn other words, I don't want stuff;\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nI want the needs or experiences it fulfills.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nThis is fueling a massive shift\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nfrom where usage trumps possessions --\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nor as Kevin Kelly, the editor of Wired magazine, puts it,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\n\"where access is better than ownership.\"\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nNow as our possessions\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\ndematerialize into the cloud,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\na blurry line is appearing\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nbetween what's mine, what's yours,\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nand what's ours.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nI want to give you one example\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nthat shows how fast this evolution is happening.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nThis represents an eight-year time span.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nWe've gone from traditional car-ownership\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nto car-sharing companies, such as Zipcar and GoGet,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nto ride-sharing platforms that match rides\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nto the newest entry, which is peer-to-peer car rental,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nwhere you can actually make money\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nout of renting that car that sits idle for 23 hours a day\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nto your neighbor.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nNow all of these systems\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nrequire a degree of trust,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nand the cornerstone to this working\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nis reputation.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nNow in the old consumer system,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nour reputation didn't matter so much,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nbecause our credit history was far more important\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nthat any kind of peer-to-peer review.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nBut now with the Web, we leave a trail.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nWith every spammer we flag,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nwith every idea we post, comment we share,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nwe're actually signaling how well we collaborate,\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nand whether we can or can't be trusted.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nLet's go back to my first example,\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nSwaptree.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nI can see that Rondoron\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nhas completed 553 trades\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nwith a 100 percent success rate.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nIn other words, I can trust him or her.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nNow mark my words,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nit's only a matter of time\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nbefore we're going to be able to perform a Google-like search\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nand see a cumulative picture\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nof our reputation capital.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nAnd this reputation capital\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nwill determine our access to collaborative consumption.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nIt's a new social currency, so to speak,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nthat could become as powerful as our credit rating.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nNow as a closing thought,\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nI believe we're actually in a period\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nwhere we're waking up\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nfrom this humongous hangover\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nof emptiness and waste,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nand we're taking a leap\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nto create a more sustainable system\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nbuilt to serve our innate needs\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nfor community and individual identity.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nI believe it will be referred to\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nas a revolution, so to speak --\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nwhen society, faced with great challenges,\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nmade a seismic shift\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nfrom individual getting and spending\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\ntowards a rediscovery of collective good.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nI'm on a mission to make sharing cool.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nI'm on a mission to make sharing hip.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nBecause I really believe\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nit can disrupt outdated modes of business,\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nhelp us leapfrog\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nover wasteful forms of hyper-consumption\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nand teach us when enough really is enough.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Life lessons from big cats", "duration": "1040", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/beverly_dereck_joubert_life_lessons_from_big_cats", "transcript": "Beverly Joubert: We are truly passionate about the African wilderness and protecting the African wilderness, and so what we've done is we've focused on iconic cats. And I know, in the light of human suffering and poverty and even climate change, one would wonder, why worry about a few cats? Well today we're here to share with you a message that we have learned from a very important and special character \u2014 this leopard.Dereck Joubert: Well, our lives have basically been like a super long episode of \"CSI\" \u2014 something like 28 years. In essence, what we've done is we've studied the science, we've looked at the behavior, we've seen over 2,000 kills by these amazing animals. But one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality, that individual personality that these animals have. And here's a prime example. We found this leopard in a 2,000-year-old baobab tree in Africa, the same tree that we found her mother in and her grandmother. And she took us on a journey and revealed something very special to us \u2014 her own daughter, eight days old. And the minute we found this leopard, we realized that we needed to move in, and so we basically stayed with this leopard for the next four-and-a-half years \u2014 following her every day, getting to know her, that individual personality of hers, and really coming to know her. Now I'm destined to spend a lot of time with some unique, very, very special, individualistic and often seductive female characters. (Laughter) Beverly's clearly one of them, and this little leopard, Legadema, is another, and she changed our lives.BJ: Well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her \u2014 in fact, more time than even her mother did. When her mother would go off hunting, we would stay and film. And early on, a lightning bolt hit a tree 20 paces away from us. It was frightening, and it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell. And of course, we were stunned for a while, but when we managed to get our wits about us, we looked at it and said, \"My gosh, what's going to happen with that little cub? She's probably going to forever associate that deafening crash with us.\" Well, we needn't have worried. She came charging out of the thicket straight towards us, sat next to us, shivering, with her back towards Dereck, and looking out. And actually from that day on, she's been comfortable with us. So we felt that that day was the day that she really earned her name. We called her Legadema, which means, \"light from the sky.\"DJ: Now we've found these individualisms in all sorts of animals, in particular in the cats. This particular one is called Eetwidomayloh, \"he who greets with fire,\" and you can just see that about him, you know \u2014 that's his character. But only by getting up close to these animals and spending time with them can we actually even reach out and dig out these personal characters that they have.BJ: But through our investigation, we have to seek the wildest places in Africa. And right now this is in the Okavango Delta in Botswana. Yes, it is swamp. We live in the swamp in a tent, but I must tell you, every day is exhilarating. But also, our hearts are in our throats a huge amount of the time, because we're driving through water, and it's an unknown territory. But we're really there seeking and searching and filming the iconic cats.DJ: Now one of the big things, of course, everybody knows that cats hate water, and so this was a real revelation for us. And we could only find this by pushing ourselves, by going where no sane person should go \u2014 not without some prompting, by the way, from Beverly \u2014 and just pushing the envelope, going out there, pushing our vehicle, pushing ourselves. But we've managed to find that these lions are 15 percent bigger than any others, and they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water.BJ: And then of course, the challenge is knowing when to turn around. We don't always get that right, and on this particular day, we seriously underestimated the depth. We got deeper and deeper, until it was at Dereck's chest-height. Well then we hit a deep depression, and we seriously submerged the vehicle. We actually managed to drown two million dollars' worth of camera gear. We drowned our pride, I must tell you, which was really serious, and we seized the engine.DJ: And of course, one of the rules that we have in the vehicle is that he who drowns the vehicle gets to swim with the crocodiles. (Laughter) You will notice also that all of these images here are taken from the top angle by Beverly \u2014 the dry top angle, by the way. (Laughter) But all the places we get stuck in really have great views. And it wasn't a moment, and these lions came back towards us, and Beverly was able to get a great photograph.BJ: But we truly do spend day and night trying to capture unique footage. And 20 years ago, we did a film called \"Eternal Enemies\" where we managed to capture this unusual disturbing behavior across two species \u2014 lions and hyenas. And surprisingly, it became a cult film. And we can only work that out as people were seeing parallels between the thuggish side of nature and gang warfare.DJ: It was amazing, because you can see that this lion is doing exactly what his name, Eetwidomayloh, represents. He's focused on this hyena, and he is going to get it. (Animal sounds) But that's, I think, what this is all about, is that these individuals have these personalities and characters. But for us to get them, not only do we push ourselves, but we live by certain rules of engagement, which mean we can't interfere. This sort of behavior has been going on for three, four, five million years, and we can't step in and say, \"That's wrong, and that's right.\" But that's not always easy for us.BJ: So, as Dereck says, we have to work through extremes \u2014 extreme temperatures, push ourselves at night. Sleep deprivation is extreme. We're on the edge through a large part of the time. But, for 10 years, we tried to capture lions and elephants together \u2014 and never ever managed until this particular night. And I have to tell you that it was a disturbing night for me. I had tears rolling down my cheeks. I was shaking with anxiety, but I knew that [I had] to capture something that had never been seen before, had never been documented. And I do believe you should stay with us.DJ: The amazing thing about these moments \u2014 and this is probably a highlight of our career \u2014 is that you never know how it's going to end. Many people believe, in fact, that death begins in the eyes, not in the heart, not in the lungs, and that's when people give up hope, or when any life form gives up hope. And you can see the start of it here. This elephant, against overwhelming odds, simply gives up hope. But by the same token, you can get your hope back again. So just when you think it's all over, something else happens, some spark gets into you, some sort of will to fight \u2014 that iron will that we all have, that this elephant has, that conservation has, that big cats have. Everything has that will to survive, to fight, to push through that mental barrier and to keep going. And for us, in many ways, this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration for us, a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work.(Applause)Now back to the leopard. We were spending so much time with this leopard and getting to understand her individualism, her personal character, that maybe we were taking it a little bit far. We were perhaps taking her for granted, and maybe she didn't like that that much. This is about couples working together, and so I do need to say that within the vehicle we have quite strict territories, Beverly and I. Beverly sits on the one side where all her camera gear is, and I'm on the other side where my space is. These are precious to us, these divides.BJ: But when this little cub saw that I had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear, she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate. It was phenomenal, and we felt grateful that she trusted us to that extent. But at the same time, we were concerned that if she created this as a habit and jumped into somebody else's car, it might not turn out the same way \u2014 she might get shot for that. So we knew we had to react quickly. And the only way we thought we could without scaring her is to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make \u2014 a hiss and a sound. So Dereck turned on the heater fan in the car \u2014 very innovative.DJ: It was the only way for me to save the marriage, because Beverly felt she was being replaced, you see. (Laughter) But really and truly, this was how this little leopard was displaying her individual personality. But nothing prepared us for what happened next in our relationship with her, when she started hunting.BJ: And on this first hunt, we truly were excited. It was like watching a graduation ceremony. We felt like we were surrogate parents. And of course, we knew now that she was going to survive. But only when we saw the tiny baby baboon clinging to the mother's fur did we realize that something very unique was taking place here with Legadema. And of course, the baby baboon was so innocent, it didn't turn and run. So what we watched over the next couple of hours was very unique. It was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety, protecting it from the hyena. And over the next five hours, she took care of it. We realized that we actually don't know everything, and that nature is so unpredictable, we have to be open at all times.DJ: Okay, so she was a little bit rough. (Laughter) But in fact, what we were seeing here was interesting. Because she is a cub wanting to play, but she was also a predator needing to kill, and yet conflicted in some way, because she was also an emerging mother. She had this maternal instinct, much like a young girl on her way to womanhood, and so this really took us to this new level of understanding that personality.BJ: And of course, through the night, they lay together. They ended up sleeping for hours. But I have to tell you \u2014 everybody always asks, \"What happened to the baby baboon?\" It did die, and we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights.DJ: So at this stage, I guess, we had very, very firm ideas on what conservation meant. We had to deal with these individual personalities. We had to deal with them with respect and celebrate them. And so we, with the National Geographic, formed the Big Cats Initiative to march forward into conservation, taking care of the big cats that we loved \u2014 and then had an opportunity to look back over the last 50 years to see how well we had all collectively been doing. So when Beverly and I were born, there were 450,000 lions, and today there are 20,000. Tigers haven't fared any better \u2014 45,000 down to maybe 3,000.BJ: And then cheetahs have crashed all the way down to 12,000. Leopards have plummeted from 700,000 down to a mere 50,000. Now in the extraordinary time that we have worked with Legadema \u2014 which is really over a five-year period \u2014 10,000 leopards were legally shot by safari hunters. And that's not the only leopards that were being killed through that period. There's an immense amount of poaching as well, and so possibly the same amount. It's simply not sustainable. We admire them, and we fear them, and yet, as man, we want to steal their power. It used to be the time where only kings wore a leopard skin, but now throughout rituals and ceremonies, traditional healers and ministers. And of course, looking at this lion paw that has been skinned, it eerily reminds me of a human hand, and that's ironic, because their fate is in our hands.DJ: There's a burgeoning bone trade. South Africa just released some lion bones onto the market. Lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same, and so in a stroke, the lion bone industry is going to wipe out all the tigers. So we have a real problem here, no more so than the lions do, the male lions. So the 20,000 lion figure that you just saw is actually a red herring, because there may be 3,000 or 4,000 male lions, and they all are actually infected with the same disease. I call it complacency \u2014 our complacency. Because there's a sport, there's an activity going on that we're all aware of, that we condone. And that's probably because we haven't seen it like we are today.BJ: And you have to know that, when a male lion is killed, it completely disrupts the whole pride. A new male comes into the area and takes over the pride, and, of course, first of all kills all the cubs and possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs. So we've estimated that between 20 [and] 30 lions are killed when one lion is hanging on a wall somewhere in a far-off place.DJ: So what our investigations have shown is that these lions are essential. They're essential to the habitat. If they disappear, whole ecosystems in Africa disappear. There's an 80-billion-dollar-a-year ecotourism revenue stream into Africa. So this is not just a concern about lions; it's a concern about communities in Africa as well. If they disappear, all of that goes away. But what I'm more concerned about in many ways is that, as we de-link ourselves from nature, as we de-link ourselves spiritually from these animals, we lose hope, we lose that spiritual connection, our dignity, that thing within us that keeps us connected to the planet.BJ: So you have to know, looking into the eyes of lions and leopards right now, it is all about critical awareness. And so what we are doing, in February, we're bringing out a film called \"The Last Lion,\" and \"The Last Lion\" is exactly what is happening right now. That is the situation we're in \u2014 the last lions. That is, if we don't take action and do something, these plains will be completely devoid of big cats, and then, in turn, everything else will disappear. And simply, if we can't protect them, we're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well.DJ: And in fact, that original thing that we spoke about and designed our lives by \u2014 that conservation was all about respect and celebration \u2014 is probably true. That's really what it needs. We need it. We respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman, as a community and as part of this planet, and we need to continue that.And Legadema? Well we can report, in fact, that we're grandparents.(Laughter)BJ/DJ: Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1039, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958

wilderness,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nand so what we've done\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nis we've focused on iconic cats.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nAnd I know,\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nin the light of human suffering and poverty\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nand even climate change,\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\none would wonder,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nwhy worry about a few cats?\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nWell today we're here\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nto share with you a message that we have learned\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nfrom a very important and special character --\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nthis leopard.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nDereck Joubert: Well, our lives have basically been\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nlike a super long episode of \"CSI\" --\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nsomething like 28 years.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nIn essence, what we've done\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nis we've studied the science, we've looked at the behavior,\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nwe've seen over 2,000 kills\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nby these amazing animals.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nBut one of the things that science really lets us down on\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nis that personality,\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nthat individual personality that these animals have.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nAnd here's a prime example.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nWe found this leopard in a 2,000-year-old\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nbaobab tree in Africa,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nthe same tree that we found her mother in\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nand her grandmother.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nAnd she took us on a journey\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nand revealed something very special to us --\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nher own daughter, eight days old.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nAnd the minute we found this leopard,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nwe realized that we needed to move in,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nand so we basically stayed with this leopard\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nfor the next four-and-a-half years --\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nfollowing her every day,\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\ngetting to know her,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nthat individual personality of hers,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nand really coming to know her.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nNow I'm destined\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nto spend a lot of time\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nwith some unique,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nvery, very special,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nindividualistic\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nand often seductive female characters.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nBeverly's clearly one of them,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nand this little leopard, Legadema, is another,\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nand she changed our lives.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nBJ: Well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her --\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nin fact, more time than even her mother did.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nWhen her mother would go off hunting,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nwe would stay and film.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nAnd early on, a lightning bolt hit a tree\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\n20 paces away from us.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nIt was frightening,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nand it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nAnd of course, we were stunned for a while,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nbut when we managed to get our wits about us,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nwe looked at it and said, \"My gosh,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nwhat's going to happen with that little cub?\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nShe's probably going to forever associate\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nthat deafening crash with us.\"\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nWell, we needn't have worried.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nShe came charging out of the thicket straight towards us,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nsat next to us, shivering,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nwith her back towards Dereck, and looking out.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nAnd actually from that day on,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nshe's been comfortable with us.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nSo we felt that that day\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nwas the day that she really earned her name.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nWe called her Legadema,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nwhich means, \"light from the sky.\"\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nDJ: Now we've found these individualisms\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nin all sorts of animals,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nin particular in the cats.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nThis particular one is called Eetwidomayloh,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\n\"he who greets with fire,\"\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nand you can just see that about him, you know -- that's his character.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nBut only by getting up close to these animals\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nand spending time with them\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\ncan we actually even reach out\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nand dig out these personal characters that they have.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nBJ: But through our investigation,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nwe have to seek the wildest places in Africa.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nAnd right now this is in the Okavango Delta\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nin Botswana.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nYes, it is swamp. We live in the swamp in a tent,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nbut I must tell you, every day is exhilarating.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nBut also, our hearts are in our throats\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\na huge amount of the time,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nbecause we're driving through water,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nand it's an unknown territory.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nBut we're really there\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nseeking and searching and filming the iconic cats.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nDJ: Now one of the big things, of course,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\neverybody knows that cats hate water,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nand so this was a real revelation for us.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nAnd we could only find this by pushing ourselves,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nby going where no sane person should go --\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nnot without some prompting, by the way, from Beverly --\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nand just pushing the envelope,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\ngoing out there, pushing our vehicle, pushing ourselves.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nBut we've managed to find that these lions\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nare 15 percent bigger than any others,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nand they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nBJ: And then of course, the challenge\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nis knowing when to turn around.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nWe don't always get that right,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nand on this particular day,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nwe seriously underestimated the depth.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nWe got deeper and deeper,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nuntil it was at Dereck's chest-height.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nWell then we hit a deep depression,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nand we seriously submerged the vehicle.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nWe actually managed to drown\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\ntwo million dollars' worth of camera gear.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nWe drowned our pride, I must tell you,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nwhich was really serious,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nand we seized the engine.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nDJ: And of course, one of the rules that we have in the vehicle\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nis that he who drowns the vehicle\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\ngets to swim with the crocodiles.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nYou will notice also that all of these images here\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nare taken from the top angle by Beverly --\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nthe dry top angle, by the way.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nBut all the places we get stuck in really have great views.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nAnd it wasn't a moment, and these lions came back towards us,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nand Beverly was able to get a great photograph.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nBJ: But we truly do\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nspend day and night\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\ntrying to capture unique footage.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nAnd 20 years ago,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nwe did a film called \"Eternal Enemies\"\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nwhere we managed to capture\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nthis unusual disturbing behavior across two species --\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nlions and hyenas.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nAnd surprisingly, it became a cult film.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nAnd we can only work that out\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nas people were seeing parallels\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nbetween the thuggish side of nature\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nand gang warfare.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nDJ: It was amazing, because you can see that this lion\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nis doing exactly what his name,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nEetwidomayloh, represents.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nHe's focused on this hyena,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nand he is going to get it.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.958\n(Animal sounds)\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nBut that's, I think, what this is all about,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nis that these individuals have these personalities and characters.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nBut for us to get them, not only do we push ourselves,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nbut we live by certain rules of engagement,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nwhich mean we can't interfere.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nThis sort of behavior has been going on\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nfor three, four, five million years,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nand we can't step in and say, \"That's wrong, and that's right.\"\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nBut that's not always easy for us.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nBJ: So, as Dereck says,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nwe have to work through extremes --\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nextreme temperatures, push ourselves at night.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nSleep deprivation is extreme.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nWe're on the edge\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nthrough a large part of the time.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nBut, for 10 years, we tried to capture\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nlions and elephants together --\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nand never ever managed\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nuntil this particular night.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nAnd I have to tell you\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nthat it was a disturbing night for me.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nI had tears rolling down my cheeks.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nI was shaking with anxiety,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nbut I knew that [I had] to capture something\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nthat had never been seen before, had never been documented.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nAnd I do believe you should stay with us.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nDJ: The amazing thing about these moments --\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nand this is probably a highlight of our career --\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nis that you never know how it's going to end.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nMany people believe, in fact,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nthat death begins in the eyes, not in the heart,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nnot in the lungs,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nand that's when people give up hope,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nor when any life form gives up hope.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nAnd you can see the start of it here.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nThis elephant, against overwhelming odds,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nsimply gives up hope.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nBut by the same token,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nyou can get your hope back again.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nSo just when you think it's all over, something else happens,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nsome spark gets into you,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nsome sort of will to fight --\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nthat iron will that we all have,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nthat this elephant has,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nthat conservation has, that big cats have.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nEverything has that will to survive,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nto fight, to push through that mental barrier\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nand to keep going.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nAnd for us, in many ways,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nthis elephant has become\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\na symbol of inspiration for us,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\na symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:47.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nNow back to the leopard.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nWe were spending so much time with this leopard\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nand getting to understand her individualism,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nher personal character,\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nthat maybe we were taking it a little bit far.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nWe were perhaps taking her for granted,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nand maybe she didn't like that that much.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nThis is about couples working together,\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nand so I do need to say that within the vehicle\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nwe have quite strict territories, Beverly and I.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nBeverly sits on the one side\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nwhere all her camera gear is,\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nand I'm on the other side where my space is.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nThese are precious to us, these divides.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nBJ: But when this little cub saw\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nthat I had vacated my seat\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nand climbed to the back to get some camera gear,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nshe came in like a curious cat\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nto come and investigate.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nIt was phenomenal, and we felt grateful\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nthat she trusted us to that extent.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nBut at the same time, we were concerned\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nthat if she created this as a habit\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nand jumped into somebody else's car,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nit might not turn out the same way --\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nshe might get shot for that.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nSo we knew we had to react quickly.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nAnd the only way we thought we could\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nwithout scaring her\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nis to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make --\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\na hiss and a sound.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nSo Dereck turned on the heater fan in the car --\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nvery innovative.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nDJ: It was the only way for me to save the marriage,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nbecause Beverly felt she was being replaced, you see.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nBut really and truly, this was how\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nthis little leopard was displaying\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nher individual personality.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nBut nothing prepared us\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nfor what happened next in our relationship with her,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nwhen she started hunting.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nBJ: And on this first hunt, we truly were excited.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nIt was like watching a graduation ceremony.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nWe felt like we were surrogate parents.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nAnd of course, we knew now\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nthat she was going to survive.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nBut only when we saw the tiny baby baboon\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nclinging to the mother's fur\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\ndid we realize that something very unique\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nwas taking place here with Legadema.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAnd of course, the baby baboon was so innocent,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nit didn't turn and run.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nSo what we watched\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nover the next couple of hours\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nwas very unique.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nIt was absolutely amazing\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nwhen she picked it up to safety,\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nprotecting it from the hyena.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nAnd over the next five hours,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nshe took care of it.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nWe realized that we actually don't know everything,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nand that nature is so unpredictable,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nwe have to be open at all times.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nDJ: Okay, so she was a little bit rough.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nBut in fact,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nwhat we were seeing here was interesting.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nBecause she is a cub wanting to play,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nbut she was also a predator needing to kill,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand yet conflicted in some way,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nbecause she was also an emerging mother.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nShe had this maternal instinct,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nmuch like a young girl on her way to womanhood,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nand so this really took us to this new level\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nof understanding that personality.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nBJ: And of course, through the night, they lay together.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nThey ended up sleeping for hours.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nBut I have to tell you --\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\neverybody always asks, \"What happened to the baby baboon?\"\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nIt did die,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nDJ: So at this stage, I guess,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nwe had very, very firm ideas\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\non what conservation meant.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nWe had to deal with these individual personalities.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nWe had to deal with them with respect\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand celebrate them.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nAnd so we, with the National Geographic, formed the Big Cats Initiative\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nto march forward into conservation,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\ntaking care of the big cats that we loved --\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nand then had an opportunity to look back over the last 50 years\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nto see how well we had all collectively been doing.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nSo when Beverly and I were born,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nthere were 450,000 lions,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nand today there are 20,000.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nTigers haven't fared any better --\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\n45,000\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\ndown to maybe 3,000.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nBJ: And then cheetahs have crashed\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nall the way down to 12,000.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nLeopards have plummeted\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nfrom 700,000\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\ndown to a mere 50,000.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nNow in the extraordinary time\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nthat we have worked with Legadema --\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nwhich is really over a five-year period --\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\n10,000 leopards were legally shot\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nby safari hunters.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nAnd that's not the only leopards\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nthat were being killed through that period.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nThere's an immense amount of poaching as well,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nand so possibly the same amount.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nIt's simply not sustainable.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nWe admire them,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nand we fear them,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nand yet, as man, we want to steal their power.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nIt used to be the time\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nwhere only kings wore a leopard skin,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nbut now throughout rituals and ceremonies,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\ntraditional healers and ministers.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nAnd of course, looking at this lion paw\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nthat has been skinned,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nit eerily reminds me\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nof a human hand,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nand that's ironic, because their fate is in our hands.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nDJ: There's a burgeoning bone trade.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nSouth Africa just released some lion bones onto the market.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nLion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nand so in a stroke, the lion bone industry\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nis going to wipe out all the tigers.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nSo we have a real problem here,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nno more so than the lions do, the male lions.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nSo the 20,000 lion figure that you just saw\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nis actually a red herring,\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nbecause there may be 3,000 or 4,000 male lions,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nand they all are actually\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\ninfected with the same disease.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nI call it complacency --\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nour complacency.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nBecause there's a sport, there's an activity going on\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nthat we're all aware of, that we condone.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nAnd that's probably because we haven't seen it\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nlike we are today.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nBJ: And you have to know\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nthat, when a male lion is killed,\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nit completely disrupts the whole pride.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nA new male comes into the area\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nand takes over the pride,\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nand, of course, first of all kills all the cubs\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nand possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nSo we've estimated\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nthat between 20 [and] 30 lions are killed\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nwhen one lion is hanging on a wall\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nsomewhere in a far-off place.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nDJ: So what our investigations have shown\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nis that these lions are essential.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nThey're essential to the habitat.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nIf they disappear,\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nwhole ecosystems in Africa disappear.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nThere's an 80-billion-dollar-a-year\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\necotourism revenue stream into Africa.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nSo this is not just a concern about lions;\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nit's a concern about communities in Africa as well.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nIf they disappear, all of that goes away.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nBut what I'm more concerned about in many ways\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nis that, as we de-link ourselves from nature,\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nas we de-link ourselves spiritually\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nfrom these animals,\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nwe lose hope,\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nwe lose that spiritual connection,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nour dignity, that thing within us\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nthat keeps us connected to the planet.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nBJ: So you have to know, looking into the eyes\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nof lions and leopards right now,\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nit is all about critical awareness.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nAnd so what we are doing,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nin February, we're bringing out a film called \"The Last Lion,\"\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nand \"The Last Lion\" is exactly\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nwhat is happening right now.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nThat is the situation we're in --\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nthe last lions.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nThat is, if we don't take action and do something,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nthese plains will be completely devoid\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nof big cats,\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nand then, in turn, everything else will disappear.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nAnd simply, if we can't protect them,\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nwe're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nDJ: And in fact, that original thing that we spoke about\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nand designed our lives by --\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nthat conservation was all about respect\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nand celebration --\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nis probably true. That's really what it needs.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nWe need it. We respect and celebrate each other\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nas a man and a woman, as a community\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nand as part of this planet,\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nand we need to continue that.\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nAnd Legadema?\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nWell we can report, in fact,\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nthat we're grandparents.\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nBJ/DJ: Thank you very much.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:09.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why we have too few women leaders", "duration": "898", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/sheryl_sandberg_why_we_have_too_few_women_leaders", "transcript": "So for any of us in this room today, let's start out by admitting we're lucky. We don't live in the world our mothers lived in, our grandmothers lived in, where career choices for women were so limited. And if you're in this room today, most of us grew up in a world where we have basic civil rights, and amazingly, we still live in a world where some women don't have them. But all that aside, we still have a problem, and it's a real problem. And the problem is this: Women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world. The numbers tell the story quite clearly. 190 heads of state \u2014 nine are women. Of all the people in parliament in the world, 13 percent are women. In the corporate sector, women at the top, C-level jobs, board seats \u2014 tops out at 15, 16 percent. The numbers have not moved since 2002 and are going in the wrong direction. And even in the non-profit world, a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women, women at the top: 20 percent.We also have another problem, which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment. A recent study in the U.S. showed that, of married senior managers, two-thirds of the married men had children and only one-third of the married women had children. A couple of years ago, I was in New York, and I was pitching a deal, and I was in one of those fancy New York private equity offices you can picture. And I'm in the meeting \u2014 it's about a three-hour meeting \u2014 and two hours in, there needs to be that bio break, and everyone stands up, and the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarrassed. And I realized he doesn't know where the women's room is in his office. So I start looking around for moving boxes, figuring they just moved in, but I don't see any. And so I said, \"Did you just move into this office?\" And he said, \"No, we've been here about a year.\" And I said, \"Are you telling me that I am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year?\" And he looked at me, and he said, \"Yeah. Or maybe you're the only one who had to go to the bathroom.\"(Laughter)So the question is, how are we going to fix this? How do we change these numbers at the top? How do we make this different? I want to start out by saying, I talk about this \u2014 about keeping women in the workforce \u2014 because I really think that's the answer. In the high-income part of our workforce, in the people who end up at the top \u2014 Fortune 500 CEO jobs, or the equivalent in other industries \u2014 the problem, I am convinced, is that women are dropping out. Now people talk about this a lot, and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring and programs companies should have to train women. I want to talk about none of that today, even though that's all really important. Today I want to focus on what we can do as individuals. What are the messages we need to tell ourselves? What are the messages we tell the women that work with and for us? What are the messages we tell our daughters?Now, at the outset, I want to be very clear that this speech comes with no judgments. I don't have the right answer. I don't even have it for myself. I left San Francisco, where I live, on Monday, and I was getting on the plane for this conference. And my daughter, who's three, when I dropped her off at preschool, did that whole hugging-the-leg, crying, \"Mommy, don't get on the plane\" thing. This is hard. I feel guilty sometimes. I know no women, whether they're at home or whether they're in the workforce, who don't feel that sometimes. So I'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone.My talk today is about what the messages are if you do want to stay in the workforce, and I think there are three. One, sit at the table. Two, make your partner a real partner. And three, don't leave before you leave. Number one: sit at the table. Just a couple weeks ago at Facebook, we hosted a very senior government official, and he came in to meet with senior execs from around Silicon Valley. And everyone kind of sat at the table. He had these two women who were traveling with him pretty senior in his department, and I kind of said to them, \"Sit at the table. Come on, sit at the table,\" and they sat on the side of the room. When I was in college, my senior year, I took a course called European Intellectual History. Don't you love that kind of thing from college? I wish I could do that now. And I took it with my roommate, Carrie, who was then a brilliant literary student \u2014 and went on to be a brilliant literary scholar \u2014 and my brother \u2014 smart guy, but a water-polo-playing pre-med, who was a sophomore.The three of us take this class together. And then Carrie reads all the books in the original Greek and Latin, goes to all the lectures. I read all the books in English and go to most of the lectures. My brother is kind of busy. He reads one book of 12 and goes to a couple of lectures, marches himself up to our room a couple days before the exam to get himself tutored. The three of us go to the exam together, and we sit down. And we sit there for three hours \u2014 and our little blue notebooks \u2014 yes, I'm that old. We walk out, we look at each other, and we say, \"How did you do?\" And Carrie says, \"Boy, I feel like I didn't really draw out the main point on the Hegelian dialectic.\" And I say, \"God, I really wish I had really connected John Locke's theory of property with the philosophers that follow.\" And my brother says, \"I got the top grade in the class.\"(Laughter)\"You got the top grade in the class? You don't know anything.\"(Laughter)The problem with these stories is that they show what the data shows: women systematically underestimate their own abilities. If you test men and women, and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like GPAs, men get it wrong slightly high, and women get it wrong slightly low. Women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce. A study in the last two years of people entering the workforce out of college showed that 57 percent of boys entering, or men, I guess, are negotiating their first salary, and only seven percent of women. And most importantly, men attribute their success to themselves, and women attribute it to other external factors. If you ask men why they did a good job, they'll say, \"I'm awesome. Obviously. Why are you even asking?\" If you ask women why they did a good job, what they'll say is someone helped them, they got lucky, they worked really hard. Why does this matter? Boy, it matters a lot. Because no one gets to the corner office by sitting on the side, not at the table, and no one gets the promotion if they don't think they deserve their success, or they don't even understand their own success.I wish the answer were easy. I wish I could go tell all the young women I work for, these fabulous women, \"Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself. Own your own success.\" I wish I could tell that to my daughter. But it's not that simple. Because what the data shows, above all else, is one thing, which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women. And everyone's nodding, because we all know this to be true.There's a really good study that shows this really well. There's a famous Harvard Business School study on a woman named Heidi Roizen. And she's an operator in a company in Silicon Valley, and she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture capitalist. In 2002 \u2014 not so long ago \u2014 a professor who was then at Columbia University took that case and made it [Howard] Roizen. And he gave the case out, both of them, to two groups of students. He changed exactly one word: \"Heidi\" to \"Howard.\" But that one word made a really big difference. He then surveyed the students, and the good news was the students, both men and women, thought Heidi and Howard were equally competent, and that's good. The bad news was that everyone liked Howard. He's a great guy. You want to work for him. You want to spend the day fishing with him. But Heidi? Not so sure. She's a little out for herself. She's a little political. You're not sure you'd want to work for her. This is the complication. We have to tell our daughters and our colleagues, we have to tell ourselves to believe we got the A, to reach for the promotion, to sit at the table, and we have to do it in a world where, for them, there are sacrifices they will make for that, even though for their brothers, there are not.The saddest thing about all of this is that it's really hard to remember this. And I'm about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me, but I think important. I gave this talk at Facebook not so long ago to about 100 employees, and a couple hours later, there was a young woman who works there sitting outside my little desk, and she wanted to talk to me. I said, okay, and she sat down, and we talked. And she said, \"I learned something today. I learned that I need to keep my hand up.\" \"What do you mean?\" She said, \"You're giving this talk, and you said you would take two more questions. I had my hand up with many other people, and you took two more questions. I put my hand down, and I noticed all the women did the same, and then you took more questions, only from the men.\" And I thought to myself, \"Wow, if it's me \u2014 who cares about this, obviously \u2014 giving this talk \u2014 and during this talk, I can't even notice that the men's hands are still raised, and the women's hands are still raised, how good are we as managers of our companies and our organizations at seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities more than women?\" We've got to get women to sit at the table.(Cheers)(Applause)Message number two: Make your partner a real partner. I've become convinced that we've made more progress in the workforce than we have in the home. The data shows this very clearly. If a woman and a man work full-time and have a child, the woman does twice the amount of housework the man does, and the woman does three times the amount of childcare the man does. So she's got three jobs or two jobs, and he's got one. Who do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more? The causes of this are really complicated, and I don't have time to go into them. And I don't think Sunday football-watching and general laziness is the cause.I think the cause is more complicated. I think, as a society, we put more pressure on our boys to succeed than we do on our girls. I know men that stay home and work in the home to support wives with careers, and it's hard. When I go to the Mommy-and-Me stuff and I see the father there, I notice that the other mommies don't play with him. And that's a problem, because we have to make it as important a job, because it's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home, for people of both genders, if we're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce.(Applause)Studies show that households with equal earning and equal responsibility also have half the divorce rate. And if that wasn't good enough motivation for everyone out there, they also have more \u2014 how shall I say this on this stage? They know each other more in the biblical sense as well.(Cheers)Message number three: Don't leave before you leave. I think there's a really deep irony to the fact that actions women are taking \u2014 and I see this all the time \u2014 with the objective of staying in the workforce actually lead to their eventually leaving. Here's what happens: We're all busy. Everyone's busy. A woman's busy. And she starts thinking about having a child, and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child, she starts thinking about making room for that child. \"How am I going to fit this into everything else I'm doing?\" And literally from that moment, she doesn't raise her hand anymore, she doesn't look for a promotion, she doesn't take on the new project, she doesn't say, \"Me. I want to do that.\" She starts leaning back. The problem is that \u2014 let's say she got pregnant that day, that day \u2014 nine months of pregnancy, three months of maternity leave, six months to catch your breath \u2014 Fast-forward two years, more often \u2014 and as I've seen it \u2014 women start thinking about this way earlier \u2014 when they get engaged, or married, when they start thinking about having a child, which can take a long time. One woman came to see me about this. She looked a little young. And I said, \"So are you and your husband thinking about having a baby?\" And she said, \"Oh no, I'm not married.\" She didn't even have a boyfriend.(Laughter)I said, \"You're thinking about this just way too early.\"But the point is that what happens once you start kind of quietly leaning back? Everyone who's been through this \u2014 and I'm here to tell you, once you have a child at home, your job better be really good to go back, because it's hard to leave that kid at home. Your job needs to be challenging. It needs to be rewarding. You need to feel like you're making a difference. And if two years ago you didn't take a promotion and some guy next to you did, if three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities, you're going to be bored because you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal. Don't leave before you leave. Stay in. Keep your foot on the gas pedal, until the very day you need to leave to take a break for a child \u2014 and then make your decisions. Don't make decisions too far in advance, particularly ones you're not even conscious you're making.My generation really, sadly, is not going to change the numbers at the top. They're just not moving. We are not going to get to where 50 percent of the population \u2014 in my generation, there will not be 50 percent of [women] at the top of any industry. But I'm hopeful that future generations can. I think a world where half of our countries and our companies were run by women, would be a better world. It's not just because people would know where the women's bathrooms are, even though that would be very helpful. I think it would be a better world. I have two children. I have a five-year-old son and a two-year-old daughter. I want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home, and I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed, but to be liked for her accomplishments.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1040, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:17.299\nSo for any of us in this room today,\nlet's start out by admitting we're lucky.\n\n00:00:17.323 --> 00:00:20.150\nWe don't live in the world\nour mothers lived in,\n\n00:00:20.174 --> 00:00:21.413\nour grandmothers lived in,\n\n00:00:21.437 --> 00:00:23.925\nwhere career choices\nfor women were so limited.\n\n00:00:24.326 --> 00:00:25.934\nAnd if you're in this room today,\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:30.702\nmost of us grew up in a world\nwhere we have basic civil rights,\n\n00:00:30.726 --> 00:00:34.649\nand amazingly, we still live in a world\nwhere some women don't have them.\n\n00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.044\nBut all that aside,\nwe still have a problem,\n\n00:00:38.068 --> 00:00:39.283\nand it's a real problem.\n\n00:00:39.307 --> 00:00:40.934\nAnd the problem is this:\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:45.130\nWomen are not making it\nto the top of any profession\n\n00:00:45.154 --> 00:00:46.526\nanywhere in the world.\n\n00:00:47.052 --> 00:00:49.485\nThe numbers tell the story quite clearly.\n\n00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:52.547\n190 heads of state --\nnine are women.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:55.424\nOf all the people\nin parliament in the world,\n\n00:00:55.448 --> 00:00:57.297\n13 percent are women.\n\n00:00:57.756 --> 00:01:00.600\nIn the corporate sector, women at the top,\n\n00:01:00.624 --> 00:01:02.934\nC-level jobs, board seats --\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.699\ntops out at 15, 16 percent.\n\n00:01:05.723 --> 00:01:08.675\nThe numbers have not moved since 2002\n\n00:01:08.699 --> 00:01:10.648\nand are going in the wrong direction.\n\n00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.302\nAnd even in the non-profit world,\n\n00:01:13.326 --> 00:01:16.598\na world we sometimes think of\nas being led by more women,\n\n00:01:16.622 --> 00:01:18.934\nwomen at the top: 20 percent.\n\n00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.398\nWe also have another problem,\n\n00:01:21.422 --> 00:01:23.812\nwhich is that women face harder choices\n\n00:01:23.836 --> 00:01:26.934\nbetween professional success\nand personal fulfillment.\n\n00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:32.479\nA recent study in the U.S.\nshowed that, of married senior managers,\n\n00:01:32.503 --> 00:01:34.934\ntwo-thirds of the married men had children\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:37.664\nand only one-third\nof the married women had children.\n\n00:01:38.627 --> 00:01:40.637\nA couple of years ago, I was in New York,\n\n00:01:40.661 --> 00:01:42.117\nand I was pitching a deal,\n\n00:01:42.141 --> 00:01:45.492\nand I was in one of those fancy\nNew York private equity offices\n\n00:01:45.516 --> 00:01:46.689\nyou can picture.\n\n00:01:46.713 --> 00:01:49.523\nAnd I'm in the meeting --\nit's about a three-hour meeting --\n\n00:01:49.547 --> 00:01:52.706\nand two hours in,\nthere needs to be that bio break,\n\n00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.537\nand everyone stands up,\n\n00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:57.847\nand the partner running the meeting\nstarts looking really embarrassed.\n\n00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.492\nAnd I realized he doesn't know\nwhere the women's room is in his office.\n\n00:02:02.516 --> 00:02:05.059\nSo I start looking\naround for moving boxes,\n\n00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:07.369\nfiguring they just moved in,\nbut I don't see any.\n\n00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:10.337\nAnd so I said, \"Did you just\nmove into this office?\"\n\n00:02:10.718 --> 00:02:12.957\nAnd he said, \"No,\nwe've been here about a year.\"\n\n00:02:13.587 --> 00:02:17.688\nAnd I said, \"Are you telling me\nthat I am the only woman\n\n00:02:17.712 --> 00:02:20.494\nto have pitched a deal\nin this office in a year?\"\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.544\nAnd he looked at me, and he said,\n\n00:02:22.568 --> 00:02:26.149\n\"Yeah.

I feel guilty sometimes.\n\n00:03:47.405 --> 00:03:48.934\nI know no women,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.768\nwhether they're at home\nor whether they're in the workforce,\n\n00:03:51.792 --> 00:03:53.331\nwho don't feel that sometimes.\n\n00:03:53.355 --> 00:03:55.934\nSo I'm not saying\nthat staying in the workforce\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.783\nis the right thing for everyone.\n\n00:03:58.286 --> 00:04:00.934\nMy talk today is about\nwhat the messages are\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.315\nif you do want to stay in the workforce,\n\n00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:04.934\nand I think there are three.\n\n00:04:05.473 --> 00:04:07.461\nOne, sit at the table.\n\n00:04:07.862 --> 00:04:10.272\nTwo, make your partner a real partner.\n\n00:04:11.164 --> 00:04:14.934\nAnd three, don't leave before you leave.\n\n00:04:15.754 --> 00:04:17.216\nNumber one: sit at the table.\n\n00:04:17.812 --> 00:04:19.637\nJust a couple weeks ago at Facebook,\n\n00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:21.934\nwe hosted a very senior\ngovernment official,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.179\nand he came in to meet with senior execs\n\n00:04:25.203 --> 00:04:26.804\nfrom around Silicon Valley.\n\n00:04:27.312 --> 00:04:29.494\nAnd everyone kind of sat at the table.\n\n00:04:29.518 --> 00:04:32.090\nHe had these two women\nwho were traveling with him\n\n00:04:32.114 --> 00:04:33.934\npretty senior in his department,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.244\nand I kind of said to them,\n\n00:04:35.268 --> 00:04:37.482\n\"Sit at the table.\nCome on, sit at the table,\"\n\n00:04:37.506 --> 00:04:39.269\nand they sat on the side of the room.\n\n00:04:40.491 --> 00:04:42.443\nWhen I was in college, my senior year,\n\n00:04:42.467 --> 00:04:44.966\nI took a course called\nEuropean Intellectual History.\n\n00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.197\nDon't you love that kind\nof thing from college?\n\n00:04:47.221 --> 00:04:48.934\nI wish I could do that now.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.934\nAnd I took it with my roommate, Carrie,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.498\nwho was then a brilliant\nliterary student --\n\n00:04:53.522 --> 00:04:55.832\nand went on to be a brilliant\nliterary scholar --\n\n00:04:55.856 --> 00:04:57.873\nand my brother -- smart guy,\n\n00:04:57.897 --> 00:04:59.512\nbut a water-polo-playing pre-med,\n\n00:04:59.536 --> 00:05:00.934\nwho was a sophomore.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.934\nThe three of us take this class together.\n\n00:05:03.516 --> 00:05:07.692\nAnd then Carrie reads all the books\nin the original Greek and Latin,\n\n00:05:07.716 --> 00:05:09.408\ngoes to all the lectures.\n\n00:05:09.432 --> 00:05:11.482\nI read all the books in English\n\n00:05:11.506 --> 00:05:13.163\nand go to most of the lectures.\n\n00:05:13.187 --> 00:05:14.934\nMy brother is kind of busy.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.670\nHe reads one book of 12\nand goes to a couple of lectures,\n\n00:05:18.694 --> 00:05:21.741\nmarches himself up to our room\n\n00:05:21.765 --> 00:05:24.242\na couple days before the exam\nto get himself tutored.\n\n00:05:24.815 --> 00:05:27.496\nThe three of us go to the exam\ntogether, and we sit down.\n\n00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.679\nAnd we sit there for three hours --\n\n00:05:29.703 --> 00:05:32.084\nand our little blue notebooks\n-- yes, I'm that old.\n\n00:05:32.108 --> 00:05:35.323\nWe walk out, we look at each other,\nand we say, \"How did you do?\"\n\n00:05:35.347 --> 00:05:38.824\nAnd Carrie says, \"Boy, I feel like\nI didn't really draw out the main point\n\n00:05:38.848 --> 00:05:40.423\non the Hegelian dialectic.\"\n\n00:05:40.447 --> 00:05:43.372\nAnd I say, \"God, I really\nwish I had really connected\n\n00:05:43.396 --> 00:05:46.611\nJohn Locke's theory of property\nwith the philosophers that follow.\"\n\n00:05:46.635 --> 00:05:48.139\nAnd my brother says,\n\n00:05:48.163 --> 00:05:50.078\n\"I got the top grade in the class.\"\n\n00:05:50.102 --> 00:05:52.047\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:52.071 --> 00:05:54.167\n\"You got the top grade in the class?\n\n00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:55.741\nYou don't know

00:06:05.251\nwomen systematically\nunderestimate their own abilities.\n\n00:06:05.275 --> 00:06:06.934\nIf you test men and women,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:10.552\nand you ask them questions\non totally objective criteria like GPAs,\n\n00:06:10.576 --> 00:06:12.440\nmen get it wrong slightly high,\n\n00:06:12.464 --> 00:06:14.551\nand women get it wrong slightly low.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.934\nWomen do not negotiate\nfor themselves in the workforce.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.934\nA study in the last two years\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.575\nof people entering\nthe

themselves,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.612\nand women attribute it\nto other external factors.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.331\nIf you ask men why they did a good job,\n\n00:06:42.355 -->

Why are you even asking?\"\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.934\nIf you ask women why they did a good job,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.934\nwhat they'll say is someone helped them,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.934\nthey got lucky, they worked really hard.\n\n00:06:54.604 --> 00:06:55.934\nWhy does this matter?\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.934\nBoy, it matters a lot.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.934\nBecause no one gets to the corner office\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.512\nby sitting on the side, not at the table,\n\n00:07:03.536 --> 00:07:05.539\nand no one gets the promotion\n\n00:07:05.563 --> 00:07:08.118\nif they don't think\nthey deserve their success,\n\n00:07:08.142 --> 00:07:10.934\nor they don't even understand\ntheir own success.\n\n00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.574\nI wish the answer were easy.\n\n00:07:13.598 --> 00:07:16.210\nI wish I could go tell\nall the young women I work for,\n\n00:07:16.234 --> 00:07:17.248\nthese fabulous women,\n\n00:07:17.272 --> 00:07:19.522\n\"Believe in yourself\nand negotiate for yourself.\n\n00:07:19.546 --> 00:07:20.934\nOwn your own success.\"\n\n00:07:21.324 --> 00:07:23.360\nI wish I could tell that to my daughter.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.563\nBut it's not that simple.\n\n00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.438\nBecause what the data shows,\nabove all else, is one thing,\n\n00:07:29.462 --> 00:07:33.763\nwhich is that success and likeability\nare positively correlated for men\n\n00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:35.773\nand negatively correlated for women.\n\n00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:39.813\nAnd everyone's nodding,\nbecause we all know this to be true.\n\n00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.934\nThere's a really good study\nthat shows this really well.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.149\nThere's a famous Harvard\nBusiness School study\n\n00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:46.806\non a woman named Heidi Roizen.\n\n00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:51.234\nAnd she's an operator\nin a company in Silicon Valley,\n\n00:07:51.258 --> 00:07:52.934\nand she uses her contacts\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.494\nto become a very successful\nventure capitalist.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.934\nIn 2002 -- not so long ago --\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.197\na professor who was then\nat Columbia University\n\n00:08:00.221 --> 00:08:02.604\ntook that case\nand made it [Howard] Roizen.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:06.461\nAnd he gave the case out, both of them,\nto two groups of students.\n\n00:08:06.485 --> 00:08:09.417\nHe changed exactly one word:\n\n00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:10.934\n\"Heidi\" to \"Howard.\"\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.934\nBut that one word made\na really big difference.\n\n00:08:14.505 --> 00:08:16.136\nHe then surveyed the students,\n\n00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.826\nand the good news was the students,\nboth men and women,\n\n00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.244\nthought Heidi and Howard\nwere equally competent,\n\n00:08:21.268 --> 00:08:22.546\nand that's good.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.641\nThe bad news was\nthat everyone liked Howard.\n\n00:08:25.665 --> 00:08:27.665\nHe's a great guy.\nYou want to work for him.\n\n00:08:27.689 --> 00:08:29.689\nYou want to spend the day\nfishing with him.\n\n00:08:29.713 --> 00:08:31.275\nBut Heidi? Not so sure.\n\n00:08:31.299 --> 00:08:34.164\nShe's a little out for herself.\nShe's a little political.\n\n00:08:34.188 --> 00:08:36.235\nYou're not sure\nyou'd want to work for her.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.583\nThis is the complication.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.268\nWe have to tell our daughters\nand our colleagues,\n\n00:08:41.292 --> 00:08:43.976\nwe have to tell ourselves\nto believe we got the A,\n\n00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.934\nto reach for the promotion,\nto sit at the table,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.737\nand we have to do it in a world\n\n00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:52.356\nwhere, for them, there are sacrifices\nthey will make for that,\n\n00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.667\neven though for their brothers,\nthere are not.\n\n00:08:55.775 --> 00:08:59.442\nThe saddest thing about all of this\nis that it's really hard to remember this.\n\n00:08:59.466 --> 00:09:02.514\nAnd I'm about to tell a story\nwhich is truly embarrassing for me,\n\n00:09:02.538 --> 00:09:03.845\nbut I think important.\n\n00:09:04.228 --> 00:09:07.425\nI gave this talk at Facebook\nnot so long ago\n\n00:09:07.449 --> 00:09:09.938\nto about 100 employees,\n\n00:09:09.962 --> 00:09:13.010\nand a couple hours later,\nthere was a young woman who works there\n\n00:09:13.034 --> 00:09:16.373\nsitting outside my little desk,\nand she wanted to talk to me.\n\n00:09:16.397 --> 00:09:18.540\nI said, okay, and she sat down,\nand we talked.\n\n00:09:18.564 --> 00:09:20.517\nAnd she said, \"I learned something today.\n\n00:09:20.541 --> 00:09:22.596\nI learned that I need to keep my hand up.\"\n\n00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:23.969\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n00:09:23.993 --> 00:09:25.787\nShe said, \"You're giving this talk,\n\n00:09:25.811 --> 00:09:28.108\nand you said you would take\ntwo more questions.\n\n00:09:28.132 --> 00:09:30.212\nI had my hand up with many other people,\n\n00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:31.831\nand you took two more questions.\n\n00:09:31.855 --> 00:09:34.765\nI put my hand down, and I noticed\nall the women did the same,\n\n00:09:34.789 --> 00:09:36.718\nand then you took more questions,\n\n00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:37.934\nonly from the men.\"\n\n00:09:39.114 --> 00:09:40.405\nAnd I thought to myself,\n\n00:09:40.429 --> 00:09:43.234\n\"Wow, if it's me -- who cares\nabout this, obviously --\n\n00:09:43.258 --> 00:09:45.192\ngiving this talk --\n\n00:09:45.216 --> 00:09:50.934\nand during this talk, I can't even notice\nthat the men's hands are still raised,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.934\nand the women's hands are still raised,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.136\nhow good are we\n\n00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.864\nas managers of our companies\nand our organizations\n\n00:09:56.888 --> 00:09:59.413\nat seeing that the

partner.\n\n00:10:11.164 --> 00:10:14.355\nI've become convinced that we've made\nmore progress in the workforce\n\n00:10:14.379 --> 00:10:15.934\nthan we have in the home.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.169\nThe data shows this very clearly.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:23.137\nIf a woman and a man\nwork full-time and have a child,\n\n00:10:23.161 --> 00:10:26.514\nthe woman does twice the amount\nof housework the man does,\n\n00:10:26.538 --> 00:10:30.934\nand the woman does three times\nthe amount of childcare the man does.\n\n00:10:31.405 --> 00:10:35.155\nSo she's got three jobs\nor two jobs, and he's got one.\n\n00:10:35.179 --> 00:10:38.206\nWho do you think drops out\nwhen someone needs to be home more?\n\n00:10:38.772 --> 00:10:42.582\nThe causes of this are really complicated,\nand I don't have time to go into them.\n\n00:10:42.606 --> 00:10:46.542\nAnd I don't think Sunday football-watching\nand general laziness is the cause.\n\n00:10:46.566 --> 00:10:48.780\nI think the cause is more complicated.\n\n00:10:48.804 --> 00:10:50.293\nI think, as a society,\n\n00:10:50.317 --> 00:10:52.534\nwe put more pressure\non our boys to succeed\n\n00:10:52.558 --> 00:10:53.934\nthan we do on our girls.\n\n00:10:54.412 --> 00:10:56.440\nI know men that stay home\n\n00:10:56.464 --> 00:10:59.531\nand work in the home\nto support wives with careers,\n\n00:10:59.555 --> 00:11:00.582\nand it's hard.\n\n00:11:00.606 --> 00:11:03.934\nWhen I go to the Mommy-and-Me stuff\nand I see the father there,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.477\nI notice that the other mommies\ndon't play with him.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.934\nAnd that's a problem,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:13.144\nbecause we have to make it\nas important a job,\n\n00:11:13.168 --> 00:11:16.547\nbecause it's the hardest job\nin the world to work inside the home,\n\n00:11:16.571 --> 00:11:18.051\nfor people of both genders,\n\n00:11:18.075 --> 00:11:21.569\nif we're going to even things out and let\nwomen stay in the workforce.\n\n00:11:21.593 --> 00:11:22.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.197\nStudies show that households\nwith equal earning\n\n00:11:25.221 --> 00:11:27.163\nand equal responsibility\n\n00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:29.348\nalso have half the divorce rate.\n\n00:11:29.372 --> 00:11:32.556\nAnd if that wasn't good enough motivation\nfor everyone out there,\n\n00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.393\nthey also have more --\n\n00:11:34.417 --> 00:11:36.227\nhow shall I say this on this stage?\n\n00:11:36.251 -->

00:11:44.934\nDon't leave before you leave.\n\n00:11:45.497 --> 00:11:47.240\nI think there's a really deep irony\n\n00:11:47.264 --> 00:11:49.349\nto the fact that actions\nwomen are taking --\n\n00:11:49.373 --> 00:11:50.934\nand I see this all the time --\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:54.084\nwith the objective\nof staying in the workforce\n\n00:11:54.108 --> 00:11:56.673\nactually lead to

The first one is happening right here in Chicago. Brenda Palms-Farber was hired to help ex-convicts reenter society and keep them from going back into prison. Currently, taxpayers spend about 60,000 dollars per year sending a person to jail. We know that two-thirds of them are going to go back. I find it interesting that, for every one dollar we spend, however, on early childhood education, like Head Start, we save 17 dollars on stuff like incarceration in the future. Or \u2014 think about it \u2014 that 60,000 dollars is more than what it costs to send one person to Harvard as well.But Brenda, not being phased by stuff like that, took a look at her challenge and came up with a not-so-obvious solution: create a business that produces skin care products from honey. Okay, it might be obvious to some of you; it wasn't to me. It's the basis of growing a form of social innovation that has real potential. She hired seemingly unemployable men and women to care for the bees, harvest the honey and make value-added products that they marketed themselves, and that were later sold at Whole Foods. She combined employment experience and training with life skills they needed, like anger-management and teamwork, and also how to talk to future employers about how their experiences actually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned and their eagerness to learn more. Less than four percent of the folks that went through her program actually go back to jail. So these young men and women learned job-readiness and life skills through bee keeping and became productive citizens in the process. Talk about a sweet beginning.Now, I'm going to take you to Los Angeles, and lots of people know that L.A. has its issues. But I'm going to talk about L.A.'s water issues right now. They have not enough water on most days and too much to handle when it rains. Currently, 20 percent of California's energy consumption is used to pump water into mostly Southern California. Their spending loads, loads, to channel that rainwater out into the ocean when it rains and floods as well. Now Andy Lipkis is working to help L.A. cut infrastructure costs associated with water management and urban heat island \u2014 linking trees, people and technology to create a more livable city. All that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water, also helps cool our cities. Because, come to think about it, do you really want air-conditioning, or is it a cooler room that you want? How you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference.So a few years ago, L.A. County decided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars to repair the city schools. And Andy and his team discovered that they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars on asphalt to surround the schools themselves. And by presenting a really strong economic case, they convinced the L.A. government that replacing that asphalt with trees and other greenery, that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy than they spend on horticultural infrastructure. So ultimately, 20 million square feet of asphalt was replaced or avoided, and electrical consumption for air-conditioning went down, while employment for people to maintain those grounds went up, resulting in a net-savings to the system, but also healthier students and schools system employees as well.Now Judy Bonds is a coal miner's daughter. Her family has eight generations in a town called Whitesville, West Virginia. And if anyone should be clinging to the former glory of the coal mining history, and of the town, it should be Judy. But the way coal is mined right now is different from the deep mines that her father and her father's father would go down into and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people. Now, two dozen men can tear down a mountain in several months, and only for about a few years' worth of coal. That kind of technology is called \"mountaintop removal.\" It can make a mountain go from this to this in a few short months. Just imagine that the air surrounding these places \u2014 it's filled with the residue of explosives and coal. When we visited, it gave some of the people we were with this strange little cough after being only there for just a few hours or so \u2014 not just miners, but everybody.And Judy saw her landscape being destroyed and her water poisoned. And the coal companies just move on after the mountain was emptied, leaving even more unemployment in their wake. But she also saw the difference in potential wind energy on an intact mountain, and one that was reduced in elevation by over 2,000 feet. Three years of dirty energy with not many jobs, or centuries of clean energy with the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency based on technical skills, and developing local knowledge about how to get the most out of that region's wind. She calculated the up-front cost and the payback over time, and it's a net-plus on so many levels for the local, national and global economy. It's a longer payback than mountaintop removal, but the wind energy actually pays back forever. Now mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals, and it gives them a lot of misery. The water is turned into goo. Most people are still unemployed, leading to most of the same kinds of social problems that unemployed people in inner cities also experience \u2014 drug and alcohol abuse, domestic abuse, teen pregnancy and poor heath, as well.Now Judy and I \u2014 I have to say \u2014 totally related to each other. Not quite an obvious alliance. I mean, literally, her hometown is called Whitesville, West Virginia. I mean, they are not \u2014 they ain't competing for the birthplace of hip hop title or anything like that. But the back of my T-shirt, the one that she gave me, says, \"Save the endangered hillbillies.\" So homegirls and hillbillies we got it together and totally understand that this is what it's all about. But just a few months ago, Judy was diagnosed with stage-three lung cancer. Yeah. And it has since moved to her bones and her brain. And I just find it so bizarre that she's suffering from the same thing that she tried so hard to protect people from. But her dream of Coal River Mountain Wind is her legacy. And she might not get to see that mountaintop. But rather than writing yet some kind of manifesto or something, she's leaving behind a business plan to make it happen. That's what my homegirl is doing. So I'm so proud of that.(Applause)But these three people don't know each other, but they do have an awful lot in common. They're all problem solvers, and they're just some of the many examples that I really am privileged to see, meet and learn from in the examples of the work that I do now. I was really lucky to have them all featured on my Corporation for Public Radio radio show called ThePromisedLand.org. Now they're all very practical visionaries. They take a look at the demands that are out there \u2014 beauty products, healthy schools, electricity \u2014 and how the money's flowing to meet those demands. And when the cheapest solutions involve reducing the number of jobs, you're left with unemployed people, and those people aren't cheap. In fact, they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens, and they include generationally impoverished, traumatized vets returning from the Middle East, people coming out of jail. And for the veterans in particular, the V.A. said there's a six-fold increase in mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since 2003. I think that number's probably going to go up. They're not the largest number of people, but they are some of the most expensive \u2014 and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse, drug and alcohol abuse, poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stress. So these three guys all understand how to productively channel dollars through our local economies to meet existing market demands, reduce the social problems that we have now and prevent new problems in the future.And there are plenty of other examples like that. One problem: waste handling and unemployment. Even when we think or talk about recycling, lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills and leaving many municipalities, diversion rates \u2014 they leave much to be recycled. And where is this waste handled? Usually in poor communities. And we know that eco-industrial business, these kinds of business models \u2014 there's a model in Europe called the eco-industrial park, where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another, or you use recycled materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell. We can create these local markets and incentives for recycled materials to be used as raw materials for manufacturing. And in my hometown, we actually tried to do one of these in the Bronx, but our mayor decided what he wanted to see was a jail on that same spot. Fortunately \u2014 because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs \u2014 but after many years, the city wanted to build a jail. They've since abandoned that project, thank goodness.Another problem: unhealthy food systems and unemployment. Working-class and poor urban Americans are not benefiting economically from our current food system. It relies too much on transportation, chemical fertilization, big use of water and also refrigeration. Mega agricultural operations often are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land, and it produces this incredibly unhealthy product that costs us billions in healthcare and lost productivity. And so we know \"urban ag\" is a big buzz topic this time of the year, but it's mostly gardening, which has some value in community building \u2014 lots of it \u2014 but it's not in terms of creating jobs or for food production. The numbers just aren't there. Part of my work now is really laying the groundwork to integrate urban ag and rural food systems to hasten the demise of the 3,000-mile salad by creating a national brand of urban-grown produce in every city, that uses regional growing power and augments it with indoor growing facilities, owned and operated by small growers, where now there are only consumers. This can support seasonal farmers around metro areas who are losing out because they really can't meet the year-round demand for produce. It's not a competition with rural farm; it's actually reinforcements. It allies in a really positive and economically viable food system.The goal is to meet the cities' institutional demands for hospitals, senior centers, schools, daycare centers, and produce a network of regional jobs, as well. This is smart infrastructure. And how we manage our built environment affects the health and well-being of people every single day. Our municipalities, rural and urban, play the operational course of infrastructure \u2014 things like waste disposal, energy demand, as well as social costs of unemployment, drop-out rates, incarceration rates and the impacts of various public health costs. Smart infrastructure can provide cost-saving ways for municipalities to handle both infrastructure and social needs. And we want to shift the systems that open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens to become part of the tax base. And imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability. So I'm hoping you can see a little theme here.These examples indicate a trend. I haven't created it, and it's not happening by accident. I'm noticing that it's happening all over the country, and the good news is that it's growing. And we all need to be invested in it. It is an essential pillar to this country's recovery. And I call it \"hometown security.\" The recession has us reeling and fearful, and there's something in the air these days that is also very empowering. It's a realization that we are the key to our own recovery. Now is the time for us to act in our own communities where we think local and we act local. And when we do that, our neighbors \u2014 be they next-door, or in the next state, or in the next country \u2014 will be just fine. The sum of the local is the global. Hometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses, putting people to work, restoring our natural systems. Hometown security means creating wealth here at home, instead of destroying it overseas. Tackling social and environmental problems at the same time with the same solution yields great cost savings, wealth generation and national security. Many great and inspiring solutions have been generated across America. The challenge for us now is to identify and support countless more.Now, hometown security is about taking care of your own, but it's not like the old saying, \"charity begins at home.\" I recently read a book called \"Love Leadership\" by John Hope Bryant. And it's about leading in a world that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear. And reading that book made me reexamine that theory because I need to explain what I mean by that. See, my dad was a great, great man in many ways. He grew up in the segregated South, escaped lynching and all that during some really hard times, and he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times. But, like all of us, he had some problems. (Laughter) And his was gambling, compulsively. To him that phrase, \"Charity begins at home,\" meant that my payday \u2014 or someone else's \u2014 would just happen to coincide with his lucky day. So you need to help him out. And sometimes I would loan him money from my after-school or summer jobs, and he always had the great intention of paying me back with interest, of course, after he hit it big. And he did sometimes, believe it or not, at a racetrack in Los Angeles \u2014 one reason to love L.A. \u2014 back in the 1940s. He made 15,000 dollars cash and bought the house that I grew up in. So I'm not that unhappy about that. But listen, I did feel obligated to him, and I grew up \u2014 then I grew up. And I'm a grown woman now, and I have learned a few things along the way.To me, charity often is just about giving, because you're supposed to, or because it's what you've always done, or it's about giving until it hurts. I'm about providing the means to build something that will grow and intensify its original investment and not just require greater giving next year \u2014 I'm not trying to feed the habit. I spent some years watching how good intentions for community empowerment, that were supposed to be there to support the community and empower it, actually left people in the same, if not worse, position that they were in before. And over the past 20 years, we've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars on social problems, yet educational outcomes, malnutrition, incarceration, obesity, diabetes, income disparity, they've all gone up with some exceptions \u2014 in particular, infant mortality among people in poverty \u2014 but it's a great world that we're bringing them into as well.And I know a little bit about these issues, because, for many years, I spent a long time in the non-profit industrial complex, and I'm a recovering executive director, two years clean. (Laughter) But during that time, I realized that it was about projects and developing them on the local level that really was going to do the right thing for our communities. But I really did struggle for financial support. The greater our success, the less money came in from foundations. And I tell you, being on the TED stage and winning a MacArthur in the same exact year gave everyone the impression that I had arrived. And by the time I'd moved on, I was actually covering a third of my agency's budget deficit with speaking fees. And I think because early on, frankly, my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time. But since then, the park that was just a dump and was featured at a TED2006 Talk became this little thing. But I did in fact get married in it. Over here. There goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding. The South Bronx Greenway was also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006. Since then, we got about 50 million dollars in stimulus package money to come and get here. And we love this, because I love construction now, because we're watching these things actually happen.So I want everyone to understand the critical importance of shifting charity into enterprise. I started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people. Hometown security is next on my to-do list. What we need are people who see the value in investing in these types of local enterprises, who will partner with folks like me to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation as well as understand the growing social costs of business as usual. We need to work together to embrace and repair our land, repair our power systems and repair ourselves. It's time to stop building the shopping malls, the prisons, the stadiums and other tributes to all of our collective failures. It is time that we start building living monuments to hope and possibility.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1041, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nSo today, I'm going to tell you about some people\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nwho didn't move out of their neighborhoods.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nThe first one is happening right here in Chicago.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nBrenda Palms-Farber was hired\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nto help ex-convicts reenter society\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nand keep them from going back into prison.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nCurrently, taxpayers spend\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nabout 60,000 dollars per year\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nsending a person to jail.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nWe know that two-thirds of them are going to go back.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nI find it interesting that, for every one dollar\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nwe spend, however, on early childhood education,\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nlike Head Start,\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nwe save 17 dollars\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.958\non stuff like incarceration in the future.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nOr -- think about it -- that 60,000 dollars\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nis more than what it costs\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nto send one person to Harvard as well.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nBut Brenda, not being phased by stuff like that,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\ntook a look at her challenge\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nand came up\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nwith a not-so-obvious solution:\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\ncreate a business\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nthat produces skin care products from honey.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nOkay, it might be obvious to some of you; it wasn't to me.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nIt's the basis of growing a form of social innovation\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nthat has real potential.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nShe hired seemingly unemployable men and women\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nto care for the bees, harvest the honey\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nand make value-added products\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nthat they marketed themselves,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nand that were later sold at Whole Foods.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nShe combined employment experience and training\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nwith life skills they needed,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nlike anger-management and teamwork,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nand also how to talk to future employers\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nabout how their experiences\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nactually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nand their eagerness to learn more.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nLess than four percent\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nof the folks that went through her program\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nactually go back to jail.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nSo these young men and women learned job-readiness\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nand life skills through bee keeping\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nand became productive citizens in the process.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nTalk about a sweet beginning.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nNow, I'm going to take you to Los Angeles,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nand lots of people know\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nthat L.A. has its issues.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nBut I'm going to talk about L.A.'s water issues right now.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nThey have not enough water on most days\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nand too much to handle when it rains.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nCurrently, 20 percent\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nof California's energy consumption\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nis used to pump water\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\ninto mostly Southern California.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nTheir spending loads, loads,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nto channel that rainwater out into the ocean\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nwhen it rains and floods as well.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nNow Andy Lipkis is working to help\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nL.A. cut infrastructure costs\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nassociated with water management and urban heat island --\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nlinking trees, people and technology\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nto create a more livable city.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nAll that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nalso helps cool our cities.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nBecause, come to think about it,\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\ndo you really want air-conditioning,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nor is it a cooler room that you want?\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nHow you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nSo a few years ago,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nL.A. County\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\ndecided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nto repair the city schools.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nAnd Andy and his team discovered\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nthat they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\non asphalt to surround the schools themselves.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nAnd by presenting a really strong economic case,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nthey convinced the L.A. government\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nthat replacing that asphalt\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nwith trees and other greenery,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nthat the schools themselves would save the system more on energy\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nthan they spend on horticultural infrastructure.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nSo ultimately, 20 million square feet of asphalt\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nwas replaced or avoided,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nand electrical consumption for air-conditioning went down,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nwhile employment\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nfor people to maintain those grounds went up,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nresulting in a net-savings to the system,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nbut also healthier students and schools system employees as well.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nNow Judy Bonds\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nis a coal miner's daughter.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nHer family has eight generations\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nin a town called Whitesville, West Virginia.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nAnd if anyone should be clinging\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nto the former glory of the coal mining history,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nand of the town,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nit should be Judy.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nBut the way coal is mined right now is different\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nfrom the deep mines that her father\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nand her father's father would go down into\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nand that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nNow, two dozen men\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\ncan tear down a mountain in several months,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nand only for about a few years' worth of coal.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nThat kind of technology is called \"mountaintop removal.\"\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nIt can make a mountain go from this to this\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nin a few short months.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nJust imagine that the air surrounding these places --\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nit's filled with the residue of explosives and coal.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nWhen we visited, it gave some of the people we were with\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nthis strange little cough\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nafter being only there for just a few hours or so --\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nnot just miners, but everybody.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nAnd Judy saw her landscape being destroyed\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nand her water poisoned.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nAnd the coal companies just move on\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nafter the mountain was emptied,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nleaving even more unemployment in their wake.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nBut she also saw the difference in potential wind energy\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\non an intact mountain,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nand one that was reduced in elevation\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nby over 2,000 feet.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nThree years of dirty energy with not many jobs,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nor centuries of clean energy\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nwith the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nbased on technical skills,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nand developing local knowledge\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nabout how to get the most out of that region's wind.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nShe calculated the up-front cost\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nand the payback over time,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nand it's a net-plus on so many levels\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nfor the local, national and global economy.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nIt's a longer payback than mountaintop removal,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nbut the wind energy actually pays back forever.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nNow mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nand it gives them a lot of misery.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nThe water is turned into goo.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nMost people are still unemployed,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nleading to most of the same kinds of social problems\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nthat unemployed people in inner cities also experience --\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\ndrug and alcohol abuse,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\ndomestic abuse, teen pregnancy and poor heath, as well.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nNow Judy and I -- I have to say --\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\ntotally related to each other.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nNot quite an obvious alliance.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nI mean, literally, her hometown is called Whitesville, West Virginia.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nI mean, they are not --\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nthey ain't competing for the birthplace of hip hop title\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nor anything like that.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nBut the back of my T-shirt, the one that she gave me,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nsays, \"Save the endangered hillbillies.\"\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nSo homegirls and hillbillies we got it together\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nand totally understand that this is what it's all about.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nBut just a few months ago,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nJudy was diagnosed\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nwith stage-three lung cancer.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nYeah.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nAnd it has since moved to her bones and her brain.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nAnd I just find it so bizarre\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nthat she's suffering from the same thing\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nthat she tried so hard to protect people from.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nBut her dream\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nof Coal River Mountain Wind\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nis her legacy.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nAnd she might not\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nget to see that mountaintop.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nBut rather than writing\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nyet some kind of manifesto or something,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nshe's leaving behind\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\na business plan to make it happen.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nThat's what my homegirl is doing.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nSo I'm so proud of that.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:06.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nBut these three people\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\ndon't know each other,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nbut they do have an awful lot in common.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nThey're all problem solvers,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nand they're just some of the many examples\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nthat I really am privileged to see, meet and learn from\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nin the examples of the work that I do now.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nI was really lucky to have them all featured\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\non my Corporation for Public Radio radio show\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\ncalled ThePromisedLand.org.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nNow they're all very practical visionaries.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nThey take a look at the demands that are out there --\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nbeauty products, healthy schools, electricity --\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nand how the money's flowing to meet those demands.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nAnd when the cheapest solutions\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\ninvolve reducing the number of jobs,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nyou're left with unemployed people,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nand those people aren't cheap.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nIn fact, they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nand they include generationally impoverished,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\ntraumatized vets returning from the Middle East,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\npeople coming out of jail.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nAnd for the veterans in particular,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nthe V.A. said there's a six-fold increase\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nin mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since 2003.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nI think that number's probably going to go up.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nThey're not the largest number of people,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nbut they are some of the most expensive --\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nand in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse, drug and alcohol abuse,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\npoor performance by their kids in schools\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nand also poor health as a result of stress.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nSo these three guys all understand\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nhow to productively channel dollars\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nthrough our local economies\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nto meet existing market demands,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nreduce the social problems that we have now\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nand prevent new problems in the future.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nAnd there are plenty of other examples like that.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nOne problem: waste handling and unemployment.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nEven when we think or talk about recycling,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nlots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand leaving many municipalities, diversion rates --\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nthey leave much to be recycled.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nAnd where is this waste handled? Usually in poor communities.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nAnd we know that eco-industrial business, these kinds of business models --\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nthere's a model in Europe called the eco-industrial park,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nwhere either the waste of one company is the raw material for another,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nor you use recycled materials\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nto make goods that you can actually use and sell.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nWe can create these local markets and incentives\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nfor recycled materials\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nto be used as raw materials for manufacturing.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nAnd in my hometown, we actually tried to do one of these in the Bronx,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nbut our mayor decided what he wanted to see\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nwas a jail on that same spot.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nFortunately -- because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs --\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nbut after many years,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nthe city wanted to build a jail.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nThey've since abandoned that project, thank goodness.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nAnother problem: unhealthy food systems and unemployment.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nWorking-class and poor urban Americans\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nare not benefiting economically\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nfrom our current food system.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nIt relies too much on transportation,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nchemical fertilization, big use of water\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nand also refrigeration.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nMega agricultural operations\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\noften are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nand it produces this incredibly unhealthy product\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nthat costs us billions in healthcare\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nand lost productivity.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nAnd so we know \"urban ag\"\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nis a big buzz topic this time of the year,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nbut it's mostly gardening,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nwhich has some value in community building -- lots of it --\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nbut it's not in terms of creating jobs\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nor for food production.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nThe numbers just aren't there.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nPart of my work now is really laying the groundwork\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nto integrate urban ag and rural food systems\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nto hasten the demise of the 3,000-mile salad\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nby creating a national brand of urban-grown produce\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nin every city,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nthat uses regional growing power\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nand augments it with indoor growing facilities,\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nowned and operated by small growers,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nwhere now there are only consumers.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nThis can support seasonal farmers around metro areas\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nwho are losing out because they really can't meet\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nthe year-round demand for produce.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nIt's not a competition with rural farm;\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nit's actually reinforcements.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nIt allies in a really positive\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nand economically viable food system.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nThe goal is to meet the cities' institutional demands\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nfor hospitals,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nsenior centers, schools, daycare centers,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nand produce a network of regional jobs, as well.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nThis is smart infrastructure.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nAnd how we manage our built environment\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\naffects the health and well-being of people every single day.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nOur municipalities, rural and urban,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nplay the operational course of infrastructure --\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nthings like waste disposal, energy demand,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nas well as social costs of unemployment, drop-out rates, incarceration rates\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nand the impacts of various public health costs.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nSmart infrastructure can provide cost-saving ways\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nfor municipalities to handle\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nboth infrastructure and social needs.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nAnd we want to shift the systems\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nthat open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nto become part of the tax base.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nAnd imagine a national business model\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nthat creates local jobs and smart infrastructure\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nto improve local economic stability.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nSo I'm hoping you can see a little theme here.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nThese examples indicate a trend.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nI haven't created it, and it's not happening by accident.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nI'm noticing that it's happening all over the country,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nand the good news is that it's growing.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nAnd we all need to be invested in it.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nIt is an essential pillar to this country's recovery.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nAnd I call it \"hometown security.\"\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nThe recession has us reeling and fearful,\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nand there's something in the air these days\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nthat is also very empowering.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nIt's a realization\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nthat we are the key\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nto our own recovery.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nNow is the time for us to act in our own communities\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nwhere we think local and we act local.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nAnd when we do that, our neighbors --\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nbe they next-door, or in the next state,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nor in the next country --\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nwill be just fine.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nThe sum of the local is the global.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nHometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nputting people to work,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nrestoring our natural systems.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nHometown security means creating wealth here at home,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\ninstead of destroying it overseas.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nTackling social and environmental problems\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nat the same time with the same solution\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nyields great cost savings,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nwealth generation and national security.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nMany great and inspiring solutions\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nhave been generated across America.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nThe challenge for us now\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nis to identify and support countless more.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nNow, hometown security is about taking care of your own,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nbut it's not like the old saying,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\n\"charity begins at home.\"\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nI recently read a book called \"Love Leadership\" by John Hope Bryant.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nAnd it's about leading in a world\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nthat really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nAnd reading that book made me reexamine that theory\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nbecause I need to explain what I mean by that.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nSee, my dad\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nwas a great, great man in many ways.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nHe grew up in the segregated South,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nescaped lynching and all that\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nduring some really hard times,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nand he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nand a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nBut, like all of us, he had some problems.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nAnd his was gambling,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\ncompulsively.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nTo him that phrase, \"Charity begins at home,\"\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nmeant that my payday -- or someone else's --\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nwould just happen to coincide with his lucky day.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nSo you need to help him out.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nAnd sometimes I would loan him money\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nfrom my after-school or summer jobs,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nand he always had the great intention\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nof paying me back with interest,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nof course, after he hit it big.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nAnd he did sometimes, believe it or not,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nat a racetrack in Los Angeles --\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\none reason to love L.A. -- back in the 1940s.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nHe made 15,000 dollars cash\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nand bought the house that I grew up in.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nSo I'm not that unhappy about that.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nBut listen, I did feel obligated to him,\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nand I grew up -- then I grew up.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd I'm a grown woman now,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nand I have learned a few things along the way.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nTo me, charity\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\noften is just about giving,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nbecause you're supposed to,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nor because it's what you've always done,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nor it's about giving until it hurts.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nI'm about providing the means\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nto build something that will grow\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nand intensify its original investment\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nand not just require greater giving next year --\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nI'm not trying to feed the habit.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nI spent some years\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nwatching how good intentions for community empowerment,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nthat were supposed to be there\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nto support the community and empower it,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nactually left people\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nin the same, if not worse, position that they were in before.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nAnd over the past 20 years,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nwe've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\non social problems,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nyet educational outcomes,\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nmalnutrition, incarceration,\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nobesity, diabetes, income disparity,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nthey've all gone up with some exceptions --\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nin particular, infant mortality\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\namong people in poverty --\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nbut it's a great world that we're bringing them into as well.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nAnd I know a little bit about these issues,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nbecause, for many years, I spent a long time\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nin the non-profit industrial complex,\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nand I'm a recovering executive director,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\ntwo years clean.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nBut during that time, I realized that it was about projects\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nand developing them on the local level\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nthat really was going to do the right thing for our communities.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nBut I really did struggle for financial support.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nThe greater our success,\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nthe less money came in from foundations.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nAnd I tell you, being on the TED stage\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nand winning a MacArthur in the same exact year\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\ngave everyone the impression that I had arrived.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nAnd by the time I'd moved on,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nI was actually covering a third\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nof my agency's budget deficit with speaking fees.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nAnd I think because early on, frankly,\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nmy programs were just a little bit ahead of their time.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nBut since then,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nthe park that was just a dump and was featured at a TED2006 Talk\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nbecame this little thing.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nBut I did in fact get married in it.\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nOver here.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nThere goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nThe South Bronx Greenway\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nwas also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nSince then, we got\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nabout 50 million dollars in stimulus package money\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nto come and get here.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nAnd we love this, because I love construction now,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nbecause we're watching these things actually happen.\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nSo I want everyone to understand\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nthe critical importance\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nof shifting charity into enterprise.\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nI started my firm to help communities across the country\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nrealize their own potential\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nto improve everything about the quality of life for their people.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nHometown security\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nis next on my to-do list.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nWhat we need are people who see the value\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nin investing in these types of local enterprises,\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nwho will partner with folks like me\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nto identify the growth trends and climate adaptation\n\n00:17:18.958

"https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability", "transcript": "So, I'll start with this: a couple years ago, an event planner called me because I was going to do a speaking event. And she called, and she said, \"I'm really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer.\" And I thought, \"Well, what's the struggle?\" And she said, \"Well, I saw you speak, and I'm going to call you a researcher, I think, but I'm afraid if I call you a researcher, no one will come, because they'll think you're boring and irrelevant.\"(Laughter)And I was like, \"Okay.\" And she said, \"But the thing I liked about your talk is you're a storyteller. So I think what I'll do is just call you a storyteller.\" And of course, the academic, insecure part of me was like, \"You're going to call me a what?\" And she said, \"I'm going to call you a storyteller.\" And I was like, \"Why not 'magic pixie'?\"(Laughter)I was like, \"Let me think about this for a second.\" I tried to call deep on my courage. And I thought, you know, I am a storyteller. I'm a qualitative researcher. I collect stories; that's what I do. And maybe stories are just data with a soul. And maybe I'm just a storyteller. And so I said, \"You know what? Why don't you just say I'm a researcher-storyteller.\" And she went, \"Ha ha. There's no such thing.\"(Laughter)So I'm a researcher-storyteller, and I'm going to talk to you today \u2014 we're talking about expanding perception \u2014 and so I want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that I live and love and work and parent.And this is where my story starts. When I was a young researcher, doctoral student, my first year, I had a research professor who said to us, \"Here's the thing, if you cannot measure it, it does not exist.\" And I thought he was just sweet-talking me. I was like, \"Really?\" and he was like, \"Absolutely.\" And so you have to understand that I have a bachelor's and a master's in social work, and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work, so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the \"life's messy, love it.\" And I'm more of the, \"life's messy, clean it up, organize it and put it into a bento box.\"(Laughter)And so to think that I had found my way, to found a career that takes me \u2014 really, one of the big sayings in social work is, \"Lean into the discomfort of the work.\" And I'm like, knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all A's. That was my mantra. So I was very excited about this. And so I thought, you know what, this is the career for me, because I am interested in some messy topics. But I want to be able to make them not messy. I want to understand them. I want to hack into these things that I know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see.So where I started was with connection. Because, by the time you're a social worker for 10 years, what you realize is that connection is why we're here. It's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives. This is what it's all about. It doesn't matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice, mental health and abuse and neglect, what we know is that connection, the ability to feel connected, is \u2014 neurobiologically that's how we're wired \u2014 it's why we're here.So I thought, you know what, I'm going to start with connection. Well, you know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss, and she tells you 37 things that you do really awesome, and one \"opportunity for growth?\"(Laughter)And all you can think about is that opportunity for growth, right? Well, apparently this is the way my work went as well, because, when you ask people about love, they tell you about heartbreak. When you ask people about belonging, they'll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded. And when you ask people about connection, the stories they told me were about disconnection.So very quickly \u2014 really about six weeks into this research \u2014 I ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that I didn't understand or had never seen. And so I pulled back out of the research and thought, I need to figure out what this is. And it turned out to be shame. And shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection: Is there something about me that, if other people know it or see it, that I won't be worthy of connection?The things I can tell you about it: It's universal; we all have it. The only people who don't experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection. No one wants to talk about it, and the less you talk about it, the more you have it. What underpinned this shame, this \"I'm not good enough,\" \u2014 which, we all know that feeling: \"I'm not blank enough. I'm not thin enough, rich enough, beautiful enough, smart enough, promoted enough.\" The thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability. This idea of, in order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be seen, really seen.And you know how I feel about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability. And so I thought, this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick. I'm going in, I'm going to figure this stuff out, I'm going to spend a year, I'm going to totally deconstruct shame, I'm going to understand how vulnerability works, and I'm going to outsmart it. So I was ready, and I was really excited. As you know, it's not going to turn out well.(Laughter)You know this. So, I could tell you a lot about shame, but I'd have to borrow everyone else's time. But here's what I can tell you that it boils down to \u2014 and this may be one of the most important things that I've ever learned in the decade of doing this research.My one year turned into six years: Thousands of stories, hundreds of long interviews, focus groups. At one point, people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories \u2014 thousands of pieces of data in six years. And I kind of got a handle on it. I kind of understood, this is what shame is, this is how it works. I wrote a book, I published a theory, but something was not okay \u2014 and what it was is that, if I roughly took the people I interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness \u2014 that's what this comes down to, a sense of worthiness \u2014 they have a strong sense of love and belonging \u2014 and folks who struggle for it, and folks who are always wondering if they're good enough.There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it. And that was, the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they're worthy of love and belonging. That's it. They believe they're worthy. And to me, the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we're not worthy of connection, was something that, personally and professionally, I felt like I needed to understand better. So what I did is I took all of the interviews where I saw worthiness, where I saw people living that way, and just looked at those.What do these people have in common? I have a slight office supply addiction, but that's another talk. So I had a manila folder, and I had a Sharpie, and I was like, what am I going to call this research? And the first words that came to my mind were \"whole-hearted.\" These are whole-hearted people, living from this deep sense of worthiness. So I wrote at the top of the manila folder, and I started looking at the data. In fact, I did it first in a four-day, very intensive data analysis, where I went back, pulled the interviews, the stories, pulled the incidents. What's the theme? What's the pattern? My husband left town with the kids because I always go into this Jackson Pollock crazy thing, where I'm just writing and in my researcher mode.And so here's what I found. What they had in common was a sense of courage. And I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute. Courage, the original definition of courage, when it first came into the English language \u2014 it's from the Latin word \"cor,\" meaning \"heart\" \u2014 and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart. And so these folks had, very simply, the courage to be imperfect. They had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others, because, as it turns out, we can't practice compassion with other people if we can't treat ourselves kindly. And the last was they had connection, and \u2014 this was the hard part \u2014 as a result of authenticity, they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were, which you have to absolutely do that for connection.The other thing that they had in common was this: They fully embraced vulnerability. They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful. They didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable, nor did they really talk about it being excruciating \u2014 as I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing. They just talked about it being necessary. They talked about the willingness to say, \"I love you\" first ... the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees ... the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram. They're willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out. They thought this was fundamental.I personally thought it was betrayal. I could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research, where our job \u2014 you know, the definition of research is to control and predict, to study phenomena for the explicit reason to control and predict. And now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting. This led to a little breakdown \u2014(Laughter)\u2014 which actually looked more like this.(Laughter)And it did.I call it a breakdown; my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening.(Laughter)A spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown, but I assure you, it was a breakdown. And I had to put my data away and go find a therapist. Let me tell you something: you know who you are when you call your friends and say, \"I think I need to see somebody. Do you have any recommendations?\" Because about five of my friends were like, \"Wooo, I wouldn't want to be your therapist.\"(Laughter)I was like, \"What does that mean?\" And they're like, \"I'm just saying, you know. Don't bring your measuring stick.\"(Laughter)I was like, \"Okay.\" So I found a therapist. My first meeting with her, Diana \u2014 I brought in my list of the way the whole-hearted live, and I sat down. And she said, \"How are you?\" And I said, \"I'm great. I'm okay.\" She said, \"What's going on?\" And this is a therapist who sees therapists, because we have to go to those, because their B.S. meters are good.(Laughter)And so I said, \"Here's the thing, I'm struggling.\" And she said, \"What's the struggle?\" And I said, \"Well, I have a vulnerability issue. And I know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness, but it appears that it's also the birthplace of joy, of creativity, of belonging, of love. And I think I have a problem, and I need some help.\" And I said, \"But here's the thing: no family stuff, no childhood shit.\"(Laughter)\"I just need some strategies.\"(Laughter)(Applause)Thank you. So she goes like this.(Laughter)And then I said, \"It's bad, right?\" And she said, \"It's neither good nor bad.\"(Laughter)\"It just is what it is.\" And I said, \"Oh my God, this is going to suck.\"(Laughter)And it did, and it didn't. And it took about a year. And you know how there are people that, when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important, that they surrender and walk into it. A: that's not me, and B: I don't even hang out with people like that.(Laughter)For me, it was a yearlong street fight. It was a slugfest. Vulnerability pushed, I pushed back. I lost the fight, but probably won my life back.And so then I went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they, the whole-hearted, what choices they were making, and what we are doing with vulnerability. Why do we struggle with it so much? Am I alone in struggling with vulnerability? No.So this is what I learned. We numb vulnerability \u2014 when we're waiting for the call. It was funny, I sent something out on Twitter and on Facebook that says, \"How would you define vulnerability? What makes you feel vulnerable?\" And within an hour and a half, I had 150 responses. Because I wanted to know what's out there. Having to ask my husband for help because I'm sick, and we're newly married; initiating sex with my husband; initiating sex with my wife; being turned down; asking someone out; waiting for the doctor to call back; getting laid off; laying off people. This is the world we live in. We live in a vulnerable world. And one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability.And I think there's evidence \u2014 and it's not the only reason this evidence exists, but I think it's a huge cause \u2014 We are the most in-debt ... obese ... addicted and medicated adult cohort in U.S. history. The problem is \u2014 and I learned this from the research \u2014 that you cannot selectively numb emotion. You can't say, here's the bad stuff. Here's vulnerability, here's grief, here's shame, here's fear, here's disappointment. I don't want to feel these. I'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin.(Laughter)I don't want to feel these. And I know that's knowing laughter. I hack into your lives for a living. God.(Laughter)You can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects, our emotions. You cannot selectively numb. So when we numb those, we numb joy, we numb gratitude, we numb happiness. And then, we are miserable, and we are looking for purpose and meaning, and then we feel vulnerable, so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. And it becomes this dangerous cycle.One of the things that I think we need to think about is why and how we numb. And it doesn't just have to be addiction. The other thing we do is we make everything that's uncertain certain. Religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty. \"I'm right, you're wrong. Shut up.\" That's it. Just certain. The more afraid we are, the more vulnerable we are, the more afraid we are. This is what politics looks like today. There's no discourse anymore. There's no conversation. There's just blame. You know how blame is described in the research? A way to discharge pain and discomfort. We perfect. If there's anyone who wants their life to look like this, it would be me, but it doesn't work. Because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks.(Laughter)Which just, I hope in 100 years, people will look back and go, \"Wow.\"(Laughter)And we perfect, most dangerously, our children. Let me tell you what we think about children. They're hardwired for struggle when they get here. And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand, our job is not to say, \"Look at her, she's perfect. My job is just to keep her perfect \u2014 make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh.\" That's not our job. Our job is to look and say, \"You know what? You're imperfect, and you're wired for struggle, but you are worthy of love and belonging.\" That's our job. Show me a generation of kids raised like that, and we'll end the problems, I think, that we see today. We pretend that what we do doesn't have an effect on people. We do that in our personal lives. We do that corporate \u2014 whether it's a bailout, an oil spill ... a recall. We pretend like what we're doing doesn't have a huge impact on other people. I would say to companies, this is not our first rodeo, people. We just need you to be authentic and real and say ... \"We're sorry. We'll fix it.\"But there's another way, and I'll leave you with this. This is what I have found: To let ourselves be seen, deeply seen, vulnerably seen ... to love with our whole hearts, even though there's no guarantee \u2014 and that's really hard, and I can tell you as a parent, that's excruciatingly difficult \u2014 to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror, when we're wondering, \"Can I love you this much? Can I believe in this this passionately? Can I be this fierce about this?\" just to be able to stop and, instead of catastrophizing what might happen, to say, \"I'm just so grateful, because to feel this vulnerable means I'm alive.\" And the last, which I think is probably the most important, is to believe that we're enough. Because when we work from a place, I believe, that says, \"I'm enough\" ... then we stop screaming and start listening, we're kinder and gentler to the people around us, and we're kinder and gentler to ourselves.That's all I have. Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1042, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.558 --> 00:00:17.019\nSo, I'll start with this: a couple\nyears ago, an event

parent.\n\n00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:48.923\nAnd this is where my story starts.\n\n00:01:49.688 --> 00:01:52.371\nWhen I was a young researcher,\ndoctoral student,\n\n00:01:52.395 --> 00:01:56.372\nmy first year, I had\na research professor who said to us,\n\n00:01:56.396 --> 00:02:00.342\n\"Here's the thing, if you cannot\nmeasure it, it does not exist.\"\n\n00:02:02.072 --> 00:02:04.664\nAnd I thought he was just\nsweet-talking me.\n\n00:02:05.037 --> 00:02:07.474\nI was like, \"Really?\"\nand he was like, \"Absolutely.\"\n\n00:02:07.498 --> 00:02:09.751\nAnd so you have to understand\n\n00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:12.355\nthat I have a bachelor's\nand a master's in social work,\n\n00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.753\nand I was getting my Ph.D. in social work,\nso my entire academic career\n\n00:02:15.777 --> 00:02:21.394\nwas surrounded by people who kind of\nbelieved in the \"life's messy, love it.\"\n\n00:02:22.172 --> 00:02:27.600\nAnd I'm more of the, \"life's messy,\nclean it up, organize it\n\n00:02:27.624 --> 00:02:29.401\nand put it into a bento box.\"\n\n00:02:29.425 --> 00:02:31.401\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:37.029\nAnd so to think that I had found my way,\nto found a career that takes me --\n\n00:02:37.053 --> 00:02:40.386\nreally, one of the big sayings\nin social work is,\n\n00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.505\n\"Lean into the discomfort of the work.\"\n\n00:02:43.235 --> 00:02:45.767\nAnd I'm like, knock discomfort\nupside the head\n\n00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:48.069\nand move it over and get all A's.\n\n00:02:48.093 --> 00:02:50.005\nThat was my mantra.\n\n00:02:51.688 --> 00:02:53.664\nSo I was very excited about this.\n\n00:02:53.688 --> 00:02:56.664\nAnd so I thought, you know what,\nthis is the career for me,\n\n00:02:56.688 --> 00:02:59.664\nbecause I am interested\nin some messy topics.\n\n00:02:59.688 --> 00:03:02.059\nBut I want to be able\nto make them not messy.\n\n00:03:02.083 --> 00:03:03.405\nI want to understand them.\n\n00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:07.006\nI want to hack into these things\nthat I know are important\n\n00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.006\nand lay the code out for everyone to see.\n\n00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:12.347\nSo where I started was with connection.\n\n00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:15.783\nBecause, by the time\nyou're a social worker for 10 years,\n\n00:03:15.807 --> 00:03:20.514\nwhat you realize is that connection\nis why we're here.\n\n00:03:20.538 --> 00:03:22.918\nIt's what gives purpose\nand meaning to our lives.\n\n00:03:23.774 --> 00:03:25.560\nThis is what it's all about.\n\n00:03:25.584 --> 00:03:27.681\nIt doesn't matter whether\nyou talk to people\n\n00:03:27.705 --> 00:03:30.797\nwho work in social justice,\nmental health and abuse and neglect,\n\n00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:36.162\nwhat we know is that connection,\nthe ability to feel connected, is --\n\n00:03:36.646 --> 00:03:38.664\nneurobiologically\nthat's how we're wired --\n\n00:03:38.688 --> 00:03:40.067\nit's why we're here.\n\n00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:43.104\nSo I thought, you know what,\nI'm going to start with connection.\n\n00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:45.662\nWell, you know that situation\n\n00:03:45.686 --> 00:03:48.194\nwhere you get an evaluation\nfrom your boss,\n\n00:03:48.218 --> 00:03:51.004\nand she tells you 37 things\nthat you do really awesome,\n\n00:03:51.028 --> 00:03:53.402\nand one \"opportunity for growth?\"\n\n00:03:53.426 --> 00:03:55.235\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:55.894 --> 00:03:59.362\nAnd all you can think about\nis that opportunity for growth, right?\n\n00:03:59.386 --> 00:04:02.084\nWell, apparently this is the way\nmy work went as well,\n\n00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:07.085\nbecause, when you ask people about love,\nthey tell you about heartbreak.\n\n00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.743\nWhen you ask people about belonging,\n\n00:04:09.767 --> 00:04:13.719\nthey'll tell you their most excruciating\nexperiences of being excluded.\n\n00:04:13.743 --> 00:04:16.244\nAnd when you ask people about connection,\n\n00:04:16.268 --> 00:04:18.806\nthe stories they told me\nwere about disconnection.\n\n00:04:19.816 --> 00:04:22.841\nSo very quickly -- really about six weeks\ninto this research --\n\n00:04:22.865 --> 00:04:28.887\nI ran into this unnamed thing\nthat absolutely unraveled connection\n\n00:04:28.911 --> 00:04:31.371\nin a way that I didn't understand\nor had never seen.\n\n00:04:31.807 --> 00:04:33.784\nAnd so I pulled back out of the research\n\n00:04:33.808 --> 00:04:36.038\nand thought, I need\nto figure out what this is.\n\n00:04:36.062 --> 00:04:38.241\nAnd it turned out to be shame.\n\n00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.188\nAnd shame is really easily understood\nas the fear of disconnection:\n\n00:04:43.911 --> 00:04:48.467\nIs there something about me that,\nif other people know it or see it,\n\n00:04:48.491 --> 00:04:51.657\nthat I won't be worthy of connection?\n\n00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:53.973\nThe things I can tell you about it:\n\n00:04:53.997 --> 00:04:55.664\nIt's universal; we all have it.\n\n00:04:55.688 --> 00:04:57.688\nThe only people who don't experience shame\n\n00:04:57.712 --> 00:05:00.046\nhave no capacity for human\nempathy or connection.\n\n00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.664\nNo one wants to talk about it,\n\n00:05:01.688 --> 00:05:04.259\nand the less you talk about it,\nthe more you have it.\n\n00:05:05.703 --> 00:05:10.869\nWhat underpinned this shame,\nthis \"I'm not good enough,\" --\n\n00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:12.497\nwhich, we all know that feeling:\n\n00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:14.570\n\"I'm not blank enough.\nI'm not thin enough,\n\n00:05:14.594 --> 00:05:17.848\nrich enough, beautiful enough,\nsmart enough, promoted enough.\"\n\n00:05:17.872 --> 00:05:22.848\nThe thing that underpinned this\nwas excruciating vulnerability.\n\n00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.664\nThis idea of, in order\nfor connection to happen,\n\n00:05:27.688 --> 00:05:31.434\nwe have to allow ourselves\nto be seen, really seen.\n\n00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.957\nAnd you know how I feel\nabout vulnerability. I hate vulnerability.\n\n00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:40.479\nAnd so I thought, this is my chance\nto beat it back with my measuring stick.\n\n00:05:40.503 --> 00:05:43.194\nI'm going in, I'm going\nto figure this stuff out,\n\n00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:46.528\nI'm going to spend a year,\nI'm going to totally deconstruct shame,\n\n00:05:46.552 --> 00:05:48.830\nI'm going to understand\nhow vulnerability works,\n\n00:05:48.854 --> 00:05:50.289\nand I'm going to outsmart it.\n\n00:05:51.338 --> 00:05:53.608\nSo I was ready, and I was really excited.\n\n00:05:56.937 --> 00:05:59.080\nAs you know,\nit's not going to turn out well.\n\n00:05:59.104 --> 00:06:01.617\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:03.235\nYou know this.\n\n00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:05.148\nSo, I could tell you a lot about shame,\n\n00:06:05.172 --> 00:06:07.269\nbut I'd have to borrow\neveryone else's time.\n\n00:06:07.293 --> 00:06:10.150\nBut here's what I can tell you\nthat it boils down to --\n\n00:06:10.174 --> 00:06:13.556\nand this may be one of the most important\nthings that I've ever learned\n\n00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.444\nin the decade of doing this research.\n\n00:06:16.766 --> 00:06:20.958\nMy one year turned into six years:\n\n00:06:20.982 --> 00:06:25.664\nThousands of stories, hundreds\nof long interviews, focus groups.\n\n00:06:25.688 --> 00:06:28.069\nAt one point, people were\nsending me journal pages\n\n00:06:28.093 --> 00:06:29.930\nand sending me their stories --\n\n00:06:29.954 --> 00:06:33.946\nthousands of pieces of data in six years.\n\n00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.664\nAnd I kind of got a handle on it.\n\n00:06:35.688 --> 00:06:38.787\nI kind of understood, this is\nwhat shame is, this is how it works.\n\n00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:46.397\nI wrote a book, I published a theory,\nbut something was not okay --\n\n00:06:46.421 --> 00:06:50.577\nand what it was is that, if I roughly\ntook the people I interviewed\n\n00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:57.173\nand divided them into people who really\nhave a sense of worthiness --\n\n00:06:57.197 --> 00:06:59.959\nthat's what this comes down to,\na sense of worthiness --\n\n00:06:59.983 --> 00:07:03.205\nthey have a strong sense\nof love and belonging --\n\n00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:04.880\nand folks who struggle for it,\n\n00:07:04.904 --> 00:07:08.004\nand folks who are always wondering\nif they're good enough.\n\n00:07:08.028 --> 00:07:10.267\nThere was only one variable that separated\n\n00:07:10.291 --> 00:07:13.031\nthe people who have a strong sense\nof love and belonging\n\n00:07:13.055 --> 00:07:15.314\nand the people who really struggle for it.\n\n00:07:15.338 --> 00:07:19.056\nAnd that was, the people who have\na strong sense of love and belonging\n\n00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.484\nbelieve they're worthy\nof love and belonging.\n\n00:07:22.402 --> 00:07:23.552\nThat's it.\n\n00:07:24.203 --> 00:07:25.691\nThey believe they're worthy.\n\n00:07:27.434 --> 00:07:33.252\nAnd to me, the hard part of the one thing\nthat keeps us out of connection\n\n00:07:33.276 --> 00:07:36.491\nis our fear that we're not\nworthy of connection,\n\n00:07:36.515 --> 00:07:38.918\nwas something that,\npersonally and professionally,\n\n00:07:38.942 --> 00:07:41.164\nI felt like I needed to understand better.\n\n00:07:41.505 --> 00:07:46.482\nSo what I did is I took\nall of the interviews\n\n00:07:46.506 --> 00:07:49.324\nwhere I saw worthiness,\nwhere I saw people living that way,\n\n00:07:49.348 --> 00:07:51.236\nand just looked at those.\n\n00:07:52.012 --> 00:07:54.060\nWhat do these people have in common?\n\n00:07:54.084 --> 00:07:58.727\nI have a slight office supply addiction,\nbut that's another talk.\n\n00:07:58.751 --> 00:08:02.228\nSo I had a manila folder,\nand I had a Sharpie,\n\n00:08:02.252 --> 00:08:04.872\nand I was like, what am I going\nto call this research?\n\n00:08:04.896 --> 00:08:07.886\nAnd the first words that came\nto my mind were \"whole-hearted.\"\n\n00:08:08.505 --> 00:08:12.021\nThese are whole-hearted people,\nliving from this deep sense of worthiness.\n\n00:08:12.045 --> 00:08:14.901\nSo I wrote at the top\nof the manila folder,\n\n00:08:14.925 --> 00:08:16.854\nand I started looking at the data.\n\n00:08:16.878 --> 00:08:22.871\nIn fact, I did it first in a four-day,\nvery intensive data analysis,\n\n00:08:22.895 --> 00:08:26.472\nwhere I went back, pulled the interviews,\nthe stories, pulled the incidents.\n\n00:08:26.496 --> 00:08:28.275\nWhat's the theme? What's the pattern?\n\n00:08:29.068 --> 00:08:32.045\nMy husband left town with the kids\n\n00:08:32.069 --> 00:08:35.046\nbecause I always go into this\nJackson Pollock crazy thing,\n\n00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.815\nwhere I'm just writing\nand in my researcher mode.\n\n00:08:40.323 --> 00:08:41.870\nAnd so here's what I found.\n\n00:08:44.812 --> 00:08:47.664\nWhat they had in common\nwas a sense of courage.\n\n00:08:48.322 --> 00:08:51.419\nAnd I want to separate courage\nand bravery for you for a minute.\n\n00:08:51.443 --> 00:08:53.884\nCourage, the original\ndefinition of courage,\n\n00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:56.147\nwhen it first came\ninto the English language --\n\n00:08:56.171 --> 00:08:58.524\nit's from the Latin word \"cor,\"\nmeaning \"heart\" --\n\n00:08:58.548 --> 00:09:01.559\nand the original definition was to tell\nthe story of who you are\n\n00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:02.997\nwith your whole heart.\n\n00:09:03.757 --> 00:09:07.931\nAnd so these folks had, very simply,\nthe courage to be imperfect.\n\n00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:15.307\nThey had the compassion to be kind\nto themselves first and then to others,\n\n00:09:15.331 --> 00:09:16.530\nbecause, as it turns out,\n\n00:09:16.554 --> 00:09:18.788\nwe can't practice compassion\nwith other people\n\n00:09:18.812 --> 00:09:20.555\nif we can't treat ourselves kindly.\n\n00:09:20.957 --> 00:09:25.354\nAnd the last was they had connection,\nand -- this was the hard part --\n\n00:09:25.378 --> 00:09:28.355\nas a result of authenticity,\n\n00:09:28.379 --> 00:09:31.664\nthey were willing to let go\nof who they thought they should be\n\n00:09:31.688 --> 00:09:36.292\nin order to be who they were,\nwhich you have to absolutely do that\n\n00:09:36.316 --> 00:09:37.489\nfor connection.\n\n00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:44.021\nThe other thing that they had\nin common was this:\n\n00:09:47.608 --> 00:09:50.688\nThey fully embraced vulnerability.\n\n00:09:52.377 --> 00:09:59.028\nThey believed that what made them\nvulnerable made them beautiful.\n\n00:10:02.839 --> 00:10:06.664\nThey didn't talk about vulnerability\nbeing comfortable,\n\n00:10:06.688 --> 00:10:09.514\nnor did they really talk\nabout it being excruciating --\n\n00:10:09.538 --> 00:10:12.016\nas I had heard it earlier\nin the shame interviewing.\n\n00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.270\nThey just talked about it being necessary.\n\n00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:19.307\nThey talked about the willingness\nto say, \"I love you\" first ...\n\n00:10:21.076 --> 00:10:26.449\nthe willingness to do something\nwhere there are no guarantees ...\n\n00:10:27.981 --> 00:10:32.316\nthe willingness to breathe\nthrough waiting for the doctor to call\n\n00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.623\nafter your mammogram.\n\n00:10:35.329 --> 00:10:38.594\nThey're willing to invest\nin a relationship\n\n00:10:38.618 --> 00:10:40.068\nthat may or may not work out.\n\n00:10:41.163 --> 00:10:43.033\nThey thought this was fundamental.\n\n00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.759\nI personally thought it was betrayal.\n\n00:10:47.545 --> 00:10:52.141\nI could not believe I had pledged\nallegiance to research, where our job --\n\n00:10:52.165 --> 00:10:56.229\nyou know, the definition of research\nis to control and predict,\n\n00:10:56.253 --> 00:11:00.896\nto study phenomena for the explicit\nreason to control and predict.\n\n00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.286\nAnd now my mission to control and predict\n\n00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.879\nhad turned up the answer\nthat the way to live is with vulnerability\n\n00:11:08.903 --> 00:11:11.001\nand to stop controlling and predicting.\n\n00:11:11.025 --> 00:11:12.802\nThis led to a little breakdown --\n\n00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.664\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:18.688 --> 00:11:21.664\n-- which actually looked more like this.\n\n00:11:21.688 --> 00:11:23.181\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:23.205 --> 00:11:25.182\nAnd it did.\n\n00:11:25.206 --> 00:11:28.386\nI call it a breakdown;

The second thing I want to do is introduce my co-author and dear friend and co-teacher. Ken and I have been working together for almost 40 years. That's Ken Sharpe over there.(Applause)So there is among many people \u2014 certainly me and most of the people I talk to \u2014 a kind of collective dissatisfaction with the way things are working, with the way our institutions run. Our kids' teachers seem to be failing them. Our doctors don't know who the hell we are, and they don't have enough time for us. We certainly can't trust the bankers, and we certainly can't trust the brokers. They almost brought the entire financial system down. And even as we do our own work, all too often, we find ourselves having to choose between doing what we think is the right thing and doing the expected thing, or the required thing, or the profitable thing. So everywhere we look, pretty much across the board, we worry that the people we depend on don't really have our interests at heart. Or if they do have our interests at heart, we worry that they don't know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to secure those interests. They don't understand us. They don't have the time to get to know us.There are two kinds of responses that we make to this sort of general dissatisfaction. If things aren't going right, the first response is: let's make more rules, let's set up a set of detailed procedures to make sure that people will do the right thing. Give teachers scripts to follow in the classroom, so even if they don't know what they're doing and don't care about the welfare of our kids, as long as they follow the scripts, our kids will get educated. Give judges a list of mandatory sentences to impose for crimes, so that you don't need to rely on judges using their judgment. Instead, all they have to do is look up on the list what kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime. Impose limits on what credit card companies can charge in interest and on what they can charge in fees. More and more rules to protect us against an indifferent, uncaring set of institutions we have to deal with.Or \u2014 or maybe and \u2014 in addition to rules, let's see if we can come up with some really clever incentives so that, even if the people we deal with don't particularly want to serve our interests, it is in their interest to serve our interest \u2014 the magic incentives that will get people to do the right thing even out of pure selfishness. So we offer teachers bonuses if the kids they teach score passing grades on these big test scores that are used to evaluate the quality of school systems.Rules and incentives \u2014 \"sticks\" and \"carrots.\" We passed a bunch of rules to regulate the financial industry in response to the recent collapse. There's the Dodd-Frank Act, there's the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency that is temporarily being headed through the backdoor by Elizabeth Warren. Maybe these rules will actually improve the way these financial services companies behave. We'll see. In addition, we are struggling to find some way to create incentives for people in the financial services industry that will have them more interested in serving the long-term interests even of their own companies, rather than securing short-term profits. So if we find just the right incentives, they'll do the right thing \u2014 as I said \u2014 selfishly, and if we come up with the right rules and regulations, they won't drive us all over a cliff. And Ken [Sharpe] and I certainly know that you need to reign in the bankers. If there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse it is that.But what we believe, and what we argue in the book, is that there is no set of rules, no matter how detailed, no matter how specific, no matter how carefully monitored and enforced, there is no set of rules that will get us what we need. Why? Because bankers are smart people. And, like water, they will find cracks in any set of rules. You design a set of rules that will make sure that the particular reason why the financial system \"almost-collapse\" can't happen again. It is naive beyond description to think that having blocked this source of financial collapse, you have blocked all possible sources of financial collapse. So it's just a question of waiting for the next one and then marveling at how we could have been so stupid as not to protect ourselves against that.What we desperately need, beyond, or along with, better rules and reasonably smart incentives, is we need virtue. We need character. We need people who want to do the right thing. And in particular, the virtue that we need most of all is the virtue that Aristotle called \"practical wisdom.\" Practical wisdom is the moral will to do the right thing and the moral skill to figure out what the right thing is. So Aristotle was very interested in watching how the craftsmen around him worked. And he was impressed at how they would improvise novel solutions to novel problems \u2014 problems that they hadn't anticipated. So one example is he sees these stonemasons working on the Isle of Lesbos, and they need to measure out round columns. Well if you think about it, it's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler. So what do they do? They fashion a novel solution to the problem. They created a ruler that bends, what we would call these days a tape measure \u2014 a flexible rule, a rule that bends. And Aristotle said, \"Hah, they appreciated that sometimes to design rounded columns, you need to bend the rule.\" And Aristotle said often in dealing with other people, we need to bend the rules.Dealing with other people demands a kind of flexibility that no set of rules can encompass. Wise people know when and how to bend the rules. Wise people know how to improvise. The way my co-author , Ken, and I talk about it, they are kind of like jazz musicians. The rules are like the notes on the page, and that gets you started, but then you dance around the notes on the page, coming up with just the right combination for this particular moment with this particular set of fellow players. So for Aristotle, the kind of rule-bending, rule exception-finding and improvisation that you see in skilled craftsmen is exactly what you need to be a skilled moral craftsman. And in interactions with people, almost all the time, it is this kind of flexibility that is required. A wise person knows when to bend the rules. A wise person knows when to improvise. And most important, a wise person does this improvising and rule-bending in the service of the right aims. If you are a rule-bender and an improviser mostly to serve yourself, what you get is ruthless manipulation of other people. So it matters that you do this wise practice in the service of others and not in the service of yourself. And so the will to do the right thing is just as important as the moral skill of improvisation and exception-finding. Together they comprise practical wisdom, which Aristotle thought was the master virtue.So I'll give you an example of wise practice in action. It's the case of Michael. Michael's a young guy. He had a pretty low-wage job. He was supporting his wife and a child, and the child was going to parochial school. Then he lost his job. He panicked about being able to support his family. One night, he drank a little too much, and he robbed a cab driver \u2014 stole 50 dollars. He robbed him at gunpoint. It was a toy gun. He got caught. He got tried. He got convicted. The Pennsylvania sentencing guidelines required a minimum sentence for a crime like this of two years, 24 months. The judge on the case, Judge Lois Forer thought that this made no sense. He had never committed a crime before. He was a responsible husband and father. He had been faced with desperate circumstances. All this would do is wreck a family. And so she improvised a sentence \u2014 11 months, and not only that, but release every day to go to work. Spend your night in jail, spend your day holding down a job. He did. He served out his sentence. He made restitution and found himself a new job. And the family was united.And it seemed on the road to some sort of a decent life \u2014 a happy ending to a story involving wise improvisation from a wise judge. But it turned out the prosecutor was not happy that Judge Forer ignored the sentencing guidelines and sort of invented her own, and so he appealed. And he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery. He did after all have a toy gun. The mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery is five years. He won the appeal. Michael was sentenced to five years in prison. Judge Forer had to follow the law. And by the way, this appeal went through after he had finished serving his sentence, so he was out and working at a job and taking care of his family and he had to go back into jail. Judge Forer did what she was required to do, and then she quit the bench. And Michael disappeared. So that is an example, both of wisdom in practice and the subversion of wisdom by rules that are meant, of course, to make things better.Now consider Ms. Dewey. Ms. Dewey's a teacher in a Texas elementary school. She found herself listening to a consultant one day who was trying to help teachers boost the test scores of the kids, so that the school would reach the elite category in percentage of kids passing big tests. All these schools in Texas compete with one another to achieve these milestones, and there are bonuses and various other treats that come if you beat the other schools. So here was the consultant's advice: first, don't waste your time on kids who are going to pass the test no matter what you do. Second, don't waste your time on kids who can't pass the test no matter what you do. Third, don't waste your time on kids who moved into the district too late for their scores to be counted. Focus all of your time and attention on the kids who are on the bubble, the so-called \"bubble kids\" \u2014 kids where your intervention can get them just maybe over the line from failing to passing. So Ms. Dewey heard this, and she shook her head in despair while fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other on and nodding approvingly. It's like they were about to go play a football game. For Ms. Dewey, this isn't why she became a teacher.Now Ken and I are not naive, and we understand that you need to have rules. You need to have incentives. People have to make a living. But the problem with relying on rules and incentives is that they demoralize professional activity, and they demoralize professional activity in two senses. First, they demoralize the people who are engaged in the activity. Judge Forer quits, and Ms. Dewey in completely disheartened. And second, they demoralize the activity itself. The very practice is demoralized, and the practitioners are demoralized. It creates people \u2014 when you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing \u2014 it creates people who are addicted to incentives. That is to say, it creates people who only do things for incentives.Now the striking thing about this is that psychologists have known this for 30 years. Psychologists have known about the negative consequences of incentivizing everything for 30 years. We know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures, they stop caring about the drawing and care only about the reward. If you reward kids for reading books, they stop caring about what's in the books and only care about how long they are. If you reward teachers for kids' test scores, they stop caring about educating and only care about test preparation. If you were to reward doctors for doing more procedures \u2014 which is the current system \u2014 they would do more. If instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures, they will do fewer. What we want, of course, is doctors who do just the right amount of procedures and do the right amount for the right reason \u2014 namely, to serve the welfare of their patients. Psychologists have known this for decades, and it's time for policymakers to start paying attention and listen to psychologists a little bit, instead of economists.And it doesn't have to be this way. We think, Ken and I, that there are real sources of hope. We identify one set of people in all of these practices who we call canny outlaws. These are people who, being forced to operate in a system that demands rule-following and creates incentives, find away around the rules, find a way to subvert the rules. So there are teachers who have these scripts to follow, and they know that if they follow these scripts, the kids will learn nothing. And so what they do is they follow the scripts, but they follow the scripts at double-time and squirrel away little bits of extra time during which they teach in the way that they actually know is effective. So these are little ordinary, everyday heroes, and they're incredibly admirable, but there's no way that they can sustain this kind of activity in the face of a system that either roots them out or grinds them down.So canny outlaws are better than nothing, but it's hard to imagine any canny outlaw sustaining that for an indefinite period of time. More hopeful are people we call system-changers. These are people who are looking not to dodge the system's rules and regulations, but to transform the system, and we talk about several. One in particular is a judge named Robert Russell. And one day he was faced with the case of Gary Pettengill. Pettengill was a 23-year-old vet who had planned to make the army a career, but then he got a severe back injury in Iraq, and that forced him to take a medical discharge. He was married, he had a third kid on the way, he suffered from PTSD, in addition to the bad back, and recurrent nightmares, and he had started using marijuana to ease some of the symptoms. He was only able to get part-time work because of his back, and so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table and take care of his family. So he started selling marijuana. He was busted in a drug sweep. His family was kicked out of their apartment, and the welfare system was threatening to take away his kids.Under normal sentencing procedures, Judge Russell would have had little choice but to sentence Pettengill to serious jail-time as a drug felon. But Judge Russell did have an alternative. And that's because he was in a special court. He was in a court called the Veterans' Court. In the Veterans' Court \u2014 this was the first of its kind in the United States. Judge Russell created the Veterans' Court. It was a court only for veterans who had broken the law. And he had created it exactly because mandatory sentencing laws were taking the judgment out of judging. No one wanted non-violent offenders \u2014 and especially non-violent offenders who were veterans to boot \u2014 to be thrown into prison. They wanted to do something about what we all know, namely the revolving door of the criminal justice system. And what the Veterans' Court did, was it treated each criminal as an individual, tried to get inside their problems, tried to fashion responses to their crimes that helped them to rehabilitate themselves, and didn't forget about them once the judgment was made. Stayed with them, followed up on them, made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan had been jointly developed to get them over the hump.There are now 22 cities that have Veterans' Courts like this. Why has the idea spread? Well, one reason is that Judge Russell has now seen 108 vets in his Veterans' Court as of February of this year, and out of 108, guess how many have gone back through the revolving door of justice into prison. None. None. Anyone would glom onto a criminal justice system that has this kind of a record. So here's is a system-changer, and it seems to be catching.There's a banker who created a for-profit community bank that encouraged bankers \u2014 I know this is hard to believe \u2014 encouraged bankers who worked there to do well by doing good for their low-income clients. The bank helped finance the rebuilding of what was otherwise a dying community. Though their loan recipients were high-risk by ordinary standards, the default rate was extremely low. The bank was profitable. The bankers stayed with their loan recipients. They didn't make loans and then sell the loans. They serviced the loans. They made sure that their loan recipients were staying up with their payments. Banking hasn't always been the way we read about it now in the newspapers. Even Goldman Sachs once used to serve clients, before it turned into an institution that serves only itself. Banking wasn't always this way, and it doesn't have to be this way.So there are examples like this in medicine \u2014 doctors at Harvard who are trying to transform medical education, so that you don't get a kind of ethical erosion and loss of empathy, which characterizes most medical students in the course of their medical training. And the way they do it is to give third-year medical students patients who they follow for an entire year. So the patients are not organ systems, and they're not diseases; they're people, people with lives. And in order to be an effective doctor, you need to treat people who have lives and not just disease. In addition to which there's an enormous amount of back and forth, mentoring of one student by another, of all the students by the doctors, and the result is a generation \u2014 we hope \u2014 of doctors who do have time for the people they treat. We'll see.So there are lots of examples like this that we talk about. Each of them shows that it is possible to build on and nurture character and keep a profession true to its proper mission \u2014 what Aristotle would have called its proper telos. And Ken and I believe that this is what practitioners actually want. People want to be allowed to be virtuous. They want to have permission to do the right thing. They don't want to feel like they need to take a shower to get the moral grime off their bodies everyday when they come home from work.Aristotle thought that practical wisdom was the key to happiness, and he was right. There's now a lot of research being done in psychology on what makes people happy, and the two things that jump out in study after study \u2014 I know this will come as a shock to all of you \u2014 the two things that matter most to happiness are love and work. Love: managing successfully relations with the people who are close to you and with the communities of which you are a part. Work: engaging in activities that are meaningful and satisfying. If you have that, good close relations with other people, work that's meaningful and fulfilling, you don't much need anything else.Well, to love well and to work well, you need wisdom. Rules and incentives don't tell you how to be a good friend, how to be a good parent, how to be a good spouse, or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer or a good teacher. Rules and incentives are no substitutes for wisdom. Indeed, we argue, there is no substitute for wisdom. And so practical wisdom does not require heroic acts of self-sacrifice on the part of practitioners. In giving us the will and the skill to do the right thing \u2014 to do right by others \u2014 practical wisdom also gives us the will and the skill to do right by ourselves.Thanks.(Applause)", "id":

dissatisfaction\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nwith the way things are working,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nwith the way our institutions run.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nOur kids' teachers seem to be failing them.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nOur doctors don't know who the hell we are,\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nand they don't have enough time for us.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nWe certainly can't trust the bankers,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nand we certainly can't trust the brokers.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nThey almost brought the entire financial system down.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nAnd even as we do our own work,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nall too often,\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nwe find ourselves having to choose\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nbetween doing what we think is the right thing\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nand doing the expected thing,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nor the required thing,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nor the profitable thing.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nSo everywhere we look,\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\npretty much across the board,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nwe worry that the people we depend on\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\ndon't really have our interests at heart.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nOr if they do have our interests at heart,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nwe worry that they don't know us well enough\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nto figure out what they need to do\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nin order to allow us\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nto secure those interests.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nThey don't understand us.\n\n00:01:38.958

00:01:54.958\nlet's make more rules,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nlet's set up a set\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nof detailed procedures\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nto make sure that people will do the right thing.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nGive teachers scripts\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nto follow in the classroom,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nso even if they

00:02:28.958\nis look up on the list\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nwhat kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nImpose limits\n\n00:02:33.958 -->

bonuses\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nif the kids they teach\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nscore passing grades on these big test scores\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nthat are used to

\"carrots.\"\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nWe passed a bunch of rules\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nto regulate the financial industry\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nin response to the recent collapse.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nThere's the Dodd-Frank Act,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nthere's the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nthat is temporarily being headed through the backdoor\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nby Elizabeth Warren.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nMaybe these rules\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nwill actually improve\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nthe way these financial services companies behave.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nWe'll see.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nIn addition, we are struggling\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nto find some way to create incentives\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nfor people in the financial services industry\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nthat will have them more interested\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nin serving the long-term interests\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\neven of their own companies,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nrather than securing short-term profits.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nSo if we find just the right incentives,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nthey'll do the right thing -- as I said -- selfishly,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nand if we come up with the right rules and regulations,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nthey won't drive us all over a cliff.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nAnd Ken [Sharpe] and I certainly know\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nthat you need to reign in the bankers.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nIf there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nit is that.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nBut what we believe,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nand what we argue in the book,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nis that there is no set of rules,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nno matter how detailed,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nno matter how specific,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nno matter how carefully monitored\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nand enforced,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nthere is no set of rules\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nthat will get us what we need.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nWhy? Because bankers are smart people.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nAnd, like water,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nthey will find cracks\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nin any set of rules.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nYou design a set of rules that will make sure\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nthat the particular reason\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nwhy the financial system \"almost-collapse\"\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\ncan't happen again.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nIt is naive beyond description\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nto think that having blocked\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nthis source of financial collapse,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nyou have blocked all possible sources of financial collapse.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nSo it's just a question of waiting for the next one\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nand then marveling at how we could have been so stupid\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nas not to protect ourselves against that.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nWhat we desperately need,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nbeyond, or along with, better rules\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nand reasonably smart incentives,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nis we need virtue.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nWe need character.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nWe need people who want to do the right thing.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nAnd in particular,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nthe virtue that we need most of all\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nis the virtue that Aristotle called\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\n\"practical wisdom.\"\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nPractical wisdom\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nis the moral will\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nto do the right thing\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nand the moral skill\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nto figure out what the right thing is.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nSo Aristotle was very interested in watching\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nhow the craftsmen around him worked.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd he was impressed\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nat how they would improvise\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nnovel solutions to novel problems --\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nproblems that they hadn't anticipated.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nSo one example is he sees these stonemasons\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nworking on the Isle of Lesbos,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nand they need to measure out\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nround columns.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nWell if you think about it,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nit's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nSo what do they do?\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nThey fashion a novel solution to the problem.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nThey created a ruler that bends,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nwhat we would call these days a tape measure --\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\na flexible rule,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\na rule that bends.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nAnd Aristotle said,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\n\"Hah, they appreciated that sometimes\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nto design rounded columns,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nyou need to bend the rule.\"\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nAnd Aristotle said\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\noften in dealing with other people,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nwe need to bend the rules.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nDealing with other people\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\ndemands a kind of flexibility\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nthat no set of rules can encompass.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nWise people know when and how\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nto bend the rules.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nWise people know how to improvise.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nThe way my co-author , Ken, and I talk about it,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nthey are kind of like jazz musicians.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nThe rules are like the notes on the page,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nand that gets you started,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nbut then you dance around the notes on the page,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\ncoming up with just the right combination\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nfor this particular moment\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nwith this particular set of fellow players.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nSo for Aristotle,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nthe kind\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nof rule-bending,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nrule exception-finding and improvisation\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nthat you see in skilled craftsmen\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nis exactly what you need\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nto be a skilled moral craftsman.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nAnd in interactions with people,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nalmost all the time,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nit is this kind of flexibility that is required.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nA wise person knows when to bend the rules.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nA wise person knows when to improvise.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nAnd most important,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\na wise person does this improvising and rule-bending\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nin the service of the right aims.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nIf you are a rule-bender and an improviser\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nmostly to serve yourself,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nwhat you get is ruthless manipulation of other people.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nSo it matters that you do this wise practice\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nin the service of others\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nand not in the service of yourself.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nAnd so the will to do the right thing\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nis just as important as the moral skill\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nof improvisation\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nand exception-finding.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nTogether they comprise practical wisdom,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nwhich Aristotle thought\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nwas the master virtue.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nSo I'll give you an example\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nof wise practice in action.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nIt's the case of Michael.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nMichael's a young guy.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nHe had a pretty low-wage job.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nHe was supporting his wife and a child,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nand the child was going to parochial school.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nThen he lost his job.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nHe panicked\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nabout being able to support his family.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nOne night, he drank a little too much,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nand he robbed a cab driver --\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nstole 50 dollars.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nHe robbed him at gunpoint.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nIt was a toy gun.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nHe got caught. He got tried.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nHe got convicted.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nThe Pennsylvania sentencing guidelines\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nrequired a minimum sentence for a crime like this\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nof two years, 24 months.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nThe judge on the case, Judge Lois Forer\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nthought that this made no sense.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nHe had never committed a crime before.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nHe was a responsible husband and father.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nHe had been faced with desperate circumstances.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nAll this would do is wreck a family.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nAnd so she improvised a sentence -- 11 months,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nand not only that,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nbut release every day to go to work.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nSpend your night in jail, spend your day holding down a job.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nHe did. He served out his sentence.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nHe made restitution\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nand found himself a new job.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nAnd the family was united.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nAnd it seemed on the road\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nto some sort of a decent life --\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\na happy ending to a story\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\ninvolving wise improvisation\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nfrom a wise judge.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nBut it turned out\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nthe prosecutor was not happy\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nthat Judge Forer ignored the sentencing guidelines\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nand sort of invented her own,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nand so he appealed.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nAnd he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nfor armed robbery.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nHe did after all have a toy gun.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nThe mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nis five years.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nHe won the appeal.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nMichael was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nJudge Forer had to follow the law.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nAnd by the way, this appeal went through\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nafter he had finished serving his sentence,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nso he was out and working at a job\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nand taking care of his family\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nand he had to go back into jail.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nJudge Forer did what she was required to do,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nand then she quit the bench.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nAnd Michael disappeared.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nSo that is an example,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nboth of wisdom in practice\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nand the subversion of wisdom\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nby rules that are meant, of course, to make things better.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nNow consider Ms. Dewey.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nMs. Dewey's a teacher in a Texas elementary school.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nShe found herself listening to a consultant one day\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nwho was trying to help teachers\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nboost the test scores of the kids,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nso that the school\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nwould reach the elite category\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nin percentage of kids passing big tests.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nAll these schools in Texas compete with one another\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nto achieve these milestones,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nand there are bonuses and various other treats\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nthat come if you beat the other schools.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nSo here was the consultant's advice:\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nfirst, don't waste your time on kids\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nwho are going to pass the test no matter what you do.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nSecond, don't waste your time\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\non kids who can't pass the test\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nno matter what you do.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nThird, don't waste your time\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\non kids who moved into the district\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\ntoo late for their scores to be counted.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nFocus all of your time and attention\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\non the kids who are on the bubble,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nthe so-called \"bubble kids\" --\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nkids where your intervention\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\ncan get them just maybe over the line\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nfrom failing to passing.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nSo Ms. Dewey heard this,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nand she shook her head in despair\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nwhile fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other on\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nand nodding approvingly.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nIt's like they were about to go play a football game.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nFor Ms. Dewey,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nthis isn't why she became a teacher.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nNow Ken and I are not naive,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nand we understand that you need to have rules.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nYou need to have incentives.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nPeople have to make a living.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nBut the problem\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nwith relying on rules and incentives\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nis that they demoralize\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nprofessional activity,\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nand they demoralize professional activity\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nin two senses.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nFirst, they demoralize the people\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nwho are engaged in the activity.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nJudge Forer quits,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nand Ms. Dewey in completely disheartened.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nAnd second,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nthey demoralize the activity itself.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nThe very practice is demoralized,\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nand the practitioners are demoralized.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nIt creates people --\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nwhen you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing --\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nit creates people\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nwho are addicted to incentives.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nThat is to say, it creates people\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nwho only do things for incentives.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nNow the striking thing about this\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nis that psychologists have known this\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nfor 30 years.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nPsychologists have known\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nabout the negative consequences of incentivizing everything\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nfor 30 years.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nWe know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures,\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nthey stop caring about the drawing\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nand care only about the reward.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nIf you reward kids for reading books,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nthey stop caring about what's in the books\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nand only care about how long they are.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nIf you reward teachers for kids' test scores,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nthey stop caring about educating\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nand only care about test preparation.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nIf you were to reward doctors\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nfor doing more procedures --\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nwhich is the current system -- they would do more.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nIf instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nthey will do fewer.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nWhat we want, of course,\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nis doctors who do just the right amount of procedures\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nand do the right amount for the right reason --\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nnamely, to serve the welfare of their patients.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nPsychologists have known this for decades,\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nand it's time for policymakers\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nto start paying attention\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nand listen to psychologists a little bit,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\ninstead of economists.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nAnd it doesn't have to be this way.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nWe think, Ken and I, that there are real sources of hope.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nWe identify one set of people\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nin all of these practices\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nwho we call canny outlaws.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nThese are people\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nwho, being forced to operate\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nin a system that demands rule-following\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nand creates incentives,\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nfind away around the rules,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nfind a way to subvert the rules.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nSo there are teachers who have these scripts to follow,\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nand they know that if they follow these scripts, the kids will learn nothing.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nAnd so what they do is they follow the scripts,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nbut they follow the scripts at double-time\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nand squirrel away little bits of extra time\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nduring which they teach in the way\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nthat they actually know is effective.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nSo these are little ordinary, everyday heroes,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nand they're incredibly admirable,\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nbut there's no way that they can sustain this kind of activity\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nin the face of a system\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nthat either roots them out\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nor grinds them down.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nSo canny outlaws are better than nothing,\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nbut it's hard to imagine any canny outlaw\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nsustaining that for an indefinite period of time.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nMore hopeful\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nare people we call system-changers.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nThese are people who are looking\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nnot to dodge the system's rules and regulations,\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nbut to transform the system,\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nand we talk about several.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nOne in particular\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nis a judge named Robert Russell.\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nAnd one day he was faced\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nwith the case of Gary Pettengill.\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nPettengill was a 23-year-old vet\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nwho had planned to make the army a career,\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nbut then he got a severe back injury in Iraq,\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nand that forced him to take a medical discharge.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nHe was married, he had a third kid on the way,\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nhe suffered from PTSD, in addition to the bad back,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nand recurrent nightmares,\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nand he had started using marijuana\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nto ease some of the symptoms.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nHe was only able to get part-time work because of his back,\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nand so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nand take care of his family.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nSo he started selling marijuana.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nHe was busted in a drug sweep.\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nHis family was kicked out of their apartment,\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nand the welfare system\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nwas threatening to take away his kids.\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nUnder normal sentencing procedures,\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nJudge Russell would have had little choice\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nbut to sentence Pettengill to serious jail-time\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nas a drug felon.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nBut Judge Russell did have an alternative.\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nAnd that's because he was in a special court.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nHe was in a court called the Veterans' Court.\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nIn the Veterans' Court --\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nthis was the first of its kind in the United States.\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nJudge Russell created the Veterans' Court.\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nIt was a court only for veterans\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nwho had broken the law.\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nAnd he had created it exactly because\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:48.958\nmandatory sentencing laws\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nwere taking the judgment out of judging.\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nNo one wanted non-violent offenders --\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nand especially non-violent offenders who were veterans to boot --\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nto be thrown into prison.\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nThey wanted to do something about what we all know,\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nnamely the revolving door of the criminal justice system.\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nAnd what the Veterans' Court did,\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nwas it treated each criminal as an individual,\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:13.958\ntried to get inside their problems,\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:16.958\ntried to fashion responses to their crimes\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nthat helped them to rehabilitate themselves,\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nand didn't forget about them once the judgment was made.\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nStayed with them, followed up on them,\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nmade sure that they were sticking to whatever plan\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nhad been jointly developed\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nto get them over the hump.\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nThere are now 22 cities\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nthat have Veterans' Courts like this.\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nWhy has the idea spread?\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nWell, one reason is\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nthat Judge Russell\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nhas now seen 108 vets\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nin his Veterans' Court\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nas of February of this year,\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nand out of 108,\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nguess how many have gone back through\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nthe revolving door of justice\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.958\ninto prison.\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nNone. None.\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nAnyone would glom onto\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.958\na criminal justice system\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:04.958\nthat has this kind of a record.\n\n00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nSo here's is a system-changer, and it seems to be catching.\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nThere's a banker\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nwho created a for-profit community bank\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nthat encouraged bankers -- I know this is hard to believe --\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nencouraged bankers who worked there to do well\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:20.958\nby doing good for their low-income clients.\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:23.958\nThe bank helped finance the rebuilding\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nof what was otherwise a dying community.\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:29.958\nThough their loan recipients were high-risk by ordinary standards,\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nthe default rate was extremely low.\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:35.958\nThe bank was profitable.\n\n00:19:35.958 --> 00:19:37.958\nThe bankers stayed with their loan recipients.\n\n00:19:37.958 --> 00:19:39.958\nThey didn't make loans and then sell the loans.\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:41.958\nThey serviced the loans.\n\n00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:43.958\nThey made sure that their loan recipients\n\n00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:46.958\nwere staying up with their payments.\n\n00:19:46.958 --> 00:19:49.958\nBanking hasn't always been\n\n00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:53.958\nthe way we read about it now in the newspapers.\n\n00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:55.958\nEven Goldman Sachs\n\n00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:58.958\nonce used to serve clients,\n\n00:19:58.958 --> 00:20:01.958\nbefore it turned into an institution\n\n00:20:01.958 --> 00:20:03.958\nthat serves only itself.\n\n00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:05.958\nBanking wasn't always this way,\n\n00:20:05.958 --> 00:20:08.958\nand it doesn't have to be this way.\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:13.958\nSo there are examples like this in medicine --\n\n00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:15.958\ndoctors at Harvard\n\n00:20:15.958 --> 00:20:17.958\nwho are trying to transform medical education,\n\n00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:19.958\nso that you don't get a kind of ethical erosion\n\n00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:21.958\nand loss of empathy,\n\n00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:23.958\nwhich characterizes most medical students\n\n00:20:23.958 --> 00:20:25.958\nin the course of their medical training.\n\n00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:28.958\nAnd the way they do it is to give third-year medical students\n\n00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:30.958\npatients who they follow for an entire year.\n\n00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:32.958\nSo the patients are not organ systems,\n\n00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:34.958\nand they're not diseases;\n\n00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:36.958\nthey're people, people with lives.\n\n00:20:36.958 --> 00:20:38.958\nAnd in order to be an effective doctor,\n\n00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:41.958\nyou need to treat people who have lives and not just disease.\n\n00:20:41.958 --> 00:20:44.958\nIn addition to which there's an enormous amount of back and forth,\n\n00:20:44.958 --> 00:20:46.958\nmentoring of one student by another,\n\n00:20:46.958 --> 00:20:49.958\nof all the students by the doctors,\n\n00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:52.958\nand the result is a generation -- we hope -- of doctors\n\n00:20:52.958 --> 00:20:54.958\nwho do have time for the people they treat.\n\n00:20:54.958 --> 00:20:56.958\nWe'll see.\n\n00:20:56.958 --> 00:20:59.958\nSo there are lots of examples like this that we talk about.\n\n00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:01.958\nEach of them shows that it is possible\n\n00:21:01.958 --> 00:21:04.958\nto build on and nurture character\n\n00:21:04.958 --> 00:21:06.958\nand keep a profession\n\n00:21:06.958 --> 00:21:08.958\ntrue to its proper mission --\n\n00:21:08.958 --> 00:21:11.958\nwhat Aristotle would have called its proper telos.\n\n00:21:12.958 --> 00:21:14.958\nAnd Ken and I believe\n\n00:21:14.958 --> 00:21:17.958\nthat this is what practitioners actually want.\n\n00:21:17.958 --> 00:21:19.958\nPeople want to be allowed\n\n00:21:19.958 --> 00:21:21.958\nto be virtuous.\n\n00:21:21.958 --> 00:21:24.958\nThey want to have permission to do the right thing.\n\n00:21:24.958 --> 00:21:26.958\nThey don't want to feel\n\n00:21:26.958 --> 00:21:28.958\nlike they need to take a shower\n\n00:21:28.958 --> 00:21:31.958\nto get the moral grime off their bodies everyday\n\n00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:34.958\nwhen they come home from work.\n\n00:21:34.958 --> 00:21:36.958\nAristotle thought that practical wisdom\n\n00:21:36.958 --> 00:21:38.958\nwas the key to happiness,\n\n00:21:38.958 --> 00:21:41.958\nand he was right.\n\n00:21:41.958 --> 00:21:44.958\nThere's now a lot of research being done in psychology\n\n00:21:44.958 --> 00:21:46.958\non what makes people happy,\n\n00:21:46.958 --> 00:21:49.958\nand the two things that jump out in study after study --\n\n00:21:49.958 --> 00:21:51.958\nI know this will come as a shock to all of you --\n\n00:21:51.958 --> 00:21:54.958\nthe two things that matter most to happiness\n\n00:21:54.958 --> 00:21:57.958\nare love and work.\n\n00:21:57.958 --> 00:22:00.958\nLove: managing successfully\n\n00:22:00.958 --> 00:22:02.958\nrelations with the people who are close to you\n\n00:22:02.958 --> 00:22:05.958\nand with the communities of which you are a part.\n\n00:22:05.958 --> 00:22:08.958\nWork: engaging in activities\n\n00:22:08.958 --> 00:22:11.958\nthat are meaningful and satisfying.\n\n00:22:11.958 --> 00:22:14.958\nIf you have that, good close relations with other people,\n\n00:22:14.958 --> 00:22:17.958\nwork that's meaningful and fulfilling,\n\n00:22:17.958 --> 00:22:20.958\nyou don't much need anything else.\n\n00:22:20.958 --> 00:22:23.958\nWell, to love well and to work well,\n\n00:22:23.958 --> 00:22:25.958\nyou need wisdom.\n\n00:22:25.958 --> 00:22:27.958\nRules and incentives don't tell you\n\n00:22:27.958 --> 00:22:30.958\nhow to be a good friend, how to be a good parent,\n\n00:22:30.958 --> 00:22:32.958\nhow to be a good spouse,\n\n00:22:32.958 --> 00:22:34.958\nor how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer\n\n00:22:34.958 --> 00:22:36.958\nor a good teacher.\n\n00:22:36.958 --> 00:22:38.958\nRules and incentives\n\n00:22:38.958 --> 00:22:40.958\nare no substitutes for wisdom.\n\n00:22:40.958 --> 00:22:42.958\nIndeed, we argue,\n\n00:22:42.958 --> 00:22:45.958\nthere is no substitute for wisdom.\n\n00:22:45.958 --> 00:22:47.958\nAnd so practical wisdom\n\n00:22:47.958 --> 00:22:49.958\ndoes not require\n\n00:22:49.958 --> 00:22:52.958\nheroic acts of self-sacrifice\n\n00:22:52.958 --> 00:22:55.958\non the part of practitioners.\n\n00:22:55.958 --> 00:22:57.958\nIn giving us the will and the skill\n\n00:22:57.958 --> 00:23:00.958\nto do the right thing -- to do right by others --\n\n00:23:00.958 --> 00:23:02.958\npractical wisdom also gives us\n\n00:23:02.958 --> 00:23:04.958\nthe will and the skill\n\n00:23:04.958 --> 00:23:07.958\nto do right by ourselves.\n\n00:23:07.958 --> 00:23:09.958\nThanks.\n\n00:23:09.958 --> 00:23:12.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How to succeed?

And my little idea that will do that is sleep.(Laughter)(Applause)This is a room of type A women. This is a room of sleep-deprived women. And I learned the hard way the value of sleep. Two-and-a-half years ago, I fainted from exhaustion. I hit my head on my desk. I broke my cheekbone, I got five stitches on my right eye. And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep. And in the course of that, I studied, I met with medical doctors, scientists, and I'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive, more inspired, more joyful life is getting enough sleep.(Applause)And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution, this new feminist issue. We are literally going to sleep our way to the top \u2014 literally \u2014(Laughter)(Applause)because unfortunately, for men, sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol. I was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before. And I felt like saying to him \u2014 but I didn't say \u2014 I felt like saying, \"You know what? if you had gotten five, this dinner would have been a lot more interesting.\"(Laughter)There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship. Especially here in Washington, if you try to make a breakfast date, and you say, \"How about eight o'clock?\" they're likely to tell you, \"Eight o'clock is too late for me, but that's OK, I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight.\" And they think that means they are so incredibly busy and productive, but the truth is, they're not, because we, at the moment, have had brilliant leaders in business, in finance, in politics, making terrible decisions. So a high IQ does not mean that you're a good leader, because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic.(Laughter)And we've had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics. In fact, I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters, they might still be around.(Laughter)(Applause)While all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24/7, maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg, because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep, and have been able to see the big picture.So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment, what is good for us on a personal level, what's going to bring more joy, gratitude, effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers, is also what is best for the world. So I urge you to shut your eyes, and discover the great ideas that lie inside us; to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1044, "subtitle":

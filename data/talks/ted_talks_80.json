[{"title": "Biomimicry's surprising lessons from nature's engineers", "duration": "1399", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/janine_benyus_shares_nature_s_designs", "transcript": "It is a thrill to be here at a conference that's devoted to \"Inspired by Nature\" \u2014 you can imagine. And I'm also thrilled to be in the foreplay section. Did you notice this section is foreplay? Because I get to talk about one of my favorite critters, which is the Western Grebe. You haven't lived until you've seen these guys do their courtship dance. I was on Bowman Lake in Glacier National Park, which is a long, skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it, and my partner and I have a rowing shell. And so we were rowing, and one of these Western Grebes came along. And what they do for their courtship dance is, they go together, the two of them, the two mates, and they begin to run underwater. They paddle faster, and faster, and faster, until they're going so fast that they literally lift up out of the water, and they're standing upright, sort of paddling the top of the water. And one of these Grebes came along while we were rowing. And so we're in a skull, and we're moving really, really quickly. And this Grebe, I think, sort of, mistaked us for a prospect, and started to run along the water next to us, in a courtship dance \u2014 for miles. It would stop, and then start, and then stop, and then start. Now that is foreplay. (Laughter)I came this close to changing species at that moment. Obviously, life can teach us something in the entertainment section. Life has a lot to teach us. But what I'd like to talk about today is what life might teach us in technology and in design. What's happened since the book came out \u2014 the book was mainly about research in biomimicry \u2014 and what's happened since then is architects, designers, engineers \u2014 people who make our world \u2014 have started to call and say, we want a biologist to sit at the design table to help us, in real time, become inspired. Or \u2014 and this is the fun part for me \u2014 we want you to take us out into the natural world. We'll come with a design challenge and we find the champion adapters in the natural world, who might inspire us.So this is a picture from a Galapagos trip that we took with some wastewater treatment engineers; they purify wastewater. And some of them were very resistant, actually, to being there. What they said to us at first was, you know, we already do biomimicry. We use bacteria to clean our water. And we said, well, that's not exactly being inspired by nature. That's bioprocessing, you know; that's bio-assisted technology: using an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old, old technology called \"domestication.\" This is learning something, learning an idea, from an organism and then applying it. And so they still weren't getting it.So we went for a walk on the beach and I said, well, give me one of your big problems. Give me a design challenge, sustainability speed bump, that's keeping you from being sustainable. And they said scaling, which is the build-up of minerals inside of pipes. And they said, you know what happens is, mineral \u2014 just like at your house \u2014 mineral builds up. And then the aperture closes, and we have to flush the pipes with toxins, or we have to dig them up. So if we had some way to stop this scaling \u2014 and so I picked up some shells on the beach. And I asked them, what is scaling? What's inside your pipes? And they said, calcium carbonate. And I said, that's what this is; this is calcium carbonate.And they didn't know that. They didn't know that what a seashell is, it's templated by proteins, and then ions from the seawater crystallize in place to create a shell. So the same sort of a process, without the proteins, is happening on the inside of their pipes. They didn't know. This is not for lack of information; it's a lack of integration. You know, it's a silo, people in silos. They didn't know that the same thing was happening. So one of them thought about it and said, OK, well, if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater \u2014 self-assembly \u2014 then why aren't shells infinite in size? What stops the scaling? Why don't they just keep on going? And I said, well, in the same way that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization \u2014 and then they all sort of leaned in \u2014 they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization. It literally adheres to the growing face of the crystal. And, in fact, there is a product called TPA that's mimicked that protein \u2014 that stop-protein \u2014 and it's an environmentally friendly way to stop scaling in pipes.That changed everything. From then on, you could not get these engineers back in the boat. The first day they would take a hike, and it was, click, click, click, click. Five minutes later they were back in the boat. We're done. You know, I've seen that island. After this, they were crawling all over. They would snorkel for as long as we would let them snorkel. What had happened was that they realized that there were organisms out there that had already solved the problems that they had spent their careers trying to solve.Learning about the natural world is one thing; learning from the natural world \u2014 that's the switch. That's the profound switch. What they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere; they just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world. 3.8 billion years of field-testing. 10 to 30 \u2014 Craig Venter will probably tell you; I think there's a lot more than 30 million \u2014 well-adapted solutions. The important thing for me is that these are solutions solved in context. And the context is the Earth \u2014 the same context that we're trying to solve our problems in. So it's the conscious emulation of life's genius. It's not slavishly mimicking \u2014 although Al is trying to get the hairdo going \u2014 it's not a slavish mimicry; it's taking the design principles, the genius of the natural world, and learning something from it.Now, in a group with so many IT people, I do have to mention what I'm not going to talk about, and that is that your field is one that has learned an enormous amount from living things, on the software side. So there's computers that protect themselves, like an immune system, and we're learning from gene regulation and biological development. And we're learning from neural nets, genetic algorithms, evolutionary computing. That's on the software side. But what's interesting to me is that we haven't looked at this, as much. I mean, these machines are really not very high tech in my estimation in the sense that there's dozens and dozens of carcinogens in the water in Silicon Valley. So the hardware is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success. So what can we learn about making \u2014 not just computers, but everything? The plane you came in, cars, the seats that you're sitting on. How do we redesign the world that we make, the human-made world? More importantly, what should we ask in the next 10 years? And there's a lot of cool technologies out there that life has.What's the syllabus? Three questions, for me, are key. How does life make things? This is the opposite; this is how we make things. It's called heat, beat and treat \u2014 that's what material scientists call it. And it's carving things down from the top, with 96 percent waste left over and only 4 percent product. You heat it up; you beat it with high pressures; you use chemicals. OK. Heat, beat and treat.Life can't afford to do that. How does life make things? How does life make the most of things? That's a geranium pollen. And its shape is what gives it the function of being able to tumble through air so easily. Look at that shape. Life adds information to matter. In other words: structure. It gives it information. By adding information to matter, it gives it a function that's different than without that structure. And thirdly, how does life make things disappear into systems? Because life doesn't really deal in things; there are no things in the natural world divorced from their systems. Really quick syllabus. As I'm reading more and more now, and following the story, there are some amazing things coming up in the biological sciences. And at the same time, I'm listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand challenges are. The two groups are not talking to each other. At all.What in the world of biology might be helpful at this juncture, to get us through this sort of evolutionary knothole that we're in? I'm going to try to go through 12, really quickly.One that's exciting to me is self-assembly. Now, you've heard about this in terms of nanotechnology. Back to that shell: the shell is a self-assembling material. On the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of seawater. It's a layered structure that's mineral and then polymer, and it makes it very, very tough. It's twice as tough as our high-tech ceramics. But what's really interesting: unlike our ceramics that are in kilns, it happens in seawater. It happens near, in and near, the organism's body. This is Sandia National Labs. A guy named Jeff Brinker has found a way to have a self-assembling coding process. Imagine being able to make ceramics at room temperature by simply dipping something into a liquid, lifting it out of the liquid, and having evaporation force the molecules in the liquid together, so that they jigsaw together in the same way as this crystallization works. Imagine making all of our hard materials that way. Imagine spraying the precursors to a PV cell, to a solar cell, onto a roof, and having it self-assemble into a layered structure that harvests light.Here's an interesting one for the IT world: bio-silicon. This is a diatom, which is made of silicates. And so silicon, which we make right now \u2014 it's part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips \u2014 this is a bio-mineralization process that's now being mimicked. This is at UC Santa Barbara. Look at these diatoms. This is from Ernst Haeckel's work. Imagine being able to \u2014 and, again, it's a templated process, and it solidifies out of a liquid process \u2014 imagine being able to have that sort of structure coming out at room temperature. Imagine being able to make perfect lenses. On the left, this is a brittle star; it's covered with lenses that the people at Lucent Technologies have found have no distortion whatsoever. It's one of the most distortion-free lenses we know of. And there's many of them, all over its entire body. What's interesting, again, is that it self-assembles. A woman named Joanna Aizenberg, at Lucent, is now learning to do this in a low-temperature process to create these sort of lenses. She's also looking at fiber optics. That's a sea sponge that has a fiber optic. Down at the very base of it, there's fiber optics that work better than ours, actually, to move light, but you can tie them in a knot; they're incredibly flexible.Here's another big idea: CO2 as a feedstock. A guy named Geoff Coates, at Cornell, said to himself, you know, plants do not see CO2 as the biggest poison of our time. We see it that way. Plants are busy making long chains of starches and glucose, right, out of CO2. He's found a way \u2014 he's found a catalyst \u2014 and he's found a way to take CO2 and make it into polycarbonates. Biodegradable plastics out of CO2 \u2014 how plant-like.Solar transformations: the most exciting one. There are people who are mimicking the energy-harvesting device inside of purple bacterium, the people at ASU. Even more interesting, lately, in the last couple of weeks, people have seen that there's an enzyme called hydrogenase that's able to evolve hydrogen from proton and electrons, and is able to take hydrogen up \u2014 basically what's happening in a fuel cell, in the anode of a fuel cell and in a reversible fuel cell. In our fuel cells, we do it with platinum; life does it with a very, very common iron. And a team has now just been able to mimic that hydrogen-juggling hydrogenase. That's very exciting for fuel cells \u2014 to be able to do that without platinum.Power of shape: here's a whale. We've seen that the fins of this whale have tubercles on them. And those little bumps actually increase efficiency in, for instance, the edge of an airplane \u2014 increase efficiency by about 32 percent. Which is an amazing fossil fuel savings, if we were to just put that on the edge of a wing. Color without pigments: this peacock is creating color with shape. Light comes through, it bounces back off the layers; it's called thin-film interference. Imagine being able to self-assemble products with the last few layers playing with light to create color. Imagine being able to create a shape on the outside of a surface, so that it's self-cleaning with just water. That's what a leaf does. See that up-close picture? That's a ball of water, and those are dirt particles. And that's an up-close picture of a lotus leaf. There's a company making a product called Lotusan, which mimics \u2014 when the building facade paint dries, it mimics the bumps in a self-cleaning leaf, and rainwater cleans the building.Water is going to be our big, grand challenge: quenching thirst. Here are two organisms that pull water. The one on the left is the Namibian beetle pulling water out of fog. The one on the right is a pill bug \u2014 pulls water out of air, does not drink fresh water. Pulling water out of Monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in Atlanta, before it gets into a building, are key technologies.Separation technologies are going to be extremely important. What if we were to say, no more hard rock mining? What if we were to separate out metals from waste streams, small amounts of metals in water? That's what microbes do; they chelate metals out of water. There's a company here in San Francisco called MR3 that is embedding mimics of the microbes' molecules on filters to mine waste streams. Green chemistry is chemistry in water. We do chemistry in organic solvents. This is a picture of the spinnerets coming out of a spider and the silk being formed from a spider. Isn't that beautiful? Green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature's recipe book. It's not easy, because life uses only a subset of the elements in the periodic table. And we use all of them, even the toxic ones. To figure out the elegant recipes that would take the small subset of the periodic table, and create miracle materials like that cell, is the task of green chemistry.Timed degradation: packaging that is good until you don't want it to be good anymore, and dissolves on cue. That's a mussel you can find in the waters out here, and the threads holding it to a rock are timed; at exactly two years, they begin to dissolve.Healing: this is a good one. That little guy over there is a tardigrade. There is a problem with vaccines around the world not getting to patients. And the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken; what's called the \"cold chain\" gets broken. A guy named Bruce Rosner looked at the tardigrade \u2014 which dries out completely, and yet stays alive for months and months and months, and is able to regenerate itself. And he found a way to dry out vaccines \u2014 encase them in the same sort of sugar capsules as the tardigrade has within its cells \u2014 meaning that vaccines no longer need to be refrigerated. They can be put in a glove compartment, OK. Learning from organisms. This is a session about water \u2014 learning about organisms that can do without water, in order to create a vaccine that lasts and lasts and lasts without refrigeration.I'm not going to get to 12. But what I am going to do is tell you that the most important thing, besides all of these adaptations, is the fact that these organisms have figured out a way to do the amazing things they do while taking care of the place that's going to take care of their offspring. When they're involved in foreplay, they're thinking about something very, very important \u2014 and that's having their genetic material remain, 10,000 generations from now. And that means finding a way to do what they do without destroying the place that'll take care of their offspring. That's the biggest design challenge. Luckily, there are millions and millions of geniuses willing to gift us with their best ideas. Good luck having a conversation with them.Thank you.(Applause)Chris Anderson: Talk about foreplay, I \u2014 we need to get to 12, but really quickly.Janine Benyus: Oh really? CA: Yeah. Just like, you know, like the 10-second version of 10, 11 and 12. Because we just \u2014 your slides are so gorgeous, and the ideas are so big, I can't stand to let you go down without seeing 10, 11 and 12.JB: OK, put this \u2014 OK, I'll just hold this thing. OK, great. OK, so that's the healing one. Sensing and responding: feedback is a huge thing. This is a locust. There can be 80 million of them in a square kilometer, and yet they don't collide with one another. And yet we have 3.6 million car collisions a year. (Laughter) Right. There's a person at Newcastle who has figured out that it's a very large neuron. And she's actually figuring out how to make a collision-avoidance circuitry based on this very large neuron in the locust.This is a huge and important one, number 11. And that's the growing fertility. That means, you know, net fertility farming. We should be growing fertility. And, oh yes \u2014 we get food, too. Because we have to grow the capacity of this planet to create more and more opportunities for life. And really, that's what other organisms do as well. In ensemble, that's what whole ecosystems do: they create more and more opportunities for life. Our farming has done the opposite. So, farming based on how a prairie builds soil, ranching based on how a native ungulate herd actually increases the health of the range, even wastewater treatment based on how a marsh not only cleans the water, but creates incredibly sparkling productivity.This is the simple design brief. I mean, it looks simple because the system, over 3.8 billion years, has worked this out. That is, those organisms that have not been able to figure out how to enhance or sweeten their places, are not around to tell us about it. That's the twelfth one. Life \u2014 and this is the secret trick; this is the magic trick \u2014 life creates conditions conducive to life. It builds soil; it cleans air; it cleans water; it mixes the cocktail of gases that you and I need to live. And it does that in the middle of having great foreplay and meeting their needs. So it's not mutually exclusive. We have to find a way to meet our needs, while making of this place an Eden.CA: Janine, thank you so much.

You haven't lived\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nuntil you've seen these guys do their courtship dance.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nI was on Bowman Lake in Glacier National Park,\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nwhich is a long, skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it,\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nand my partner and I have a rowing shell.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nAnd so we were rowing, and one of these Western Grebes came along.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nAnd what they do for their courtship dance is, they go together,\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nthe two of them, the two mates, and they begin to run underwater.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nThey paddle faster, and faster, and faster, until they're going so fast\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nthat they literally lift up out of the water,\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nand they're standing upright, sort of paddling the top of the water.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nAnd one of these Grebes came along while we were rowing.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nAnd so we're in a skull, and we're moving really, really quickly.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nAnd this Grebe, I think, sort of, mistaked us for a prospect,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nand started to run along the water next to us,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nin a courtship dance -- for miles.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nIt would stop, and then start, and then stop, and then start.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nNow that is foreplay.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nI came this close to changing species at that moment.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nObviously, life can teach us something\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nin the entertainment section. Life has a lot to teach us.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nBut what I'd like to talk about today\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nis what life might teach us in technology and in design.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nWhat's happened since the book came out --\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nthe book was mainly about research in biomimicry --\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nand what's happened since then is architects, designers, engineers --\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\npeople who make our world -- have started to call and say,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nwe want a biologist to sit at the design table\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nto help us, in real time, become inspired.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nOr -- and this is the fun part for me -- we want you to take us out\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\ninto the natural world. We'll come with a design challenge\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nand we find the champion adapters in the natural world, who might inspire us.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nSo this is a picture from a Galapagos trip that we took\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nwith some wastewater treatment engineers; they purify wastewater.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nAnd some of them were very resistant, actually, to being there.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nWhat they said to us at first was, you know, we already do biomimicry.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nWe use bacteria to clean our water. And we said,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nwell, that's not exactly being inspired by nature.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nThat's bioprocessing, you know; that's bio-assisted technology:\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nusing an organism to do your wastewater treatment\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nis an old, old technology called \"domestication.\"\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nThis is learning something, learning an idea, from an organism and then applying it.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nAnd so they still weren't getting it.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nSo we went for a walk on the beach and I said,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nwell, give me one of your big problems. Give me a design challenge,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nsustainability speed bump, that's keeping you from being sustainable.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nAnd they said scaling, which is the build-up of minerals inside of pipes.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nAnd they said, you know what happens is, mineral --\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\njust like at your house -- mineral builds up.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nAnd then the aperture closes, and we have to flush the pipes with toxins,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nor we have to dig them up.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nSo if we had some way to stop this scaling --\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nand so I picked up some shells on the beach. And I asked them,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nwhat is scaling? What's inside your pipes?\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nAnd they said, calcium carbonate.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nAnd I said, that's what this is; this is calcium carbonate.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nAnd they didn't know that.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nThey didn't know that what a seashell is,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nit's templated by proteins, and then ions from the seawater\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\ncrystallize in place to create a shell.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nSo the same sort of a process, without the proteins,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nis happening on the inside of their pipes. They didn't know.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nThis is not for lack of information; it's a lack of integration.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nYou know, it's a silo, people in silos. They didn't know\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nthat the same thing was happening. So one of them thought about it\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nand said, OK, well, if this is just crystallization\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nthat happens automatically out of seawater -- self-assembly --\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nthen why aren't shells infinite in size? What stops the scaling?\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nWhy don't they just keep on going?\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nAnd I said, well, in the same way\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nthat they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization --\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nand then they all sort of leaned in --\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nthey let go of a protein that stops the crystallization.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nIt literally adheres to the growing face of the crystal.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAnd, in fact, there is a product called TPA\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nthat's mimicked that protein -- that stop-protein --\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nand it's an environmentally friendly way to stop scaling in pipes.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nThat changed everything. From then on,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nyou could not get these engineers back in the boat.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nThe first day they would take a hike,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nand it was, click, click, click, click. Five minutes later they were back in the boat.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nWe're done. You know, I've seen that island.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAfter this,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nthey were crawling all over. They would snorkel\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nfor as long as we would let them snorkel.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nWhat had happened was that they realized that there were organisms\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nout there that had already solved the problems\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nthat they had spent their careers trying to solve.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nLearning about the natural world is one thing;\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nlearning from the natural world -- that's the switch.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nThat's the profound switch.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nWhat they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere;\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nthey just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:27.958\n3.8 billion years of field-testing.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\n10 to 30 -- Craig Venter will probably tell you;\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nI think there's a lot more than 30 million -- well-adapted solutions.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nThe important thing for me is that these are solutions solved in context.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nAnd the context is the Earth --\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nthe same context that we're trying to solve our problems in.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nSo it's the conscious emulation of life's genius.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nIt's not slavishly mimicking --\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nalthough Al is trying to get the hairdo going --\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nit's not a slavish mimicry; it's taking the design principles,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nthe genius of the natural world, and learning something from it.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nNow, in a group with so many IT people, I do have to mention what\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nI'm not going to talk about, and that is that your field\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nis one that has learned an enormous amount from living things,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.958\non the software side. So there's computers that protect themselves,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nlike an immune system, and we're learning from gene regulation\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nand biological development. And we're learning from neural nets,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\ngenetic algorithms, evolutionary computing.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nThat's on the software side. But what's interesting to me\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nis that we haven't looked at this, as much. I mean, these machines\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nare really not very high tech in my estimation\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nin the sense that there's dozens and dozens of carcinogens\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nin the water in Silicon Valley.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nSo the hardware\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nis not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nSo what can we learn about making -- not just computers, but everything?\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nThe plane you came in, cars, the seats that you're sitting on.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nHow do we redesign the world that we make, the human-made world?\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nMore importantly, what should we ask in the next 10 years?\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nAnd there's a lot of cool technologies out there that life has.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nWhat's the syllabus?\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nThree questions, for me, are key.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nHow does life make things?\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nThis is the opposite; this is how we make things.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nIt's called heat, beat and treat --\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nthat's what material scientists call it.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nAnd it's carving things down from the top, with 96 percent waste left over\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nand only 4 percent product. You heat it up; you beat it with high pressures;\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nyou use chemicals. OK. Heat, beat and treat.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nLife can't afford to do that. How does life make things?\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nHow does life make the most of things?\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nThat's a geranium pollen.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nAnd its shape is what gives it the function of being able\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nto tumble through air so easily. Look at that shape.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nLife adds information to matter.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nIn other words: structure.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nIt gives it information. By adding information to matter,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nit gives it a function that's different than without that structure.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nAnd thirdly, how does life make things disappear into systems?\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nBecause life doesn't really deal in things;\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nthere are no things in the natural world divorced\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nfrom their systems.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nReally quick syllabus.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nAs I'm reading more and more now, and following the story,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nthere are some amazing things coming up in the biological sciences.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nAnd at the same time, I'm listening to a lot of businesses\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nand finding what their sort of grand challenges are.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nThe two groups are not talking to each other.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nAt all.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nWhat in the world of biology might be helpful at this juncture,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nto get us through this sort of evolutionary knothole that we're in?\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nI'm going to try to go through 12, really quickly.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nOne that's exciting to me is self-assembly.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nNow, you've heard about this in terms of nanotechnology.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nBack to that shell: the shell is a self-assembling material.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nOn the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nforming out of seawater. It's a layered structure that's mineral\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nand then polymer, and it makes it very, very tough.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nIt's twice as tough as our high-tech ceramics.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nBut what's really interesting: unlike our ceramics that are in kilns,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nit happens in seawater. It happens near, in and near, the organism's body.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nThis is Sandia National Labs.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nA guy named Jeff Brinker\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nhas found a way to have a self-assembling coding process.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nImagine being able to make ceramics at room temperature\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nby simply dipping something into a liquid,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nlifting it out of the liquid, and having evaporation\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nforce the molecules in the liquid together,\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nso that they jigsaw together\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nin the same way as this crystallization works.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nImagine making all of our hard materials that way.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nImagine spraying the precursors to a PV cell, to a solar cell,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nonto a roof, and having it self-assemble into a layered structure that harvests light.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nHere's an interesting one for the IT world:\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nbio-silicon. This is a diatom, which is made of silicates.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nAnd so silicon, which we make right now --\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nit's part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips --\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nthis is a bio-mineralization process that's now being mimicked.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nThis is at UC Santa Barbara. Look at these diatoms.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nThis is from Ernst Haeckel's work.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nImagine being able to -- and, again, it's a templated process,\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nand it solidifies out of a liquid process -- imagine being able to have that\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nsort of structure coming out at room temperature.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nImagine being able to make perfect lenses.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nOn the left, this is a brittle star; it's covered with lenses\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nthat the people at Lucent Technologies have found\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nhave no distortion whatsoever.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nIt's one of the most distortion-free lenses we know of.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nAnd there's many of them, all over its entire body.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nWhat's interesting, again, is that it self-assembles.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nA woman named Joanna Aizenberg, at Lucent,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nis now learning to do this in a low-temperature process to create\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nthese sort of lenses. She's also looking at fiber optics.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nThat's a sea sponge that has a fiber optic.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nDown at the very base of it, there's fiber optics\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nthat work better than ours, actually, to move light,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nbut you can tie them in a knot; they're incredibly flexible.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nHere's another big idea: CO2 as a feedstock.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nA guy named Geoff Coates, at Cornell, said to himself,\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nyou know, plants do not see CO2 as the biggest poison of our time.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nWe see it that way. Plants are busy making long chains\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nof starches and glucose, right, out of CO2. He's found a way --\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nhe's found a catalyst -- and he's found a way to take CO2\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nand make it into polycarbonates. Biodegradable plastics\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nout of CO2 -- how plant-like.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nSolar transformations: the most exciting one.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nThere are people who are mimicking the energy-harvesting device\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:53.958\ninside of purple bacterium, the people at ASU. Even more interesting,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nlately, in the last couple of weeks, people have seen\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nthat there's an enzyme called hydrogenase that's able to evolve\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nhydrogen from proton and electrons, and is able to take hydrogen up --\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nbasically what's happening in a fuel cell, in the anode of a fuel cell\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nand in a reversible fuel cell.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nIn our fuel cells, we do it with platinum;\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nlife does it with a very, very common iron.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nAnd a team has now just been able to mimic\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nthat hydrogen-juggling hydrogenase.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nThat's very exciting for fuel cells --\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nto be able to do that without platinum.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nPower of shape: here's a whale. We've seen that the fins of this whale\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nhave tubercles on them. And those little bumps\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nactually increase efficiency in, for instance,\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nthe edge of an airplane -- increase efficiency by about 32 percent.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nWhich is an amazing fossil fuel savings,\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nif we were to just put that on the edge of a wing.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nColor without pigments: this peacock is creating color with shape.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nLight comes through, it bounces back off the layers;\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nit's called thin-film interference.

And this will be my only comment on it. And that is, I understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists. (Laughter)What I'm going to tell you about in my 18 minutes is how we're about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves. It's only 10 years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free-living organism, that of haemophilus influenzae. That took a genome project from 13 years down to four months. We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours. So in the last decade, a large number of genomes have been added: most human pathogens, a couple of plants, several insects and several mammals, including the human genome. Genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over 10 years ago was, by the end of this year, we might have between three and five genomes sequenced; it's on the order of several hundred. We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to sequence 130 genomes this year, as a side project from environmental organisms. So the rate of reading the genetic code has changed.But as we look, what's out there, we've barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet. Most people don't realize it, because they're invisible, but microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass, whereas all animals only make up about one one-thousandth of all the biomass. And maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often, but if you ever make it to the sea, and you swallow a mouthful of seawater, keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of 10 million viruses.Less than 5,000 microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago, and so we decided to do something about it. And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition, where we were, as with great oceanographic expeditions, trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles. We started in Bermuda for our test project, then moved up to Halifax, working down the U.S. East Coast, the Caribbean Sea, the Panama Canal, through to the Galapagos, then across the Pacific, and we're in the process now of working our way across the Indian Ocean. It's very tough duty; we're doing this on a sailing vessel, in part to help excite young people about going into science. The experiments are incredibly simple. We just take seawater and we filter it, and we collect different size organisms on different filters, and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville, where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every 24 hours. And with doing this, we've made some amazing discoveries.For example, it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes \u2014 there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments. It turns out, almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors, and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication. From one site, from one barrel of seawater, we discovered 1.3 million new genes and as many as 50,000 new species.We've extended this to the air now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation. We're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day, particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums. (Laughter) We filter through some simple apparatuses; we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in New York City. And we're in the process of sequencing all that at the present time.Just on the data collection side, just where we are through the Galapagos, we're finding that almost every 200 miles, we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean. Some of these make logical sense, in terms of different temperature gradients. So this is a satellite photograph based on temperatures \u2014 red being warm, blue being cold \u2014 and we found there's a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold water samples, in terms of abundant species. The other thing that surprised us quite a bit is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light, and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence. And these vary tremendously from region to region. Maybe not surprisingly, in the deep ocean, where it's mostly blue, the photoreceptors tend to see blue light. When there's a lot of chlorophyll around, they see a lot of green light. But they vary even more, possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet in the extremes.Just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was, we assembled all the data \u2014 including all of ours thus far from the expedition, which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet \u2014 and it totaled around 29 million genes. And we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are: Are we just discovering new members of known families, or are we discovering new families? And it turns out we have about 50,000 major gene families, but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families. So we're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes, components and life on this planet.When we look at the so-called evolutionary tree, we're up on the upper right-hand corner with the animals. Of those roughly 29 million genes, we only have around 24,000 in our genome. And if you take all animals together, we probably share less than 30,000 and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families. I view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution. And we think in a gene-centric view \u2014 maybe going back to Richard Dawkins' ideas \u2014 than in a genome-centric view, which are different constructs of these gene components.Synthetic DNA, the ability to synthesize DNA, has changed at sort of the same pace that DNA sequencing has over the last decade or two, and is getting very rapid and very cheap. Our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in 1995, and that from mycoplasma genitalium. And we have really nice T-shirts that say, you know, \"I heart my genitalium.\" This is actually just a microorganism. But it has roughly 500 genes. Haemophilus had 1,800 genes. And we simply asked the question, if one species needs 800, another 500, is there a smaller set of genes that might comprise a minimal operating system?So we started doing transposon mutagenesis. Transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly insert in the genetic code. And if they insert in the middle of the gene, they disrupt its function. So we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those \"non-essential genes.\" But it turns out the environment is very critical for this, and you can only define an essential or non-essential gene based on exactly what's in the environment. We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of 13 related organisms, and we tried to compare all of those, to see what they had in common. And we got these overlapping circles. And we found only 173 genes common to all 13 organisms. The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite; it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around 310 or so. So we think that we can expand or contract genomes, depending on your point of view here, to maybe 300 to 400 genes from the minimal of 500.The only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them, and we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion. We found that synthesizing accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult. Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison, my colleagues on this, developed an exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize a 5,000-base pair virus in only a two-week period that was 100 percent accurate, in terms of its sequence and its biology. It was a quite exciting experiment \u2014 when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA, injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden, that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria. This was not the first synthetic virus \u2014 a polio virus had been made a year before \u2014 but it was only one ten-thousandth as active and it took three years to do. This is a cartoon of the structure of phi X 174. This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware, and that's the notions that we have with biology.People immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare, and I had recent testimony before a Senate committee, and a special committee the U.S. government has set up to review this area. And I think it's important to keep reality in mind, versus what happens with people's imaginations. Basically, any virus that's been sequenced today \u2014 that genome can be made. And people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox, but the DNA from this organism is not infective. So even if somebody made the smallpox genome, that DNA itself would not cause infections. The real concern that security departments have is designer viruses. And there's only two countries, the U.S. and the former Soviet Union, that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents. If that research is truly discontinued, there should be very little activity on the know-how to make designer viruses in the future.I think single-cell organisms are possible within two years. And possibly eukaryotic cells, those that we have, are possible within a decade. So we're now making several dozen different constructs, because we can vary the cassettes and the genes that go into this artificial chromosome. The key is, how do you put all of the others? We start with these fragments, and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembles those into a chromosome.This is derived from an organism, deinococcus radiodurans, that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed. It reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about 12 to 24 hours, after its chromosomes are literally blown apart. This organism is ubiquitous on the planet, and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there. This is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation. The glass started to burn and crack, while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier. Here's an actual picture of what happens: the top of this shows the genome after 1.7 million rads of radiation. The chromosome is literally blown apart. And here's that same DNA automatically reassembled 24 hours later. It's truly stunning that these organisms can do that, and we probably have thousands, if not tens of thousands, of different species on this planet that are capable of doing that. After these genomes are synthesized, the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome.So we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential, not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues. For example, from the third organism we sequenced, Methanococcus jannaschii \u2014 it lives in boiling water temperatures; its energy source is hydrogen and all its carbon comes from CO2 it captures back from the environment. So we know lots of different pathways, thousands of different organisms now that live off of CO2, and can capture that back. So instead of using carbon from oil for synthetic processes, we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere, converting that into biopolymers or other products. We have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide, and we use as a reducing power to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Also, there's numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane. And DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway to capture and convert the methane from the gas fields there into useful products.Within a short while, I think there's going to be a new field called \"Combinatorial Genomics,\" because with these new synthesis capabilities, these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination, we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day. And therefore, as with all biology, you get selection through screening, whether you're screening for hydrogen production, or chemical production, or just viability. To understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach.We're trying to modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight. Photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen, and we have an oxygen-insensitive hydrogenase that we think will totally change this process. We're also combining cellulases, the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars and fermentation in the same cell for producing ethanol. Pharmaceutical production is already under way in major laboratories using microbes. The chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best chemists can produce. I think future engineered species could be the source of food, hopefully a source of energy, environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry.Let me just close with ethical and policy studies. We delayed the start of our experiments in 1999 until we completed a year-and-a-half bioethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species. Every major religion participated in this. It was actually a very strange study, because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books, and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life, so it must be OK. The only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this, but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them.Right now the Sloan Foundation has just funded a multi-institutional study on this, to work out what the risk and benefits to society are, and the rules that scientific teams such as my own should be using in this area, and we're trying to set good examples as we go forward. These are complex issues. Except for the threat of bio-terrorism, they're very simple issues in terms of, can we design things to produce clean energy, perhaps revolutionizing what developing countries can do and provide through various simple processes.

00:00:16.958\nabout my comments about the aging debate.\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nAnd this will be my only comment on it.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nAnd that is, I understand\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nthat optimists greatly outlive pessimists.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:26.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nWhat I'm going to tell you about in my 18 minutes is\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nhow we're about to switch from reading the genetic code\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nto the first stages of beginning\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nto write the code ourselves.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nIt's only 10 years ago this month\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nwhen we published the first sequence\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nof a free-living organism,\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nthat of haemophilus influenzae.\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nThat took a genome project\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nfrom 13 years down to four months.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nWe can now do that same genome project\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nin the order of\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\ntwo to eight hours.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nSo in the last decade, a large number of genomes have been added:\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nmost human pathogens,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\na couple of plants,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nseveral insects and several mammals,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nincluding the human genome.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nGenomics at this stage of the thinking\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nfrom a little over 10 years ago\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nwas, by the end of this year, we might have\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nbetween three and five genomes sequenced;\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nit's on the order of several hundred.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nWe just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nto sequence 130 genomes this year,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nas a side project from environmental organisms.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nSo the rate of reading the genetic code has changed.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nBut as we look, what's out there,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nwe've barely scratched the surface\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:48.958\non what is available on this planet.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nMost people don't realize it, because they're invisible,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nbut microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nwhereas all animals only make up about\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\none one-thousandth of all the biomass.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nAnd maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nbut if you ever make it to the sea,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nand you swallow a mouthful of seawater,\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nkeep in mind that each milliliter\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nhas about a million bacteria\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nand on the order of 10 million viruses.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nLess than 5,000 microbial species\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nhave been characterized as of two years ago,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nand so we decided to do something about it.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nAnd we started the Sorcerer II Expedition,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nwhere we were, as with great oceanographic expeditions,\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\ntrying to sample the ocean every 200 miles.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nWe started in Bermuda for our test project,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nthen moved up to Halifax,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nworking down the U.S. East Coast,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nthe Caribbean Sea, the Panama Canal,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nthrough to the Galapagos, then across the Pacific,\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nand we're in the process now of working our way\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nacross the Indian Ocean.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nIt's very tough duty; we're doing this on a sailing vessel,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nin part to help excite young people\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nabout going into science.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nThe experiments are incredibly simple.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nWe just take seawater and we filter it,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nand we collect different size organisms on different filters,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nand then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nwhere we can sequence a hundred million letters\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nof the genetic code every 24 hours.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nAnd with doing this,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nwe've made some amazing discoveries.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nFor example, it was thought that the visual pigments\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nthat are in our eyes -- there was only one or two organisms\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nin the environment that had these same pigments.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nIt turns out, almost every species\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nin the upper parts of the ocean\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nin warm parts of the world\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nhave these same photoreceptors,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nand use sunlight as the source of their energy\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nand communication.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nFrom one site, from one barrel of seawater,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nwe discovered 1.3 million new genes\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nand as many as 50,000 new species.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nWe've extended this to the air\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nnow with a grant from the Sloan Foundation.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nWe're measuring how many viruses and bacteria\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nall of us are breathing in and out every day,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nparticularly on airplanes\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nor closed auditoriums.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nWe filter through some simple apparatuses;\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nwe collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nfiltering on top of a building in New York City.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nAnd we're in the process of sequencing all that\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nat the present time.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nJust on the data collection side,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\njust where we are through the Galapagos,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nwe're finding that almost every 200 miles,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nwe see tremendous diversity\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nin the samples in the ocean.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nSome of these make logical sense,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nin terms of different temperature gradients.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nSo this is a satellite photograph\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nbased on temperatures -- red being warm,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nblue being cold --\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nand we found there's a tremendous difference between\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nthe warm water samples and the cold water samples,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nin terms of abundant species.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nThe other thing that surprised us quite a bit\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nis these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nand we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nAnd these vary tremendously from region to region.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nMaybe not surprisingly,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nin the deep ocean, where it's mostly blue,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nthe photoreceptors tend to see blue light.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nWhen there's a lot of chlorophyll around,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nthey see a lot of green light.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nBut they vary even more,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\npossibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nin the extremes.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nJust to try and get an assessment\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nof what our gene repertoire was,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nwe assembled all the data --\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nincluding all of ours thus far from the expedition,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nwhich represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet --\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nand it totaled around 29 million genes.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nAnd we tried to put these into gene families\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nto see what these discoveries are:\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nAre we just discovering new members of known families,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nor are we discovering new families?\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nAnd it turns out we have about 50,000\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nmajor gene families,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nbut every new sample we take in the environment\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nadds in a linear fashion to these new families.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nSo we're at the earliest stages of discovery\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nabout basic genes,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\ncomponents and life on this planet.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nWhen we look at the so-called evolutionary tree,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nwe're up on the upper right-hand corner with the animals.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nOf those roughly 29 million genes,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nwe only have around 24,000\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nin our genome.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nAnd if you take all animals together,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nwe probably share less than 30,000\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nand probably maybe a dozen\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nor more thousand different gene families.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nI view that these genes are now\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nnot only the design components of evolution.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nAnd we think in a gene-centric view --\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nmaybe going back to Richard Dawkins' ideas --\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nthan in a genome-centric view,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nwhich are different constructs of these gene components.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nSynthetic DNA, the ability to synthesize DNA,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nhas changed at sort of the same pace\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nthat DNA sequencing has\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nover the last decade or two,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nand is getting very rapid and very cheap.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nOur first thought about synthetic genomics came\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nwhen we sequenced the second genome back in 1995,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nand that from mycoplasma genitalium.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nAnd we have really nice T-shirts that say,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nyou know, \"I heart my genitalium.\"\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nThis is actually just a microorganism.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nBut it has roughly 500 genes.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nHaemophilus had 1,800 genes.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nAnd we simply asked the question,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nif one species needs 800, another 500,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nis there a smaller set of genes\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nthat might comprise a minimal operating system?\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nSo we started doing transposon mutagenesis.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nTransposons are just small pieces of DNA\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nthat randomly insert in the genetic code.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nAnd if they insert in the middle of the gene, they disrupt its function.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nSo we made a map of all the genes\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nthat could take transposon insertions\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nand we called those \"non-essential genes.\"\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nBut it turns out the environment is very critical for this,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nand you can only\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\ndefine an essential or non-essential gene\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nbased on exactly what's in the environment.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nWe also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nwith the genomes of 13 related organisms,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nand we tried to compare all of those, to see what they had in common.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nAnd we got these overlapping circles. And we found only 173 genes\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\ncommon to all 13 organisms.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nThe pool expanded a little bit if we ignored\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\none intracellular parasite;\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nit expanded even more\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nwhen we looked at core sets of genes\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nof around 310 or so.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nSo we think that we can expand\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nor contract genomes, depending on your point of view here,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nto maybe 300 to 400 genes\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nfrom the minimal of 500.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nThe only way to prove these ideas\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nwas to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them,\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nand we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nWe found that synthesizing accurate DNA\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nin large pieces was extremely difficult.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nHam Smith and Clyde Hutchison, my colleagues on this,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\ndeveloped an exciting new method\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nthat allowed us to synthesize a 5,000-base pair virus\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nin only a two-week period\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nthat was 100 percent accurate,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nin terms of its sequence and its biology.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nIt was a quite exciting experiment -- when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\ninjected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nthat DNA started driving the production of the virus particles\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nthat turned around and then killed the bacteria.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nThis was not the first synthetic virus --\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\na polio virus had been made a year before --\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nbut it was only one ten-thousandth as active\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nand it took three years to do.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nThis is a cartoon of the structure of phi X 174.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nThis is a case where the software now builds its own hardware,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nand that's the notions that we have with biology.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nPeople immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nand I had recent testimony before a Senate committee,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nand a special committee the U.S. government has set up\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nto review this area.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nAnd I think it's important to keep reality in mind,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nversus what happens with people's imaginations.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nBasically, any virus that's been sequenced today --\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nthat genome can be made.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nAnd people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nbut the DNA from this organism is not infective.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nSo even if somebody made the smallpox genome,\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nthat DNA itself would not cause infections.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nThe real concern that security departments have\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nis designer viruses.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAnd there's only two countries, the U.S. and the former Soviet Union,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nthat had major efforts\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\non trying to create biological warfare agents.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nIf that research is truly discontinued,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nthere should be very little activity\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:58.958\non the know-how to make designer viruses in the future.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nI think single-cell organisms are possible within two years.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nAnd possibly eukaryotic cells,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nthose that we have,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nare possible within a decade.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nSo we're now making several dozen different constructs,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nbecause we can vary the cassettes and the genes\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nthat go into this artificial chromosome.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nThe key is, how do you put all of the others?\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nWe start with these fragments,\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nand then we have a homologous recombination system\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nthat reassembles those into a chromosome.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nThis is derived from an organism, deinococcus radiodurans,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nthat can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nIt reassembles its genome after this radiation burst\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nin about 12 to 24 hours,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nafter its chromosomes are literally blown apart.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nThis organism is ubiquitous on the planet,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nand exists perhaps now\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nin outer space due to all our travel there.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nThis is a glass beaker after\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nabout half a million rads of radiation.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nThe glass started to burn and crack,\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nwhile the microbes sitting in the bottom\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\njust got happier and happier.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nHere's an actual picture of what happens:\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nthe top of this shows the genome\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nafter 1.7 million rads of radiation.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nThe chromosome is literally blown apart.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nAnd here's that same DNA automatically reassembled\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\n24 hours later.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nIt's truly stunning that these organisms can do that,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nand we probably have thousands,\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nif not tens of thousands, of different species\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\non this planet that are capable of doing that.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nAfter these genomes are synthesized,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nthe first step is just transplanting them\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:39.958\ninto a cell without a genome.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nSo we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nnot only for understanding the basis of biology\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nbut for hopefully environmental and society issues.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nFor example, from the third organism we sequenced,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nMethanococcus jannaschii -- it lives in boiling water temperatures;\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nits energy source is hydrogen\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nand all its carbon comes from CO2 it captures back from the environment.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nSo we know lots of different pathways,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nthousands of different organisms now\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nthat live off of CO2,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nand can capture that back.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nSo instead of using carbon from oil\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nfor synthetic processes,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nwe have the chance of using carbon\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nand capturing it back from the atmosphere,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nconverting that into biopolymers\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nor other products.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nWe have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nand we use as a reducing power\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nto split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nAlso, there's numerous pathways\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nthat can be engineered metabolizing methane.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nAnd DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nto capture and convert the methane\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nfrom the gas fields there into useful products.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nWithin a short while, I think there's going to be a new field\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\ncalled \"Combinatorial Genomics,\"\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nbecause with these new synthesis capabilities,\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nthese vast gene array repertoires\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nand the homologous recombination,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nwe think we can design a robot to make\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nmaybe a million different chromosomes a day.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nAnd therefore, as with all biology,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nyou get selection through screening,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nwhether you're screening for hydrogen production,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nor chemical production, or just viability.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nTo understand the role of these genes\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nis going to be well within reach.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nWe're trying to modify photosynthesis\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nto produce hydrogen directly from sunlight.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nPhotosynthesis is modulated by oxygen,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nand we have an oxygen-insensitive hydrogenase\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nthat we think will totally change this process.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nWe're also combining cellulases,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nthe enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nand fermentation in the same cell\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nfor producing ethanol.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nPharmaceutical production is already under way\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nin major laboratories\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nusing microbes.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nThe chemistry from compounds in the environment\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nis orders of magnitude more complex\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nthan our best chemists can produce.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nI think future engineered species\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\ncould be the source of food,\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nhopefully a source of energy,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nenvironmental remediation\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nand perhaps\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nreplacing the petrochemical industry.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nLet me just close with ethical and policy studies.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nWe delayed the start of our experiments in 1999\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nuntil we completed a year-and-a-half bioethical review\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nas to whether we should try and make an artificial species.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nEvery major religion participated in this.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nIt was actually a very strange study,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nbecause the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books,\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nand they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life,\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nso it must be OK. The only ultimate concerns\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nwere biological warfare aspects of this,\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nbut gave us the go ahead to start these experiments\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nfor the reasons we were doing them.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nRight now the Sloan Foundation has just funded\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\na multi-institutional study on this,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nto work out what the risk and benefits to society are,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nand the rules that scientific teams such as my own\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nshould be using in this area,\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nand we're trying to set good examples as we go forward.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nThese are complex issues.\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nExcept for the threat of bio-terrorism,\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nthey're very simple issues in terms of,\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:26.958\ncan we design things to produce clean energy,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nperhaps revolutionizing\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nwhat developing countries can do\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nand provide through various simple processes.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nThank you very much."}, {"title": "Software (as) art", "duration": "893", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/golan_levin_on_software_as_art", "transcript": "Imagine spending seven years at MIT and research laboratories, only to find out that you're a performance artist.(Laughter)I'm also a software engineer, and I make lots of different kinds of art with the computer. And I think the main thing that I'm interested in is trying to find a way of making the computer into a personal mode of expression. And many of you out there are the heads of Macromedia and Microsoft, and in a way those are my bane: I think there's a great homogenizing force that software imposes on people and limits the way they think about what's possible on the computer. Of course, it's also a great liberating force that makes possible, you know, publishing and so forth, and standards, and so on. But, in a way, the computer makes possible much more than what most people think, and my art has just been about trying to find a personal way of using the computer, and so I end up writing software to do that.Chris has asked me to do a short performance, and so I'm going to take just this time \u2014 maybe 10 minutes \u2014 to do that, and hopefully at the end have just a moment to show you a couple of my other projects in video form.Thank you.(Applause)We've got about a minute left. I'd just like to show a clip from a most recent project. I did a performance with two singers who specialize in making strange noises with their mouths. And this just came off last September at ARS Electronica; we repeated it in England. And the idea is to visualize their speech and song behind them with a large screen. We used a computer vision tracking system in order to know where they were. And since we know where their heads are, and we have a wireless mic on them that we're processing the sound from, we're able to create visualizations which are linked very tightly to what they're doing with their speech.

It's kind of a well-kept secret. This species lives only in the Congo. And they're not in too many zoos, because of their sexual behavior. Their sexual behavior is too human-like for most of us to be comfortable with.(Laughter)But \u2014(Laughter)actually, we have a lot to learn from them, because they're a very egalitarian society and they're a very empathetic society. And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they sort of set aside. It permeates their entire life. And it's used for communication. And it's used for conflict resolution. And I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of, divided our lives up into lots of parts. We divided our world up with lots of categories. And so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit. But I don't think that we were that way initially.There are many people who think that the animal world is hard-wired and that there's something very, very special about man. Maybe it's his ability to have causal thought. Maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to have language. Maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics. Well, I don't know. There were Tasmanians who were discovered around the 1600s and they had no fire. They had no stone tools. To our knowledge they had no music. So when you compare them to the Bonobo, the Bonobo is a little hairier. He doesn't stand quite as upright. But there are a lot of similarities. And I think that as we look at culture, we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are. And I don't really think it's in our biology; I think we've attributed it to our biology, but I don't really think it's there.So what I want to do now is introduce you to a species called the Bonobo. This is Kanzi. He's a Bonobo. Right now, he's in a forest in Georgia. His mother originally came from a forest in Africa. And she came to us when she was just at puberty, about six or seven years of age.Now this shows a Bonobo on your right, and a chimpanzee on your left. Clearly, the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking. The Bonobo, although shorter than us and their arms still longer, is more upright, just as we are. This shows the Bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy. As you can see, there's not a lot of difference between the way a Bonobo walks and the way an early australopithecine would have walked. As they turn toward us you'll see that the pelvic area of early australopithecines is a little flatter and doesn't have to rotate quite so much from side to side. So the \u2014 the bipedal gait is a little easier. And now we see all four.Video: Narrator: The wild Bonobo lives in central Africa, in the jungle encircled by the Congo River. Canopied trees as tall as 40 meters, 130 feet, grow densely in the area. It was a Japanese scientist who first undertook serious field studies of the Bonobo, almost three decades ago. Bonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee. Slim-bodied, Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures. Long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them. One discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally. What's more, they are able to walk upright for long distances. Susan Savage-Rumbaugh (video): Let's go say hello to Austin first and then go to the A frame.SS: This is Kanzi and I, in the forest. None of the things you will see in this particular video are trained. None of them are tricks. They all happened to be captured on film spontaneously, by NHK of Japan. We have eight Bonobos.Video: Look at all this stuff that's here for our campfire.SS: An entire family at our research centre.Video: You going to help get some sticks? Good. We need more sticks, too. I have a lighter in my pocket if you need one. That's a wasps' nest. You can get it out. I hope I have a lighter. You can use the lighter to start the fire.SS: So Kanzi is very interested in fire. He doesn't do it yet without a lighter, but I think if he saw someone do it, he might be able to do \u2014 make a fire without a lighter. He's learning about how to keep a fire going. He's learning the uses for a fire, just by watching what we do with fire.(Laughter)This is a smile on the face of a Bonobo. These are happy vocalizations.Video: You're happy. You're very happy about this part. You've got to put some water on the fire. You see the water? Good job.SS: Forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack. But he likes to carry things from place to place.Video: Austin, I hear you saying \"Austin.\"SS: He talks to other Bonobos at the lab, long-distance, farther than we can hear. This is his sister. This is her first time to try to drive a golf cart.Video: Goodbye.(Laughter)SS: She's got the pedals down, but not the wheel. She switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel, rather than turns it.(Laughter)Like us, she knows that that individual in the mirror is her.(Music)Video: Narrator: By raising Bonobos in a culture that is both Bonobo and human, and documenting their development across two decades, scientists are exploring how cultural forces(Laughter)may have operated during human evolution.His name is Nyota. It means \"star\" in Swahili.(Music)Panbanisha is trying to give Nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors. In the wild, the parent Bonobo is known to groom its offspring. Here Panbanisha uses scissors, instead of her hands, to groom Nyota. Very impressive. Subtle maneuvering of the hands is required to perform delicate tasks like this. Nyota tries to imitate Panbanisha by using the scissors himself. Realizing that Nyota might get hurt, Panbanisha, like any human mother, carefully tugs to get the scissors back.He can now cut through tough animal hide.SS: Kanzi's learned to make stone tools.Video: Kanzi now makes his tools, just as our ancestors may have made them, two-and-a-half million years ago \u2014 by holding the rocks in both hands, to strike one against the other. He has learned that by using both hands and aiming his glancing blows, he can make much larger, sharper flakes. Kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough. The tough hide is difficult to cut, even with a knife. The rock that Kanzi is using is extremely hard and ideal for stone tool making, but difficult to handle, requiring great skill. Kanzi's rock is from Gona, Ethiopia and is identical to that used by our African ancestors two-and-a-half million years ago. These are the rocks Kanzi used and these are the flakes he made. The flat sharp edges are like knife blades. Compare them to the tools our ancestors used; they bear a striking resemblance to Kanzi's.Panbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods. She keeps staring out the window.SS: This is \u2014 let me show you something we didn't think they would do.Video: For several days now, Panbanisha has not been outside.SS: I normally talk about language.Video: Then Panbanisha does something unexpected.SS: But since I'm advised not to do what I normally do, I haven't told you that these apes have language. It's a geometric language.Video: She takes a piece of chalk and begins writing something on the floor. What is she writing?SS: She's also saying the name of that, with her voice.Video: Now she comes up to Dr. Sue and starts writing again.SS: These are her symbols on her keyboard.(Music)They speak when she touches them.Video: Panbanisha is communicating to Dr. Sue where she wants to go. \"A frame\" represents a hut in the woods. Compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard. Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor. SS (video): Very nice. Beautiful, Panbanisha.SS: At first we didn't really realize what she was doing, until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it.Video: This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods. The curved line is very similar to the lexigram. The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents \"collar.\" It indicates the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she goes out.SS: That's an institutional requirement.Video: This symbol is not as clear as the others, but one can see Panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line and several straight lines. Researchers began to record what Panbanisha said, by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk. Panbanisha watched. Soon she began to write as well. The Bonobo's abilities have stunned scientists around the world. How did they develop?SS (video): We found that the most important thing for permitting Bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them. It's simply to use language around them, because the driving force in language acquisition is to understand what others, that are important to you, are saying to you. Once you have that capacity, the ability to produce language comes rather naturally and rather freely. So we want to create an environment in which Bonobos, like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting \u2014 we want to create an environment in which they have fun, and an environment in which the others are meaningful individuals for them. Narrator: This environment brings out unexpected potential in Kanzi and Panbanisha.Panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica, until Nyota, now one year old, steals it. Then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth. Is he looking for where the sound came from? Dr. Sue thinks it's important to allow such curiosity to flourish. This time Panbanisha is playing the electric piano. She wasn't forced to learn the piano; she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest.Researcher: Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm listening. Do that real fast part that you did. Yeah, that part.Narrator: Kanzi plays the xylophone; using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies Dr. Sue's singing. Kanzi and Panbanisha are stimulated by this fun-filled environment, which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities.(Laughter)Researcher: OK, now get the monsters. Get them. Take the cherries too. Now watch out, stay away from them now. Now you can chase them again. Time to chase them. Now you have to stay away. Get away. Run away. Run. Now we can chase them again. Go get them. Oh no! Good Kanzi. Very good. Thank you so much.Narrator: None of us, Bonobo or human, can possibly even imagine?SS: So we have a bi-species environment, we call it a \"panhomoculture.\" We're learning how to become like them. We're learning how to communicate with them, in really high-pitched tones. We're learning that they probably have a language in the wild. And they're learning to become like us. Because we believe that it's not biology; it's culture. So we're sharing tools and technology and language with another species.Thank you.", "id": 76, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nI work with a species called \"Bonobo.\"\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nAnd I'm happy most of the time,\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nbecause I think this is the happiest species on the planet.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nIt's kind of a well-kept secret.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nThis species lives only in the Congo.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nAnd they're not in too many zoos, because of their sexual behavior.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nTheir sexual behavior is too human-like\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nfor most of us to be comfortable with.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:35.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nBut --\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nactually, we have a lot to learn from them, because they're a very\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:46.958\negalitarian society and they're a very empathetic society.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nAnd sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nthat they sort of set aside.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nIt permeates their entire life.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nAnd it's used for communication.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nAnd it's used for conflict resolution.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nAnd I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of,\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\ndivided our lives up into lots of parts.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nWe divided our world up with lots of categories.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nAnd so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nBut I don't think that we were that way initially.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nThere are many people who think that the animal world is hard-wired\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nand that there's something very, very special about man.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nMaybe it's his ability to have causal thought.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nMaybe it's something special in his brain\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nthat allows him to have language.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nMaybe it's something special in his brain\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nthat allows him to make tools or to have mathematics.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nWell, I don't know.

00:04:21.958\nSlim-bodied, Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nLong and careful studies have reported many new findings on them.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nOne discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nWhat's more, they are able to walk upright for long distances.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nSusan Savage-Rumbaugh (video): Let's go say hello to Austin first and then go to the A frame.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nSS: This is Kanzi and I, in the forest.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nNone of the things you will see in this particular video are trained.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nNone of them are tricks.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nThey all happened to be captured on film spontaneously,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nby NHK of Japan.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nWe have eight Bonobos.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nVideo: Look at all this stuff that's here for our campfire.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nSS: An entire family at our research centre.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nVideo: You going to help get some sticks?\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nGood.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nWe need more sticks, too.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nI have a lighter in my pocket if you need one.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nThat's a wasps' nest.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nYou can get it out.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nI hope I have a lighter.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nYou can use the lighter to start the fire.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nSS: So Kanzi is very interested in fire.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nHe doesn't do it yet without a lighter,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nbut I think if he saw someone do it, he might be able to do --\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nmake a fire without a lighter.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nHe's learning about how to keep a fire going.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nHe's learning the uses for a fire,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\njust by watching what we do with fire.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nThis is a smile on the face of a Bonobo.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nThese are happy vocalizations.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nVideo: You're happy.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nYou're very happy about this part.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nYou've got to put some water on the fire. You see the water?\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nGood job.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nSS: Forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nBut he likes to carry things from place to place.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nVideo: Austin, I hear you saying \"Austin.\"\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nSS: He talks to other Bonobos at the lab, long-distance,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nfarther than we can hear.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nThis is his sister.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nThis is her first time to try to drive a golf cart.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nVideo: Goodbye.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nSS: She's got the pedals down, but not the wheel.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nShe switches from reverse to forward\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nand she holds onto the wheel, rather than turns it.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nLike us, she knows that that individual in the mirror is her.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:40.958\n(Music)\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nVideo: Narrator: By raising Bonobos in a culture that is both Bonobo and human,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nand documenting their development across two decades,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nscientists are exploring how cultural forces\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nmay have operated during human evolution.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nHis name is Nyota.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nIt means \"star\" in Swahili.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:09.958\n(Music)\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nPanbanisha is trying to give Nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nIn the wild, the parent Bonobo is known to groom its offspring.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nHere Panbanisha uses scissors, instead of her hands,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nto groom Nyota.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nVery impressive.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nSubtle maneuvering of the hands is required\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nto perform delicate tasks like this.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nNyota tries to imitate Panbanisha by using the scissors himself.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nRealizing that Nyota might get hurt,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nPanbanisha, like any human mother,\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:08.958\ncarefully tugs to get the scissors back.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nHe can now cut through tough animal hide.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nSS: Kanzi's learned to make stone tools.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nVideo: Kanzi now makes his tools,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\njust as our ancestors may have made them,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\ntwo-and-a-half million years ago --\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nby holding the rocks in both hands, to strike one against the other.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nHe has learned that by using both hands\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nand aiming his glancing blows,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nhe can make much larger, sharper flakes.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nKanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nThe tough hide is difficult to cut, even with a knife.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nThe rock that Kanzi is using is extremely hard\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nand ideal for stone tool making, but difficult to handle,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nrequiring great skill.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nKanzi's rock is from Gona, Ethiopia\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nand is identical to that used by our African ancestors\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\ntwo-and-a-half million years ago.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nThese are the rocks Kanzi used\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nand these are the flakes he made.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nThe flat sharp edges are like knife blades.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nCompare them to the tools our ancestors used;\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nthey bear a striking resemblance to Kanzi's.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nPanbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nShe keeps staring out the window.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nSS: This is -- let me show you something we didn't think they would do.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nVideo: For several days now, Panbanisha has not been outside.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nSS: I normally talk about language.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nVideo: Then Panbanisha does something unexpected.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nSS: But since I'm advised not to do what I normally do,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nI haven't told you that these apes have language.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nIt's a geometric language.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nVideo: She takes a piece of chalk\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nand begins writing something on the floor.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nWhat is she writing?\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nSS: She's also saying the name of that, with her voice.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nVideo: Now she comes up to Dr. Sue and starts writing again.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nSS: These are her symbols on her keyboard.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:37.958\n(Music)\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nThey speak when she touches them.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nVideo: Panbanisha is communicating to Dr. Sue where she wants to go.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:46.958\n\"A frame\" represents a hut in the woods.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nCompare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nPanbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nSS (video): Very nice. Beautiful, Panbanisha.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nSS: At first we didn't really realize what she was doing,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nuntil we stood back and looked at it and rotated it.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nVideo: This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nThe curved line is very similar to the lexigram.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nThe next symbol Panbanisha writes represents \"collar.\"\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nIt indicates the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she goes out.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nSS: That's an institutional requirement.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nVideo: This symbol is not as clear as the others,\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nbut one can see Panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nand several straight lines.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nResearchers began to record what Panbanisha said,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nby writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nPanbanisha watched.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nSoon she began to write as well.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nThe Bonobo's abilities have stunned scientists around the world.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nHow did they develop?\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nSS (video): We found that the most important thing\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nfor permitting Bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nIt's simply to use language around them,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nbecause the driving force in language acquisition\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nis to understand what others, that are important to you, are saying to you.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nOnce you have that capacity,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nthe ability to produce language\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:33.958\ncomes rather naturally and rather freely.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nSo we want to create an environment in which Bonobos,\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nlike all of the individuals with whom they are interacting --\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nwe want to create an environment in which they have fun,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nand an environment in which the others\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nare meaningful individuals for them.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nNarrator: This environment brings out unexpected potential\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nin Kanzi and Panbanisha.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nPanbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nuntil Nyota, now one year old, steals it.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nThen he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nIs he looking for where the sound came from?\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nDr. Sue thinks it's important to allow such curiosity to flourish.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nThis time Panbanisha is playing the electric piano.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nShe wasn't forced to learn the piano;\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nshe saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nResearcher: Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm listening.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nDo that real fast part that you did. Yeah, that part.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nNarrator: Kanzi plays the xylophone;\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nusing both hands he enthusiastically accompanies Dr. Sue's singing.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nKanzi and Panbanisha\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nare stimulated by this fun-filled environment,\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nwhich promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nResearcher: OK, now get the monsters. Get them.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nTake the cherries too.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nNow watch out, stay away from them now.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nNow you can chase them again. Time to chase them.\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nNow you have to stay away. Get away.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nRun away. Run.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nNow we can chase them again. Go get them.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nOh no!\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nGood Kanzi. Very good. Thank you so much.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nNarrator: None of us, Bonobo or human, can possibly even imagine?\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nSS: So we have a bi-species environment, we call it a \"panhomoculture.\"\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nWe're learning how to become like them.\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nWe're learning how to communicate with them,\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nin really high-pitched tones.\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nWe're learning that they probably have a language in the wild.\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nAnd they're learning to become like us.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nBecause we believe that it's not biology; it's culture.\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nSo we're sharing tools and technology and language\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nwith another species.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nThank you."}, {"title": "The story of life in photographs", "duration": "977", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/frans_lanting_s_lyrical_nature_photos", "transcript": "Nature's my muse and it's been my passion. As a photographer for National Geographic, I've portrayed it for many. But five years ago, I went on a personal journey. I wanted to visualize the story of life. It's the hardest thing I've ever attempted, and there have been plenty of times when I felt like backing out. But there were also revelations. And one of those I'd like to share with you today.I went down to a remote lagoon in Australia, hoping to see the Earth the way it was three billion years ago, back before the sky turned blue. There's stromatolites down there \u2014 the first living things to capture photosynthesis \u2014 and it's the only place they still occur today. Going down there was like entering a time capsule, and I came out with a different sense of myself in time. The oxygen exhaled by those stromatolites is what we all breathe today.Stromatolites are the heroes in my story. I hope it's a story that has some resonance for our time. It's a story about you and me, nature and science. And with that said, I'd like to invite you for a short, brief journey of life through time. Our journey starts in space, where matter condenses into spheres over time ... solidifying into surface, molded by fire. The fire gave way, Earth emerged \u2014 but this was an alien planet. The moon was closer; things were different. Heat from within made geysers erupt \u2014 that is how the oceans were born. Water froze around the poles and shaped the edges of the Earth. Water is the key to life, but in frozen form, it is a latent force. And when it vanishes, Earth becomes Mars.But this planet is different \u2014 it's roiling inside. And where that energy touches water, something new emerges: life. It arises around cracks in the Earth. Mud and minerals become substrate; there are bacteria. Learn to multiply, thickening in places ... Growing living structures under an alien sky ... Stromatolites were the first to exhale oxygen. And they changed the atmosphere. A breath that's fossilized now as iron.Meteorites delivered chemistry, and perhaps membranes, too. Life needs a membrane to contain itself so it can replicate and mutate. These are diatoms, single-celled phytoplankton with skeletons of silicon ... circuit boards of the future. Shallow seas nurtured life early on, and that's where it morphed into more complex forms. It grew as light and oxygen increased. Life hardened and became defensive. It learned to move and began to see. The first eyes grew on trilobites. Vision was refined in horseshoe crabs, among the first to leave the sea. They still do what they've done for ages, their enemies long gone.Scorpions follow prey out of the sea. Slugs became snails. Fish tried amphibian life. Frogs adapted to deserts. Lichens arose as a co-op. Fungi married algae ... clinging to rock, and eating it too ... transforming barren land. True land plants arose, leafless at first. Once they learn how to stay upright, they grew in size and shape. The fundamental forms of ferns followed, to bear spores that foreshadowed seeds. Life flourished in swamps.On land, life turned a corner. Jaws formed first; teeth came later. Leatherbacks and tuataras are echoes from that era. It took time for life to break away from water, and it still beckons all the time. Life turned hard so it could venture inland. And the dragons that arose are still among us today. Jurassic Park still shimmers in part of Madagascar, and the center of Brazil, where plants called \"cycads\" remain rock hard. Forests arose and nurtured things with wings. One early form left an imprint, like it died only yesterday. And others fly today like echoes of the past. In birds, life gained new mobility. Flamingos covered continents. Migrations got underway.Birds witnessed the emergence of flowering plants. Water lilies were among the first. Plants began to diversify and grew, turning into trees. In Australia, a lily turned into a grass tree, and in Hawaii, a daisy became a silver sword. In Africa, Gondwana molded Proteas. But when that ancient continent broke up, life got lusher. Tropical rainforests arose, sparking new layers of interdependence. Fungi multiplied. Orchids emerged, genitalia shaped to lure insects ... a trick shared by the largest flower on Earth. Co-evolution entwined insects and birds and plants forever. When birds can't fly, they become vulnerable. Kiwis are, and so are these hawks trapped near Antarctica.Extinction can come slowly, but sometimes it arrives fast. An asteroid hits, and the world went down in flames. But there were witnesses, survivors in the dark. When the skies cleared, a new world was born. A world fit for mammals. From tiny shrews [came] tenrecs, accustomed to the dark. New forms became bats. Civets. New predators, hyenas, getting faster and faster still.Grasslands created opportunities. Herd safety came with sharpened senses. Growing big was another answer, but size always comes at a price. Some mammals turned back to water. Walruses adapted with layers of fat. Sea lions got sleek. And cetaceans moved into a world without bounds. There are many ways to be a mammal. A 'roo hops in Oz; a horse runs in Asia; and a wolf evolves stilt legs in Brazil. Primates emerge from jungles, as tarsiers first, becoming lemurs not much later. Learning became reinforced. Bands of apes ventured into the open. And forests dried out once more. Going upright became a lifestyle.So who are we? Brothers of masculine chimps, sisters of feminine bonobos? We are all of them, and more. We're molded by the same life force. The blood veins in our hands echoed a course of water traces on the Earth. And our brains \u2014 our celebrated brains \u2014 reflect a drainage of a tidal marsh.Life is a force in its own right. It is a new element. And it has altered the Earth. It covers Earth like a skin. And where it doesn't, as in Greenland in winter, Mars is still not very far. But that likelihood fades as long as ice melts again. And where water is liquid, it becomes a womb for cells green with chlorophyll \u2014 and that molecular marvel is what's made a difference \u2014 it powers everything. The whole animal world today lives on a stockpile of bacterial oxygen that is cycled constantly through plants and algae, and their waste is our breath, and vice versa. This Earth is alive, and it's made its own membrane. We call it \"atmosphere.\" This is the icon of our journey. And you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next.

And that's not a joke, we really do. So come up afterwards and I'll show you how to play a lobster.So, actually, I started working on what's called the mantis shrimp a few years ago because they make sound. This is a recording I made of a mantis shrimp that's found off the coast of California. And while that's an absolutely fascinating sound, it actually turns out to be a very difficult project. And while I was struggling to figure out how and why mantis shrimp, or stomatopods, make sound, I started to think about their appendages. And mantis shrimp are called \"mantis shrimp\" after the praying mantises, which also have a fast feeding appendage. And I started to think, well, maybe it will be interesting, while listening to their sounds, to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes. And so today I'll talk about the extreme stomatopod strike, work that I've done in collaboration with Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell.So, mantis shrimp come in two varieties: there are spearers and smashers. And this is a spearing mantis shrimp, or stomatopod. And he lives in the sand, and he catches things that go by overhead. So, a quick strike like that. And if we slow it down a bit, this is the mantis shrimp \u2014 the same species \u2014 recorded at 1,000 frames a second, played back at 15 frames per second. And you can see it's just a really spectacular extension of the limbs, exploding upward to actually just catch a dead piece of shrimp that I had offered it. Now, the other type of mantis shrimp is the smasher stomatopod, and these guys open up snails for a living. And so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack.(Laughter)So, I'll play it one more time. He wiggles it in place, tugs it with his nose, and smash. And a few smashes later, the snail is broken open, and he's got a good dinner. So, the smasher raptorial appendage can stab with a point at the end, or it can smash with the heel. And today I'll talk about the smashing type of strike.And so the first question that came to mind was, well, how fast does this limb move? Because it's moving pretty darn fast on that video. And I immediately came upon a problem. Every single high-speed video system in the biology department at Berkeley wasn't fast enough to catch this movement. We simply couldn't capture it on video. And so this had me stymied for quite a long period of time. And then a BBC crew came cruising through the biology department, looking for a story to do about new technologies in biology. And so we struck up a deal. I said, \"Well, if you guys rent the high-speed video system that could capture these movements, you guys can film us collecting the data.\" And believe it or not, they went for it. (Laughter) So we got this incredible video system. It's very new technology \u2014 it just came out about a year ago \u2014 that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light. And low light is a critical issue with filming animals, because if it's too high, you fry them. (Laughter)So this is a mantis shrimp. There are the eyes up here, and there's that raptorial appendage, and there's the heel. And that thing's going to swing around and smash the snail. And the snail's wired to a stick, so he's a little bit easier to set up the shot. And \u2014 yeah.(Laughter)I hope there aren't any snail rights activists around here.(Laughter)So this was filmed at 5,000 frames per second, and I'm playing it back at 15. And so this is slowed down 333 times. And as you'll notice, it's still pretty gosh darn fast slowed down 333 times. It's an incredibly powerful movement. The whole limb extends out. The body flexes backwards \u2014 just a spectacular movement. And so what we did is, we took a look at these videos, and we measured how fast the limb was moving to get back to that original question. And we were in for our first surprise. So what we calculated was that the limbs were moving at the peak speed ranging from 10 meters per second all the way up to 23 meters per second. And for those of you who prefer miles per hour, that's over 45 miles per hour in water. And this is really darn fast. In fact, it's so fast we were able to add a new point on the extreme animal movement spectrum. And mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike of any animal system. So our first surprise.(Applause)So that was really cool and very unexpected. So, you might be wondering, well, how do they do it? And actually, this work was done in the 1960s by a famous biologist named Malcolm Burrows. And what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use what's called a \"catch mechanism,\" or \"click mechanism.\" And what this basically consists of is a large muscle that takes a good long time to contract, and a latch that prevents anything from moving. So the muscle contracts, and nothing happens. And once the muscle's contracted completely, everything's stored up \u2014 the latch flies upward, and you've got the movement. And that's basically what's called a \"power amplification system.\" It takes a long time for the muscle to contract, and a very short time for the limb to fly out. And so I thought that this was sort of the end of the story. This was how mantis shrimps make these very fast strikes.But then I took a trip to the National Museum of Natural History. And if any of you ever have a chance, backstage of the National Museum of Natural History is one of the world's best collections of preserved mantis shrimp. And what \u2014(Laughter)this is serious business for me.(Laughter)So, this \u2014 what I saw, on every single mantis shrimp limb, whether it's a spearer or a smasher, is a beautiful saddle-shaped structure right on the top surface of the limb. And you can see it right here. It just looks like a saddle you'd put on a horse. It's a very beautiful structure. And it's surrounded by membranous areas. And those membranous areas suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible structure. And this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while. And then we did a series of calculations, and what we were able to show is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring. There needs to be some kind of spring-loaded mechanism in order to generate the amount of force that we observe, and the speed that we observe, and the output of the system. So we thought, OK, this must be a spring \u2014 the saddle could very well be a spring. And we went back to those high-speed videos again, and we could actually visualize the saddle compressing and extending. And I'll just do that one more time. And then if you take a look at the video \u2014 it's a little bit hard to see \u2014 it's outlined in yellow. The saddle is outlined in yellow. You can actually see it extending over the course of the strike, and actually hyperextending. So, we've had very solid evidence showing that that saddle-shaped structure actually compresses and extends, and does, in fact, function as a spring.The saddle-shaped structure is also known as a \"hyperbolic paraboloid surface,\" or an \"anticlastic surface.\" And this is very well known to engineers and architects, because it's a very strong surface in compression. It has curves in two directions, one curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other, so any kind of perturbation spreads the forces over the surface of this type of shape. So it's very well known to engineers, not as well known to biologists. It's also known to quite a few people who make jewelry, because it requires very little material to build this type of surface, and it's very strong. So if you're going to build a thin gold structure, it's very nice to have it in a shape that's strong.Now, it's also known to architects. One of the most famous architects is Eduardo Catalano, who popularized this structure. And what's shown here is a saddle-shaped roof that he built that's 87 and a half feet spanwise. It's two and a half inches thick, and supported at two points. And one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it's \u2014 he found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure that's made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points. And all of these are the same principles that apply to the saddle-shaped spring in stomatopods. In biological systems it's important not to have a whole lot of extra material requirements for building it. So, very interesting parallels between the biological and the engineering worlds. And interestingly, this turns out \u2014 the stomatopod saddle turns out to be the first described biological hyperbolic paraboloid spring. That's a bit long, but it is sort of interesting.So the next and final question was, well, how much force does a mantis shrimp produce if they're able to break open snails? And so I wired up what's called a load cell. A load cell measures forces, and this is actually a piezoelectronic load cell that has a little crystal in it. And when this crystal is squeezed, the electrical properties change and it \u2014 which \u2014 in proportion to the forces that go in. So these animals are wonderfully aggressive, and are really hungry all the time. And so all I had to do was actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell, and they'd smash away at it. And so this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell. And we were able to get some force measurements out. And again, we were in for a surprise.I purchased a 100-pound load cell, thinking, no animal could produce more than 100 pounds at this size of an animal. And what do you know? They immediately overloaded the load cell. So these are actually some old data where I had to find the smallest animals in the lab, and we were able to measure forces of well over 100 pounds generated by an animal about this big. And actually, just last week I got a 300-pound load cell up and running, and I've clocked these animals generating well over 200 pounds of force. And again, I think this will be a world record. I have to do a little bit more background reading, but I think this will be the largest amount of force produced by an animal of a given \u2014 per body mass. So, really incredible forces. And again, that brings us back to the importance of that spring in storing up and releasing so much energy in this system. But that was not the end of the story.Now, things \u2014 I'm making this sound very easy, this is actually a lot of work. And I got all these force measurements, and then I went and looked at the force output of the system. And this is just very simple \u2014 time is on the X-axis and the force is on the Y-axis. And you can see two peaks. And that was what really got me puzzled. The first peak, obviously, is the limb hitting the load cell. But there's a really large second peak half a millisecond later, and I didn't know what that was. So now, you'd expect a second peak for other reasons, but not half a millisecond later. Again, going back to those high-speed videos, there's a pretty good hint of what might be going on. Here's that same orientation that we saw earlier. There's that raptorial appendage \u2014 there's the heel, and it's going to swing around and hit the load cell. And what I'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this, on the surface of the load cell, as the limb comes flying through. And I hope what you are able to see is actually a flash of light.Audience: Wow.Sheila Patek: And so if we just take that one frame, what you can actually see there at the end of that yellow arrow is a vapor bubble. And what that is, is cavitation. And cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon which occurs when you have areas of water moving at extremely different speeds. And when this happens, it can cause areas of very low pressure, which results in the water literally vaporizing. And when that vapor bubble collapses, it emits sound, light and heat, and it's a very destructive process. And so here it is in the stomatopod. And again, this is a situation where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon, because it destroys boat propellers. People have been struggling for years to try and design a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it, just like these pictures show.So this is a potent force in fluid systems, and just to sort of take it one step further, I'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail. This is taken at 20,000 frames per second, and I have to give full credit to the BBC cameraman, Tim Green, for setting this shot up, because I could never have done this in a million years \u2014 one of the benefits of working with professional cameramen. You can see it coming in, and an incredible flash of light, and all this cavitation spreading over the surface of the snail. So really, just an amazing image, slowed down extremely, to extremely slow speeds. And again, we can see it in slightly different form there, with the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces. In fact, you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb.So to solve this quandary of the two force peaks: what I think was going on is: that first impact is actually the limb hitting the load cell, and the second impact is actually the collapse of the cavitation bubble. And these animals may very well be making use of not only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring, but the extremes of the fluid dynamics. And they might actually be making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail. So, really fascinating double whammy, so to speak, from these animals.So, one question I often get after this talk \u2014 so I figured I'd answer it now \u2014 is, well, what happens to the animal? Because obviously, if it's breaking snails, the poor limb must be disintegrating. And indeed it does. That's the smashing part of the heel on both these images, and it gets worn away. In fact, I've seen them wear away their heel all the way to the flesh. But one of the convenient things about being an arthropod is that you have to molt. And every three months or so these animals molt, and they build a new limb and it's no problem. Very, very convenient solution to that particular problem.So, I'd like to end on sort of a wacky note.(Laughter)Maybe this is all wacky to folks like you, I don't know.(Laughter)So, the saddles \u2014 that saddle-shaped spring \u2014 has actually been well known to biologists for a long time, not as a spring but as a visual signal. And there's actually a spectacular colored dot in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods. And this is quite interesting, to find evolutionary origins of visual signals on what's really, in all species, their spring. And I think one explanation for this could be going back to the molting phenomenon.So these animals go into a molting period where they're unable to strike \u2014 their bodies become very soft. And they're literally unable to strike or they will self-destruct. This is for real. And what they do is, up until that time period when they can't strike, they become really obnoxious and awful, and they strike everything in sight; it doesn't matter who or what. And the second they get into that time point when they can't strike any more, they just signal. They wave their legs around. And it's one of the classic examples in animal behavior of bluffing. It's a well-established fact of these animals that they actually bluff. They can't actually strike, but they pretend to. And so I'm very curious about whether those colored dots in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information about their ability to strike, or their strike force, and something about the time period in the molting cycle. So sort of an interesting strange fact to find a visual structure right in the middle of their spring.So to conclude, I mostly want to acknowledge my two collaborators, Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell, who worked closely with me on this. And also the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, which gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time, and for that I'm very grateful. Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 77, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nIf you'd like to learn how to play the lobster, we have some here.\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nAnd that's not a joke, we really do.\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nSo come up afterwards and I'll show you how to play a lobster.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nSo, actually, I started working on what's called the mantis shrimp\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:26.958\na few years ago because they make sound.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nThis is a recording I made of a mantis shrimp\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nthat's found off the coast of California.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nAnd while that's an absolutely fascinating sound,\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nit actually turns out to be a very difficult project.\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nAnd while I was struggling to figure out how and why mantis shrimp,\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nor stomatopods, make sound, I started to think about their appendages.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nAnd mantis shrimp are called \"mantis shrimp\" after the praying mantises,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nwhich also have a fast feeding appendage. And I started to think,\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nwell, maybe it will be interesting, while listening to their sounds,\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nto figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nAnd so today I'll talk about the extreme stomatopod strike,\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nwork that I've done in collaboration with Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nSo, mantis shrimp come in two varieties:\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nthere are spearers and smashers.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nAnd this is a spearing mantis shrimp, or stomatopod.\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nAnd he lives in the sand, and he catches things that go by overhead.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nSo, a quick strike like that. And if we slow it down a bit,\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nthis is the mantis shrimp -- the same species --\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nrecorded at 1,000 frames a second,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nplayed back at 15 frames per second.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nAnd you can see it's just a really spectacular extension of the limbs,\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nexploding upward to actually just catch\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\na dead piece of shrimp that I had offered it.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nNow, the other type of mantis shrimp is the smasher stomatopod,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nand these guys open up snails for a living.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nAnd so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nSo, I'll play it one more time.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nHe wiggles it in place, tugs it with his nose, and smash.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nAnd a few smashes later, the snail is broken open, and he's got a good dinner.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nSo, the smasher raptorial appendage can stab with a point at the end,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nor it can smash with the heel.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nAnd today I'll talk about the smashing type of strike.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nAnd so the first question that came to mind was,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nwell, how fast does this limb move?\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nBecause it's moving pretty darn fast on that video.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nAnd I immediately came upon a problem.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nEvery single high-speed video system in the biology department\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nat Berkeley wasn't fast enough to catch this movement.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nWe simply couldn't capture it on video.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nAnd so this had me stymied for quite a long period of time.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nAnd then a BBC crew came cruising through the biology department,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nlooking for a story to do about new technologies in biology.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nAnd so we struck up a deal.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nI said, \"Well, if you guys rent the high-speed video system\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nthat could capture these movements,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nyou guys can film us collecting the data.\"\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nAnd believe it or not, they went for it. (Laughter)\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nSo we got this incredible video system. It's very new technology --\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nit just came out about a year ago --\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nthat allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd low light is a critical issue with filming animals,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nbecause if it's too high, you fry them. (Laughter)\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nSo this is a mantis shrimp. There are the eyes up here,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nand there's that raptorial appendage, and there's the heel.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd that thing's going to swing around and smash the snail.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nAnd the snail's wired to a stick,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nso he's a little bit easier to set up the shot. And -- yeah.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nI hope there aren't any snail rights activists around here.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nSo this was filmed at 5,000 frames per second,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nand I'm playing it back at 15. And so this is slowed down 333 times.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nAnd as you'll notice, it's still pretty gosh darn fast\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nslowed down 333 times. It's an incredibly powerful movement.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nThe whole limb extends out. The body flexes backwards --\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\njust a spectacular movement.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nAnd so what we did is, we took a look at these videos,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nand we measured how fast the limb was moving\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nto get back to that original question.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nAnd we were in for our first surprise.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nSo what we calculated was that the limbs were moving\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nat the peak speed ranging from 10 meters per second\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nall the way up to 23 meters per second.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAnd for those of you who prefer miles per hour,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nthat's over 45 miles per hour in water. And this is really darn fast.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nIn fact, it's so fast we were able to add a new point\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\non the extreme animal movement spectrum.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nAnd mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nof any animal system. So our first surprise.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:49.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nSo that was really cool and very unexpected.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nSo, you might be wondering, well, how do they do it?\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nAnd actually, this work was done in the 1960s\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nby a famous biologist named Malcolm Burrows.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nAnd what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nwhat's called a \"catch mechanism,\" or \"click mechanism.\"\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nAnd what this basically consists of is a large muscle\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nthat takes a good long time to contract,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nand a latch that prevents anything from moving.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nSo the muscle contracts, and nothing happens.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nAnd once the muscle's contracted completely, everything's stored up --\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nthe latch flies upward, and you've got the movement.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nAnd that's basically what's called a \"power amplification system.\"\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nIt takes a long time for the muscle to contract,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nand a very short time for the limb to fly out.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nAnd so I thought that this was sort of the end of the story.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nThis was how mantis shrimps make these very fast strikes.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nBut then I took a trip to the National Museum of Natural History.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nAnd if any of you ever have a chance,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nbackstage of the National Museum of Natural History\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nis one of the world's best collections of preserved mantis shrimp. And what --\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nthis is serious business for me.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nSo, this -- what I saw, on every single mantis shrimp limb,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nwhether it's a spearer or a smasher,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nis a beautiful saddle-shaped structure\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nright on the top surface of the limb. And you can see it right here.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nIt just looks like a saddle you'd put on a horse.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nIt's a very beautiful structure.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nAnd it's surrounded by membranous areas. And those membranous areas\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nsuggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible structure.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nAnd this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nAnd then we did a series of calculations, and what we were able to show\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nis that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nThere needs to be some kind of spring-loaded mechanism\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nin order to generate the amount of force that we observe,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nand the speed that we observe, and the output of the system.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nSo we thought, OK, this must be a spring --\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nthe saddle could very well be a spring.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nAnd we went back to those high-speed videos again,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nand we could actually visualize the saddle compressing and extending.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nAnd I'll just do that one more time.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nAnd then if you take a look at the video --\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nit's a little bit hard to see -- it's outlined in yellow.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nThe saddle is outlined in yellow. You can actually see it\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nextending over the course of the strike, and actually hyperextending.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nSo, we've had very solid evidence showing\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nthat that saddle-shaped structure actually compresses and extends,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nand does, in fact, function as a spring.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nThe saddle-shaped structure is also known as a \"hyperbolic paraboloid surface,\"\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nor an \"anticlastic surface.\"\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd this is very well known to engineers and architects,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nbecause it's a very strong surface in compression.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nIt has curves in two directions,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\none curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nso any kind of perturbation spreads the forces\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nover the surface of this type of shape.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nSo it's very well known to engineers, not as well known to biologists.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nIt's also known to quite a few people who make jewelry,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nbecause it requires very little material\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nto build this type of surface, and it's very strong.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nSo if you're going to build a thin gold structure,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nit's very nice to have it in a shape that's strong.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nNow, it's also known to architects. One of the most famous architects\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nis Eduardo Catalano, who popularized this structure.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nAnd what's shown here is a saddle-shaped roof that he built\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nthat's 87 and a half feet spanwise.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nIt's two and a half inches thick, and supported at two points.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nAnd one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it's --\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nhe found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nthat's made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nAnd all of these are the same principles that apply\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nto the saddle-shaped spring in stomatopods.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nIn biological systems it's important not to have a whole lot\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nof extra material requirements for building it.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nSo, very interesting parallels between the biological\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nand the engineering worlds. And interestingly, this turns out --\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nthe stomatopod saddle turns out to be the first\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\ndescribed biological hyperbolic paraboloid spring.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nThat's a bit long, but it is sort of interesting.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nSo the next and final question was, well, how much force\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:59.958\ndoes a mantis shrimp produce if they're able to break open snails?\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nAnd so I wired up what's called a load cell.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nA load cell measures forces, and this is actually\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\na piezoelectronic load cell that has a little crystal in it.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nAnd when this crystal is squeezed, the electrical properties change\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nand it -- which -- in proportion to the forces that go in.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nSo these animals are wonderfully aggressive,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nand are really hungry all the time. And so all I had to do\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nwas actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nand they'd smash away at it.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nAnd so this is just a regular video of the animal\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\njust smashing the heck out of this load cell.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nAnd we were able to get some force measurements out.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nAnd again, we were in for a surprise.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nI purchased a 100-pound load cell, thinking,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nno animal could produce more than 100 pounds at this size of an animal.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nAnd what do you know? They immediately overloaded the load cell.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nSo these are actually some old data\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nwhere I had to find the smallest animals in the lab,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nand we were able to measure forces of well over 100 pounds\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\ngenerated by an animal about this big.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nAnd actually, just last week I got a 300-pound load cell\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nup and running, and I've clocked these animals generating\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nwell over 200 pounds of force.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nAnd again, I think this will be a world record.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nI have to do a little bit more background reading,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nbut I think this will be the largest amount of force produced\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nby an animal of a given -- per body mass. So, really incredible forces.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nAnd again, that brings us back to the importance of that spring\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nin storing up and releasing so much energy in this system.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nBut that was not the end of the story.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nNow, things -- I'm making this sound very easy, this is actually a lot of work.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nAnd I got all these force measurements,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nand then I went and looked at the force output of the system.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nAnd this is just very simple -- time is on the X-axis\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nand the force is on the Y-axis. And you can see two peaks.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nAnd that was what really got me puzzled.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nThe first peak, obviously, is the limb hitting the load cell.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nBut there's a really large second peak half a millisecond later,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nand I didn't know what that was.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nSo now, you'd expect a second peak for other reasons,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nbut not half a millisecond later.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nAgain, going back to those high-speed videos,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nthere's a pretty good hint of what might be going on.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nHere's that same orientation that we saw earlier.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nThere's that raptorial appendage -- there's the heel,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nand it's going to swing around and hit the load cell.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nAnd what I'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:19.958\non the surface of the load cell, as the limb comes flying through.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nAnd I hope what you are able to see is actually a flash of light.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nAudience: Wow.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nSheila Patek: And so if we just take that one frame, what you can actually see there\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nat the end of that yellow arrow is a vapor bubble.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nAnd what that is, is cavitation.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nAnd cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nwhich occurs when you have areas of water\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nmoving at extremely different speeds.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nAnd when this happens, it can cause areas of very low pressure,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nwhich results in the water literally vaporizing.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nAnd when that vapor bubble collapses, it emits sound, light and heat,\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nand it's a very destructive process.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAnd so here it is in the stomatopod. And again, this is a situation\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nwhere engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nbecause it destroys boat propellers.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nPeople have been struggling for years to try and design\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:14.958\na very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nand literally wear away the metal and put holes in it,\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\njust like these pictures show.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nSo this is a potent force in fluid systems, and just to sort of take it one step further,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nI'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nThis is taken at 20,000 frames per second, and I have to give\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nfull credit to the BBC cameraman, Tim Green, for setting this shot up,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nbecause I could never have done this in a million years --\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\none of the benefits of working with professional cameramen.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nYou can see it coming in, and an incredible flash of light,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nand all this cavitation spreading over the surface of the snail.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nSo really, just an amazing image,\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nslowed down extremely, to extremely slow speeds.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nAnd again, we can see it in slightly different form there,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nwith the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nIn fact, you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nSo to solve this quandary of the two force peaks:\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nwhat I think was going on is: that first impact is actually\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nthe limb hitting the load cell, and the second impact is actually\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nthe collapse of the cavitation bubble.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nAnd these animals may very well be making use of\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nnot only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nbut the extremes of the fluid dynamics. And they might actually be\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nmaking use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nSo, really fascinating double whammy, so to speak, from these animals.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nSo, one question I often get after this talk --\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nso I figured I'd answer it now -- is, well, what happens to the animal?\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nBecause obviously, if it's breaking snails,\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nthe poor limb must be disintegrating. And indeed it does.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nThat's the smashing part of the heel on both these images,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nand it gets worn away. In fact, I've seen them wear away\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\ntheir heel all the way to the flesh.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nBut one of the convenient things about being an arthropod\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nis that you have to molt. And every three months or so\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nthese animals molt, and they build a new limb and it's no problem.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nVery, very convenient solution to that particular problem.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nSo, I'd like to end on sort of a wacky note.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nMaybe this is all wacky to folks like you, I don't know.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:28.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nSo, the saddles -- that saddle-shaped spring --\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nhas actually been well known to biologists for a long time,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nnot as a spring but as a visual signal.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nAnd there's actually a spectacular colored dot\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nin the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nAnd this is quite interesting, to find evolutionary origins\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nof visual signals on what's really, in all species, their spring.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nAnd I think one explanation for this could be\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\ngoing back to the molting phenomenon.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nSo these animals go into a molting period where they're\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nunable to strike -- their bodies become very soft.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nAnd they're literally unable to strike or they will self-destruct.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nThis is for real. And what they do is, up until that time period\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nwhen they can't strike, they become really obnoxious and awful,\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nand they strike everything in sight; it doesn't matter who or what.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nAnd the second they get into that time point when they can't strike any more,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nthey just signal. They wave their legs around.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nAnd it's one of the classic examples in animal behavior of bluffing.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nIt's a well-established fact of these animals\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nthat they actually bluff. They can't actually strike, but they pretend to.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nAnd so I'm very curious about whether those colored dots\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nin the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nabout their ability to strike, or their strike force,\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nand something about the time period in the molting cycle.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nSo sort of an interesting strange fact to find a visual structure\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nright in the middle of their spring.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nSo to conclude, I mostly want to acknowledge my two collaborators,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nWyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell, who worked closely with me on this.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nAnd also the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science,\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nwhich gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nand for that I'm very grateful.

When I go to an academic cocktail party and there are all the professors around, they ask me what field I'm in and I say, \"philosophy\" \u2014 their eyes glaze over.(Laughter)When I go to a philosopher's party(Laughter)and they ask me what I work on and I say, \"consciousness,\" their eyes don't glaze over \u2014 their lips curl into a snarl.(Laughter)And I get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because they think, \"That's impossible! You can't explain consciousness.\" The very chutzpah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question.My late, lamented friend Bob Nozick, a fine philosopher, in one of his books, \"Philosophical Explanations,\" is commenting on the ethos of philosophy \u2014 the way philosophers go about their business. And he says, you know, \"Philosophers love rational argument.\" And he says, \"It seems as if the ideal argument for most philosophers is you give your audience the premises and then you give them the inferences and the conclusion, and if they don't accept the conclusion, they die. Their heads explode.\" The idea is to have an argument that is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents. But in fact that doesn't change people's minds at all.It's very hard to change people's minds about something like consciousness, and I finally figured out the reason for that. The reason for that is that everybody's an expert on consciousness. We heard the other day that everybody's got a strong opinion about video games. They all have an idea for a video game, even if they're not experts. But they don't consider themselves experts on video games; they've just got strong opinions. I'm sure that people here who work on, say, climate change and global warming, or on the future of the Internet, encounter people who have very strong opinions about what's going to happen next. But they probably don't think of these opinions as expertise. They're just strongly held opinions. But with regard to consciousness, people seem to think, each of us seems to think, \"I am an expert. Simply by being conscious, I know all about this.\" And so, you tell them your theory and they say, \"No, no, that's not the way consciousness is! No, you've got it all wrong.\" And they say this with an amazing confidence.And so what I'm going to try to do today is to shake your confidence. Because I know the feeling \u2014 I can feel it myself. I want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds \u2014 that you are, yourselves, authoritative about your own consciousness. That's the order of the day here.Now, this nice picture shows a thought-balloon, a thought-bubble. I think everybody understands what that means. That's supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness. This is my favorite picture of consciousness that's ever been done. It's a Saul Steinberg of course \u2014 it was a New Yorker cover. And this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque. That reminds him of the word baroque, barrack, bark, poodle, Suzanne R. \u2014 he's off to the races. There's a wonderful stream of consciousness here and if you follow it along, you learn a lot about this man. What I particularly like about this picture, too, is that Steinberg has rendered the guy in this sort of pointillist style.Which reminds us, as Rod Brooks was saying yesterday: what we are, what each of us is \u2014 what you are, what I am \u2014 is approximately 100 trillion little cellular robots. That's what we're made of. No other ingredients at all. We're just made of cells, about 100 trillion of them. Not a single one of those cells is conscious; not a single one of those cells knows who you are, or cares. Somehow, we have to explain how when you put together teams, armies, battalions of hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells \u2014 not so different really from a bacterium, each one of them \u2014 the result is this. I mean, just look at it. The content \u2014 there's color, there's ideas, there's memories, there's history. And somehow all that content of consciousness is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons. How is that possible? Many people just think it isn't possible at all. They think, \"No, there can't be any sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness.\"This is a lovely book by a friend of mine named Lee Siegel, who's a professor of religion, actually, at the University of Hawaii, and he's an expert magician, and an expert on the street magic of India, which is what this book is about, \"Net of Magic.\" And there's a passage in it which I would love to share with you. It speaks so eloquently to the problem. \"'I'm writing a book on magic,' I explain, and I'm asked, 'Real magic?' By 'real magic,' people mean miracles, thaumaturgical acts, and supernatural powers. 'No,' I answer. 'Conjuring tricks, not real magic.' 'Real magic,' in other words, refers to the magic that is not real; while the magic that is real, that can actually be done, is not real magic.\"(Laughter)Now, that's the way a lot of people feel about consciousness.(Laughter)Real consciousness is not a bag of tricks. If you're going to explain this as a bag of tricks, then it's not real consciousness, whatever it is. And, as Marvin said, and as other people have said, \"Consciousness is a bag of tricks.\" This means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied and incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness. So this is the problem. So I have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won't like, for the same reason that you don't like to see a magic trick explained to you. How many of you here, if somebody \u2014 some smart aleck \u2014 starts telling you how a particular magic trick is done, you sort of want to block your ears and say, \"No, no, I don't want to know! Don't take the thrill of it away. I'd rather be mystified. Don't tell me the answer.\" A lot of people feel that way about consciousness, I've discovered. And I'm sorry if I impose some clarity, some understanding on you. You'd better leave now if you don't want to know some of these tricks.But I'm not going to explain it all to you. I'm going to do what philosophers do. Here's how a philosopher explains the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick. You know the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick? The philosopher says, \"I'm going to explain to you how that's done. You see, the magician doesn't really saw the lady in half.\"(Laughter)\"He merely makes you think that he does.\" And you say, \"Yes, and how does he do that?\" He says, \"Oh, that's not my department, I'm sorry.\"(Laughter)So now I'm going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness. But I'm going to try to also show you that consciousness isn't quite as marvelous \u2014 your own consciousness isn't quite as wonderful \u2014 as you may have thought it is. This is something, by the way, that Lee Siegel talks about in his book. He marvels at how he'll do a magic show, and afterwards people will swear they saw him do X, Y, and Z. He never did those things. He didn't even try to do those things. People's memories inflate what they think they saw. And the same is true of consciousness.Now, let's see if this will work. All right. Let's just watch this. Watch it carefully. I'm working with a young computer-animator documentarian named Nick Deamer, and this is a little demo that he's done for me, part of a larger project some of you may be interested in. We're looking for a backer. It's a feature-length documentary on consciousness. OK, now, you all saw what changed, right? How many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color? Every one. I'll just show you by running it again. Even when you know that they're all going to change color, it's very hard to notice. You have to really concentrate to pick up any of the changes at all.Now, this is an example \u2014 one of many \u2014 of a phenomenon that's now being studied quite a bit. It's one that I predicted in the last page or two of my 1991 book, \"Consciousness Explained,\" where I said if you did experiments of this sort, you'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes. If there's time at the end, I'll show you the much more dramatic case. Now, how can it be that there are all those changes going on, and that we're not aware of them? Well, earlier today, Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades, the way your eye moves around three or four times a second. He didn't mention the speed. Your eye is constantly in motion, moving around, looking at eyes, noses, elbows, looking at interesting things in the world. And where your eye isn't looking, you're remarkably impoverished in your vision. That's because the foveal part of your eye, which is the high-resolution part, is only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length. That's the detail part. It doesn't seem that way, does it? It doesn't seem that way, but that's the way it is. You're getting in a lot less information than you think.Here's a completely different effect. This is a painting by Bellotto. It's in the museum in North Carolina. Bellotto was a student of Canaletto's. And I love paintings like that \u2014 the painting is actually about as big as it is right here. And I love Canalettos, because Canaletto has this fantastic detail, and you can get right up and see all the details on the painting. And I started across the hall in North Carolina, because I thought it was probably a Canaletto, and would have all that in detail. And I noticed that on the bridge there, there's a lot of people \u2014 you can just barely see them walking across the bridge. And I thought as I got closer I would be able to see all the detail of most people, see their clothes, and so forth. And as I got closer and closer, I actually screamed. I yelled out because when I got closer, I found the detail wasn't there at all. There were just little artfully placed blobs of paint. And as I walked towards the picture, I was expecting detail that wasn't there. The artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes and wagons and all sorts of things, and my brain had taken the suggestion.You're familiar with a more recent technology, which is \u2014 There, you can get a better view of the blobs. See, when you get close they're really just blobs of paint. You will have seen something like this \u2014 this is the reverse effect. I'll just give that to you one more time.Now, what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion? When an artful blob of paint or two, by an artist, suggests a person \u2014 say, one of Marvin Minsky's little society of mind \u2014 do they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere? I don't think so. Not a chance. But then, how on Earth is it done? Well, remember the philosopher's explanation of the lady? It's the same thing. The brain just makes you think that it's got the detail there. You think the detail's there, but it isn't there. The brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all. It's just making you expect the detail.Let's just do this experiment very quickly. Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right, rotated? Yes. How many of you did it by rotating the one on the left in your mind's eye, to see if it matched up with the one on the right? How many of you rotated the one on the right? OK. How do you know that's what you did?(Laughter)There's in fact been a very interesting debate raging for over 20 years in cognitive science \u2014 various experiments started by Roger Shepherd, who measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images. Yes, it's possible to do that. But the details of the process are still in significant controversy. And if you read that literature, one of the things that you really have to come to terms with is even when you're the subject in the experiment, you don't know. You don't know how you do it. You just know that you have certain beliefs. And they come in a certain order, at a certain time. And what explains the fact that that's what you think? Well, that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician.This is a figure that I love: Bradley, Petrie, and Dumais. You may think that I've cheated, that I've put a little whiter-than-white boundary there. How many of you see that sort of boundary, with the Necker cube floating in front of the circles? Can you see it? Well, you know, in effect, the boundary's really there, in a certain sense. Your brain is actually computing that boundary, the boundary that goes right there. But now, notice there are two ways of seeing the cube, right? It's a Necker cube. Everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube? OK. Can you see the four ways of seeing the cube? Because there's another way of seeing it. If you're seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles, some black circles, there's another way of seeing it. As a cube, on a black background, as seen through a piece of Swiss cheese.(Laughter)Can you get it? How many of you can't get it? That'll help.(Laughter)Now you can get it. These are two very different phenomena. When you see the cube one way, behind the screen, those boundaries go away. But there's still a sort of filling in, as we can tell if we look at this. We don't have any trouble seeing the cube, but where does the color change? Does your brain have to send little painters in there? The purple-painters and the green-painters fight over who's going to paint that bit behind the curtain? No. Your brain just lets it go. The brain doesn't need to fill that in. When I first started talking about the Bradley, Petrie, Dumais example that you just saw \u2014 I'll go back to it, this one \u2014 I said that there was no filling-in behind there. And I supposed that that was just a flat truth, always true. But Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isn't.Now, if you think you see some pale yellow \u2014 I'll run this a few more times. Look in the gray areas, and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there \u2014 yeah, it's amazing. There's nothing there. It's no trick. [\"Failure to Detect Changes in Scenes\" slide] This is Ron Rensink's work, which was in some degree inspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book. Let me just pause this for a second if I can.This is change-blindness. What you're going to see is two pictures, one of which is slightly different from the other. You see here the red roof and the gray roof, and in between them there will be a mask, which is just a blank screen, for about a quarter of a second. So you'll see the first picture, then a mask, then the second picture, then a mask. And this will just continue, and your job as the subject is to press the button when you see the change. So, show the original picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank. Show the next picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank. And keep going, until the subject presses the button, saying, \"I see the change.\"So now we're going to be subjects in the experiment. We're going to start easy. Some examples. No trouble there. Can everybody see? All right. Indeed, Rensink's subjects took only a little bit more than a second to press the button. Can you see that one? 2.9 seconds. How many don't see it still? What's on the roof of that barn?(Laughter)It's easy. Is it a bridge or a dock? There are a few more really dramatic ones, and then I'll close. I want you to see a few that are particularly striking. This one because it's so large and yet it's pretty hard to see. Can you see it?Audience: Yes.Dan Dennett: See the shadows going back and forth? Pretty big. So 15.5 seconds is the median time for subjects in his experiment there.I love this one. I'll end with this one, just because it's such an obvious and important thing. How many still don't see it? How many still don't see it? How many engines on the wing of that Boeing?(Laughter)Right in the middle of the picture! Thanks very much for your attention. What I wanted to show you is that scientists, using their from-the-outside, third-person methods, can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dream of, and that, in fact, you're not the authority on your own consciousness that you think you are. And we're really making a lot of progress on coming up with a theory of mind.Jeff Hawkins, this morning, was describing his attempt to get theory, and a good, big theory, into the neuroscience. And he's right. This is a problem. Harvard Medical School once \u2014 I was at a talk \u2014 director of the lab said, \"In our lab, we have a saying. If you work on one neuron, that's neuroscience. If you work on two neurons, that's psychology.\"(Laughter)We have to have more theory, and it can come as much from the top down.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 102, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nSo I'm going to speak about a problem that I have\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nand that's that I'm a philosopher.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nWhen I go to a party and people ask me what do I do\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nand I say, \"I'm a professor,\" their eyes glaze over.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nWhen I go to an academic cocktail party\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nand there are all the professors around, they ask me what field I'm in\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nand I say, \"philosophy\" -- their eyes glaze over.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nWhen I go to a philosopher's party\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nand they ask me what I work on and I say, \"consciousness,\"\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:54.958\ntheir eyes don't glaze over -- their lips curl into a snarl.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nAnd I get hoots of derision and cackles and growls\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nbecause they think, \"That's impossible! You can't explain consciousness.\"\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nThe very chutzpah of somebody thinking\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nthat you could explain consciousness is just out of the question.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nMy late, lamented friend Bob Nozick, a fine philosopher,\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nin one of his books, \"Philosophical Explanations,\"\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nis commenting on the ethos of philosophy --\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nthe way philosophers go about their business.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nAnd he says, you know, \"Philosophers love rational argument.\"\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nAnd he says, \"It seems as if the ideal argument\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nfor most philosophers is you give your audience the premises\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nand then you give them the inferences and the conclusion,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nand if they don't accept the conclusion, they die.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nTheir heads explode.\" The idea is to have an argument\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nthat is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nBut in fact that doesn't change people's minds at all.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nIt's very hard to change people's minds\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nabout something like consciousness,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nand I finally figured out the reason for that.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nThe reason for that is that everybody's an expert on consciousness.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nWe heard the other day that everybody's got a strong opinion about video games.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nThey all have an idea for a video game, even if they're not experts.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nBut they don't consider themselves experts on video games;\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nthey've just got strong opinions.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nI'm sure that people here who work on, say, climate change\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nand global warming, or on the future of the Internet,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nencounter people who have very strong opinions\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nabout what's going to happen next.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nBut they probably don't think of these opinions as expertise.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nThey're just strongly held opinions.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nBut with regard to consciousness, people seem to think,\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\neach of us seems to think, \"I am an expert.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nSimply by being conscious, I know all about this.\"\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nAnd so, you tell them your theory and they say,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:55.958\n\"No, no, that's not the way consciousness is!\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nNo, you've got it all wrong.\"\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nAnd they say this with an amazing confidence.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nAnd so what I'm going to try to do today\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nis to shake your confidence. Because I know the feeling --\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nI can feel it myself.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nI want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds --\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nthat you are, yourselves, authoritative about your own consciousness.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nThat's the order of the day here.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nNow, this nice picture shows a thought-balloon, a thought-bubble.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nI think everybody understands what that means.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nThat's supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nThis is my favorite picture of consciousness that's ever been done.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nIt's a Saul Steinberg of course -- it was a New Yorker cover.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nAnd this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nThat reminds him of the word baroque, barrack, bark, poodle,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nSuzanne R. -- he's off to the races.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nThere's a wonderful stream of consciousness here\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nand if you follow it along, you learn a lot about this man.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nWhat I particularly like about this picture, too,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nis that Steinberg has rendered the guy\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nin this sort of pointillist style.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nWhich reminds us, as Rod Brooks was saying yesterday:\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nwhat we are, what each of us is -- what you are, what I am --\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nis approximately 100 trillion little cellular robots.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nThat's what we're made of.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nNo other ingredients at all. We're just made of cells, about 100 trillion of them.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nNot a single one of those cells is conscious;\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nnot a single one of those cells knows who you are, or cares.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nSomehow, we have to explain\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nhow when you put together teams, armies, battalions\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nof hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells --\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nnot so different really from a bacterium, each one of them --\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nthe result is this. I mean, just look at it.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nThe content -- there's color, there's ideas, there's memories,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nthere's history. And somehow all that content of consciousness\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nis accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nHow is that possible? Many people just think it isn't possible at all.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nThey think, \"No, there can't be any\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nsort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness.\"\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nThis is a lovely book by a friend of mine named Lee Siegel,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nwho's a professor of religion, actually, at the University of Hawaii,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nand he's an expert magician, and an expert\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.958\non the street magic of India, which is what this book is about,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\n\"Net of Magic.\"\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nAnd there's a passage in it which I would love to share with you.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nIt speaks so eloquently to the problem.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:36.958\n\"'I'm writing a book on magic,' I explain, and I'm asked, 'Real magic?'\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nBy 'real magic,' people mean miracles,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nthaumaturgical acts, and supernatural powers.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:44.958\n'No,' I answer. 'Conjuring tricks, not real magic.'\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:48.958\n'Real magic,' in other words, refers to the magic that is not real;\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nwhile the magic that is real, that can actually be done, is not real magic.\"\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:57.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nNow, that's the way a lot of people feel about consciousness.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nReal consciousness is not a bag of tricks.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nIf you're going to explain this as a bag of tricks,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthen it's not real consciousness, whatever it is.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd, as Marvin said, and as other people have said,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\n\"Consciousness is a bag of tricks.\"\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nThis means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nand incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nSo this is the problem. So I have to\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\ndo a little bit of the sort of work\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nthat a lot of you won't like,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nfor the same reason that you don't like to see\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\na magic trick explained to you.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nHow many of you here, if somebody -- some smart aleck --\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nstarts telling you how a particular magic trick is done,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nyou sort of want to block your ears and say, \"No, no, I don't want to know!\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nDon't take the thrill of it away. I'd rather be mystified.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nDon't tell me the answer.\"\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nA lot of people feel that way about consciousness, I've discovered.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nAnd I'm sorry if I impose some clarity, some understanding on you.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nYou'd better leave now if you don't want to know some of these tricks.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nBut I'm not going to explain it all to you.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nI'm going to do what philosophers do.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nHere's how a philosopher explains the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nYou know the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick?\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nThe philosopher says, \"I'm going to explain to you how that's done.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nYou see, the magician doesn't really saw the lady in half.\"\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:40.958\n\"He merely makes you think that he does.\"\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nAnd you say, \"Yes, and how does he do that?\"\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nHe says, \"Oh, that's not my department, I'm sorry.\"\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:48.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nSo now I'm going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nBut I'm going to try to also show you\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nthat consciousness isn't quite as marvelous --\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nyour own consciousness isn't quite as wonderful --\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nas you may have thought it is.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nThis is something, by the way, that Lee Siegel talks about in his book.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nHe marvels at how he'll do a magic show, and afterwards\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\npeople will swear they saw him do X, Y, and Z. He never did those things.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nHe didn't even try to do those things.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nPeople's memories inflate what they think they saw.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nAnd the same is true of consciousness.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nNow, let's see if this will work. All right. Let's just watch this.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nWatch it carefully.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nI'm working with a young computer-animator documentarian\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nnamed Nick Deamer, and this is a little demo that he's done for me,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\npart of a larger project some of you may be interested in.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nWe're looking for a backer.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nIt's a feature-length documentary on consciousness.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nOK, now, you all saw what changed, right?\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nHow many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color?\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nEvery one. I'll just show you by running it again.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nEven when you know that they're all going to change color,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nit's very hard to notice. You have to really concentrate\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nto pick up any of the changes at all.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nNow, this is an example -- one of many --\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nof a phenomenon that's now being studied quite a bit.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nIt's one that I predicted in the last page or two of my\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\n1991 book, \"Consciousness Explained,\"\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nwhere I said if you did experiments of this sort,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nyou'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nIf there's time at the end,\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nI'll show you the much more dramatic case.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nNow, how can it be that there are all those changes going on,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nand that we're not aware of them?\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nWell, earlier today, Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nthe way your eye moves around three or four times a second.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nHe didn't mention the speed. Your eye is constantly in motion,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nmoving around, looking at eyes, noses, elbows,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nlooking at interesting things in the world.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nAnd where your eye isn't looking,\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nyou're remarkably impoverished in your vision.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nThat's because the foveal part of your eye,\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nwhich is the high-resolution part,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nis only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nThat's the detail part.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nIt doesn't seem that way, does it?\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nIt doesn't seem that way, but that's the way it is.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nYou're getting in a lot less information than you think.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nHere's a completely different effect. This is a painting by Bellotto.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nIt's in the museum in North Carolina.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nBellotto was a student of Canaletto's.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nAnd I love paintings like that --\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nthe painting is actually about as big as it is right here.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nAnd I love Canalettos, because Canaletto has this fantastic detail,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nand you can get right up\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nand see all the details on the painting.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nAnd I started across the hall in North Carolina,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nbecause I thought it was probably a Canaletto,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nand would have all that in detail.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nAnd I noticed that on the bridge there, there's a lot of people --\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nyou can just barely see them walking across the bridge.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAnd I thought as I got closer\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nI would be able to see all the detail of most people,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nsee their clothes, and so forth.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nAnd as I got closer and closer, I actually screamed.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nI yelled out because when I got closer,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nI found the detail wasn't there at all.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nThere were just little artfully placed blobs of paint.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nAnd as I walked towards the picture,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nI was expecting detail that wasn't there.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nThe artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nand wagons and all sorts of things,\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nand my brain had taken the suggestion.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nYou're familiar with a more recent technology, which is -- There,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nyou can get a better view of the blobs.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nSee, when you get close\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nthey're really just blobs of paint.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nYou will have seen something like this -- this is the reverse effect.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nI'll just give that to you one more time.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nNow, what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion?\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nWhen an artful blob of paint or two, by an artist,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nsuggests a person -- say, one of\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nMarvin Minsky's little society of mind --\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:58.958\ndo they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere?\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nI don't think so. Not a chance. But then, how on Earth is it done?\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nWell, remember the philosopher's explanation of the lady?\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nIt's the same thing.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nThe brain just makes you think that it's got the detail there.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nYou think the detail's there, but it isn't there.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nThe brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nIt's just making you expect the detail.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nLet's just do this experiment very quickly.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nIs the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right, rotated?\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nYes.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nHow many of you did it by rotating the one on the left\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nin your mind's eye, to see if it matched up with the one on the right?\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nHow many of you rotated the one on the right? OK.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nHow do you know that's what you did?\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nThere's in fact been a very interesting debate\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nraging for over 20 years in cognitive science --\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nvarious experiments started by Roger Shepherd,\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nwho measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nYes, it's possible to do that.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nBut the details of the process are still in significant controversy.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nAnd if you read that literature, one of the things\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nthat you really have to come to terms with is\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\neven when you're the subject in the experiment, you don't know.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nYou don't know how you do it.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nYou just know that you have certain beliefs.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nAnd they come in a certain order, at a certain time.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nAnd what explains the fact that that's what you think?\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nWell, that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nThis is a figure that I love: Bradley, Petrie, and Dumais.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nYou may think that I've cheated,\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nthat I've put a little whiter-than-white boundary there.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nHow many of you see that sort of boundary,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nwith the Necker cube floating in front of the circles?\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nCan you see it?\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nWell, you know, in effect, the boundary's really there, in a certain sense.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nYour brain is actually computing that boundary,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nthe boundary that goes right there.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nBut now, notice there are two ways of seeing the cube, right?\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nIt's a Necker cube.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nEverybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube? OK.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nCan you see the four ways of seeing the cube?\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nBecause there's another way of seeing it.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nIf you're seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nsome black circles, there's another way of seeing it.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nAs a cube, on a black background,\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nas seen through a piece of Swiss cheese.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nCan you get it? How many of you can't get it? That'll help.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nNow you can get it. These are two very different phenomena.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nWhen you see the cube one way, behind the screen,\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nthose boundaries go away.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nBut there's still a sort of filling in, as we can tell if we look at this.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nWe don't have any trouble seeing the cube, but where does the color change?\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nDoes your brain have to send little painters in there?\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nThe purple-painters and the green-painters\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nfight over who's going to paint that bit behind the curtain? No.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nYour brain just lets it go. The brain doesn't need to fill that in.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nWhen I first started talking about\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nthe Bradley, Petrie, Dumais example that you just saw --\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nI'll go back to it, this one --\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nI said that there was no filling-in behind there.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nAnd I supposed that that was just a flat truth, always true.\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nBut Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isn't.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nNow, if you think you see some pale yellow --\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nI'll run this a few more times.\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nLook in the gray areas,\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nand see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there --\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nyeah, it's amazing. There's nothing there. It's no trick.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:10.958\n[\"Failure to Detect Changes in Scenes\" slide]\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nThis is Ron Rensink's work, which was in some degree\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:16.958\ninspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book.\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nLet me just pause this for a second if I can.\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nThis is change-blindness.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nWhat you're going to see is two pictures,\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.958\none of which is slightly different from the other.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nYou see here the red roof and the gray roof,\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nand in between them there will be a mask,\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nwhich is just a blank screen, for about a quarter of a second.\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nSo you'll see the first picture, then a mask,\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nthen the second picture, then a mask.\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nAnd this will just continue, and your job as the subject\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nis to press the button when you see the change.\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nSo, show the original picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank.\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nShow the next picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank.\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nAnd keep going, until the subject presses the button, saying,\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:04.958\n\"I see the change.\"\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nSo now we're going to be subjects in the experiment.\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nWe're going to start easy.

All right.\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:25.958\nIndeed, Rensink's subjects took only a little bit more\n\n00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nthan a second to press the button.\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nCan you see that one?\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:43.958\n2.9 seconds.\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nHow many don't see it still?\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nWhat's on the roof of that barn?\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nIt's easy.\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:34.958\nIs it a bridge or a dock?\n\n00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:42.958\nThere are a few more really dramatic ones, and then I'll close.\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:46.958\nI want you to see a few that are particularly striking.\n\n00:19:46.958 --> 00:19:53.958\nThis one because it's so large and yet it's pretty hard to see.\n\n00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:56.958\nCan you see it?\n\n00:19:56.958 --> 00:19:58.958\nAudience: Yes.\n\n00:19:58.958 --> 00:20:01.958\nDan Dennett: See the shadows going back and forth?

I'll end with this one,\n\n00:20:18.958 --> 00:20:21.958\njust because it's such an obvious and important thing.\n\n00:20:23.958 --> 00:20:29.958\nHow many still don't see it?

And my aim, really, is to teach the world to listen. That's my only real aim in life. And it sounds quite simple, but actually, it's quite a big, big job. Because you know, when you look at a piece of music, for example, if I just open my little motorbike bag \u2014 we have here, hopefully, a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page. And, you know, we open it up ... And I read the music. So technically, I can actually read this. I will follow the instructions, the tempo markings, the dynamics. I will do exactly as I'm told. And so therefore, because time is short, if I just played you, literally, the first, maybe, two lines or so \u2014 It's very straightforward; there's nothing too difficult about the piece. But here, I'm being told that the piece of music is very quick. I'm being told where to play on the drum. I'm being told which part of the stick to use. And I'm being told the dynamic. And I'm also being told that the drum is without snares. Snares on, snares off. So therefore, if I translate this piece of music, we have this idea.(Drum sounds)(Drum sounds end)And so on. My career would probably last about five years.(Laughter)However, what I have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music; everything that there isn't time to learn from a teacher, or to talk about, even, from a teacher. But it's the things you notice when you're not actually with your instrument that, in fact, become so interesting, and that you want to explore through this tiny, tiny surface of a drum. So there, we experience the translation. Now we'll experience the interpretation.(Drum sounds)(Drum sounds end)(Applause)Now my career may last a little longer.(Laughter)But in a way, you know, it's the same if I look at you and I see a nice, bright young lady with a pink top on. I see that you're clutching a teddy bear, etc., etc. So I get a basic idea as to what you might be about, what you might like, what you might do as a profession, etc., etc. However, that's just the initial idea I may have that we all get when we actually look and we try to interpret. But actually it's so unbelievably shallow. In the same way, I look at the music; I get a basic idea; I wonder what technically might be hard, or, you know, what I want to do. Just the basic feeling.However, that is simply not enough. And I think what Herbie said: please listen, listen. We have to listen to ourselves, first of all. If I play, for example, holding the stick \u2014 where literally I do not let go of the stick \u2014(Drum sound)you'll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm. And you feel really quite \u2014 believe it or not \u2014 detached from the instrument and from the stick, even though I'm actually holding the stick quite tightly.(Drum sound)By holding it tightly, I feel strangely more detached. If I just simply let go and allow my hand, my arm, to be more of a support system, suddenly \u2014(Drum sound)I have more dynamic with less effort. Much more \u2014(Drum sound)and I just feel, at last, one with the stick and one with the drum. And I'm doing far, far less.So in the same way that I need time with this instrument, I need time with people in order to interpret them. Not just translate them, but interpret them. If, for example, I play just a few bars of a piece of music for which I think of myself as a technician \u2014 that is, someone who is basically a percussion player \u2014(Marimba sounds)(Marimba sounds end)And so on, if I think of myself as a musician \u2014(Marimba sounds)(Marimba sounds end)And so on. There is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just \u2014(Applause)thinking about.And I remember when I was 12 years old, and I started playing timpani and percussion, and my teacher said, \"Well, how are we going to do this? You know, music is about listening.\" And I said, \"Yes, I agree with that, so what's the problem?\" And he said, \"Well, how are you going to hear this? How are you going to hear that?\" And I said, \"Well, how do you hear it?\" He said, \"Well, I think I hear it through here.\" And I said, \"Well, I think I do too, but I also hear it through my hands, through my arms, cheekbones, my scalp, my tummy, my chest, my legs and so on.\"And so we began our lessons every single time tuning drums, in particular, the kettle drums, or timpani to such a narrow pitch interval, so something like \u2014(Marimba sounds)that of a difference. Then gradually:(Marimba sounds)And gradually:(Marimba sounds)And it's amazing that when you do open your body up, and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through, that in fact the tiny, tiny difference \u2014(Marimba sounds)can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger, there.And so what we would do is that I would put my hands on the wall of the music room, and together, we would \"listen\" to the sounds of the instruments, and really try to connect with those sounds far, far more broadly than simply depending on the ear. Because of course, the ear is subject to all sorts of things. The room we happen to be in, the amplification, the quality of the instrument, the type of sticks \u2014(Marimba sounds)(Marimba sounds end)Etc., etc., they're all different.(Marimba sounds)(Marimba sounds end)Same amount of weight, but different sound colors. And that's basically what we are; we're just human beings, but we all have our own little sound colors, as it were, that make up these extraordinary personalities and characters and interests and things.And as I grew older, I then auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music in London, and they said, \"Well, no, we won't accept you, because we haven't a clue, you know, of the future of a so-called 'deaf musician.'\" And I just couldn't quite accept that. And so therefore, I said to them, \"Well, look, if you refuse \u2014 if you refuse me through those reasons, as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound \u2014 then we have to think very, very hard about the people you do actually accept.\" And as a result, once we got over a little hurdle, and having to audition twice, they accepted me. And not only that, what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the United Kingdom.Under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no arms, no legs \u2014 they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand. No circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry. And every single entry had to be listened to, experienced, and then, based on the musical ability, then that person could either enter or not. And so therefore, this in turn meant that there was an extremely interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions, and I have to say, many of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world. The interesting thing about this as well, though \u2014(Applause)is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound \u2014 which is basically all of us \u2014 we well know that music really is our daily medicine.I say \"music,\" but actually I mean \"sound.\" Because some of the extraordinary things I've experienced as a musician \u2014 when you may have a 15-year-old lad who has got the most incredible challenges, who may not be able to control his movements, who may be deaf, who may be blind, etc., etc. \u2014 suddenly, if that young lad sits close to this instrument, and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba, and you play something that's so incredibly organ-like, almost \u2014 I don't really have the right sticks, perhaps \u2014 but something like this \u2014 let me change \u2014(Soft marimba sounds)(Soft marimba sounds end)Something that's so unbelievably simple \u2014 but he would be experiencing something that I wouldn't be, because I'm on top of the sound. I have the sound coming this way. He would have the sound coming through the resonators. If there were no resonators on here, we would have:(Marimba sounds)So he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows wouldn't experience, those of you in the back few rows wouldn't experience, either. Every single one of us, depending on where we're sitting, will experience this sound quite, quite differently. And of course, being the participator of the sound, and that is, starting from the idea of what type of sound I want to produce, for example, this sound:(No sound)Can you hear anything? Exactly \u2014 because I'm not even touching it.(Laughter)But yet, we get the sensation of something happening. In the same way that when I see a tree moves, then I imagine that tree making a rustling sound. Do you see what I mean? Whatever the eye sees, then there's always sound happening. So there's always, always that huge \u2014 I mean, just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from.So all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience, and not by learning a piece of music, putting on someone else's interpretation of it, buying all the CDs possible of that particular piece of music, and so on and so forth, because that isn't giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic, and something that I can fully experience the journey of. So it may be that, in certain halls, this dynamic may well work.(Soft marimba sounds)(Soft marimba sounds end)It may be that in other halls, they're simply not going to experience that at all, and so therefore, my level of soft, gentle playing may have to be \u2014(Marimba sounds)(Marimba sounds end)Do you see what I mean? So, because of this explosion in access to sound, especially through the Deaf community, this has not only affected how music institutions, how schools for the deaf treat sound, and not just as a means of therapy \u2014 although, of course, being a participator of music, that definitely is the case as well \u2014 but it's meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together. There are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics, dare I say. But by that I mean, where you can absolutely do anything you imagine. The tiniest, softest, softest sound to something that is so broad, so huge, so incredible. There's always something: it may sound good up there, may not be so good there; it may be great there, but terrible up there; maybe terrible over there, but not too bad there, etc., etc.So to find an actual hall is incredible \u2014 for which you can play exactly what you imagine, without it being cosmetically enhanced. So therefore, acousticians are actually in conversation with people who are hearing impaired, and who are participators of sound. And this is quite interesting. I cannot give you any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls, but it's just the fact that they are going to a group of people for whom so many years, we've been saying, \"Well, how on earth can they experience music? They're deaf.\" We go like that, and we imagine that's what deafness is about. Or we go like that, and we imagine that's what blindness is about. If we see someone in a wheelchair, we assume they cannot walk. It may be that they can walk three, four, five steps. That, to them, means they can walk. In a year's time, it could be two extra steps. In another year's time, three extra steps.Those are hugely important aspects to think about. So when we do listen to each other, it's unbelievably important for us to really test our listening skills, to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber, to stop the judgment. For me, as a musician who deals with 99 percent of new music, it's very easy for me to say, \"Oh yes, I like that piece. No, I don't like that piece,\" and so on. And I just find that I have to give those pieces of music real time. It may be that the chemistry isn't quite right between myself and that particular piece of music, but that doesn't mean I have the right to say it's a bad piece of music. And you know, one of the great things about being a musician is that it is so unbelievably fluid. So there are no rules, no right, no wrong, this way, that way.If I asked you to clap \u2014 maybe I can do this. If I can just say, \"Please clap and create the sound of thunder.\" I'm assuming we've all experienced thunder. Now, I don't mean just the sound; I mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves. And please try to create that through your clapping. Try, just \u2014 please try.(Loud clapping sounds)(Clapping ends)Snow.(Laughter)Snow.(Soft clapping sounds)Have you ever heard snow?Audience: No.Evelyn Glennie: Well, then, stop clapping.(Laughter)Try again. Try again: snow.(No sound)See, you're awake.Rain.(Light clapping sounds)EG: (Laughs)Not bad. Not bad. The interesting thing here, though, is that I asked a group of kids not so long ago exactly the same question. Now \u2014 great imagination, thank you very much. However, not one of you got out of your seats to think, \"Right! How can I clap? OK, maybe:(Clapping sounds)Maybe I can use my jewelry to create extra sounds. Maybe I can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds.\" Not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands. In the same way, when we listen to music, we assume that it's all being fed through here. This is how we experience music. Of course, it's not.We experience thunder, thunder, thunder. Think, think, think. Listen, listen, listen. Now, what can we do with thunder? I remember my teacher, when I first started, my very first lesson, I was all prepared with sticks, ready to go. And instead of him saying, \"OK, Evelyn, please, feet slightly apart, arms at a more or less 90-degree angle, sticks in a more or less V shape, keep this amount of space here, etc. Please keep your back straight, etc., etc., etc.\" \u2014 where I was just probably going to end up absolutely rigid, frozen, and I would not be able to strike the drum because I was thinking of so many other things, he said, \"Evelyn, take this drum away for seven days, and I'll see you next week.\"So \u2014 heavens! What was I to do? I no longer required the sticks. I wasn't allowed to have these sticks. I had to basically look at this particular drum, see how it was made, what these little lugs did, what the snares did. Turned it upside down, experimented with the shell.(Drum sounds)Experimented with the head.(Drum sounds)Experimented with my body.(Drum sounds)Experimented with jewelry. Experimented with all sorts of things.(Drum sounds)(Drum sounds end)And of course, I returned with all sorts of bruises.(Laughter)But nevertheless, it was such an unbelievable experience, because where on earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music? Where on earth are you going to experience that in a study book? So we never, ever dealt with actual study books. So for example, one of the things that we learn when we are dealing with being a percussion player as opposed to a musician, is basically, straightforward single-stroke rolls.(Drum sounds)Like that, and then we get a little faster \u2014(Drum sounds)and a little faster \u2014(Drum sounds)and a little faster, and so on and so forth. What does this piece require? Single-stroke rolls.(Drum sound)So why can't I then do that whilst learning a piece of music? And that's exactly what he did. And interestingly, the older I became, and when I became a full-time student at a so-called \"music institution,\" all of that went out of the window. We had to study from study books. And constantly, the question, \"Well, why? Why? What is this relating to? I need to play a piece of music.\" \"Well, this will help your control.\" \"Well, how? Why do I need to learn that? I need to relate it to a piece of music. You know, I need to say something.Why am I practicing paradiddles?(Drum sounds)Is it just literally for control, for hand-stick control? Why am I doing that? I need to have the reason, and the reason has to be by saying something through the music.\" And by saying something through music, which basically is sound, we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people. But I don't want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage. That's up to you, when you walk through a hall, because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things. I may feel sorrowful, or happy, or exhilarated, or angry when I play certain pieces of music, but I'm not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing. So please, the next time you go to a concert, just allow your body to open up, allow your body to be this resonating chamber. Be aware that you're not going to experience the same thing as the performer is.The performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound, because they're hearing the contact of the stick \u2014(Drum sound)on the drum, or the mallet on the bit of wood, or the bow on the string, etc., or the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass. They're experiencing that rawness there. But yet they're experiencing something so unbelievably pure, which is before the sound is actually happening. Please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike, or breath, is being pulled. Just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that I wished I'd experienced the whole journey of this particular conference, rather than just arriving last night. But I hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses. But thank you very much for having me!(Applause)(Applause ends)(Music)(Music ends)(Applause)", "id": 103, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:16.658\nI'm not quite sure whether\nI really want to see a snare drum\n\n00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:18.754\nat nine o'clock or so in the morning.\n\n00:00:18.778 --> 00:00:20.176\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.270\nBut anyway, it's just great\nto see such a full theater,\n\n00:00:24.294 --> 00:00:27.579\nand really, I must thank\nHerbie Hancock and his colleagues\n\n00:00:27.603 --> 00:00:30.107\nfor such a great presentation.\n\n00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:33.202\n(Applause)\n\n00:00:33.226 --> 00:00:35.412\nOne of the interesting things, of course,\n\n00:00:35.436 --> 00:00:42.389\nis the combination of that raw hand\non the instrument and technology,\n\n00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:47.509\nand what he said about listening\nto our young people.\n\n00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:51.231\nOf course, my job is all about listening.\n\n00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:57.997\nAnd my aim, really,\nis to teach the world to listen.\n\n00:00:58.021 --> 00:01:01.606\nThat's my only real aim in life.\n\n00:01:02.352 --> 00:01:08.489\nAnd it sounds quite simple,\nbut actually, it's quite a big, big job.\n\n00:01:08.513 --> 00:01:13.783\nBecause you know, when you look\nat a piece of music, for example,\n\n00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:17.266\nif I just open my little motorbike bag --\n\n00:01:18.605 --> 00:01:21.613\nwe have here, hopefully,\n\n00:01:21.637 --> 00:01:27.262\na piece of music that is full\nof little black dots on the page.\n\n00:01:28.452 --> 00:01:32.218\nAnd, you know, we open it up ...\n\n00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.964\nAnd I read the music.\n\n00:01:36.512 --> 00:01:40.226\nSo technically, I can actually read this.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:44.934\nI will follow the instructions,\nthe tempo markings, the dynamics.\n\n00:01:45.544 --> 00:01:48.729\nI will do exactly as I'm told.\n\n00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:53.067\nAnd so therefore, because time is short,\n\n00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:59.990\nif I just played you, literally,\nthe first, maybe, two lines or so --\n\n00:02:00.696 --> 00:02:04.192\nIt's very straightforward; there's nothing\ntoo difficult about the piece.\n\n00:02:04.216 --> 00:02:07.524\nBut here, I'm being told\nthat the piece of music is very quick.\n\n00:02:08.508 --> 00:02:11.514\nI'm being told where to play on the drum.\n\n00:02:11.538 --> 00:02:14.454\nI'm being told which part\nof the stick to use.\n\n00:02:15.805 --> 00:02:18.403\nAnd I'm being told the dynamic.\n\n00:02:18.427 --> 00:02:23.028\nAnd I'm also being told\nthat the drum is without snares.\n\n00:02:23.052 --> 00:02:26.064\nSnares on, snares off.\n\n00:02:26.088 --> 00:02:31.940\nSo therefore, if I translate\nthis piece of music,\n\n00:02:31.964 --> 00:02:33.964\nwe have this idea.\n\n00:02:35.032 --> 00:02:37.236\n(Drum sounds)\n\n00:03:02.781 --> 00:03:05.200\n(Drum sounds end)\n\n00:03:05.224 --> 00:03:06.491\nAnd so on.\n\n00:03:06.515 --> 00:03:09.997\nMy career would probably last\nabout five years.\n\n00:03:10.021 --> 00:03:11.025\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.572\nHowever, what I have to do as a musician\n\n00:03:15.596 --> 00:03:19.704\nis do everything that is not on the music;\n\n00:03:19.728 --> 00:03:24.732\neverything that there isn't time\nto learn from a teacher,\n\n00:03:24.756 --> 00:03:28.316\nor to talk about, even, from a teacher.\n\n00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.193\nBut it's the things you notice when\nyou're not actually with your instrument\n\n00:03:33.217 --> 00:03:38.464\nthat, in fact, become so interesting,\nand that you want to explore\n\n00:03:38.488 --> 00:03:41.956\nthrough this tiny, tiny surface of a drum.\n\n00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.681\nSo there, we experience the translation.\n\n00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:48.175\nNow we'll experience the interpretation.\n\n00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.810\n(Drum sounds)\n\n00:04:30.934 --> 00:04:32.934\n(Drum sounds end)\n\n00:04:34.471 --> 00:04:41.471\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:42.016 --> 00:04:44.727\nNow my career may last a little longer.\n\n00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:46.078\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:46.102 --> 00:04:49.387\nBut in a way, you know,\nit's the same if I look at you\n\n00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:53.751\nand I see a nice, bright young lady\nwith a pink top on.\n\n00:04:53.775 --> 00:04:57.193\nI see that you're clutching\na teddy bear, etc., etc.\n\n00:04:57.217 --> 00:05:01.775\nSo I get a basic idea\nas to what you might be about,\n\n00:05:01.799 --> 00:05:06.167\nwhat you might like, what you might do\nas a profession, etc., etc.\n\n00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.961\nHowever, that's just the initial idea\nI may have that we all get\n\n00:05:12.985 --> 00:05:16.567\nwhen we actually look\nand we try to interpret.\n\n00:05:16.591 --> 00:05:18.891\nBut actually it's so unbelievably shallow.\n\n00:05:18.915 --> 00:05:21.820\nIn the same way, I look\nat the music; I get a basic idea;\n\n00:05:21.844 --> 00:05:26.138\nI wonder what technically might be hard,\nor, you know, what I want to do.\n\n00:05:26.162 --> 00:05:27.652\nJust the basic feeling.\n\n00:05:27.676 --> 00:05:30.339\nHowever, that is simply not enough.\n\n00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:34.677\nAnd I think what Herbie said:\nplease listen, listen.\n\n00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:38.337\nWe have to listen\nto ourselves, first of all.\n\n00:05:38.361 --> 00:05:42.106\nIf I play, for example,\nholding the stick --\n\n00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.183\nwhere literally I do not let go\nof the stick --\n\n00:05:45.207 --> 00:05:47.772\n(Drum sound)\n\n00:05:47.796 --> 00:05:51.613\nyou'll experience quite a lot\nof shock coming up through the arm.\n\n00:05:51.637 --> 00:05:53.962\nAnd you feel really quite --\nbelieve it or not --\n\n00:05:53.986 --> 00:05:57.229\ndetached from the instrument\nand from the stick,\n\n00:05:57.253 --> 00:06:01.375\neven though I'm actually holding\nthe stick quite tightly.\n\n00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:02.824\n(Drum sound)\n\n00:06:02.848 --> 00:06:06.805\nBy holding it tightly,\nI feel strangely more detached.\n\n00:06:06.829 --> 00:06:08.546\nIf I just simply let go\n\n00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.765\nand allow my hand, my arm,\nto be more of a support system,\n\n00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:14.987\nsuddenly --\n\n00:06:15.011 --> 00:06:17.025\n(Drum sound)\n\n00:06:17.049 --> 00:06:20.506\nI have more dynamic with less effort.\n\n00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:21.705\nMuch more --\n\n00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:23.480\n(Drum sound)\n\n00:06:23.504 --> 00:06:26.437\nand I just feel, at last,\none with the stick\n\n00:06:26.461 --> 00:06:28.120\nand one with the drum.\n\n00:06:28.144 --> 00:06:30.257\nAnd I'm doing far, far less.\n\n00:06:30.281 --> 00:06:33.693\nSo in the same way that I need\ntime with this instrument,\n\n00:06:33.717 --> 00:06:39.044\nI need time with people\nin order to interpret them.\n\n00:06:39.068 --> 00:06:41.756\nNot just translate them,\nbut interpret them.\n\n00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:47.967\nIf, for example, I play just\na few bars of a piece of music\n\n00:06:49.247 --> 00:06:54.637\nfor which I think of myself\nas a technician --\n\n00:06:54.661 --> 00:06:58.917\nthat is, someone who is basically\na percussion player --\n\n00:06:58.941 --> 00:07:01.187\n(Marimba sounds)\n\n00:07:09.931 --> 00:07:11.828\n(Marimba sounds end)\n\n00:07:11.852 --> 00:07:15.040\nAnd so on, if I think of myself\nas a musician --\n\n00:07:15.064 --> 00:07:17.132\n(Marimba sounds)\n\n00:07:34.825 --> 00:07:36.868\n(Marimba sounds end)\n\n00:07:36.892 --> 00:07:38.066\nAnd so on.\n\n00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.952\nThere is a little bit of a difference\nthere that is worth just --\n\n00:07:41.976 --> 00:07:44.527\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:44.551 --> 00:07:45.934\nthinking about.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:49.867\nAnd I remember when I was 12 years old,\n\n00:07:49.891 --> 00:07:53.009\nand I started playing timpani\nand percussion,\n\n00:07:53.033 --> 00:07:55.463\nand my teacher said,\n\n00:07:55.487 --> 00:08:01.140\n\"Well, how are we going to do this?\nYou know, music is about listening.\"\n\n00:08:01.164 --> 00:08:05.835\nAnd I said, \"Yes, I agree with that,\nso what's the problem?\"\n\n00:08:05.859 --> 00:08:08.278\nAnd he said, \"Well,\nhow are you going to hear this?\n\n00:08:08.302 --> 00:08:09.860\nHow are you going to hear that?\"\n\n00:08:09.884 --> 00:08:11.966\nAnd I said, \"Well, how do you hear it?\"\n\n00:08:12.465 --> 00:08:15.934\nHe said, \"Well, I think\nI hear it through here.\"\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:21.332\nAnd I said, \"Well, I think I do too,\nbut I also hear it through my hands,\n\n00:08:21.356 --> 00:08:24.895\nthrough my arms, cheekbones, my scalp,\n\n00:08:24.919 --> 00:08:27.936\nmy tummy, my chest, my legs and so on.\"\n\n00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.792\nAnd so we began our lessons\nevery single time\n\n00:08:32.816 --> 00:08:36.758\ntuning drums, in particular,\nthe kettle drums, or timpani\n\n00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:41.795\nto such a narrow pitch interval,\nso something like --\n\n00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:45.176\n(Marimba sounds)\n\n00:08:46.998 --> 00:08:48.171\nthat of a difference.\n\n00:08:48.195 --> 00:08:49.397\nThen gradually:\n\n00:08:49.421 --> 00:08:50.578\n(Marimba sounds)\n\n00:08:50.602 --> 00:08:51.782\nAnd gradually:\n\n00:08:51.806 --> 00:08:53.597\n(Marimba sounds)\n\n00:08:53.621 --> 00:08:57.680\nAnd it's amazing that when you do\nopen your body up,\n\n00:08:57.704 --> 00:09:01.679\nand open your hand up to allow\nthe vibration to come through,\n\n00:09:01.703 --> 00:09:04.026\nthat in fact the tiny, tiny difference --\n\n00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.109\n(Marimba sounds)\n\n00:09:06.133 --> 00:09:12.215\ncan be felt with just the tiniest\npart of your finger, there.\n\n00:09:12.239 --> 00:09:15.105\nAnd so what we would do\nis that I would put my hands\n\n00:09:15.129 --> 00:09:17.444\non the wall of the music room,\n\n00:09:17.468 --> 00:09:22.662\nand together, we would \"listen\"\nto the sounds of the instruments,\n\n00:09:22.686 --> 00:09:26.522\nand really try to connect\nwith those sounds\n\n00:09:26.546 --> 00:09:30.939\nfar, far more broadly\nthan simply depending on the ear.\n\n00:09:30.963 --> 00:09:35.606\nBecause of course, the ear\nis subject to all sorts of things.\n\n00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:38.599\nThe room we happen to be in,\nthe amplification,\n\n00:09:38.623 --> 00:09:41.358\nthe quality of the instrument,\nthe type of sticks --\n\n00:09:41.382 --> 00:09:43.463\n(Marimba sounds)\n\n00:09:47.802 --> 00:09:49.749\n(Marimba sounds end)\n\n00:09:49.773 --> 00:09:51.592\nEtc., etc., they're all different.\n\n00:09:51.616 --> 00:09:53.616\n(Marimba sounds)\n\n00:09:56.075 --> 00:09:58.172\n(Marimba sounds end)\n\n00:09:58.196 --> 00:10:02.781\nSame amount of weight,\nbut different sound colors.\n\n00:10:02.805 --> 00:10:05.709\nAnd that's basically what we are;\nwe're just human beings,\n\n00:10:05.733 --> 00:10:08.898\nbut we all have our own\nlittle sound colors, as it were,\n\n00:10:08.922 --> 00:10:12.571\nthat make up these extraordinary\npersonalities and characters\n\n00:10:12.595 --> 00:10:14.468\nand interests and things.\n\n00:10:14.492 --> 00:10:17.492\nAnd as I grew older, I then auditioned\n\n00:10:17.516 --> 00:10:19.934\nfor the Royal Academy of Music in London,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:24.232\nand they said, \"Well, no, we won't\naccept you, because we haven't a clue,\n\n00:10:24.256 --> 00:10:28.909\nyou know, of the future\nof a so-called 'deaf musician.'\"\n\n00:10:28.933 --> 00:10:33.460\nAnd I just couldn't quite accept that.\n\n00:10:33.484 --> 00:10:40.052\nAnd so therefore, I said to them,\n\"Well, look, if you refuse --\n\n00:10:40.076 --> 00:10:43.401\nif you refuse me through those reasons,\n\n00:10:43.425 --> 00:10:48.193\nas opposed to the ability to perform\n\n00:10:48.217 --> 00:10:54.934\nand to understand and love\nthe art of creating sound --\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:11:01.197\nthen we have to think very, very hard\nabout the people you do actually accept.\"\n\n00:11:01.221 --> 00:11:05.479\nAnd as a result,\nonce we got over a little hurdle,\n\n00:11:05.503 --> 00:11:07.512\nand having to audition twice,\n\n00:11:07.536 --> 00:11:09.751\nthey accepted me.\n\n00:11:09.775 --> 00:11:11.141\nAnd not only that,\n\n00:11:11.165 --> 00:11:16.808\nwhat had happened was that it changed\nthe whole role of the music institutions\n\n00:11:16.832 --> 00:11:18.784\nthroughout the United Kingdom.\n\n00:11:18.808 --> 00:11:22.756\nUnder no circumstances were they to refuse\n\n00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.695\nany application whatsoever\n\n00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:30.227\non the basis of whether someone\nhad no arms, no legs --\n\n00:11:30.251 --> 00:11:34.779\nthey could still perhaps play a wind\ninstrument if it was supported on a stand.\n\n00:11:35.326 --> 00:11:41.581\nNo circumstances at all\nwere used to refuse any entry.\n\n00:11:41.605 --> 00:11:46.443\nAnd every single entry\nhad to be listened to, experienced,\n\n00:11:46.467 --> 00:11:49.024\nand then, based on the musical ability,\n\n00:11:49.048 --> 00:11:54.300\nthen that person\ncould either enter or not.\n\n00:11:54.324 --> 00:11:57.478\nAnd so therefore, this in turn meant\n\n00:11:57.502 --> 00:12:01.139\nthat there was an extremely\ninteresting bunch of students\n\n00:12:01.163 --> 00:12:04.513\nwho arrived in these various\nmusic institutions,\n\n00:12:04.537 --> 00:12:09.026\nand I have to say, many of them now\nin the professional orchestras\n\n00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:11.029\nthroughout the world.\n\n00:12:11.053 --> 00:12:13.739\nThe interesting thing\nabout this as well, though --\n\n00:12:13.763 --> 00:12:17.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:24.748\nis quite simply that not only were people\nconnected with sound --\n\n00:12:24.772 --> 00:12:26.283\nwhich is basically all of us --\n\n00:12:26.307 --> 00:12:31.229\nwe well know that music\nreally is our daily medicine.\n\n00:12:31.253 --> 00:12:33.934\nI say \"music,\" but actually\nI mean \"sound.\"\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:38.583\nBecause some of the extraordinary\nthings I've experienced as a musician --\n\n00:12:38.607 --> 00:12:42.746\nwhen you may have a 15-year-old lad\n\n00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:47.499\nwho has got the most\nincredible challenges,\n\n00:12:47.523 --> 00:12:50.260\nwho may not be able\nto control his movements,\n\n00:12:50.284 --> 00:12:53.297\nwho may be deaf,\nwho may be blind, etc., etc. --\n\n00:12:53.321 --> 00:12:59.351\nsuddenly, if that young lad\nsits close to this instrument,\n\n00:12:59.375 --> 00:13:02.186\nand perhaps even lies\nunderneath the marimba,\n\n00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:07.934\nand you play something\nthat's so incredibly organ-like, almost --\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.818\nI don't really have\nthe right sticks, perhaps --\n\n00:13:10.842 --> 00:13:14.665\nbut something like this --\nlet me change --\n\n00:13:16.893 --> 00:13:19.431\n(Soft marimba sounds)\n\n00:14:02.125 --> 00:14:04.760\n(Soft marimba sounds end)\n\n00:14:04.784 --> 00:14:07.666\nSomething that's so unbelievably simple --\n\n00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:12.010\nbut he would be experiencing\nsomething that I wouldn't be,\n\n00:14:12.034 --> 00:14:14.452\nbecause I'm on top of the sound.\n\n00:14:14.476 --> 00:14:16.742\nI have the sound coming this way.\n\n00:14:16.766 --> 00:14:20.324\nHe would have the sound\ncoming through the resonators.\n\n00:14:20.348 --> 00:14:23.483\nIf there were no resonators\non here, we would have:\n\n00:14:23.852 --> 00:14:28.925\n(Marimba sounds)\n\n00:14:30.064 --> 00:14:32.383\nSo he would have a fullness of sound\n\n00:14:32.407 --> 00:14:35.405\nthat those of you in the front few rows\nwouldn't experience,\n\n00:14:35.429 --> 00:14:38.574\nthose of you in the back few rows\nwouldn't experience, either.\n\n00:14:38.598 --> 00:14:41.691\nEvery single one of us,\ndepending on where we're sitting,\n\n00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:45.492\nwill experience this sound\nquite, quite differently.\n\n00:14:45.516 --> 00:14:48.386\nAnd of course, being\nthe participator of the sound,\n\n00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:53.236\nand that is, starting from the idea\nof what type of sound\n\n00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.545\nI want to produce,\nfor example, this sound:\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\n(No sound)\n\n00:15:03.129 --> 00:15:04.293\nCan you hear anything?\n\n00:15:06.066 --> 00:15:08.812\nExactly -- because\nI'm not even touching it.\n\n00:15:08.836 --> 00:15:10.361\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:10.385 --> 00:15:15.012\nBut yet, we get the sensation\nof something happening.\n\n00:15:15.036 --> 00:15:17.595\nIn the same way\nthat when I see a tree moves,\n\n00:15:17.619 --> 00:15:21.837\nthen I imagine that tree\nmaking a rustling sound.\n\n00:15:21.861 --> 00:15:23.087\nDo you see what I mean?\n\n00:15:23.111 --> 00:15:27.228\nWhatever the eye sees,\nthen there's always sound happening.\n\n00:15:27.252 --> 00:15:31.447\nSo there's always, always that huge --\n\n00:15:31.471 --> 00:15:35.757\nI mean, just this kaleidoscope\nof things to draw from.\n\n00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:41.750\nSo all of my performances\nare based on entirely what I experience,\n\n00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:44.270\nand not by learning a piece of music,\n\n00:15:44.294 --> 00:15:46.496\nputting on someone else's\ninterpretation of it,\n\n00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.699\nbuying all the CDs possible\nof that particular piece of music,\n\n00:15:49.723 --> 00:15:51.089\nand so on and so forth,\n\n00:15:51.113 --> 00:15:57.465\nbecause that isn't giving me enough\nof something that is so raw and so basic,\n\n00:15:57.489 --> 00:16:02.616\nand something that I can fully\nexperience the journey of.\n\n00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.867\nSo it may be that, in certain halls,\n\n00:16:06.891 --> 00:16:11.659\nthis dynamic may well work.\n\n00:16:12.127 --> 00:16:14.419\n(Soft marimba sounds)\n\n00:16:19.328 --> 00:16:21.330\n(Soft marimba sounds end)\n\n00:16:21.354 --> 00:16:22.886\nIt may be that in other halls,\n\n00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:26.145\nthey're simply not going\nto experience that at all,\n\n00:16:26.169 --> 00:16:30.377\nand so therefore, my level of soft,\ngentle playing may have to be --\n\n00:16:30.401 --> 00:16:33.560\n(Marimba sounds)\n\n00:16:52.428 --> 00:16:54.429\n(Marimba sounds end)\n\n00:16:54.453 --> 00:16:55.795\nDo you see what I mean?\n\n00:16:55.819 --> 00:17:02.077\nSo, because of this explosion\nin access to sound,\n\n00:17:02.101 --> 00:17:04.612\nespecially through the Deaf community,\n\n00:17:04.636 --> 00:17:09.063\nthis has not only affected\nhow music institutions,\n\n00:17:09.087 --> 00:17:15.856\nhow schools for the deaf treat sound,\nand not just as a means of therapy --\n\n00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.493\nalthough, of course,\nbeing a participator of music,\n\n00:17:18.517 --> 00:17:21.115\nthat definitely is the case as well --\n\n00:17:21.139 --> 00:17:26.238\nbut it's meant that acousticians\nhave had to really think\n\n00:17:26.262 --> 00:17:30.284\nabout the types of halls\nthey put together.\n\n00:17:30.308 --> 00:17:32.772\nThere are so few halls in this world\n\n00:17:32.796 --> 00:17:38.113\nthat actually have\nvery good acoustics, dare I say.\n\n00:17:38.137 --> 00:17:43.722\nBut by that I mean, where you can\nabsolutely do anything you imagine.\n\n00:17:43.746 --> 00:17:48.564\nThe tiniest, softest, softest sound\nto something that is so broad,\n\n00:17:48.588 --> 00:17:51.310\nso huge, so incredible.\n\n00:17:51.334 --> 00:17:52.728\nThere's always something:\n\n00:17:52.752 --> 00:17:55.256\nit may sound good up there,\nmay not be so good there;\n\n00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.423\nit may be great there,\nbut terrible up there;\n\n00:17:57.447 --> 00:18:01.631\nmaybe terrible over there,\nbut not too bad there, etc., etc.\n\n00:18:01.655 --> 00:18:06.077\nSo to find an actual hall is incredible --\n\n00:18:06.101 --> 00:18:10.177\nfor which you can play\nexactly what you imagine,\n\n00:18:10.201 --> 00:18:13.308\nwithout it being cosmetically enhanced.\n\n00:18:13.332 --> 00:18:18.389\nSo therefore, acousticians\nare actually in conversation\n\n00:18:18.413 --> 00:18:21.708\nwith people who are hearing impaired,\n\n00:18:21.732 --> 00:18:26.583\nand who are participators of sound.\n\n00:18:26.607 --> 00:18:28.434\nAnd this is quite interesting.\n\n00:18:28.458 --> 00:18:32.445\nI cannot give you any detail\n\n00:18:32.469 --> 00:18:36.206\nas far as what is actually happening\nwith those halls,\n\n00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:40.338\nbut it's just the fact\nthat they are going to a group of people\n\n00:18:40.362 --> 00:18:44.308\nfor whom so many years, we've been saying,\n\n00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:47.673\n\"Well, how on earth can they experience\nmusic? They're deaf.\"\n\n00:18:47.697 --> 00:18:51.012\nWe go like that, and we imagine\nthat's what deafness is about.\n\n00:18:51.036 --> 00:18:54.172\nOr we go like that, and we imagine\nthat's what blindness is about.\n\n00:18:54.196 --> 00:18:58.018\nIf we see someone in a wheelchair,\nwe assume they cannot walk.\n\n00:18:58.042 --> 00:19:01.566\nIt may be that they can walk\nthree, four, five steps.\n\n00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:04.441\nThat, to them, means they can walk.\n\n00:19:05.552 --> 00:19:08.591\nIn a year's time,\nit could be two extra steps.\n\n00:19:09.257 --> 00:19:12.010\nIn another year's time, three extra steps.\n\n00:19:12.034 --> 00:19:16.737\nThose are hugely important\naspects to think about.\n\n00:19:16.761 --> 00:19:20.934\nSo when we do listen to each other,\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:24.647\nit's unbelievably important for us\n\n00:19:24.671 --> 00:19:29.289\nto really test our listening skills,\n\n00:19:29.313 --> 00:19:32.785\nto really use our bodies\nas a resonating chamber,\n\n00:19:32.809 --> 00:19:34.458\nto stop the judgment.\n\n00:19:34.482 --> 00:19:38.353\nFor me, as a musician who deals\nwith 99 percent of new music,\n\n00:19:38.377 --> 00:19:40.301\nit's very easy for me to say,\n\n00:19:40.325 --> 00:19:43.926\n\"Oh yes, I like that piece.\nNo, I don't like that piece,\" and so on.\n\n00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:49.079\nAnd I just find that I have to give\nthose pieces of music real time.\n\n00:19:49.103 --> 00:19:52.376\nIt may be that the chemistry\nisn't quite right between myself\n\n00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.177\nand that particular piece of music,\n\n00:19:54.201 --> 00:19:58.683\nbut that doesn't mean I have the right\nto say it's a bad piece of music.\n\n00:19:59.035 --> 00:20:04.135\nAnd you know, one of the great things\nabout being a musician\n\n00:20:04.159 --> 00:20:07.715\nis that it is so unbelievably fluid.\n\n00:20:07.739 --> 00:20:12.143\nSo there are no rules, no right,\nno wrong, this way, that way.\n\n00:20:12.167 --> 00:20:16.995\nIf I asked you to clap --\nmaybe I can do this.\n\n00:20:17.019 --> 00:20:23.393\nIf I can just say, \"Please clap\nand create the sound of thunder.\"\n\n00:20:23.417 --> 00:20:26.716\nI'm assuming we've all\nexperienced thunder.\n\n00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.322\nNow, I don't mean just the sound;\n\n00:20:28.346 --> 00:20:33.263\nI mean really listen\nto that thunder within yourselves.\n\n00:20:33.287 --> 00:20:35.745\nAnd please try to create that\nthrough your clapping.\n\n00:20:35.769 --> 00:20:37.718\nTry, just -- please try.\n\n00:20:37.742 --> 00:20:41.011\n(Loud clapping sounds)\n\n00:20:45.519 --> 00:20:46.669\n(Clapping ends)\n\n00:20:47.061 --> 00:20:48.419\nSnow.\n\n00:20:48.443 --> 00:20:50.579\n(Laughter)\n\n00:20:50.603 --> 00:20:51.771\nSnow.\n\n00:20:51.795 --> 00:20:54.031\n(Soft clapping sounds)\n\n00:20:54.055 --> 00:20:55.600\nHave you ever heard snow?\n\n00:20:55.624 --> 00:20:56.775\nAudience: No.\n\n00:20:56.799 --> 00:20:58.957\nEvelyn Glennie: Well, then, stop clapping.\n\n00:20:58.981 --> 00:21:00.380\n(Laughter)\n\n00:21:00.404 --> 00:21:03.609\nTry again. Try again: snow.\n\n00:21:03.974 --> 00:21:07.018\n(No sound)\n\n00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.384\nSee, you're awake.\n\n00:21:10.053 --> 00:21:11.300\nRain.\n\n00:21:11.672 --> 00:21:13.361\n(Light clapping sounds)\n\n00:21:13.845 --> 00:21:15.298\nEG: (Laughs)\n\n00:21:16.312 --> 00:21:19.042\nNot bad. Not bad.\n\n00:21:19.066 --> 00:21:23.822\nThe interesting thing here, though,\nis that I asked a group of kids\n\n00:21:23.846 --> 00:21:25.549\nnot so long ago\n\n00:21:25.573 --> 00:21:27.738\nexactly the same question.\n\n00:21:27.762 --> 00:21:31.141\nNow -- great imagination,\nthank you very much.\n\n00:21:31.165 --> 00:21:33.987\nHowever, not one of you got out\nof your seats to think,\n\n00:21:34.011 --> 00:21:35.678\n\"Right! How can I clap?\n\n00:21:35.702 --> 00:21:36.924\nOK, maybe:\n\n00:21:36.948 --> 00:21:39.457\n(Clapping sounds)\n\n00:21:39.481 --> 00:21:42.313\nMaybe I can use my jewelry\nto create extra sounds.\n\n00:21:42.337 --> 00:21:46.373\nMaybe I can use the other parts\nof my body to create extra sounds.\"\n\n00:21:46.397 --> 00:21:51.790\nNot a single one of you thought\nabout clapping in a slightly different way\n\n00:21:51.814 --> 00:21:54.932\nother than sitting in your seats\nthere and using two hands.\n\n00:21:54.956 --> 00:21:57.101\nIn the same way, when we listen to music,\n\n00:21:57.125 --> 00:22:01.066\nwe assume that it's all being\nfed through here.\n\n00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:03.634\nThis is how we experience music.\n\n00:22:03.658 --> 00:22:05.329\nOf course, it's not.\n\n00:22:05.353 --> 00:22:08.176\nWe experience thunder, thunder, thunder.\n\n00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.397\nThink, think, think.\n\n00:22:09.421 --> 00:22:11.311\nListen, listen, listen.\n\n00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:15.557\nNow, what can we do with thunder?\n\n00:22:16.224 --> 00:22:21.618\nI remember my teacher, when I first\nstarted, my very first lesson,\n\n00:22:21.642 --> 00:22:25.027\nI was all prepared\nwith sticks, ready to go.\n\n00:22:25.051 --> 00:22:29.847\nAnd instead of him saying,\n\"OK, Evelyn, please, feet slightly apart,\n\n00:22:29.871 --> 00:22:35.711\narms at a more or less 90-degree angle,\nsticks in a more or less V shape,\n\n00:22:35.735 --> 00:22:38.779\nkeep this amount of space here, etc.\n\n00:22:38.803 --> 00:22:41.357\nPlease keep your back straight,\netc., etc., etc.\" --\n\n00:22:41.381 --> 00:22:45.545\nwhere I was just probably going to end up\nabsolutely rigid, frozen,\n\n00:22:45.569 --> 00:22:47.578\nand I would not be able to strike the drum\n\n00:22:47.602 --> 00:22:49.822\nbecause I was thinking\nof so many other things,\n\n00:22:49.846 --> 00:22:52.409\nhe said, \"Evelyn, take this drum\naway for seven days,\n\n00:22:52.433 --> 00:22:54.218\nand I'll see you next week.\"\n\n00:22:54.242 --> 00:22:56.647\nSo -- heavens! What was I to do?\n\n00:22:56.671 --> 00:22:59.149\nI no longer required the sticks.\n\n00:22:59.173 --> 00:23:01.321\nI wasn't allowed to have these sticks.\n\n00:23:01.345 --> 00:23:04.982\nI had to basically look\nat this particular drum,\n\n00:23:05.006 --> 00:23:06.679\nsee how it was made,\n\n00:23:06.703 --> 00:23:09.719\nwhat these little lugs did,\nwhat the snares did.\n\n00:23:09.743 --> 00:23:12.695\nTurned it upside down,\nexperimented with the shell.\n\n00:23:12.719 --> 00:23:14.432\n(Drum sounds)\n\n00:23:14.456 --> 00:23:15.802\nExperimented with the head.\n\n00:23:15.826 --> 00:23:17.288\n(Drum sounds)\n\n00:23:17.312 --> 00:23:19.092\nExperimented with my body.\n\n00:23:19.116 --> 00:23:20.910\n(Drum sounds)\n\n00:23:20.934 --> 00:23:22.758\nExperimented with jewelry.\n\n00:23:22.782 --> 00:23:24.870\nExperimented with all sorts of things.\n\n00:23:24.894 --> 00:23:28.273\n(Drum sounds)\n\n00:23:31.314 --> 00:23:33.790\n(Drum sounds end)\n\n00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.340\nAnd of course, I returned\nwith all sorts of bruises.\n\n00:23:38.364 --> 00:23:39.615\n(Laughter)\n\n00:23:39.639 --> 00:23:42.999\nBut nevertheless, it was such\nan unbelievable experience,\n\n00:23:43.023 --> 00:23:47.725\nbecause where on earth are you going\nto experience that in a piece of music?\n\n00:23:47.749 --> 00:23:51.735\nWhere on earth are you going\nto experience that in a study book?\n\n00:23:51.759 --> 00:23:55.464\nSo we never, ever dealt\nwith actual study books.\n\n00:23:55.488 --> 00:23:58.144\nSo for example,\none of the things that we learn\n\n00:23:58.168 --> 00:24:02.852\nwhen we are dealing\nwith being a percussion player\n\n00:24:02.876 --> 00:24:04.235\nas opposed to a musician,\n\n00:24:04.259 --> 00:24:07.864\nis basically, straightforward\nsingle-stroke rolls.\n\n00:24:07.888 --> 00:24:11.512\n(Drum sounds)\n\n00:24:11.536 --> 00:24:13.646\nLike that, and then\nwe get a little faster --\n\n00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:14.838\n(Drum sounds)\n\n00:24:14.862 --> 00:24:16.058\nand a little faster --\n\n00:24:16.082 --> 00:24:17.260\n(Drum sounds)\n\n00:24:17.284 --> 00:24:19.766\nand a little faster,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:21.229\nWhat does this piece require?\n\n00:24:21.253 --> 00:24:22.628\nSingle-stroke rolls.\n\n00:24:22.652 --> 00:24:25.851\n(Drum sound)\n\n00:24:25.875 --> 00:24:29.337\nSo why can't I then do that\nwhilst learning a piece of music?\n\n00:24:29.361 --> 00:24:32.179\nAnd that's exactly what he did.\n\n00:24:32.203 --> 00:24:37.553\nAnd interestingly, the older I became,\nand when I became a full-time student\n\n00:24:37.577 --> 00:24:42.835\nat a so-called \"music institution,\"\nall of that went out of the window.\n\n00:24:42.859 --> 00:24:45.600\nWe had to study from study books.\n\n00:24:45.624 --> 00:24:49.725\nAnd constantly, the question, \"Well, why?\nWhy?

And so the question that we might not have birds became kind of fundamental to those of us wandering around looking for the meadowlarks that seemed to have all disappeared. And the question was, were the birds singing? Now, I'm not a scientist, that'll be really clear. But, you know, we've just come from this discussion of what a bird might be. What is a bird? Well, in my world, this is a rubber duck. It comes in California with a warning \u2014 \"This product contains chemicals known by the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.\" This is a bird. What kind of culture would produce a product of this kind and then label it and sell it to children? I think we have a design problem.Someone heard the six hours of talk that I gave called \"The Monticello Dialogues\" on NPR, and sent me this as a thank you note \u2014 \"We realize that design is a signal of intention, but it also has to occur within a world, and we have to understand that world in order to imbue our designs with inherent intelligence, and so as we look back at the basic state of affairs in which we design, we, in a way, need to go to the primordial condition to understand the operating system and the frame conditions of a planet, and I think the exciting part of that is the good news that's there, because the news is the news of abundance, and not the news of limits, and I think as our culture tortures itself now with tyrannies and concerns over limits and fear, we can add this other dimension of abundance that is coherent, driven by the sun, and start to imagine what that would be like to share.\" That was a nice thing to get. That was one sentence. Henry James would be proud. This is \u2014 I put it down at the bottom, but that was extemporaneous, obviously.The fundamental issue is that, for me, design is the first signal of human intentions. So what are our intentions, and what would our intentions be \u2014 if we wake up in the morning, we have designs on the world \u2014 well, what would our intention be as a species now that we're the dominant species? And it's not just stewardship and dominion debate, because really, dominion is implicit in stewardship \u2014 because how could you dominate something you had killed? And stewardship's implicit in dominion, because you can't be steward of something if you can't dominate it.So the question is, what is the first question for designers? Now, as guardians \u2014 let's say the state, for example, which reserves the right to kill, the right to be duplicitous and so on \u2014 the question we're asking the guardian at this point is are we meant, how are we meant, to secure local societies, create world peace and save the environment? But I don't know that that's the common debate.Commerce, on the other hand, is relatively quick, essentially creative, highly effective and efficient, and fundamentally honest, because we can't exchange value for very long if we don't trust each other. So we use the tools of commerce primarily for our work, but the question we bring to it is, how do we love all the children of all species for all time? And so we start our designs with that question. Because what we realize today is that modern culture appears to have adopted a strategy of tragedy. If we come here and say, \"Well, I didn't intend to cause global warming on the way here,\" and we say, \"That's not part of my plan,\" then we realize it's part of our de facto plan. Because it's the thing that's happening because we have no other plan.And I was at the White House for President Bush, meeting with every federal department and agency, and I pointed out that they appear to have no plan. If the end game is global warming, they're doing great. If the end game is mercury toxification of our children downwind of coal fire plants as they scuttled the Clean Air Act, then I see that our education programs should be explicitly defined as, \"Brain death for all children. No child left behind.\"(Applause)So, the question is, how many federal officials are ready to move to Ohio and Pennsylvania with their families? So if you don't have an endgame of something delightful, then you're just moving chess pieces around, if you don't know you're taking the king. So perhaps we could develop a strategy of change, which requires humility. And in my business as an architect, it's unfortunate the word \"humility\" and the word \"architect\" have not appeared in the same paragraph since \"The Fountainhead.\" So if anybody here has trouble with the concept of design humility, reflect on this \u2014 it took us 5,000 years to put wheels on our luggage. So, as Kevin Kelly pointed out, there is no endgame. There is an infinite game, and we're playing in that infinite game. And so we call it \"cradle to cradle,\" and our goal is very simple.This is what I presented to the White House. Our goal is a delightfully diverse, safe, healthy and just world, with clean air, clean water, soil and power \u2014 economically, equitably, ecologically and elegantly enjoyed, period.(Applause)What don't you like about this? Which part of this don't you like? So we realized we want full diversity, even though it can be difficult to remember what De Gaulle said when asked what it was like to be President of France. He said, \"What do you think it's like trying to run a country with 400 kinds of cheese?\" But at the same time, we realize that our products are not safe and healthy.So we've designed products and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million. This is a baby blanket by Pendleton that will give your child nutrition instead of Alzheimer's later in life. We can ask ourselves, what is justice, and is justice blind, or is justice blindness? And at what point did that uniform turn from white to black? Water has been declared a human right by the United Nations. Air quality is an obvious thing to anyone who breathes. Is there anybody here who doesn't breathe? Clean soil is a critical problem \u2014 the nitrification, the dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico. A fundamental issue that's not being addressed. We've seen the first form of solar energy that's beat the hegemony of fossil fuels in the form of wind here in the Great Plains, and so that hegemony is leaving. And if we remember Sheikh Yamani when he formed OPEC, they asked him, \"When will we see the end of the age of oil?\" I don't know if you remember his answer, but it was, \"The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones.\" We see that companies acting ethically in this world are outperforming those that don't. We see the flows of materials in a rather terrifying prospect. This is a hospital monitor from Los Angeles, sent to China. This woman will expose herself to toxic phosphorous, release four pounds of toxic lead into her childrens' environment, which is from copper.On the other hand, we see great signs of hope. Here's Dr. Venkataswamy in India, who's figured out how to do mass-produced health. He has given eyesight to two million people for free. We see in our material flows that car steels don't become car steel again because of the contaminants of the coatings \u2014 bismuth, antimony, copper and so on. They become building steel. On the other hand, we're working with Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett and Shaw Carpet, the largest carpet company in the world. We've developed a carpet that is continuously recyclable, down to the parts per million. The upper is Nylon 6 that can go back to caprolactam, the bottom, a polyolephine \u2014 infinitely recyclable thermoplastic. Now if I was a bird, the building on my left is a liability. The building on my right, which is our corporate campus for The Gap with an ancient meadow, is an asset \u2014 its nesting grounds.Here's where I come from. I grew up in Hong Kong, with six million people in 40 square miles. During the dry season, we had four hours of water every fourth day. And the relationship to landscape was that of farmers who have been farming the same piece of ground for 40 centuries. You can't farm the same piece of ground for 40 centuries without understanding nutrient flow. My childhood summers were in the Puget Sound of Washington, among the first growth and big growth. My grandfather had been a lumberjack in the Olympics, so I have a lot of tree karma I am working off. I went to Yale for graduate school, studied in a building of this style by Le Corbusier, affectionately known in our business as Brutalism. If we look at the world of architecture, we see with Mies' 1928 tower for Berlin, the question might be, \"Well, where's the sun?\" And this might have worked in Berlin, but we built it in Houston, and the windows are all closed. And with most products appearing not to have been designed for indoor use, this is actually a vertical gas chamber.When I went to Yale, we had the first energy crisis, and I was designing the first solar-heated house in Ireland as a student, which I then built \u2014 which would give you a sense of my ambition. And Richard Meier, who was one of my teachers, kept coming over to my desk to give me criticism, and he would say, \"Bill, you've got to understand- \u2014 solar energy has nothing to do with architecture.\" I guess he didn't read Vitruvius. In 1984, we did the first so-called \"green office\" in America for Environmental Defense. We started asking manufacturers what were in their materials. They said, \"They're proprietary, they're legal, go away.\" The only indoor quality work done in this country at that time was sponsored by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, and it was to prove there was no danger from secondhand smoke in the workplace.So, all of a sudden, here I am, graduating from high school in 1969, and this happens, and we realize that \"away\" went away. Remember we used to throw things away, and we'd point to away? And yet, NOAA has now shown us, for example \u2014 you see that little blue thing above Hawaii? That's the Pacific Gyre. It was recently dragged for plankton by scientists, and they found six times as much plastic as plankton. When asked, they said, \"It's kind of like a giant toilet that doesn't flush.\" Perhaps that's away. So we're looking for the design rules of this \u2014 this is the highest biodiversity of trees in the world, Irian Jaya, 259 species of tree, and we described this in the book, \"Cradle to Cradle.\" The book itself is a polymer. It is not a tree. That's the name of the first chapter \u2014 \"This Book is Not a Tree.\" Because in poetics, as Margaret Atwood pointed out, \"we write our history on the skin of fish with the blood of bears.\" And with so much polymer, what we really need is technical nutrition, and to use something as elegant as a tree \u2014 imagine this design assignment: Design something that makes oxygen, sequesters carbon, fixes nitrogen, distills water, accrues solar energy as fuel, makes complex sugars and food, creates microclimates, changes colors with the seasons and self-replicates. Well, why don't we knock that down and write on it?(Laughter)So, we're looking at the same criteria as most people \u2014 you know, can I afford it? Does it work? Do I like it? We're adding the Jeffersonian agenda, and I come from Charlottesville, where I've had the privilege of living in a house designed by Thomas Jefferson. We're adding life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Now if we look at the word \"competition,\" I'm sure most of you've used it. You know, most people don't realize it comes from the Latin competere, which means strive together. It means the way Olympic athletes train with each other. They get fit together, and then they compete. The Williams sisters compete \u2014 one wins Wimbledon. So we've been looking at the idea of competition as a way of cooperating in order to get fit together. And the Chinese government has now \u2014 I work with the Chinese government now \u2014 has taken this up. We're also looking at survival of the fittest, not in just competition terms in our modern context of destroy the other or beat them to the ground, but really to fit together and build niches and have growth that is good.Now most environmentalists don't say growth is good, because, in our lexicon, asphalt is two words: assigning blame. But if we look at asphalt as our growth, then we realize that all we're doing is destroying the planetary's fundamental underlying operating system. So when we see E equals mc squared come along, from a poet's perspective, we see energy as physics, chemistry as mass, and all of a sudden, you get this biology. And we have plenty of energy, so we'll solve that problem, but the biology problem's tricky, because as we put through all these toxic materials that we disgorge, we will never be able to recover that. And as Francis Crick pointed out, nine years after discovering DNA with Mr. Watson, that life itself has to have growth as a precondition \u2014 it has to have free energy, sunlight and it needs to be an open system of chemicals. So we're asking for human artifice to become a living thing, and we want growth, we want free energy from sunlight and we want an open metabolism for chemicals. Then, the question becomes not growth or no growth, but what do you want to grow? So instead of just growing destruction, we want to grow the things that we might enjoy, and someday the FDA will allow us to make French cheese.So therefore, we have these two metabolisms, and I worked with a German chemist, Michael Braungart, and we've identified the two fundamental metabolisms. The biological one I'm sure you understand, but also the technical one, where we take materials and put them into closed cycles. We call them biological nutrition and technical nutrition. Technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition. Biological nutrition can supply about 500 million humans, which means that if we all wore Birkenstocks and cotton, the world would run out of cork and dry up. So we need materials in closed cycles, but we need to analyze them down to the parts per million for cancer, birth defects, mutagenic effects, disruption of our immune systems, biodegradation, persistence, heavy metal content, knowledge of how we're making them and their production and so on.Our first product was a textile where we analyzed 8,000 chemicals in the textile industry. Using those intellectual filters, we eliminated [7,962.] We were left with 38 chemicals. We have since databased the 4000 most commonly used chemicals in human manufacturing, and we're releasing this database into the public in six weeks. So designers all over the world can analyze their products down to the parts per million for human and ecological health.(Applause)We've developed a protocol so that companies can send these same messages all the way through their supply chains, because when we asked most companies we work with \u2014 about a trillion dollars \u2014 and say, \"Where does your stuff come from?\" They say, \"Suppliers.\" \"And where does it go?\" \"Customers.\" So we need some help there.So the biological nutrients, the first fabrics \u2014 the water coming out was clean enough to drink. Technical nutrients \u2014 this is for Shaw Carpet, infinitely reusable carpet. Here's nylon going back to caprolactam back to carpet. Biotechnical nutrients \u2014 the Model U for Ford Motor, a cradle to cradle car \u2014 concept car. Shoes for Nike, where the uppers are polyesters, infinitely recyclable, the bottoms are biodegradable soles. Wear your old shoes in, your new shoes out. There is no finish line. The idea here of the car is that some of the materials go back to the industry forever, some of the materials go back to soil \u2014 it's all solar-powered.Here's a building at Oberlin College we designed that makes more energy than it needs to operate and purifies its own water. Here's a building for The Gap, where the ancient grasses of San Bruno, California, are on the roof.And this is our project for Ford Motor Company. It's the revitalization of the River Rouge in Dearborn. This is obviously a color photograph. These are our tools. These are how we sold it to Ford. We saved Ford 35 million dollars doing it this way, day one, which is the equivalent of the Ford Taurus at a four percent margin of an order for 900 million dollars worth of cars. Here it is. It's the world's largest green roof, 10 and a half acres. This is the roof, saving money, and this is the first species to arrive here. These are killdeer. They showed up in five days. And we now have 350-pound auto workers learning bird songs on the Internet. We're developing now protocols for cities \u2014 that's the home of technical nutrients. The country \u2014 the home of biological. And putting them together.And so I will finish by showing you a new city we're designing for the Chinese government. We're doing 12 cities for China right now, based on cradle to cradle as templates. Our assignment is to develop protocols for the housing for 400 million people in 12 years. We did a mass energy balance \u2014 if they use brick, they will lose all their soil and burn all their coal. They'll have cities with no energy and no food. We signed a Memorandum of Understanding \u2014 here's Madam Deng Nan, Deng Xiaoping's daughter \u2014 for China to adopt cradle to cradle. Because if they toxify themselves, being the lowest-cost producer, send it to the lowest-cost distribution \u2014 Wal-Mart \u2014 and then we send them all our money, what we'll discover is that we have what, effectively, when I was a student, was called mutually assured destruction.Now we do it by molecule. These are our cities. We're building a new city next to this city; look at that landscape. This is the site. We don't normally do green fields, but this one is about to be built, so they brought us in to intercede. This is their plan. It's a rubber stamp grid that they laid right on that landscape. And they brought us in and said, \"What would you do?\" This is what they would end up with, which is another color photograph. So this is the existing site, so this is what it looks like now, and here's our proposal.(Applause)So the way we approached this is we studied the hydrology very carefully. We studied the biota, the ancient biota, the current farming and the protocols. We studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city will have fresh air, fresh water and direct sunlight in every single apartment at some point during the day. We then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure. We lay out the building areas. We start to integrate commercial and mixed use so the people all have centers and places to be. The transportation is all very simple, everybody's within a five-minute walk of mobility. We have a 24-hour street, so that there's always a place that's alive. The waste systems all connect. If you flush a toilet, your feces will go to the sewage treatment plants, which are sold as assets, not liabilities. Because who wants the fertilizer factory that makes natural gas? The waters are all taken in to construct the wetlands for habitat restorations. And then it makes natural gas, which then goes back into the city to power the fuel for the cooking for the city. So this is \u2014 these are fertilizer gas plants. And then the compost is all taken back to the roofs of the city, where we've got farming, because what we've done is lifted up the city, the landscape, into the air to \u2014 to restore the native landscape on the roofs of the buildings. The solar power of all the factory centers and all the industrial zones with their light roofs powers the city.And this is the concept for the top of the city. We've lifted the earth up onto the roofs. The farmers have little bridges to get from one roof to the next. We inhabit the city with work/live space on all the ground floors. And so this is the existing city, and this is the new city.(Applause)", "id": 104, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nIn 1962, with Rachel Carson's \"Silent Spring,\"\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nI think for people like me in the world of the making of things,\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nthe canary in the mine wasn't singing.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nAnd so the question that we might not have birds\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nbecame kind of fundamental to those of us wandering around\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nlooking for the meadowlarks that seemed to have all disappeared.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nAnd the question was, were the birds singing?\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nNow, I'm not a scientist, that'll be really clear.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nBut, you know, we've just come from this discussion of what a bird might be.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nWhat is a bird?\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nWell, in my world, this is a rubber duck.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nIt comes in California with a warning --\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:55.958\n\"This product contains chemicals known by the State of California\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nto cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.\"\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nThis is a bird.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nWhat kind of culture would produce a product of this kind\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nand then label it and sell it to children?\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nI think we have a design problem.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nSomeone heard the six hours of talk that I gave\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:27.958\ncalled \"The Monticello Dialogues\" on NPR, and sent me this as a thank you note --\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\n\"We realize that design is a signal of intention,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nbut it also has to occur within a world,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nand we have to understand that world in order to\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nimbue our designs with inherent intelligence,\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nand so as we look back at the basic state of affairs\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nin which we design, we, in a way, need to go to the primordial condition\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nto understand the operating system and the frame conditions of a planet,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nand I think the exciting part of that is the good news that's there,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nbecause the news is the news of abundance,\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nand not the news of limits,\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nand I think as our culture tortures itself now\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nwith tyrannies and concerns over limits and fear,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nwe can add this other dimension of abundance that is coherent,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\ndriven by the sun, and start to imagine\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nwhat that would be like to share.\"\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nThat was a nice thing to get.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nThat was one sentence.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nHenry James would be proud.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nThis is -- I put it down at the bottom,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nbut that was extemporaneous, obviously.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nThe fundamental issue is that, for me,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\ndesign is the first signal of human intentions.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nSo what are our intentions, and what would our intentions be --\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nif we wake up in the morning, we have designs on the world --\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nwell, what would our intention be as a species\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nnow that we're the dominant species?\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nAnd it's not just stewardship and dominion debate,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nbecause really, dominion is implicit in stewardship --\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nbecause how could you dominate something you had killed?\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nAnd stewardship's implicit in dominion,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nbecause you can't be steward of something if you can't dominate it.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nSo the question is, what is the first question for designers?\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nNow, as guardians -- let's say the state, for example,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nwhich reserves the right to kill, the right to be duplicitous and so on --\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nthe question we're asking the guardian at this point is\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nare we meant, how are we meant,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nto secure local societies, create world peace\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nand save the environment?\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nBut I don't know that that's the common debate.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nCommerce, on the other hand, is relatively quick,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nessentially creative, highly effective and efficient,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nand fundamentally honest, because we can't exchange\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nvalue for very long if we don't trust each other.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nSo we use the tools of commerce primarily for our work,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nbut the question we bring to it is,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nhow do we love all the children of all species for all time?\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nAnd so we start our designs with that question.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nBecause what we realize today is that modern culture\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nappears to have adopted a strategy of tragedy.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nIf we come here and say, \"Well, I didn't intend\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nto cause global warming on the way here,\"\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nand we say, \"That's not part of my plan,\"\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nthen we realize it's part of our de facto plan.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nBecause it's the thing that's happening because we have no other plan.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nAnd I was at the White House for President Bush,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nmeeting with every federal department and agency,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nand I pointed out that they appear to have no plan.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nIf the end game is global warming, they're doing great.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nIf the end game is mercury toxification of our children\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\ndownwind of coal fire plants as they scuttled the Clean Air Act,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nthen I see that our education programs should be explicitly defined as,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\n\"Brain death for all children. No child left behind.\"\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:44.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nSo, the question is, how many federal officials\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nare ready to move to Ohio and Pennsylvania with their families?\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nSo if you don't have an endgame of something delightful,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nthen you're just moving chess pieces around,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nif you don't know you're taking the king.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nSo perhaps we could develop a strategy of change,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nwhich requires humility. And in my business as an architect,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nit's unfortunate the word \"humility\" and the word \"architect\"\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nhave not appeared in the same paragraph since \"The Fountainhead.\"\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nSo if anybody here has trouble with the concept of design humility,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nreflect on this -- it took us 5,000 years\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nto put wheels on our luggage.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nSo, as Kevin Kelly pointed out, there is no endgame.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nThere is an infinite game, and we're playing in that infinite game.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nAnd so we call it \"cradle to cradle,\"\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nand our goal is very simple.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nThis is what I presented to the White House.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nOur goal is a delightfully diverse, safe, healthy and just world,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nwith clean air, clean water, soil and power --\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:47.958\neconomically, equitably, ecologically and elegantly enjoyed, period.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nWhat don't you like about this?\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nWhich part of this don't you like?\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nSo we realized we want full diversity,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\neven though it can be difficult to remember what De Gaulle said\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nwhen asked what it was like to be President of France.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nHe said, \"What do you think it's like trying to run a country with 400 kinds of cheese?\"\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nBut at the same time, we realize that our products are not safe and healthy.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nSo we've designed products\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nand we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nThis is a baby blanket by Pendleton that will give your child nutrition\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\ninstead of Alzheimer's later in life.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nWe can ask ourselves, what is justice,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nand is justice blind, or is justice blindness?\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nAnd at what point did that uniform turn from white to black?\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nWater has been declared a human right by the United Nations.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nAir quality is an obvious thing to anyone who breathes.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nIs there anybody here who doesn't breathe?\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nClean soil is a critical problem -- the nitrification, the dead zones\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nin the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nA fundamental issue that's not being addressed.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nWe've seen the first form of solar energy\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nthat's beat the hegemony of fossil fuels in the form of wind\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nhere in the Great Plains, and so that hegemony is leaving.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nAnd if we remember Sheikh Yamani when he formed OPEC,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nthey asked him, \"When will we see the end of the age of oil?\"\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nI don't know if you remember his answer, but it was,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:05.958\n\"The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones.\"\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nWe see that companies acting ethically in this world\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nare outperforming those that don't.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nWe see the flows of materials in a rather terrifying prospect.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nThis is a hospital monitor from Los Angeles, sent to China.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nThis woman will expose herself to toxic phosphorous,\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nrelease four pounds of toxic lead into her childrens' environment,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nwhich is from copper.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nOn the other hand, we see great signs of hope.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nHere's Dr. Venkataswamy in India, who's figured out\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nhow to do mass-produced health.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nHe has given eyesight to two million people for free.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nWe see in our material flows that car steels don't become car steel again\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nbecause of the contaminants of the coatings --\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nbismuth, antimony, copper and so on.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nThey become building steel.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nOn the other hand, we're working with Berkshire Hathaway,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nWarren Buffett and Shaw Carpet,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nthe largest carpet company in the world.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nWe've developed a carpet that is continuously recyclable,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\ndown to the parts per million.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nThe upper is Nylon 6 that can go back to caprolactam,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nthe bottom, a polyolephine -- infinitely recyclable thermoplastic.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nNow if I was a bird, the building on my left is a liability.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nThe building on my right, which is our corporate campus for The Gap\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nwith an ancient meadow, is an asset -- its nesting grounds.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nHere's where I come from. I grew up in Hong Kong,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nwith six million people in 40 square miles.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nDuring the dry season, we had four hours of water every fourth day.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nAnd the relationship to landscape was that of farmers who have been\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nfarming the same piece of ground for 40 centuries.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nYou can't farm the same piece of ground for 40 centuries\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nwithout understanding nutrient flow.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nMy childhood summers were in the Puget Sound of Washington,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\namong the first growth and big growth.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nMy grandfather had been a lumberjack in the Olympics,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nso I have a lot of tree karma I am working off.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nI went to Yale for graduate school,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nstudied in a building of this style by Le Corbusier,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:55.958\naffectionately known in our business as Brutalism.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nIf we look at the world of architecture,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nwe see with Mies' 1928 tower for Berlin,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nthe question might be, \"Well, where's the sun?\"\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nAnd this might have worked in Berlin, but we built it in Houston,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nand the windows are all closed. And with most products\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nappearing not to have been designed for indoor use,\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nthis is actually a vertical gas chamber.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nWhen I went to Yale, we had the first energy crisis,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nand I was designing the first solar-heated house in Ireland\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nas a student, which I then built --\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nwhich would give you a sense of my ambition.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nAnd Richard Meier, who was one of my teachers,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nkept coming over to my desk to give me criticism,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nand he would say, \"Bill, you've got to understand- --\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nsolar energy has nothing to do with architecture.\"\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nI guess he didn't read Vitruvius.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nIn 1984, we did the first so-called \"green office\" in America\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nfor Environmental Defense.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nWe started asking manufacturers what were in their materials.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nThey said, \"They're proprietary, they're legal, go away.\"\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nThe only indoor quality work done in this country at that time\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nwas sponsored by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nand it was to prove there was no danger\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nfrom secondhand smoke in the workplace.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nSo, all of a sudden, here I am, graduating from high school in 1969,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nand this happens, and we realize that \"away\" went away.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nRemember we used to throw things away, and we'd point to away?\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nAnd yet, NOAA has now shown us, for example --\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nyou see that little blue thing above Hawaii?\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nThat's the Pacific Gyre.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nIt was recently dragged for plankton by scientists,\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nand they found six times as much plastic as plankton.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nWhen asked, they said, \"It's kind of like a giant toilet that doesn't flush.\"\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nPerhaps that's away.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nSo we're looking for the design rules of this --\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nthis is the highest biodiversity of trees in the world, Irian Jaya,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:34.958\n259 species of tree, and we described this\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nin the book, \"Cradle to Cradle.\"\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nThe book itself is a polymer. It is not a tree.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nThat's the name of the first chapter -- \"This Book is Not a Tree.\"\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nBecause in poetics, as Margaret Atwood pointed out,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\n\"we write our history on the skin of fish\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nwith the blood of bears.\"\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nAnd with so much polymer, what we really need\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nis technical nutrition, and to use something\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nas elegant as a tree -- imagine this design assignment:\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nDesign something that makes oxygen, sequesters carbon,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nfixes nitrogen, distills water, accrues solar energy as fuel,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nmakes complex sugars and food, creates microclimates,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nchanges colors with the seasons and self-replicates.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nWell, why don't we knock that down and write on it?\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nSo, we're looking at the same criteria\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nas most people -- you know, can I afford it?\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nDoes it work? Do I like it?\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nWe're adding the Jeffersonian agenda, and I come from Charlottesville,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nwhere I've had the privilege of living in a house designed by Thomas Jefferson.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nWe're adding life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nNow if we look at the word \"competition,\"\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nI'm sure most of you've used it.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nYou know, most people don't realize it comes from\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nthe Latin competere, which means strive together.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nIt means the way Olympic athletes train with each other.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nThey get fit together, and then they compete.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nThe Williams sisters compete -- one wins Wimbledon.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nSo we've been looking at the idea of competition\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nas a way of cooperating in order to get fit together.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAnd the Chinese government has now --\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nI work with the Chinese government now --\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nhas taken this up.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nWe're also looking at survival of the fittest,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nnot in just competition terms in our modern context\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nof destroy the other or beat them to the ground,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nbut really to fit together and build niches\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nand have growth that is good.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nNow most environmentalists don't say growth is good,\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nbecause, in our lexicon, asphalt is two words: assigning blame.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nBut if we look at asphalt as our growth,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nthen we realize that all we're doing is destroying\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nthe planetary's fundamental underlying operating system.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nSo when we see E equals mc squared come along, from a poet's perspective,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nwe see energy as physics, chemistry as mass,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nand all of a sudden, you get this biology.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nAnd we have plenty of energy, so we'll solve that problem,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nbut the biology problem's tricky, because as we put through\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nall these toxic materials that we disgorge,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nwe will never be able to recover that.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nAnd as Francis Crick pointed out, nine years\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nafter discovering DNA with Mr. Watson,\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nthat life itself has to have growth as a precondition --\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nit has to have free energy, sunlight\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nand it needs to be an open system of chemicals.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nSo we're asking for human artifice to become a living thing,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nand we want growth, we want free energy from sunlight\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nand we want an open metabolism for chemicals.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nThen, the question becomes not growth or no growth,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nbut what do you want to grow?\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nSo instead of just growing destruction,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nwe want to grow the things that we might enjoy,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nand someday the FDA will allow us to make French cheese.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nSo therefore, we have these two metabolisms,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nand I worked with a German chemist, Michael Braungart,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nand we've identified the two fundamental metabolisms.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nThe biological one I'm sure you understand,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nbut also the technical one, where we take materials\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nand put them into closed cycles.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nWe call them biological nutrition and technical nutrition.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nTechnical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nBiological nutrition can supply about 500 million humans,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nwhich means that if we all wore Birkenstocks and cotton,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nthe world would run out of cork and dry up.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nSo we need materials in closed cycles,\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nbut we need to analyze them down to the parts per million\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nfor cancer, birth defects, mutagenic effects,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\ndisruption of our immune systems, biodegradation, persistence,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nheavy metal content, knowledge of how we're making them\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nand their production and so on.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nOur first product was a textile where we analyzed 8,000 chemicals\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nin the textile industry.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nUsing those intellectual filters, we eliminated [7,962.]\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nWe were left with 38 chemicals.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nWe have since databased the 4000 most commonly used chemicals\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nin human manufacturing, and we're releasing this database into the public in six weeks.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nSo designers all over the world can analyze their products\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:38.958\ndown to the parts per million for human and ecological health.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:43.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nWe've developed a protocol so that companies can send\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nthese same messages all the way through their supply chains,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nbecause when we asked most companies we work with -- about a trillion dollars\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\n-- and say, \"Where does your stuff come from?\" They say, \"Suppliers.\"\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\n\"And where does it go?\"\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:57.958\n\"Customers.\"\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nSo we need some help there.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nSo the biological nutrients, the first fabrics --\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nthe water coming out was clean enough to drink.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nTechnical nutrients -- this is for Shaw Carpet, infinitely reusable carpet.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nHere's nylon going back to caprolactam back to carpet.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nBiotechnical nutrients -- the Model U for Ford Motor,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\na cradle to cradle car -- concept car.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nShoes for Nike, where the uppers are polyesters, infinitely recyclable,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nthe bottoms are biodegradable soles.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nWear your old shoes in, your new shoes out.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nThere is no finish line.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nThe idea here of the car is that some of the materials\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\ngo back to the industry forever, some of the materials go back to soil --\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nit's all solar-powered.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nHere's a building at Oberlin College we designed\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nthat makes more energy than it needs to operate and purifies its own water.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nHere's a building for The Gap, where the ancient grasses\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nof San Bruno, California, are on the roof.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nAnd this is our project for Ford Motor Company.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nIt's the revitalization of the River Rouge in Dearborn.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nThis is obviously a color photograph.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nThese are our tools. These are how we sold it to Ford.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nWe saved Ford 35 million dollars doing it this way, day one,\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nwhich is the equivalent of the Ford Taurus\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nat a four percent margin of an order for 900 million dollars worth of cars.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nHere it is. It's the world's largest green roof, 10 and a half acres.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nThis is the roof, saving money,\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nand this is the first species to arrive here. These are killdeer.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nThey showed up in five days.\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nAnd we now have 350-pound auto workers\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nlearning bird songs on the Internet.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nWe're developing now protocols for cities --\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nthat's the home of technical nutrients.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nThe country -- the home of biological. And putting them together.\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nAnd so I will finish by showing you a new city\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nwe're designing for the Chinese government.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nWe're doing 12 cities for China right now,\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nbased on cradle to cradle as templates.\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nOur assignment is to develop protocols for the housing\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nfor 400 million people in 12 years.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nWe did a mass energy balance -- if they use brick,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nthey will lose all their soil and burn all their coal.\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nThey'll have cities with no energy and no food.\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nWe signed a Memorandum of Understanding --\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nhere's Madam Deng Nan, Deng Xiaoping's daughter --\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nfor China to adopt cradle to cradle.\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nBecause if they toxify themselves, being the lowest-cost producer,\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nsend it to the lowest-cost distribution -- Wal-Mart --\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nand then we send them all our money, what we'll discover is that\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nwe have what, effectively, when I was a student,\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nwas called mutually assured destruction.\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nNow we do it by molecule. These are our cities.\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nWe're building a new city next to this city; look at that landscape.\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nThis is the site.\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nWe don't normally do green fields, but this one is about to be built,\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nso they brought us in to intercede.\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nThis is their plan.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nIt's a rubber stamp grid that they laid right on that landscape.\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nAnd they brought us in and said, \"What would you do?\"\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nThis is what they would end up with, which is another color photograph.\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nSo this is the existing site, so this is what it looks like now,\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nand here's our proposal.\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:48.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nSo the way we approached this\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nis we studied the hydrology very carefully.\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nWe studied the biota, the ancient biota,\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nthe current farming and the protocols.\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nWe studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nwill have fresh air, fresh water and direct sunlight\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nin every single apartment at some point during the day.\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nWe then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure.\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nWe lay out the building areas.\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:15.958\nWe start to integrate commercial and mixed use\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nso the people all have centers and places to be.\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nThe transportation is all very simple,\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:23.958\neverybody's within a five-minute walk of mobility.\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nWe have a 24-hour street, so that there's always a place that's alive.\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nThe waste systems all connect.\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nIf you flush a toilet, your feces will go to the sewage treatment plants,\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nwhich are sold as assets, not liabilities.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nBecause who wants the fertilizer factory that makes natural gas?\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:46.958\nThe waters are all taken in to construct the wetlands for habitat restorations.\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nAnd then it makes natural gas, which then goes back into the city\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nto power the fuel for the cooking for the city.\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nSo this is -- these are fertilizer gas plants.\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:59.958\nAnd then the compost is all taken back\n\n00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nto the roofs of the city, where we've got farming,\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nbecause what we've done is lifted up the city,\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:12.958\nthe landscape, into the air to -- to restore the native landscape\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:14.958\non the roofs of the buildings.\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nThe solar power of all the factory centers\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:20.958\nand all the industrial zones with their light roofs powers the city.\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:22.958\nAnd this is the concept for the top of the city.\n\n00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nWe've lifted the earth up onto the roofs.\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:30.958\nThe farmers have little bridges to get from one roof to the next.\n\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:34.958\nWe inhabit the city with work/live space on all the ground floors.\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:39.958\nAnd so this is the existing city, and this is the new city.\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:53.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The electricity metaphor for the web's future", "duration": "1031", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_bezos_on_the_next_web_innovation", "transcript": "When you think about resilience and technology it's actually much easier. You're going to see some other speakers today, I already know, who are going to talk about breaking-bones stuff, and, of course, with technology it never is. So it's very easy, comparatively speaking, to be resilient. I think that, if we look at what happened on the Internet, with such an incredible last half a dozen years, that it's hard to even get the right analogy for it. A lot of how we decide, how we're supposed to react to things and what we're supposed to expect about the future depends on how we bucket things and how we categorize them.And so I think the tempting analogy for the boom-bust that we just went through with the Internet is a gold rush. It's easy to think of this analogy as very different from some of the other things you might pick. For one thing, both were very real. In 1849, in that Gold Rush, they took over $700 million worth of gold out of California. It was very real. The Internet was also very real. This is a real way for humans to communicate with each other. It's a big deal. Huge boom. Huge boom. Huge bust. Huge bust. You keep going, and both things are lots of hype. I don't have to remind you of all the hype that was involved with the Internet \u2014 like GetRich.com.But you had the same thing with the Gold Rush. \"Gold. Gold. Gold.\" Sixty-eight rich men on the Steamer Portland. Stacks of yellow metal. Some have 5,000. Many have more. A few bring out 100,000 dollars each. People would get very excited about this when they read these articles. \"The Eldorado of the United States of America: the discovery of inexhaustible gold mines in California.\" And the parallels between the Gold Rush and the Internet Rush continue very strongly. So many people left what they were doing. And what would happen is \u2014 and the Gold Rush went on for years.People on the East Coast in 1849, when they first started to get the news, they thought, \"Ah, this isn't real.\" But they keep hearing about people getting rich, and then in 1850 they still hear that. And they think it's not real. By about 1852, they're thinking, \"Am I the stupidest person on Earth by not rushing to California?\" And they start to decide they are. These are community affairs, by the way. Local communities on the East Coast would get together and whole teams of 10, 20 people would caravan across the United States, and they would form companies. These were typically not solitary efforts. But no matter what, if you were a lawyer or a banker, people dropped what they were doing, no matter what skill set they had, to go pan for gold.This guy on the left, Dr. Richard Beverley Cole, he lived in Philadelphia and he took the Panama route. They would take a ship down to Panama, across the isthmus, and then take another ship north. This guy, Dr. Toland, went by covered wagon to California. This has its parallels, too. Doctors leaving their practices. These are both very successful \u2014 a physician in one case, a surgeon in the other. Same thing happened on the Internet. You get DrKoop.com.(Laughter)In the Gold Rush, people literally jumped ship. The San Francisco harbor was clogged with 600 ships at the peak because the ships would get there and the crews would abandon to go search for gold. So there were literally 600 captains and 600 ships. They turned the ships into hotels, because they couldn't sail them anywhere. You had dotcom fever. And you had gold fever. And you saw some of the excesses that the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened. The fort in San Francisco at the time had about 1,300 soldiers. Half of them deserted to go look for gold. And they wouldn't let the other half out to go look for the first half because they were afraid they wouldn't come back.(Laughter)And one of the soldiers wrote home, and this is the sentence that he put: \"The struggle between right and six dollars a month and wrong and 75 dollars a day is a rather severe one.\" They had bad burn rate in the Gold Rush. A very bad burn rate. This is actually from the Klondike Gold Rush. This is the White Pass Trail. They loaded up their mules and their horses. And they didn't plan right. And they didn't know how far they would really have to go, and they overloaded the horses with hundreds and hundreds of pounds of stuff. In fact it was so bad that most of the horses died before they could get where they were going. It got renamed the \"Dead Horse Trail.\"And the Canadian Minister of the Interior wrote this at the time: \"Thousands of pack horses lie dead along the way, sometimes in bunches under the cliffs, with pack saddles and packs where they've fallen from the rock above, sometimes in tangled masses, filling the mud holes and furnishing the only footing for our poor pack animals on the march, often, I regret to say, exhausted, but still alive, a fact we were unaware of, until after the miserable wretches turned beneath the hooves of our cavalcade. The eyeless sockets of the pack animals everywhere account for the myriads of ravens along the road. The inhumanity which this trail has been witness to, the heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergone, cannot be imagined. They certainly cannot be described.\"And you know, without the smell that would have accompanied that, we had the same thing on the Internet: very bad burn rate calculations. I'll just play one of these and you'll remember it. This is a commercial that was played on the Super Bowl in the year 2000.(Video): Bride #1: You said you had a large selection of invitations. Clerk: But we do. Bride #2: Then why does she have my invitation? Announcer: What may be a little thing to some ... Bride #3: You are mine, little man. Announcer: Could be a really big deal to you. Husband #1: Is that your wife? Husband #2: Not for another 15 minutes. Announcer: After all, it's your special day. OurBeginning.com. Life's an event. Announce it to the world.Jeff Bezos: It's very difficult to figure out what that ad is for.(Laughter)But they spent three and a half million dollars in the 2000 Super Bowl to air that ad, even though, at the time, they only had a million dollars in annual revenue. Now, here's where our analogy with the Gold Rush starts to diverge, and I think rather severely. And that is, in a gold rush, when it's over, it's over. Here's this guy: \"There are many men in Dawson at the present time who feel keenly disappointed. They've come thousands of miles on a perilous trip, risked life, health and property, spent months of the most arduous labor a man can perform and at length with expectations raised to the highest pitch have reached the coveted goal only to discover the fact that there is nothing here for them.\"And that was, of course, the very common story. Because when you take out that last piece of gold \u2014 and they did incredibly quickly. I mean, if you look at the 1849 Gold Rush \u2014 the entire American river region, within two years \u2014 every stone had been turned. And after that, only big companies who used more sophisticated mining technologies started to take gold out of there. So there's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic and that analogy is the electric industry. And there are a lot of similarities between the Internet and the electric industry. With the electric industry you actually have to \u2014 one of them is that they're both sort of thin, horizontal, enabling layers that go across lots of different industries. It's not a specific thing.But electricity is also very, very broad, so you have to sort of narrow it down. You know, it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power. It's an incredible means of coordinating, in a very fine-grained way, information flows. There's a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity. And the part of the electric revolution that I want to focus on is sort of the golden age of appliances. The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb. So the light bulb is what wired the world. And they weren't thinking about appliances when they wired the world. They were really thinking about \u2014 they weren't putting electricity into the home; they were putting lighting into the home. And, but it really \u2014 it got the electricity. It took a long time.This was a huge \u2014 as you would expect \u2014 a huge capital build out. All the streets had to be torn up. This is work going on down in lower Manhattan where they built some of the first electric power generating stations. And they're tearing up all the streets. The Edison Electric Company, which became Edison General Electric, which became General Electric, paid for all of this digging up of the streets. It was incredibly expensive. But that is not the \u2014 and that's not the part that's really most similar to the Web. Because, remember, the Web got to stand on top of all this heavy infrastructure that had been put in place because of the long-distance phone network. So all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure \u2014 I'm going back now to, sort of, the explosive part of the Web in 1994, when it was growing 2,300 percent a year. How could it grow at 2,300 percent a year in 1994 when people weren't really investing in the Web? Well, it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down.So the light bulb laid down the heavy infrastructure, and then home appliances started coming into being. And this was huge. The first one was the electric fan \u2014 this was the 1890 electric fan. And the appliances, the golden age of appliances really lasted \u2014 it depends how you want to measure it \u2014 but it's anywhere from 40 to 60 years. It goes on a long time. It starts about 1890. And the electric fan was a big success. The electric iron, also very big. By the way, this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit.(Laughter)There's asbestos under that handle there. This is the first vacuum cleaner, the 1905 Skinner Vacuum, from the Hoover Company. And this one weighed 92 pounds and took two people to operate and cost a quarter of a car. So it wasn't a big seller. This was truly, truly an early-adopter product \u2014 (Laughter) the 1905 Skinner Vacuum. But three years later, by 1908, it weighed 40 pounds. Now, not all these things were highly successful.(Laughter)This is the electric tie press, which never really did catch on. People, I guess, decided that they would not wrinkle their ties. These never really caught on either: the electric shoe warmer and drier. Never a big seller. This came in, like, six different colors.(Laughter)I don't know why. But I thought, you know, sometimes it's just not the right time for an invention; maybe it's time to give this one another shot. So I thought we could build a Super Bowl ad for this. We'd need the right partner. And I thought that really \u2014 (Laughter) I thought that would really work, to give that another shot. Now, the toaster was huge because they used to make toast on open fires, and it took a lot of time and attention. I want to point out one thing. This is \u2014 you guys know what this is. They hadn't invented the electric socket yet. So this was \u2014 remember, they didn't wire the houses for electricity. They wired them for lighting. So your \u2014 your appliances would plug in. They would \u2014 each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top. And you'd plug it in there.In fact, if you've seen the Carousel of Progress at Disney World, you've seen this. Here are the cables coming up into this light fixture. All the appliances plug in there. And you would just unscrew your light bulb if you wanted to plug in an appliance. The next thing that really was a big, big deal was the washing machine. Now, this was an object of much envy and lust. Everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines. On the left-hand side, this was the soapy water. And there's a rotor there \u2014 that this motor is spinning. And it would clean your clothes. This is the clean rinse-water. So you'd take the clothes out of here, put them in here, and then you'd run the clothes through this electric wringer. And this was a big deal. You'd keep this on your porch. It was a little bit messy and kind of a pain. And you'd run a long cord into the house where you could screw it into your light socket.(Laughter)And that's actually kind of an important point in my presentation, because they hadn't invented the off switch. That was to come much later \u2014 the off switch on appliances \u2014 because it didn't make any sense. I mean, you didn't want this thing clogging up a light socket. So you know, when you were done with it, you unscrewed it. That's what you did. You didn't turn it off. And as I said before, they hadn't invented the electric outlet either, so the washing machine was a particularly dangerous device. And there are \u2014 when you research this, there are gruesome descriptions of people getting their hair and clothes caught in these devices. And they couldn't yank the cord out because it was screwed into a light socket inside the house.(Laughter) And there was no off switch, so it wasn't very good. And you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestors to be plugging things into a light socket like this. But, you know, before I get too far into condemning our ancestors, I thought I'd show you: this is my conference room. This is a total kludge, if you ask me. First of all, this got installed upside down. This light socket \u2014 (Laughter) and so the cord keeps falling out, so I taped it in.(Laughter)This is supposed \u2014 don't even get me started. But that's not the worst one. This is what it looks like under my desk. I took this picture just two days ago. So we really haven't progressed that much since 1908.(Laughter)It's a total, total mess. And, you know, we think it's getting better, but have you tried to install 802.11 yourself?(Laughter)I challenge you to try. It's very hard. I know Ph.D.s in Computer Science \u2014 this process has brought them to tears, absolute tears. (Laughter) And that's assuming you already have DSL in your house. Try to get DSL installed in your house. The engineers who do it everyday can't do it. They have to \u2014 typically, they come three times. And one friend of mine was telling me a story: not only did they get there and have to wait, but then the engineers, when they finally did get there, for the third time, they had to call somebody. And they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone because then they had to wait on hold for an hour to talk to somebody to give them an access code after they got there. So we're not \u2014 we're pretty kludge-y ourselves.By the way, DSL is a kludge. I mean, this is a twisted pair of copper that was never designed for the purpose it's being put to \u2014 you know it's the whole thing \u2014 we're very, very primitive. And that's kind of the point. Because, you know, resilience \u2014 if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush, then you'd be pretty depressed right now because the last nugget of gold would be gone. But the good thing is, with innovation, there isn't a last nugget. Every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities.And if you believe that, then you believe that where we are \u2014 this is what I think \u2014 I believe that where we are with the incredible kludge \u2014 and I haven't even talked about user interfaces on the Web \u2014 but there's so much kludge, so much terrible stuff \u2014 we are at the 1908 Hurley washing machine stage with the Internet. That's where we are. We don't get our hair caught in it, but that's the level of primitiveness of where we are. We're in 1908.And if you believe that, then stuff like this doesn't bother you. This is 1996: \"All the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble.\" 1998: \"Amazon.toast.\" In 1999: \"Amazon.bomb.\" My mom hates this picture.(Laughter)She \u2014 but you know, if you really do believe that it's the very, very beginning, if you believe it's the 1908 Hurley washing machine, then you're incredibly optimistic. And I do think that that's where we are. And I do think there's more innovation ahead of us than there is behind us. And in 1917, Sears \u2014 I want to get this exactly right. This was the advertisement that they ran in 1917. It says: \"Use your electricity for more than light.\" And I think that's where we are. We're very, very early. Thank you very much.", "id": 105, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nWhen you think about resilience and technology it's actually much easier.\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nYou're going to see some other speakers today, I already know,\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nwho are going to talk about breaking-bones stuff,\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nand, of course, with technology it never is.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nSo it's very easy, comparatively speaking, to be resilient.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nI think that, if we look at what happened on the Internet,\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nwith such an incredible last half a dozen years,\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nthat it's hard to even get the right analogy for it.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nA lot of how we decide, how we're supposed to react to things\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nand what we're supposed to expect about the future\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\ndepends on how we bucket things\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nand how we categorize them.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nAnd so I think the tempting analogy for the boom-bust\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nthat we just went through with the Internet is a gold rush.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nIt's easy to think of this analogy as very different\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nfrom some of the other things you might pick.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nFor one thing, both were very real.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nIn 1849, in that Gold Rush, they took over $700 million\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nworth of gold out of California. It was very real.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nThe Internet was also very real. This is a real way for humans to\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\ncommunicate with each other. It's a big deal.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nHuge boom. Huge boom. Huge bust. Huge bust.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nYou keep going, and both things are lots of hype.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nI don't have to remind you of all the hype\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nthat was involved with the Internet -- like GetRich.com.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nBut you had the same thing with the Gold Rush. \"Gold. Gold. Gold.\"\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nSixty-eight rich men on the Steamer Portland. Stacks of yellow metal.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nSome have 5,000. Many have more.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nA few bring out 100,000 dollars each.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nPeople would get very excited about this when they read these articles.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.958\n\"The Eldorado of the United States of America:\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nthe discovery of inexhaustible gold mines in California.\"\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nAnd the parallels between the Gold Rush and the Internet Rush continue very strongly.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nSo many people left what they were doing.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nAnd what would happen is -- and the Gold Rush went on for years.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nPeople on the East Coast in 1849, when they first started to get the news,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nthey thought, \"Ah, this isn't real.\"\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nBut they keep hearing about people getting rich,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nand then in 1850 they still hear that. And they think it's not real.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nBy about 1852, they're thinking, \"Am I the stupidest person on Earth\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nby not rushing to California?\" And they start to decide they are.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nThese are community affairs, by the way.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nLocal communities on the East Coast would get together and whole teams\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nof 10, 20 people would caravan across the United States,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nand they would form companies.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nThese were typically not solitary efforts. But no matter what,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nif you were a lawyer or a banker, people dropped what they were doing,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nno matter what skill set they had, to go pan for gold.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nThis guy on the left, Dr. Richard Beverley Cole,\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nhe lived in Philadelphia and he took the Panama route.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nThey would take a ship down to Panama, across the isthmus,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nand then take another ship north.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nThis guy, Dr. Toland, went by covered wagon to California.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nThis has its parallels, too. Doctors leaving their practices.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nThese are both very successful -- a physician in one case,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:06.958\na surgeon in the other.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nSame thing happened on the Internet. You get DrKoop.com.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:11.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nIn the Gold Rush, people literally jumped ship.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nThe San Francisco harbor was clogged with 600 ships at the peak\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nbecause the ships would get there and the crews would abandon\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nto go search for gold.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nSo there were literally 600 captains and 600 ships.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nThey turned the ships into hotels, because they couldn't sail them anywhere.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nYou had dotcom fever. And you had gold fever.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nAnd you saw some of the excesses\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nthat the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nThe fort in San Francisco at the time had about 1,300 soldiers.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nHalf of them deserted to go look for gold.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nAnd they wouldn't let the other half out to go look for the first half\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nbecause they were afraid they wouldn't come back.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nAnd one of the soldiers wrote home, and this is the sentence that he put:\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:05.958\n\"The struggle between right and six dollars a month\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nand wrong and 75 dollars a day is a rather severe one.\"\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nThey had bad burn rate in the Gold Rush. A very bad burn rate.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nThis is actually from the Klondike Gold Rush. This is the White Pass Trail.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nThey loaded up their mules and their horses.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAnd they didn't plan right.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nAnd they didn't know how far they would really have to go,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nand they overloaded the horses with hundreds and hundreds of pounds of stuff.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nIn fact it was so bad that most of the horses died\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nbefore they could get where they were going.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nIt got renamed the \"Dead Horse Trail.\"\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nAnd the Canadian Minister of the Interior wrote this at the time:\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\n\"Thousands of pack horses lie dead along the way,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nsometimes in bunches under the cliffs,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nwith pack saddles and packs where they've fallen from the rock above,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nsometimes in tangled masses, filling the mud holes\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nand furnishing the only footing for our poor pack animals on the march,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.958\noften, I regret to say, exhausted, but still alive,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\na fact we were unaware of, until after the miserable wretches\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nturned beneath the hooves of our cavalcade.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nThe eyeless sockets of the pack animals everywhere\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\naccount for the myriads of ravens along the road.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nThe inhumanity which this trail has been witness to,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nthe heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergone,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:27.958\ncannot be imagined. They certainly cannot be described.\"\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nAnd you know, without the smell that would have accompanied that,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nwe had the same thing on the Internet: very bad burn rate calculations.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nI'll just play one of these and you'll remember it.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nThis is a commercial that was played on the Super Bowl in the year 2000.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:49.958\n(Video): Bride #1: You said you had a large selection of invitations. Clerk: But we do.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nBride #2: Then why does she have my invitation?\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nAnnouncer: What may be a little thing to some ... Bride #3: You are mine, little man.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nAnnouncer: Could be a really big deal to you. Husband #1: Is that your wife?\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nHusband #2: Not for another 15 minutes. Announcer: After all, it's your special day.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nOurBeginning.com. Life's an event. Announce it to the world.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nJeff Bezos: It's very difficult to figure out what that ad is for.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nBut they spent three and a half million dollars\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nin the 2000 Super Bowl to air that ad,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\neven though, at the time, they only had a million dollars in annual revenue.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nNow, here's where our analogy with the Gold Rush starts to diverge,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nand I think rather severely.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nAnd that is, in a gold rush, when it's over, it's over.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nHere's this guy: \"There are many men in Dawson\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nat the present time who feel keenly disappointed.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nThey've come thousands of miles on a perilous trip, risked life, health and property,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nspent months of the most arduous labor a man can perform\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nand at length with expectations raised to the highest pitch\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nhave reached the coveted goal only to discover\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nthe fact that there is nothing here for them.\"\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nAnd that was, of course, the very common story.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nBecause when you take out that last piece of gold --\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nand they did incredibly quickly. I mean, if you look at the 1849 Gold Rush --\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nthe entire American river region, within two years --\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nevery stone had been turned. And after that, only big companies\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nwho used more sophisticated mining technologies\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nstarted to take gold out of there.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nSo there's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nand that analogy is the electric industry.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nAnd there are a lot of similarities between the Internet and the electric industry.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nWith the electric industry you actually have to --\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\none of them is that they're both sort of thin,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nhorizontal, enabling layers that go across lots of different industries.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nIt's not a specific thing.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nBut electricity is also very, very broad, so you have to sort of narrow it down.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nYou know, it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nIt's an incredible means of coordinating,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nin a very fine-grained way, information flows.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nThere's a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nAnd the part of the electric revolution that I want to focus on\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nis sort of the golden age of appliances.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nThe killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nSo the light bulb is what wired the world.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nAnd they weren't thinking about appliances when they wired the world.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nThey were really thinking about --\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nthey weren't putting electricity into the home;\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nthey were putting lighting into the home.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nAnd, but it really -- it got the electricity. It took a long time.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nThis was a huge -- as you would expect -- a huge capital build out.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nAll the streets had to be torn up.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nThis is work going on down in lower Manhattan\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nwhere they built some of the first electric power generating stations.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nAnd they're tearing up all the streets.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nThe Edison Electric Company, which became Edison General Electric,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nwhich became General Electric,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:04.958\npaid for all of this digging up of the streets. It was incredibly expensive.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nBut that is not the -- and that's not the part that's really most similar to the Web.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nBecause, remember, the Web got to stand\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\non top of all this heavy infrastructure\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nthat had been put in place because of the long-distance phone network.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nSo all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure --\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nI'm going back now to, sort of, the explosive part of the Web in 1994,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nwhen it was growing 2,300 percent a year.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nHow could it grow at 2,300 percent a year in 1994\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nwhen people weren't really investing in the Web?\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nWell, it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nSo the light bulb laid down the heavy infrastructure,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nand then home appliances started coming into being.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nAnd this was huge. The first one was the electric fan --\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nthis was the 1890 electric fan.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nAnd the appliances, the golden age of appliances really lasted --\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nit depends how you want to measure it --\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nbut it's anywhere from 40 to 60 years. It goes on a long time.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nIt starts about 1890. And the electric fan was a big success.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nThe electric iron, also very big.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nBy the way, this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nThere's asbestos under that handle there.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nThis is the first vacuum cleaner, the 1905 Skinner Vacuum,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nfrom the Hoover Company. And this one weighed 92 pounds\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nand took two people to operate and cost a quarter of a car.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nSo it wasn't a big seller.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nThis was truly, truly an early-adopter product --\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:38.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nthe 1905 Skinner Vacuum.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nBut three years later, by 1908, it weighed 40 pounds.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nNow, not all these things were highly successful.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nThis is the electric tie press, which never really did catch on.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nPeople, I guess, decided that they would not wrinkle their ties.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nThese never really caught on either:\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nthe electric shoe warmer and drier. Never a big seller.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nThis came in, like, six different colors.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:10.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nI don't know why. But I thought, you know,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nsometimes it's just not the right time for an invention;\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nmaybe it's time to give this one another shot.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nSo I thought we could build a Super Bowl ad for this.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nWe'd need the right partner. And I thought that really --\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nI thought that would really work, to give that another shot.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nNow, the toaster was huge\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nbecause they used to make toast on open fires,\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nand it took a lot of time and attention.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nI want to point out one thing. This is -- you guys know what this is.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nThey hadn't invented the electric socket yet.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nSo this was -- remember, they didn't wire the houses for electricity.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nThey wired them for lighting. So your -- your appliances would plug in.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nThey would -- each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nAnd you'd plug it in there.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nIn fact, if you've seen the Carousel of Progress at Disney World,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nyou've seen this. Here are the cables coming up into this light fixture.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nAll the appliances plug in there. And you would just unscrew your light bulb\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nif you wanted to plug in an appliance.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nThe next thing that really was a big, big deal was the washing machine.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nNow, this was an object of much envy and lust.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nEverybody wanted one of these electric washing machines.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nOn the left-hand side, this was the soapy water.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nAnd there's a rotor there -- that this motor is spinning.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nAnd it would clean your clothes.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nThis is the clean rinse-water. So you'd take the clothes out of here,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nput them in here, and then you'd run the clothes through this electric wringer.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nAnd this was a big deal.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nYou'd keep this on your porch. It was a little bit messy and kind of a pain.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nAnd you'd run a long cord into the house\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nwhere you could screw it into your light socket.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nAnd that's actually kind of an important point in my presentation,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nbecause they hadn't invented the off switch.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nThat was to come much later -- the off switch on appliances --\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nbecause it didn't make any sense.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nI mean, you didn't want this thing clogging up a light socket.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nSo you know, when you were done with it, you unscrewed it.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nThat's what you did. You didn't turn it off.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nAnd as I said before, they hadn't invented the electric outlet either,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nso the washing machine was a particularly dangerous device.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nAnd there are --\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nwhen you research this, there are gruesome descriptions\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nof people getting their hair and clothes caught in these devices.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nAnd they couldn't yank the cord out\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nbecause it was screwed into a light socket inside the house.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nAnd there was no off switch, so it wasn't very good.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nAnd you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestors\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nto be plugging things into a light socket like this.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nBut, you know, before I get too far into condemning our ancestors,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nI thought I'd show you: this is my conference room.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nThis is a total kludge, if you ask me.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nFirst of all, this got installed upside down. This light socket --\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:03.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nand so the cord keeps falling out, so I taped it in.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nThis is supposed -- don't even get me started. But that's not the worst one.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nThis is what it looks like under my desk.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nI took this picture just two days ago.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nSo we really haven't progressed that much since 1908.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nIt's a total, total mess.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nAnd, you know, we think it's getting better,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nbut have you tried to install 802.11 yourself?\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:31.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nI challenge you to try. It's very hard.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nI know Ph.D.s in Computer Science --\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nthis process has brought them to tears, absolute tears. (Laughter)\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nAnd that's assuming you already have DSL in your house.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nTry to get DSL installed in your house.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nThe engineers who do it everyday can't do it.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nThey have to -- typically, they come three times.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nAnd one friend of mine was telling me a story:\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nnot only did they get there and have to wait,\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nbut then the engineers, when they finally did get there,\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nfor the third time, they had to call somebody.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nAnd they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nbecause then they had to wait on hold for an hour\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nto talk to somebody to give them an access code\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nafter they got there.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nSo we're not -- we're pretty kludge-y ourselves.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nBy the way, DSL is a kludge.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nI mean, this is a twisted pair of copper that was never designed\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nfor the purpose it's being put to --\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nyou know it's the whole thing --\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nwe're very, very primitive. And that's kind of the point.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nBecause, you know, resilience -- if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush,\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nthen you'd be pretty depressed right now\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nbecause the last nugget of gold would be gone.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nBut the good thing is, with innovation, there isn't a last nugget.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nEvery new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nAnd if you believe that, then you believe that where we are --\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nthis is what I think -- I believe that where we are with the incredible kludge --\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nand I haven't even talked about user interfaces on the Web --\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nbut there's so much kludge, so much terrible stuff --\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nwe are at the 1908 Hurley washing machine stage with the Internet.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nThat's where we are. We don't get our hair caught in it,\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nbut that's the level of primitiveness of where we are.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nWe're in 1908.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nAnd if you believe that, then stuff like this doesn't bother you. This is 1996:\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:21.958\n\"All the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble.\"\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:27.958\n1998: \"Amazon.toast.\" In 1999: \"Amazon.bomb.\"\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nMy mom hates this picture.\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nShe -- but you know, if you really do believe that it's the very,\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nvery beginning, if you believe it's the 1908 Hurley washing machine,\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nthen you're incredibly optimistic. And I do think that that's where we are.\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nAnd I do think there's more innovation ahead of us\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nthan there is behind us.\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nAnd in 1917, Sears -- I want to get this exactly right.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nThis was the advertisement that they ran in 1917.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nIt says: \"Use your electricity for more than light.\"\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nAnd I think that's where we are.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nWe're very, very early.

Mockingbirds \u2014 that's Mimus polyglottos \u2014 are the emcees of the animal kingdom.They listen and mimic and remix what they like. They rock the mic outside my window every morning. I can hear them sing the sounds of the car alarms like they were songs of spring. I mean, if you can talk it, a mockingbird can squawk it. So check it, I'm gonna to catch mockingbirds. I'm going to trap mockingbirds all across the nation and put them gently into mason jars like mockingbird Molotov cocktails.(Laughter)Yeah. And as I drive through a neighborhood, say, where people got-a-lotta, I'll take a mockingbird I caught in a neighborhood where folks ain't got nada and just let it go, you know. Up goes the bird, out come the words, \"Juanito, Juanito, vente a comer mi hijo!\" Oh, I'm going to be the Johnny Appleseed of sound.(Laughter)Cruising random city streets, rocking a drop-top Cadillac with a big backseat, packing like 13 brown paper Walmart bags full of loaded mockingbirds, and I'll get everybody.(Laughter)I'll get the nitwit on the network news saying, \"We'll be back in a moment with more on the crisis.\" I'll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice is. I'll get that lady at the laundromat who always seems to know what being nice is. I'll get your postman making dinner plans. I'll get the last time you lied. I'll get, \"Baby, just give me the frickin' TV guide.\" I'll get a lonely, little sentence with real error in it, \"Yeah, I guess I could come inside, but only for a minute.\"(Laughter)I'll get an ESL class in Chinatown learning \"It's Raining, It's Pouring.\" I'll put a mockingbird on a late-night train just to get an old man snoring. I'll get your ex-lover telling someone else, \"Good morning.\" I'll get everyone's good mornings. I don't care how you make 'em. Aloha. Konichiwa. Shalom. Ah-Salam Alaikum. Everybody means everybody, means everybody here. And so maybe I'll build a gilded cage. I'll line the bottom with old notebook pages. Inside it, I will place a mockingbird for \u2014 short explanation, hippie parents.(Laughter)What does a violin have to do with technology? Where in the world is this world heading? On one end, gold bars \u2014 on the other, an entire planet. We are 12 billion light years from the edge. That's a guess. Space is length and breadth continued indefinitely, but you cannot buy a ticket to travel commercially to space in America because countries are beginning to eat like us, live like us and die like us. You might wanna avert your gaze, because that is a newt about to regenerate its limb, and shaking hands spreads more germs than kissing. There's about 10 million phage per job. It's a very strange world inside a nanotube. Women can talk; black men ski; white men build strong buildings; we build strong suns. The surface of the Earth is absolutely riddled with holes, and here we are, right in the middle.(Laughter)It is the voice of life that calls us to come and learn. When all the little mockingbirds fly away, they're going to sound like the last four days. I will get uptown gurus, downtown teachers, broke-ass artists and dealers, and Filipino preachers, leaf blowers, bartenders, boob-job doctors, hooligans, garbage men, your local Congressmen in the spotlight, guys in the overhead helicopters. Everybody gets heard. Everybody gets this one, honest mockingbird as a witness. And I'm on this. I'm on this 'til the whole thing spreads, with chat rooms and copycats and moms maybe tucking kids into bed singing, \"Hush, little baby, don't say a word. Wait for the man with the mockingbird.\"(Laughter)Yeah. And then come the news crews, and the man-in-the-street interviews, and the letters to the editor. Everybody asking, just who is responsible for this citywide, nationwide mockingbird cacophony, and somebody finally is going to tip the City Council of Monterey, California off to me, and they'll offer me a key to the city.

I've been a priest in the Church for 20 years. For most of that time, I've been struggling and grappling with questions about the nature of God. Who is God? And I'm very aware that when you say the word \"God,\" many people will turn off immediately. And most people, both within and outside the organized church, still have a picture of a celestial controller, a rule maker, a policeman in the sky who orders everything, and causes everything to happen. He will protect his own people, and answer the prayers of the faithful.And in the worship of my church, the most frequently used adjective about God is \"almighty.\" But I have a problem with that. I have become more and more uncomfortable with this perception of God over the years. Do we really believe that God is the kind of male boss that we've been presenting in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years?Of course, there have been thinkers who have suggested different ways of looking at God. Exploring the feminine, nurturing side of divinity. Suggesting that God expresses Himself or Herself through powerlessness, rather than power. Acknowledging that God is unknown and unknowable by definition. Finding deep resonances with other religions and philosophies and ways of looking at life as part of what is a universal and global search for meaning. These ideas are well known in liberal academic circles, but clergy like myself have been reluctant to air them, for fear of creating tension and division in our church communities, for fear of upsetting the simple faith of more traditional believers. I have chosen not to rock the boat.Then, on December 26th last year, just two months ago, that underwater earthquake triggered the tsunami. And two weeks later, Sunday morning, 9th of January, I found myself standing in front of my congregation \u2014 intelligent, well meaning, mostly thoughtful Christian people \u2014 and I needed to express, on their behalf, our feelings and our questions. I had my own personal responses, but I also have a public role, and something needed to be said. And this is what I said.Shortly after the tsunami I read a newspaper article written by the Archbishop of Canterbury \u2014 fine title \u2014 about the tragedy in Southern Asia. The essence of what he said was this: the people most affected by the devastation and loss of life do not want intellectual theories about how God let this happen. He wrote, \"If some religious genius did come up with an explanation of exactly why all these deaths made sense, would we feel happier, or safer, or more confident in God?\"If the man in the photograph that appeared in the newspapers, holding the hand of his dead child was standing in front of us now, there are no words that we could say to him. A verbal response would not be appropriate. The only appropriate response would be a compassionate silence and some kind of practical help. It isn't a time for explanation, or preaching, or theology; it's a time for tears.This is true. And yet here we are, my church in Oxford, semi-detached from events that happened a long way away, but with our faith bruised. And we want an explanation from God. We demand an explanation from God. Some have concluded that we can only believe in a God who shares our pain. In some way, God must feel the anguish, and grief, and physical pain that we feel. In some way the eternal God must be able to enter into the souls of human beings and experience the torment within. And if this is true, it must also be that God knows the joy and exaltation of the human spirit, as well. We want a God who can weep with those who weep, and rejoice with those who rejoice.This seems to me both a deeply moving and a convincing re-statement of Christian belief about God. For hundreds of years, the prevailing orthodoxy, the accepted truth, was that God the Father, the Creator, is unchanging and therefore by definition cannot feel pain or sadness. Now the unchanging God feels a bit cold and indifferent to me. And the devastating events of the 20th century have forced people to question the cold, unfeeling God. The slaughter of millions in the trenches and in the death camps have caused people to ask, \"Where is God in all this? Who is God in all this?\"And the answer was, \"God is in this with us, or God doesn't deserve our allegiance anymore.\" If God is a bystander, observing but not involved, then God may well exist, but we don't want to know about Him. Many Jews and Christians now feel like this, I know. And I am among them.So we have a suffering God \u2014 a God who is intimately connected with this world and with every living soul. I very much relate to this idea of God. But it isn't enough. I need to ask some more questions, and I hope they are questions that you will want to ask, as well, some of you.Over the last few weeks I have been struck by the number of times that words in our worship have felt a bit inappropriate, a bit dodgy. We have a pram service on Tuesday mornings for mums and their pre-school children. And last week we sang with the children one of their favorite songs, \"The Wise Man Built His House Upon the Rock.\" Perhaps some of you know it. Some of the words go like this: \"The foolish man built his house upon the sand / And the floods came up / And the house on the sand went crash.\" Then in the same week, at a funeral, we sang the familiar hymn \"We Plow the Fields and Scatter,\" a very English hymn. In the second verse comes the line, \"The wind and waves obey Him.\" Do they? I don't feel we can sing that song again in church, after what's happened.So the first big question is about control. Does God have a plan for each of us? Is God in control? Does God order each moment? Does the wind and the waves obey Him? From time to time, one hears Christians telling the story of how God organized things for them, so that everything worked out all right \u2014 some difficulty overcome, some illness cured, some trouble averted, a parking space found at a crucial time. I can remember someone saying this to me, with her eyes shining with enthusiasm at this wonderful confirmation of her faith and the goodness of God.But if God can or will do these things \u2014 intervene to change the flow of events \u2014 then surely he could have stopped the tsunami. Do we have a local God who can do little things like parking spaces, but not big things like 500 mile-per-hour waves? That's just not acceptable to intelligent Christians, and we must acknowledge it. Either God is responsible for the tsunami, or God is not in control.After the tragedy, survival stories began to emerge. You probably heard some of them: the man who surfed the wave, the teenage girl who recognized the danger because she had just been learning about tsunamis at school. Then there was the congregation who had left their usual church building on the shore to hold a service in the hills. The preacher delivered an extra long sermon, so that they were still out of harm's way when the wave struck. Afterwards someone said that God must have been looking after them.So the next question is about partiality. Can we earn God's favor by worshipping Him or believing in Him? Does God demand loyalty, like any medieval tyrant? A God who looks after His own, so that Christians are OK, while everyone else perishes? A cosmic us and them, and a God who is guilty of the worst kind of favoritism? That would be appalling, and that would be the point at which I would hand in my membership. Such a God would be morally inferior to the highest ideals of humanity.So who is God, if not the great puppet-master or the tribal protector? Perhaps God allows or permits terrible things to happen, so that heroism and compassion can be shown. Perhaps God is testing us: testing our charity, or our faith. Perhaps there is a great, cosmic plan that allows for horrible suffering so that everything will work out OK in the end. Perhaps, but these ideas are all just variations on God controlling everything, the supreme commander toying with expendable units in a great campaign. We are still left with a God who can do the tsunami and allow Auschwitz.In his great novel, \"The Brothers Karamazov,\" Dostoevsky gives these words to Ivan, addressed to his naive and devout younger brother, Alyosha: \"If the sufferings of children go to make up the sum of sufferings which is necessary for the purchase of truth, then I say beforehand that the entire truth is not worth such a price. We cannot afford to pay so much for admission. It is not God that I do not accept. I merely, most respectfully, return Him the ticket.\"Or perhaps God set the whole universe going at the beginning and then relinquished control forever, so that natural processes could occur, and evolution run its course. This seems more acceptable, but it still leaves God with the ultimate moral responsibility. Is God a cold, unfeeling spectator? Or a powerless lover, watching with infinite compassion things God is unable to control or change? Is God intimately involved in our suffering, so that He feels it in His own being?If we believe something like this, we must let go of the puppet-master completely, take our leave of the almighty controller, abandon traditional models. We must think again about God. Maybe God doesn't do things at all. Maybe God isn't an agent like all of us are agents. Early religious thought conceived God as a sort of superhuman person, doing things all over the place. Beating up the Egyptians, drowning them in the Red Sea, wasting cities, getting angry. The people knew their God by His mighty acts.But what if God doesn't act? What if God doesn't do things at all? What if God is in things? The loving soul of the universe. An in-dwelling compassionate presence, underpinning and sustaining all things. What if God is in things? In the infinitely complex network of relationships and connections that make up life. In the natural cycle of life and death, the creation and destruction that must happen continuously. In the process of evolution. In the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world. In the collective unconscious, the soul of the human race. In you, in me, mind and body and spirit. In the tsunami, in the victims. In the depth of things. In presence and in absence. In simplicity and complexity. In change and development and growth.How does this in-ness, this innerness, this interiority of God work? It's hard to conceive, and begs more questions. Is God just another name for the universe, with no independent existence at all? I don't know. To what extent can we ascribe personality to God? I don't know. In the end, we have to say, \"I don't know.\" If we knew, God would not be God.To have faith in this God would be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe, and less like believing a system of doctrinal statements. Isn't it ironic that Christians who claim to believe in an infinite, unknowable being then tie God down in closed systems and rigid doctrines?How could one practice such a faith? By seeking the God within. By cultivating my own inwardness. In silence, in meditation, in my inner space, in the me that remains when I gently put aside my passing emotions and ideas and preoccupations. In awareness of the inner conversation.And how would we live such a faith? How would I live such a faith? By seeking intimate connection with your inwardness. The kind of relationships when deep speaks to deep. If God is in all people, then there is a meeting place where my relationship with you becomes a three-way encounter. There is an Indian greeting, which I'm sure some of you know: \"Namaste,\" accompanied by a respectful bow, which, roughly translated means, \"That which is of God in me greets that which of God is in you.\" Namaste.And how would one deepen such a faith? By seeking the inwardness which is in all things. In music and poetry, in the natural world of beauty and in the small ordinary things of life, there is a deep, indwelling presence that makes them extraordinary. It needs a profound attentiveness and a patient waiting, a contemplative attitude and a generosity and openness to those whose experience is different from my own.When I stood up to speak to my people about God and the tsunami, I had no answers to offer them. No neat packages of faith, with Bible references to prove them. Only doubts and questioning and uncertainty. I had some suggestions to make \u2014 possible new ways of thinking about God. Ways that might allow us to go on, down a new and uncharted road. But in the end, the only thing I could say for sure was, \"I don't know,\" and that just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all.Thank you.", "id": 112, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nI am a vicar in the Church of England.\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nI've been a priest in the Church for 20 years.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nFor most of that time, I've been struggling and grappling\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nwith questions about the nature of God. Who is God?\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nAnd I'm very aware that when you say the word \"God,\"\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nmany people will turn off immediately.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nAnd most people, both within and outside the organized church,\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nstill have a picture of a celestial controller,\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:54.958\na rule maker, a policeman in the sky who orders everything,\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nand causes everything to happen.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nHe will protect his own people,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nand answer the prayers of the faithful.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nAnd in the worship of my church,\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nthe most frequently used adjective about God is \"almighty.\"\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nBut I have a problem with that.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nI have become more and more uncomfortable\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nwith this perception of God over the years.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nDo we really believe that God is the kind of male boss that we've been presenting\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nin our worship and in our liturgies over all these years?\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nOf course, there have been thinkers\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nwho have suggested different ways of looking at God.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nExploring the feminine, nurturing side of divinity.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nSuggesting that God expresses Himself or Herself through powerlessness,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nrather than power.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nAcknowledging that God is unknown and unknowable by definition.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nFinding deep resonances with other religions and philosophies\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nand ways of looking at life as part of what is a universal and global search for meaning.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nThese ideas are well known in liberal academic circles,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nbut clergy like myself have been reluctant to air them,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nfor fear of creating tension and division in our church communities,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nfor fear of upsetting the simple faith of more traditional believers.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nI have chosen not to rock the boat.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nThen, on December 26th last year, just two months ago,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nthat underwater earthquake triggered the tsunami.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nAnd two weeks later, Sunday morning, 9th of January,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nI found myself standing in front of my congregation --\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nintelligent, well meaning, mostly thoughtful Christian people --\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nand I needed to express, on their behalf, our feelings and our questions.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nI had my own personal responses, but I also have a public role,\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nand something needed to be said.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nAnd this is what I said.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nShortly after the tsunami I read a newspaper article\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nwritten by the Archbishop of Canterbury -- fine title --\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nabout the tragedy in Southern Asia.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nThe essence of what he said was this:\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nthe people most affected by the devastation and loss of life\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:04:02.958\ndo not want intellectual theories about how God let this happen.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nHe wrote, \"If some religious genius did come up with an explanation\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nof exactly why all these deaths made sense,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nwould we feel happier, or safer, or more confident in God?\"\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nIf the man in the photograph that appeared in the newspapers,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nholding the hand of his dead child was standing in front of us now,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nthere are no words that we could say to him.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nA verbal response would not be appropriate.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nThe only appropriate response would be a compassionate silence\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nand some kind of practical help.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nIt isn't a time for explanation, or preaching, or theology;\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nit's a time for tears.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nThis is true. And yet here we are, my church in Oxford,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nsemi-detached from events that happened a long way away,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nbut with our faith bruised.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nAnd we want an explanation from God.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nWe demand an explanation from God.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nSome have concluded that we can only believe in a God who shares our pain.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nIn some way, God must feel the anguish, and grief,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nand physical pain that we feel.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nIn some way the eternal God must be able to enter into the souls of human beings\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nand experience the torment within.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nAnd if this is true, it must also be that God knows the joy and exaltation\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nof the human spirit, as well.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nWe want a God who can weep with those who weep,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nand rejoice with those who rejoice.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nThis seems to me both a deeply moving and a convincing re-statement\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nof Christian belief about God.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nFor hundreds of years, the prevailing orthodoxy, the accepted truth,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nwas that God the Father, the Creator, is unchanging\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nand therefore by definition cannot feel pain or sadness.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nNow the unchanging God feels a bit cold and indifferent to me.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nAnd the devastating events of the 20th century\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nhave forced people to question the cold, unfeeling God.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nThe slaughter of millions in the trenches and in the death camps\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nhave caused people to ask, \"Where is God in all this?\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nWho is God in all this?\"\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nAnd the answer was, \"God is in this with us,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nor God doesn't deserve our allegiance anymore.\"\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nIf God is a bystander, observing but not involved,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nthen God may well exist, but we don't want to know about Him.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nMany Jews and Christians now feel like this, I know.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nAnd I am among them.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nSo we have a suffering God --\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:29.958\na God who is intimately connected with this world and with every living soul.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nI very much relate to this idea of God.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nBut it isn't enough. I need to ask some more questions,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nand I hope they are questions that you will want to ask, as well,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nsome of you.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nOver the last few weeks I have been struck by the number of times\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nthat words in our worship have felt a bit inappropriate, a bit dodgy.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nWe have a pram service on Tuesday mornings for mums and their pre-school children.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nAnd last week we sang with the children one of their favorite songs,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\n\"The Wise Man Built His House Upon the Rock.\"\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nPerhaps some of you know it. Some of the words go like this:\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\n\"The foolish man built his house upon the sand /\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nAnd the floods came up / And the house on the sand went crash.\"\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nThen in the same week, at a funeral,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nwe sang the familiar hymn \"We Plow the Fields and Scatter,\"\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\na very English hymn.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nIn the second verse comes the line, \"The wind and waves obey Him.\"\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nDo they? I don't feel we can sing that song again in church,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nafter what's happened.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nSo the first big question is about control.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nDoes God have a plan for each of us? Is God in control?\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nDoes God order each moment? Does the wind and the waves obey Him?\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nFrom time to time,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:06.958\none hears Christians telling the story of how God organized things for them,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nso that everything worked out all right --\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nsome difficulty overcome, some illness cured, some trouble averted,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:17.958\na parking space found at a crucial time.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nI can remember someone saying this to me,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nwith her eyes shining with enthusiasm at this wonderful confirmation of her faith\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nand the goodness of God.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nBut if God can or will do these things --\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nintervene to change the flow of events --\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nthen surely he could have stopped the tsunami.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nDo we have a local God who can do little things like parking spaces,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nbut not big things like 500 mile-per-hour waves?\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nThat's just not acceptable to intelligent Christians,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nand we must acknowledge it.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nEither God is responsible for the tsunami,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nor God is not in control.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nAfter the tragedy, survival stories began to emerge.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nYou probably heard some of them:\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nthe man who surfed the wave,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nthe teenage girl who recognized the danger\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nbecause she had just been learning about tsunamis at school.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nThen there was the congregation who had left their usual church building on the shore\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nto hold a service in the hills.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nThe preacher delivered an extra long sermon,\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nso that they were still out of harm's way when the wave struck.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nAfterwards someone said that God must have been looking after them.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nSo the next question is about partiality.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nCan we earn God's favor by worshipping Him or believing in Him?\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nDoes God demand loyalty, like any medieval tyrant?\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nA God who looks after His own, so that Christians are OK,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nwhile everyone else perishes?\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nA cosmic us and them, and a God who is guilty of the worst kind of favoritism?\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nThat would be appalling,\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nand that would be the point at which I would hand in my membership.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nSuch a God would be morally inferior to the highest ideals of humanity.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nSo who is God, if not the great puppet-master or the tribal protector?\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nPerhaps God allows or permits terrible things to happen,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nso that heroism and compassion can be shown.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nPerhaps God is testing us: testing our charity, or our faith.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nPerhaps there is a great, cosmic plan that allows for horrible suffering\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nso that everything will work out OK in the end.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nPerhaps, but these ideas are all just variations on God controlling everything,\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nthe supreme commander toying with expendable units in a great campaign.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nWe are still left with a God who can do the tsunami and allow Auschwitz.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nIn his great novel, \"The Brothers Karamazov,\" Dostoevsky gives these words to Ivan,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:30.958\naddressed to his naive and devout younger brother, Alyosha:\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\n\"If the sufferings of children go to make up the sum of sufferings\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nwhich is necessary for the purchase of truth,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nthen I say beforehand that the entire truth is not worth such a price.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nWe cannot afford to pay so much for admission.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nIt is not God that I do not accept.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nI merely, most respectfully, return Him the ticket.\"\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nOr perhaps God set the whole universe going at the beginning\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nand then relinquished control forever,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nso that natural processes could occur, and evolution run its course.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nThis seems more acceptable,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nbut it still leaves God with the ultimate moral responsibility.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nIs God a cold, unfeeling spectator?\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nOr a powerless lover, watching with infinite compassion\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nthings God is unable to control or change?\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nIs God intimately involved in our suffering,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nso that He feels it in His own being?\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nIf we believe something like this, we must let go of the puppet-master completely,\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:55.958\ntake our leave of the almighty controller, abandon traditional models.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nWe must think again about God.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nMaybe God doesn't do things at all.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nMaybe God isn't an agent like all of us are agents.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nEarly religious thought conceived God as a sort of superhuman person,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\ndoing things all over the place.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nBeating up the Egyptians, drowning them in the Red Sea, wasting cities, getting angry.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nThe people knew their God by His mighty acts.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nBut what if God doesn't act? What if God doesn't do things at all?\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nWhat if God is in things?\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nThe loving soul of the universe.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nAn in-dwelling compassionate presence, underpinning and sustaining all things.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nWhat if God is in things?\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nIn the infinitely complex network of relationships and connections that make up life.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nIn the natural cycle of life and death,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nthe creation and destruction that must happen continuously.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nIn the process of evolution.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nIn the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nIn the collective unconscious, the soul of the human race.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nIn you, in me, mind and body and spirit.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nIn the tsunami, in the victims. In the depth of things.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nIn presence and in absence. In simplicity and complexity.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nIn change and development and growth.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nHow does this in-ness, this innerness, this interiority of God work?\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nIt's hard to conceive, and begs more questions.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nIs God just another name for the universe,\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nwith no independent existence at all?\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nI don't know.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nTo what extent can we ascribe personality to God?\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nI don't know.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nIn the end, we have to say, \"I don't know.\"\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nIf we knew, God would not be God.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nTo have faith in this God\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nwould be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe,\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nand less like believing a system of doctrinal statements.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nIsn't it ironic that Christians who claim to believe\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nin an infinite, unknowable being\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nthen tie God down in closed systems and rigid doctrines?\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nHow could one practice such a faith?\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nBy seeking the God within. By cultivating my own inwardness.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nIn silence, in meditation, in my inner space, in the me that remains\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nwhen I gently put aside my passing emotions and ideas and preoccupations.\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nIn awareness of the inner conversation.\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nAnd how would we live such a faith? How would I live such a faith?\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nBy seeking intimate connection with your inwardness.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nThe kind of relationships when deep speaks to deep.\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nIf God is in all people, then there is a meeting place\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nwhere my relationship with you becomes a three-way encounter.\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nThere is an Indian greeting, which I'm sure some of you know:\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:47.958\n\"Namaste,\" accompanied by a respectful bow,\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nwhich, roughly translated means,\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:56.958\n\"That which is of God in me greets that which of God is in you.\"\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nNamaste.\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nAnd how would one deepen such a faith?\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nBy seeking the inwardness which is in all things.\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:12.958\nIn music and poetry, in the natural world of beauty\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:15.958\nand in the small ordinary things of life,\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nthere is a deep, indwelling presence that makes them extraordinary.\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nIt needs a profound attentiveness and a patient waiting,\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:32.958\na contemplative attitude and a generosity and openness\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nto those whose experience is different from my own.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nWhen I stood up to speak to my people about God and the tsunami,\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nI had no answers to offer them.\n\n00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:48.958\nNo neat packages of faith, with Bible references to prove them.\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nOnly doubts and questioning and uncertainty.\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nI had some suggestions to make --\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:00.958\npossible new ways of thinking about God.\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nWays that might allow us to go on, down a new and uncharted road.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nBut in the end, the only thing I could say for sure was, \"I don't know,\"\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:19.958\nand that just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all.\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nThank you."}, {"title": "Militant atheism", "duration": "1750", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/richard_dawkins_on_militant_atheism", "transcript": "That splendid music, the coming-in music, \"The Elephant March\" from \"Aida,\" is the music I've chosen for my funeral.(Laughter)And you can see why. It's triumphal. I won't feel anything, but if I could, I would feel triumphal at having lived at all, and at having lived on this splendid planet, and having been given the opportunity to understand something about why I was here in the first place, before not being here.Can you understand my quaint English accent?(Laughter)Like everybody else, I was entranced yesterday by the animal session. Robert Full and Frans Lanting and others; the beauty of the things that they showed. The only slight jarring note was when Jeffrey Katzenberg said of the mustang, \"the most splendid creatures that God put on this earth.\" Now of course, we know that he didn't really mean that, but in this country at the moment, you can't be too careful.(Laughter)I'm a biologist, and the central theorem of our subject: the theory of design, Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. In professional circles everywhere, it's of course universally accepted. In non-professional circles outside America, it's largely ignored. But in non-professional circles within America, it arouses so much hostility \u2014(Laughter)it's fair to say that American biologists are in a state of war. The war is so worrying at present, with court cases coming up in one state after another, that I felt I had to say something about it.If you want to know what I have to say about Darwinism itself, I'm afraid you're going to have to look at my books, which you won't find in the bookstore outside.(Laughter)Contemporary court cases often concern an allegedly new version of creationism, called \"Intelligent Design,\" or ID. Don't be fooled. There's nothing new about ID. It's just creationism under another name, rechristened \u2014 I choose the word advisedly \u2014(Laughter)for tactical, political reasons.The arguments of so-called ID theorists are the same old arguments that had been refuted again and again, since Darwin down to the present day. There is an effective evolution lobby coordinating the fight on behalf of science, and I try to do all I can to help them, but they get quite upset when people like me dare to mention that we happen to be atheists as well as evolutionists. They see us as rocking the boat, and you can understand why. Creationists, lacking any coherent scientific argument for their case, fall back on the popular phobia against atheism: Teach your children evolution in biology class, and they'll soon move on to drugs, grand larceny and sexual \"pre-version.\"(Laughter)In fact, of course, educated theologians from the Pope down are firm in their support of evolution. This book, \"Finding Darwin's God,\" by Kenneth Miller, is one of the most effective attacks on Intelligent Design that I know and it's all the more effective because it's written by a devout Christian. People like Kenneth Miller could be called a \"godsend\" to the evolution lobby,(Laughter)because they expose the lie that evolutionism is, as a matter of fact, tantamount to atheism. People like me, on the other hand, rock the boat.But here, I want to say something nice about creationists. It's not a thing I often do, so listen carefully.(Laughter)I think they're right about one thing. I think they're right that evolution is fundamentally hostile to religion.I've already said that many individual evolutionists, like the Pope, are also religious, but I think they're deluding themselves. I believe a true understanding of Darwinism is deeply corrosive to religious faith. Now, it may sound as though I'm about to preach atheism, and I want to reassure you that that's not what I'm going to do. In an audience as sophisticated as this one, that would be preaching to the choir.No, what I want to urge upon you \u2014(Laughter)Instead, what I want to urge upon you is militant atheism.(Laughter)(Applause)But that's putting it too negatively. If I was a person who were interested in preserving religious faith, I would be very afraid of the positive power of evolutionary science, and indeed science generally, but evolution in particular, to inspire and enthrall, precisely because it is atheistic.Now, the difficult problem for any theory of biological design is to explain the massive statistical improbability of living things. Statistical improbability in the direction of good design \u2014 \"complexity\" is another word for this. The standard creationist argument \u2014 there is only one; they're all reduced to this one \u2014 takes off from a statistical improbability. Living creatures are too complex to have come about by chance; therefore, they must have had a designer. This argument of course, shoots itself in the foot. Any designer capable of designing something really complex has to be even more complex himself, and that's before we even start on the other things he's expected to do, like forgive sins, bless marriages, listen to prayers \u2014 favor our side in a war \u2014(Laughter)disapprove of our sex lives, and so on.(Laughter)Complexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve, and you can't solve it by postulating an agent that is even more complex, thereby simply compounding the problem. Darwinian natural selection is so stunningly elegant because it solves the problem of explaining complexity in terms of nothing but simplicity. Essentially, it does it by providing a smooth ramp of gradual, step-by-step increment. But here, I only want to make the point that the elegance of Darwinism is corrosive to religion, precisely because it is so elegant, so parsimonious, so powerful, so economically powerful. It has the sinewy economy of a beautiful suspension bridge.The God theory is not just a bad theory. It turns out to be \u2014 in principle \u2014 incapable of doing the job required of it.So, returning to tactics and the evolution lobby, I want to argue that rocking the boat may be just the right thing to do. My approach to attacking creationism is \u2014 unlike the evolution lobby \u2014 my approach to attacking creationism is to attack religion as a whole. And at this point I need to acknowledge the remarkable taboo against speaking ill of religion, and I'm going to do so in the words of the late Douglas Adams, a dear friend who, if he never came to TED, certainly should have been invited.(Richard Saul Wurman: He was.)Richard Dawkins: He was. Good. I thought he must have been.He begins this speech, which was tape recorded in Cambridge shortly before he died \u2014 he begins by explaining how science works through the testing of hypotheses that are framed to be vulnerable to disproof, and then he goes on.I quote, \"Religion doesn't seem to work like that. It has certain ideas at the heart of it, which we call 'sacred' or 'holy.' What it means is: here is an idea or a notion that you're not allowed to say anything bad about. You're just not. Why not? Because you're not.\"(Laughter)\"Why should it be that it's perfectly legitimate to support the Republicans or Democrats, this model of economics versus that, Macintosh instead of Windows, but to have an opinion about how the universe began, about who created the universe \u2014 no, that's holy. So, we're used to not challenging religious ideas, and it's very interesting how much of a furor Richard creates when he does it.\" \u2014He meant me, not that one.\"Everybody gets absolutely frantic about it, because you're not allowed to say these things. Yet when you look at it rationally, there's no reason why those ideas shouldn't be as open to debate as any other, except that we've agreed somehow between us that they shouldn't be.\"And that's the end of the quote from Douglas.In my view, not only is science corrosive to religion; religion is corrosive to science. It teaches people to be satisfied with trivial, supernatural non-explanations, and blinds them to the wonderful, real explanations that we have within our grasp. It teaches them to accept authority, revelation and faith, instead of always insisting on evidence.There's Douglas Adams, magnificent picture from his book, \"Last Chance to See.\" Now, there's a typical scientific journal, The Quarterly Review of Biology. And I'm going to put together, as guest editor, a special issue on the question, \"Did an asteroid kill the dinosaurs?\" And the first paper is a standard scientific paper, presenting evidence, \"Iridium layer at the K-T boundary, and potassium argon dated crater in Yucatan, indicate that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs.\" Perfectly ordinary scientific paper. Now, the next one. \"The President of the Royal Society has been vouchsafed a strong inner conviction that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs.\"(Laughter)\"It has been privately revealed to Professor Huxtanethat an asteroid killed the dinosaurs.\"(Laughter)\"Professor Hordley was brought up to have total and unquestioning faith\" \u2014(Laughter) \u2014\"that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs.\" \"Professor Hawkins has promulgated an official dogma binding on all loyal Hawkinsians that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs.\"(Laughter)That's inconceivable, of course.But suppose \u2014[Supporters of the Asteroid Theory cannot be patriotic citizens](Laughter)(Applause)In 1987, a reporter asked George Bush, Sr. whether he recognized the equal citizenship and patriotism of Americans who are atheists. Mr. Bush's reply has become infamous. \"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God.\"Bush's bigotry was not an isolated mistake, blurted out in the heat of the moment and later retracted. He stood by it in the face of repeated calls for clarification or withdrawal. He really meant it. More to the point, he knew it posed no threat to his election \u2014 quite the contrary. Democrats as well as Republicans parade their religiousness if they want to get elected. Both parties invoke \"one nation under God.\" What would Thomas Jefferson have said?[In every country and in every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty]Incidentally, I'm not usually very proud of being British, but you can't help making the comparison.(Applause)In practice, what is an atheist? An atheist is just somebody who feels about Yahweh the way any decent Christian feels about Thor or Baal or the golden calf. As has been said before, we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further.(Laughter)(Applause)And however we define atheism, it's surely the kind of academic belief that a person is entitled to hold without being vilified as an unpatriotic, unelectable non-citizen. Nevertheless, it's an undeniable fact that to own up to being an atheist is tantamount to introducing yourself as Mr. Hitler or Miss Beelzebub. And that all stems from the perception of atheists as some kind of weird, way-out minority.Natalie Angier wrote a rather sad piece in the New Yorker, saying how lonely she felt as an atheist. She clearly feels in a beleaguered minority. But actually, how do American atheists stack up numerically? The latest survey makes surprisingly encouraging reading. Christianity, of course, takes a massive lion's share of the population, with nearly 160 million. But what would you think was the second largest group, convincingly outnumbering Jews with 2.8 million, Muslims at 1.1 million, Hindus, Buddhists and all other religions put together? The second largest group, with nearly 30 million, is the one described as non-religious or secular.You can't help wondering why vote-seeking politicians are so proverbially overawed by the power of, for example, the Jewish lobby \u2014 the state of Israel seems to owe its very existence to the American Jewish vote \u2014 while at the same time, consigning the non-religious to political oblivion. This secular non-religious vote, if properly mobilized, is nine times as numerous as the Jewish vote. Why does this far more substantial minority not make a move to exercise its political muscle?Well, so much for quantity. How about quality? Is there any correlation, positive or negative, between intelligence and tendency to be religious?[Them folks misunderestimated me](Laughter)The survey that I quoted, which is the ARIS survey, didn't break down its data by socio-economic class or education, IQ or anything else. But a recent article by Paul G. Bell in the Mensa magazine provides some straws in the wind. Mensa, as you know, is an international organization for people with very high IQ. And from a meta-analysis of the literature, Bell concludes that, I quote \u2014 \"Of 43 studies carried out since 1927 on the relationship between religious belief, and one's intelligence or educational level, all but four found an inverse connection. That is, the higher one's intelligence or educational level, the less one is likely to be religious.\" Well, I haven't seen the original 42 studies, and I can't comment on that meta-analysis, but I would like to see more studies done along those lines. And I know that there are \u2014 if I could put a little plug here \u2014 there are people in this audience easily capable of financing a massive research survey to settle the question, and I put the suggestion up, for what it's worth.But let me know show you some data that have been properly published and analyzed, on one special group \u2014 namely, top scientists. In 1998, Larson and Witham polled the cream of American scientists, those who'd been honored by election to the National Academy of Sciences, and among this select group, belief in a personal God dropped to a shattering seven percent. About 20 percent are agnostic; the rest could fairly be called atheists. Similar figures obtained for belief in personal immortality. Among biological scientists, the figure is even lower: 5.5 percent, only, believe in God. Physical scientists, it's 7.5 percent. I've not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars in other fields, such as history or philosophy, but I'd be surprised if they were different.So, we've reached a truly remarkable situation, a grotesque mismatch between the American intelligentsia and the American electorate. A philosophical opinion about the nature of the universe, which is held by the vast majority of top American scientists and probably the majority of the intelligentsia generally, is so abhorrent to the American electorate that no candidate for popular election dare affirm it in public. If I'm right, this means that high office in the greatest country in the world is barred to the very people best qualified to hold it \u2014 the intelligentsia \u2014 unless they are prepared to lie about their beliefs. To put it bluntly: American political opportunities are heavily loaded against those who are simultaneously intelligent and honest.(Laughter)(Applause)I'm not a citizen of this country, so I hope it won't be thought unbecoming if I suggest that something needs to be done.(Laughter)And I've already hinted what that something is. From what I've seen of TED, I think this may be the ideal place to launch it. Again, I fear it will cost money. We need a consciousness-raising, coming-out campaign for American atheists.(Laughter)This could be similar to the campaign organized by homosexuals a few years ago, although heaven forbid that we should stoop to public outing of people against their will. In most cases, people who out themselves will help to destroy the myth that there is something wrong with atheists.On the contrary, they'll demonstrate that atheists are often the kinds of people who could serve as decent role models for your children, the kinds of people an advertising agent could use to recommend a product, the kinds of people who are sitting in this room. There should be a snowball effect, a positive feedback, such that the more names we have, the more we get. There could be non-linearities, threshold effects. When a critical mass has been obtained, there's an abrupt acceleration in recruitment. And again, it will need money.I suspect that the word \"atheist\" itself contains or remains a stumbling block far out of proportion to what it actually means, and a stumbling block to people who otherwise might be happy to out themselves. So, what other words might be used to smooth the path, oil the wheels, sugar the pill? Darwin himself preferred \"agnostic\" \u2014 and not only out of loyalty to his friend Huxley, who coined the term.Darwin said, \"I have never been an atheist in the same sense of denying the existence of a God. I think that generally an 'agnostic' would be the most correct description of my state of mind.\"He even became uncharacteristically tetchy with Edward Aveling. Aveling was a militant atheist who failed to persuade Darwin to accept the dedication of his book on atheism \u2014 incidentally, giving rise to a fascinating myth that Karl Marx tried to dedicate \"Das Kapital\" to Darwin, which he didn't, it was actually Edward Aveling. What happened was that Aveling's mistress was Marx's daughter, and when both Darwin and Marx were dead, Marx's papers became muddled up with Aveling's papers, and a letter from Darwin saying, \"My dear sir, thank you very much but I don't want you to dedicate your book to me,\" was mistakenly supposed to be addressed to Marx, and that gave rise to this whole myth, which you've probably heard. It's a sort of urban myth, that Marx tried to dedicate \"Kapital\" to Darwin.Anyway, it was Aveling, and when they met, Darwin challenged Aveling. \"Why do you call yourselves atheists?\" \"'Agnostic, '\" retorted Aveling, \"was simply 'atheist' writ respectable, and 'atheist' was simply 'agnostic' writ aggressive.\" Darwin complained, \"But why should you be so aggressive?\" Darwin thought that atheism might be well and good for the intelligentsia, but that ordinary people were not, quote, \"ripe for it.\" Which is, of course, our old friend, the \"don't rock the boat\" argument. It's not recorded whether Aveling told Darwin to come down off his high horse.(Laughter)But in any case, that was more than 100 years ago. You'd think we might have grown up since then. Now, a friend, an intelligent lapsed Jew, who, incidentally, observes the Sabbath for reasons of cultural solidarity, describes himself as a \"tooth-fairy agnostic.\" He won't call himself an atheist because it's, in principle, impossible to prove a negative, but \"agnostic\" on its own might suggest that God's existence was therefore on equal terms of likelihood as his non-existence.So, my friend is strictly agnostic about the tooth fairy, but it isn't very likely, is it? Like God. Hence the phrase, \"tooth-fairy agnostic.\" Bertrand Russell made the same point using a hypothetical teapot in orbit about Mars. You would strictly have to be agnostic about whether there is a teapot in orbit about Mars, but that doesn't mean you treat the likelihood of its existence as on all fours with its non-existence.The list of things which we strictly have to be agnostic about doesn't stop at tooth fairies and teapots; it's infinite. If you want to believe one particular one of them \u2014 unicorns or tooth fairies or teapots or Yahweh \u2014 the onus is on you to say why. The onus is not on the rest of us to say why not. We, who are atheists, are also a-fairyists and a-teapotists.(Laughter)But we don't bother to say so. And this is why my friend uses \"tooth-fairy agnostic\" as a label for what most people would call atheist. Nonetheless, if we want to attract deep-down atheists to come out publicly, we're going to have find something better to stick on our banner than \"tooth-fairy\" or \"teapot agnostic.\"So, how about \"humanist\"? This has the advantage of a worldwide network of well-organized associations and journals and things already in place. My problem with it is only its apparent anthropocentrism. One of the things we've learned from Darwin is that the human species is only one among millions of cousins, some close, some distant.And there are other possibilities, like \"naturalist,\" but that also has problems of confusion, because Darwin would have thought naturalist \u2014 \"Naturalist\" means, of course, as opposed to \"supernaturalist\" \u2014 and it is used sometimes \u2014 Darwin would have been confused by the other sense of \"naturalist,\" which he was, of course, and I suppose there might be others who would confuse it with \"nudism\".(Laughter)Such people might be those belonging to the British lynch mob, which last year attacked a pediatrician in mistake for a pedophile.(Laughter)I think the best of the available alternatives for \"atheist\" is simply \"non-theist.\" It lacks the strong connotation that there's definitely no God, and it could therefore easily be embraced by teapot or tooth-fairy agnostics. It's completely compatible with the God of the physicists. When atheists like Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein use the word \"God,\" they use it of course as a metaphorical shorthand for that deep, mysterious part of physics which we don't yet understand. \"Non-theist\" will do for all that, yet unlike \"atheist,\" it doesn't have the same phobic, hysterical responses. But I think, actually, the alternative is to grasp the nettle of the word \"atheism\" itself, precisely because it is a taboo word, carrying frissons of hysterical phobia. Critical mass may be harder to achieve with the word \"atheist\" than with the word \"non-theist,\" or some other non-confrontational word. But if we did achieve it with that dread word \"atheist\" itself, the political impact would be even greater.Now, I said that if I were religious, I'd be very afraid of evolution \u2014 I'd go further: I would fear science in general, if properly understood. And this is because the scientific worldview is so much more exciting, more poetic, more filled with sheer wonder than anything in the poverty-stricken arsenals of the religious imagination. As Carl Sagan, another recently dead hero, put it, \"How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded, 'This is better than we thought! The universe is much bigger than our prophet said, grander, more subtle, more elegant'? Instead they say, 'No, no, no! My god is a little god, and I want him to stay that way.' A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science, might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.\"Now, this is an elite audience, and I would therefore expect about 10 percent of you to be religious. Many of you probably subscribe to our polite cultural belief that we should respect religion. But I also suspect that a fair number of those secretly despise religion as much as I do.(Laughter)If you're one of them, and of course many of you may not be, but if you are one of them, I'm asking you to stop being polite, come out, and say so. And if you happen to be rich, give some thought to ways in which you might make a difference. The religious lobby in this country is massively financed by foundations \u2014 to say nothing of all the tax benefits \u2014 by foundations, such as the Templeton Foundation and the Discovery Institute. We need an anti-Templeton to step forward. If my books sold as well as Stephen Hawking's books, instead of only as well as Richard Dawkins' books, I'd do it myself.People are always going on about, \"How did September the 11th change you?\"Well, here's how it changed me.Let's all stop being so damned respectful.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 113, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:14.021 --> 00:00:16.934\nThat splendid music, the coming-in music,\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:22.839\n\"The Elephant March\" from \"Aida,\"\nis the music I've chosen for my funeral.\n\n00:00:22.863 --> 00:00:23.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:28.934\nAnd you can see why. It's triumphal.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:32.934\nI won't feel anything, but if I could,\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:36.934\nI would feel triumphal\nat having lived at all,\n\n00:00:36.958 -->

00:01:01.684\nLike everybody else, I was entranced\nyesterday by the animal session.\n\n00:01:01.708 --> 00:01:07.147\nRobert Full and Frans Lanting and others;\n\n00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:09.397\nthe beauty of the things that they showed.\n\n00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:14.934\nThe only slight jarring note was when\nJeffrey Katzenberg said of the mustang,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:18.789\n\"the most splendid creatures\nthat God put on this earth.\"\n\n00:01:18.813 --> 00:01:22.414\nNow of course, we know\nthat he didn't really mean that,\n\n00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:25.591\nbut in this country at the moment,\nyou can't be too careful.\n\n00:01:25.615 --> 00:01:26.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:33.934\nI'm a biologist, and the central theorem\nof our subject: the theory of

accepted.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:48.934\nIn non-professional circles\noutside America, it's largely ignored.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.934\nBut in non-professional\ncircles within America,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.934\nit arouses so much hostility --\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.034\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:57.058 --> 00:02:01.688\nit's fair to say that American biologists\nare in a state of war.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.933\nThe war is so worrying at present,\n\n00:02:04.957 --> 00:02:07.530\nwith court cases coming\nup in one state after another,\n\n00:02:07.554 --> 00:02:09.934\nthat I felt I had to say\nsomething about it.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.934\nIf you want to know what I have\nto say about Darwinism itself,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.934\nI'm

00:02:24.934\nContemporary court cases\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.934\noften concern an allegedly\nnew version of creationism,\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.257\ncalled \"Intelligent Design,\" or ID.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:36.750\nDon't be fooled.\nThere's nothing new about ID.\n\n00:02:37.107 --> 00:02:40.457\nIt's just creationism under another name,\n\n00:02:40.481 --> 00:02:43.839\nrechristened --\nI choose the word advisedly --\n\n00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:44.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.934\nfor tactical, political reasons.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.934\nThe arguments of so-called ID theorists\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:52.330\nare the same old arguments\nthat had been refuted again and again,\n\n00:02:52.354 --> 00:02:54.787\nsince Darwin down to the present day.\n\n00:02:55.866 --> 00:02:58.934\nThere is an effective evolution lobby\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.054\ncoordinating the fight\non behalf of science,\n\n00:03:01.078 --> 00:03:03.934\nand I try to do all I can to help them,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:07.934\nbut they get quite upset\nwhen people like me dare to mention\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:11.537\nthat we happen to be atheists\nas well as evolutionists.\n\n00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.934\nThey see us as rocking the boat,\nand you can understand why.\n\n00:03:17.647 --> 00:03:22.376\nCreationists, lacking any coherent\nscientific argument for their case,\n\n00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.354\nfall back on the popular\nphobia against atheism:\n\n00:03:27.378 --> 00:03:30.934\nTeach your children\nevolution in biology class,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:35.934\nand they'll soon move on to drugs,\ngrand larceny and sexual \"pre-version.\"\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:39.747\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.934\nIn fact, of course, educated\ntheologians from the Pope down\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.082\nare firm in their support of evolution.\n\n00:03:46.844 --> 00:03:49.763\nThis book, \"Finding\nDarwin's God,\" by Kenneth Miller,\n\n00:03:49.787 --> 00:03:53.850\nis one of the most effective attacks\non Intelligent Design that I know\n\n00:03:53.874 --> 00:03:57.934\nand it's all the more effective because\nit's written by a devout Christian.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:02.540\nPeople like Kenneth Miller could be called\na \"godsend\" to the evolution lobby,\n\n00:04:02.564 --> 00:04:03.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:08.685\nbecause they expose the lie\nthat evolutionism is, as a matter of fact,\n\n00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.332\ntantamount to atheism.\n\n00:04:10.356 --> 00:04:13.490\nPeople like me, on the other\nhand, rock the boat.\n\n00:04:15.133 --> 00:04:17.934\nBut here, I want to say something\nnice about creationists.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.634\nIt's not a thing I often do,\nso listen carefully.\n\n00:04:20.658 --> 00:04:21.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.934\nI think they're right about one thing.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.934\nI think they're right that evolution\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.601\nis fundamentally hostile to religion.\n\n00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:33.815\nI've already said that many individual\nevolutionists, like the Pope,\n\n00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:36.934\nare also religious, but I think\nthey're deluding themselves.\n\n00:04:37.418 --> 00:04:40.362\nI believe a true\nunderstanding of Darwinism\n\n00:04:40.386 --> 00:04:43.926\nis deeply corrosive to religious faith.\n\n00:04:45.307 --> 00:04:50.530\nNow, it may sound as though\nI'm about to preach atheism,\n\n00:04:50.554 --> 00:04:54.386\nand I want to reassure you\nthat that's not what I'm going to do.\n\n00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.934\nIn an audience\nas sophisticated as this one,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.311\nthat would be preaching to the choir.\n\n00:05:00.811 --> 00:05:03.431\nNo, what I want to urge upon you --\n\n00:05:03.455 --> 00:05:07.198\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:07.222 --> 00:05:11.934\nInstead, what I want to urge\nupon you is militant atheism.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:17.156\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.935\nBut that's putting it too negatively.\n\n00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:24.608\nIf I was a person who were interested\nin preserving religious faith,\n\n00:05:24.632 --> 00:05:29.781\nI would be very afraid of the positive\npower of evolutionary science,\n\n00:05:29.805 --> 00:05:32.654\nand indeed science generally,\nbut evolution in particular,\n\n00:05:32.678 --> 00:05:38.540\nto inspire and enthrall,\nprecisely because it is atheistic.\n\n00:05:40.295 --> 00:05:44.048\nNow, the difficult problem\nfor any theory of biological design\n\n00:05:44.072 --> 00:05:49.334\nis to explain the massive statistical\nimprobability of living things.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:54.730\nStatistical improbability\nin the direction of good design --\n\n00:05:54.754 --> 00:05:56.642\n\"complexity\" is another word for this.\n\n00:05:57.227 --> 00:05:58.974\nThe standard creationist argument --\n\n00:05:58.998 --> 00:06:01.934\nthere is only one;\nthey're all reduced to this one --\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.338\ntakes off from\na statistical improbability.\n\n00:06:04.362 --> 00:06:07.648\nLiving creatures are too complex\nto have come about by chance;\n\n00:06:07.672 --> 00:06:09.934\ntherefore, they must have had a designer.\n\n00:06:10.552 --> 00:06:12.996\nThis argument of course,\nshoots itself in the foot.\n\n00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.335\nAny designer capable of designing\nsomething really complex\n\n00:06:16.359 --> 00:06:18.940\nhas to be even more complex himself,\n\n00:06:18.964 --> 00:06:22.934\nand that's before we even start\non the other things he's expected to do,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:26.872\nlike forgive sins, bless\nmarriages, listen to prayers --\n\n00:06:26.896 --> 00:06:28.934\nfavor our side in a war --\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.344\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:31.368 --> 00:06:33.934\ndisapprove of our sex lives, and so on.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:40.934\nComplexity is the problem\nthat any theory of biology has to solve,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:45.665\nand you can't solve it by postulating\nan agent that is even more complex,\n\n00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:48.299\nthereby simply compounding the problem.\n\n00:06:48.886 --> 00:06:53.283\nDarwinian natural selection\nis so stunningly elegant\n\n00:06:53.307 --> 00:06:57.132\nbecause it solves the problem\nof explaining complexity\n\n00:06:57.156 --> 00:07:00.211\nin terms of nothing but simplicity.\n\n00:07:01.052 --> 00:07:04.321\nEssentially, it does it\nby providing a smooth ramp\n\n00:07:04.345 --> 00:07:07.660\nof gradual, step-by-step increment.\n\n00:07:08.715 --> 00:07:10.588\nBut here, I only want to make the point\n\n00:07:10.612 --> 00:07:14.302\nthat the elegance of Darwinism\nis corrosive to religion,\n\n00:07:14.326 --> 00:07:18.934\nprecisely because it is so elegant,\nso parsimonious, so powerful,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.672\nso economically powerful.\n\n00:07:23.243 --> 00:07:29.140\nIt has the sinewy economy\nof a beautiful suspension bridge.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.549\nThe God theory is not just a bad theory.\n\n00:07:32.573 --> 00:07:34.343\nIt turns out to be -- in principle --\n\n00:07:34.367 --> 00:07:37.934\nincapable of doing the job required of it.\n\n00:07:38.422 --> 00:07:41.533\nSo, returning to tactics\nand the evolution lobby,\n\n00:07:41.557 --> 00:07:44.679\nI want to argue that rocking the boat\n\n00:07:44.703 --> 00:07:49.410\nmay be just the right thing to do.\n\n00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.006\nMy approach to attacking creationism is --\n\n00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.513\nunlike the evolution lobby --\n\n00:07:55.537 --> 00:08:00.267\nmy approach to attacking creationism\nis to attack religion as a whole.\n\n00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:05.576\nAnd at this point I need\nto acknowledge the remarkable taboo\n\n00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.086\nagainst speaking ill of religion,\n\n00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:11.459\nand I'm going to do so in the words\nof the late Douglas Adams,\n\n00:08:11.483 --> 00:08:13.722\na dear friend who,\nif he never came to TED,\n\n00:08:13.746 --> 00:08:15.728\ncertainly should have been invited.\n\n00:08:15.752 --> 00:08:17.219\n(Richard Saul Wurman: He was.)\n\n00:08:17.243 --> 00:08:20.266\nRichard Dawkins: He was. Good.\nI thought he must have been.\n\n00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.134\nHe begins this speech,\nwhich was tape recorded in Cambridge\n\n00:08:23.158 --> 00:08:24.934\nshortly before he died --\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:29.531\nhe begins by explaining how science\nworks through the testing of hypotheses\n\n00:08:29.555 --> 00:08:33.158\nthat are framed to be vulnerable\nto disproof, and then he goes on.\n\n00:08:33.182 --> 00:08:36.934\nI quote, \"Religion doesn't\nseem to work like that.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:40.934\nIt has certain ideas at the heart of it,\nwhich we call 'sacred' or 'holy.'\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.934\nWhat it means is:\nhere is an idea or a notion\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:47.613\nthat you're not allowed\nto say anything bad about.\n\n00:08:47.637 --> 00:08:51.934\nYou're just not. Why not?\nBecause you're not.\"\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:55.862\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:55.886 --> 00:08:58.307\n\"Why should it be\nthat it's perfectly legitimate\n\n00:08:58.331 --> 00:09:00.320\nto support the Republicans or Democrats,\n\n00:09:00.344 --> 00:09:02.704\nthis model of economics versus that,\n\n00:09:02.728 --> 00:09:04.693\nMacintosh instead of Windows,\n\n00:09:04.717 --> 00:09:07.678\nbut to have an opinion\nabout how the universe began,\n\n00:09:07.702 --> 00:09:09.338\nabout who created the universe --\n\n00:09:09.362 --> 00:09:11.011\nno, that's holy.\n\n00:09:11.742 --> 00:09:15.108\nSo, we're used to not\nchallenging religious ideas,\n\n00:09:15.132 --> 00:09:18.322\nand it's very interesting how much\nof a furor Richard creates\n\n00:09:18.346 --> 00:09:19.505\nwhen he does it.\" --\n\n00:09:19.529 --> 00:09:21.329\nHe meant me, not that one.\n\n00:09:22.536 --> 00:09:24.934\n\"Everybody gets absolutely\nfrantic about it,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.546\nbecause you're not allowed\nto say these things.\n\n00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.267\nYet when you look at it rationally,\n\n00:09:29.291 --> 00:09:31.387\nthere's no reason why those ideas\n\n00:09:31.411 --> 00:09:34.086\nshouldn't be as open\nto debate as any other,\n\n00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.179\nexcept that we've agreed\nsomehow between us\n\n00:09:37.203 --> 00:09:38.577\nthat they shouldn't be.\"\n\n00:09:38.941 --> 00:09:41.258\nAnd that's the end\nof the quote from Douglas.\n\n00:09:43.822 --> 00:09:47.934\nIn my view, not only is science\ncorrosive to religion;\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:51.109\nreligion is corrosive to science.\n\n00:09:51.656 --> 00:09:55.529\nIt teaches people\nto be satisfied with trivial,\n\n00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:58.576\nsupernatural non-explanations,\n\n00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.331\nand blinds them to the wonderful,\nreal explanations\n\n00:10:02.355 --> 00:10:03.934\nthat we have within our grasp.\n\n00:10:04.553 --> 00:10:10.594\nIt teaches them to accept\nauthority, revelation and faith,\n\n00:10:10.618 --> 00:10:14.087\ninstead of always insisting on evidence.\n\n00:10:16.039 --> 00:10:20.578\nThere's Douglas Adams, magnificent picture\nfrom his book, \"Last Chance to See.\"\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.618\nNow, there's a typical scientific

special issue on the question,\n\"Did an asteroid kill the dinosaurs?\"\n\n00:10:34.448 --> 00:10:38.545\nAnd the first paper\nis a standard scientific paper,\n\n00:10:38.569 -->

00:11:50.036\nBut suppose --\n\n00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.106\n[Supporters of the Asteroid Theory\ncannot be patriotic citizens]\n\n00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.845\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:54.869 --> 00:11:57.488\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:59.732 --> 00:12:02.934\nIn 1987, a reporter asked George Bush, Sr.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:06.776\nwhether he recognized\nthe equal citizenship and patriotism\n\n00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.934\nof Americans who are atheists.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.934\nMr. Bush's reply has become infamous.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:15.934\n\"No, I don't know that atheists\nshould be considered citizens,\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.934\nnor should they be considered patriots.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.592\nThis is one nation under God.\"\n\n00:12:21.529 --> 00:12:24.148\nBush's bigotry\nwas not an isolated mistake,\n\n00:12:24.172 --> 00:12:27.457\nblurted out in the heat\nof the moment and later retracted.\n\n00:12:27.481 --> 00:12:32.328\nHe stood by it in the face of repeated\ncalls for clarification or withdrawal.\n\n00:12:32.352 --> 00:12:33.582\nHe really meant it.\n\n00:12:33.606 --> 00:12:38.161\nMore to the point, he knew\nit posed no threat to his election --\n\n00:12:38.185 --> 00:12:39.367\nquite the contrary.\n\n00:12:39.391 --> 00:12:43.121\nDemocrats as well as Republicans\nparade their religiousness\n\n00:12:43.145 --> 00:12:44.869\nif they want to get elected.\n\n00:12:44.893 --> 00:12:49.053\nBoth parties invoke\n\"one nation under God.\"\n\n00:12:49.077 --> 00:12:51.389\nWhat would Thomas Jefferson have said?\n\n00:12:51.413 --> 00:12:55.039\n[In every country and in every age,\nthe priest has been hostile to liberty]\n\n00:12:55.063 --> 00:12:58.934\nIncidentally, I'm not usually\nvery proud of being British,\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:02.934\nbut you can't help making the comparison.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:09.927\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:11.443 --> 00:13:13.934\nIn practice, what is an atheist?\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:18.266\nAn atheist is just somebody\nwho feels about Yahweh\n\n00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:24.553\nthe way any decent Christian feels\nabout Thor or Baal or the golden calf.\n\n00:13:24.577 --> 00:13:28.934\nAs has been said before, we are\nall atheists about most of the gods\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.263\nthat humanity has ever believed in.\n\n00:13:31.287 --> 00:13:33.934\nSome of us just go one god further.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:43.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:47.292\nAnd however we define atheism,\nit's surely the kind of academic belief\n\n00:13:47.316 --> 00:13:50.934\nthat a person is entitled\nto hold without being vilified\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:55.114\nas an unpatriotic,\nunelectable non-citizen.\n\n00:13:56.003 --> 00:13:59.387\nNevertheless, it's an undeniable fact\nthat to own up to being an atheist\n\n00:13:59.411 --> 00:14:03.951\nis tantamount to introducing yourself\nas Mr. Hitler or Miss Beelzebub.\n\n00:14:04.541 --> 00:14:08.243\nAnd that all stems\nfrom the perception of atheists\n\n00:14:08.267 --> 00:14:12.172\nas some kind of weird, way-out minority.\n\n00:14:12.847 --> 00:14:15.934\nNatalie Angier wrote a rather\nsad piece in the New Yorker,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.021\nsaying how lonely she felt as an atheist.\n\n00:14:18.378 --> 00:14:20.816\nShe clearly feels\nin a beleaguered minority.\n\n00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:26.095\nBut actually, how do American atheists\nstack up numerically?\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.857\nThe latest survey makes\nsurprisingly encouraging reading.\n\n00:14:30.254 --> 00:14:33.684\nChristianity, of course, takes a massive\nlion's share of the population,\n\n00:14:33.708 --> 00:14:35.302\nwith nearly 160 million.\n\n00:14:36.214 --> 00:14:39.691\nBut what would you think\nwas the second largest group,\n\n00:14:39.715 --> 00:14:45.151\nconvincingly outnumbering Jews\nwith 2.8 million, Muslims at 1.1 million,\n\n00:14:45.175 --> 00:14:48.825\nHindus, Buddhists and all other\nreligions put together?\n\n00:14:48.849 --> 00:14:51.492\nThe second largest group,\nwith nearly 30 million,\n\n00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:54.706\nis the one described\nas non-religious or secular.\n\n00:14:55.659 --> 00:14:58.934\nYou can't help wondering\nwhy vote-seeking politicians\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:04.140\nare so proverbially overawed by the power\nof, for example, the Jewish lobby --\n\n00:15:04.164 --> 00:15:08.481\nthe state of Israel seems to owe its very\nexistence to the American Jewish vote --\n\n00:15:08.505 --> 00:15:09.934\nwhile at the same time,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:14.048\nconsigning the non-religious\nto political oblivion.\n\n00:15:15.302 --> 00:15:18.934\nThis secular non-religious vote,\nif properly mobilized,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.871\nis nine times as numerous\nas the Jewish vote.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.934\nWhy does this far more\nsubstantial minority\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:29.165\nnot make a move to exercise\nits political muscle?\n\n00:15:30.243 --> 00:15:33.013\nWell, so much for quantity.\nHow about quality?\n\n00:15:33.497 --> 00:15:36.600\nIs there any correlation,\npositive or negative,\n\n00:15:36.624 --> 00:15:40.635\nbetween intelligence\nand tendency to be religious?\n\n00:15:40.659 --> 00:15:42.896\n[Them folks misunderestimated me]\n\n00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:47.008\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.934\nThe survey that I quoted,\nwhich is the ARIS survey,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:54.006\ndidn't break down its data\nby socio-economic class or education,\n\n00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.752\nIQ or anything else.\n\n00:15:55.776 --> 00:15:59.934\nBut a recent article by Paul G. Bell\nin the Mensa magazine\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.934\nprovides some straws in the wind.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.435\nMensa, as you know,\nis an international organization\n\n00:16:04.459 --> 00:16:07.769\nfor people with very high IQ.\n\n00:16:07.793 --> 00:16:12.728\nAnd from a meta-analysis\nof the literature,\n\n00:16:12.752 --> 00:16:17.934\nBell concludes that, I quote --\n\"Of 43 studies carried out since 1927\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.253\non the relationship\nbetween religious belief,\n\n00:16:20.277 --> 00:16:22.743\nand one's intelligence\nor educational level,\n\n00:16:22.767 --> 00:16:26.934\nall but four found an inverse connection.\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:30.575\nThat is, the higher one's intelligence\nor educational level,\n\n00:16:30.599 --> 00:16:32.934\nthe less one is likely to be religious.\"\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.133\nWell, I haven't seen\nthe original 42 studies,\n\n00:16:35.157 --> 00:16:38.165\nand I can't comment on that meta-analysis,\n\n00:16:38.189 --> 00:16:41.902\nbut I would like to see more\nstudies done along those lines.\n\n00:16:41.926 --> 00:16:44.989\nAnd I know that there are --\nif I could put a little plug here --\n\n00:16:45.013 --> 00:16:46.609\nthere are people in this audience\n\n00:16:46.633 --> 00:16:51.934\neasily capable of financing a massive\nresearch survey to settle the question,\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:54.543\nand I put the suggestion up,\nfor what it's worth.\n\n00:16:54.567 --> 00:16:56.217\nBut let me know show you some data\n\n00:16:56.241 --> 00:16:58.470\nthat have been properly\npublished and analyzed,\n\n00:16:58.494 --> 00:17:02.486\non one special group --\nnamely, top scientists.\n\n00:17:03.402 --> 00:17:08.934\nIn 1998, Larson and Witham\npolled the cream of American scientists,\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:12.649\nthose who'd been honored by election\nto the National Academy of Sciences,\n\n00:17:12.673 --> 00:17:15.304\nand among this select group,\n\n00:17:15.328 --> 00:17:20.775\nbelief in a personal God dropped\nto a shattering seven percent.\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:26.705\nAbout 20 percent are agnostic;\nthe rest could fairly be called atheists.\n\n00:17:26.729 --> 00:17:29.934\nSimilar figures obtained\nfor belief in personal immortality.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.934\nAmong biological scientists,\nthe figure is even lower:\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:36.713\n5.5 percent, only, believe in God.\n\n00:17:36.737 --> 00:17:39.934\nPhysical scientists, it's 7.5 percent.\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:42.934\nI've not seen corresponding\nfigures for elite scholars\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:45.934\nin other fields,\nsuch as history or philosophy,\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:48.132\nbut I'd be surprised\nif they were different.\n\n00:17:49.449 --> 00:17:52.672\nSo, we've reached a truly\nremarkable situation,\n\n00:17:52.696 --> 00:17:57.711\na grotesque mismatch\nbetween the American intelligentsia\n\n00:17:57.735 --> 00:17:59.504\nand the American electorate.\n\n00:18:00.322 --> 00:18:03.934\nA philosophical opinion\nabout the nature of the universe,\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:07.934\nwhich is held by the vast majority\nof top American scientists\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:11.814\nand probably the majority\nof the intelligentsia generally,\n\n00:18:11.838 --> 00:18:14.638\nis so abhorrent to the American electorate\n\n00:18:14.662 --> 00:18:19.566\nthat no candidate for popular election\ndare affirm it in public.\n\n00:18:20.035 --> 00:18:22.934\nIf I'm right, this means that high office\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:25.604\nin the greatest country in the world\n\n00:18:25.628 --> 00:18:29.715\nis barred to the very people\nbest qualified to hold it --\n\n00:18:29.739 --> 00:18:30.934\nthe intelligentsia --\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:33.934\nunless they are prepared\nto lie about their beliefs.\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:37.452\nTo put it bluntly:\nAmerican political opportunities\n\n00:18:37.476 --> 00:18:39.934\nare heavily loaded against those\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:42.743\nwho are simultaneously\nintelligent and honest.\n\n00:18:42.767 --> 00:18:43.973\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:43.997 --> 00:18:50.308\n(Applause)\n\n00:18:50.332 --> 00:18:53.934\nI'm not a citizen of this country,\nso I hope it won't be thought unbecoming\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:56.934\nif I suggest that something\nneeds to be done.\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:59.458\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:59.482 --> 00:19:01.934\nAnd I've already hinted\nwhat that something is.\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:05.715\nFrom what I've seen of TED, I think this\nmay be the ideal place to launch it.\n\n00:19:06.437 --> 00:19:08.588\nAgain, I fear it will cost money.\n\n00:19:08.612 --> 00:19:11.159\nWe need a consciousness-raising,\n\n00:19:11.183 --> 00:19:14.934\ncoming-out campaign for American atheists.\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:16.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:20.678\nThis could be similar to the campaign\norganized by homosexuals\n\n00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:21.934\na few years ago,\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:25.291\nalthough heaven forbid\nthat we should stoop to public outing\n\n00:19:25.315 --> 00:19:26.934\nof people against their will.\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:29.934\nIn most cases, people who out themselves\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:33.934\nwill help to destroy the myth that\nthere is something wrong with atheists.\n\n00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:35.111\nOn the contrary,\n\n00:19:35.135 --> 00:19:38.205\nthey'll demonstrate that atheists\nare often the kinds of people\n\n00:19:38.229 --> 00:19:40.934\nwho could serve as decent\nrole models for your children,\n\n00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:45.725\nthe kinds of people an advertising agent\ncould use to recommend a product,\n\n00:19:45.749 --> 00:19:48.581\nthe kinds of people\nwho are sitting in this room.\n\n00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:52.934\nThere should be a snowball effect,\na positive feedback,\n\n00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:55.934\nsuch that the more names\nwe have, the more we get.\n\n00:19:56.548 --> 00:19:59.317\nThere could be non-linearities,\nthreshold effects.\n\n00:19:59.341 --> 00:20:01.420\nWhen a critical mass has been obtained,\n\n00:20:01.444 --> 00:20:04.349\nthere's an abrupt\nacceleration in recruitment.\n\n00:20:04.373 --> 00:20:06.087\nAnd again, it will need money.\n\n00:20:07.452 --> 00:20:10.934\nI suspect that the word \"atheist\" itself\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:14.425\ncontains or remains a stumbling block\n\n00:20:14.449 --> 00:20:17.125\nfar out of proportion\nto what it actually means,\n\n00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:18.722\nand a stumbling block to people\n\n00:20:18.746 --> 00:20:21.803\nwho otherwise might be\nhappy to out themselves.\n\n00:20:21.827 --> 00:20:24.552\nSo, what other words might\nbe used to smooth the path,\n\n00:20:24.576 --> 00:20:27.124\noil the wheels, sugar the pill?\n\n00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.338\nDarwin himself preferred \"agnostic\" --\n\n00:20:31.362 --> 00:20:34.466\nand not only out of loyalty\nto his friend Huxley,\n\n00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:36.017\nwho coined the term.\n\n00:20:36.691 --> 00:20:39.524\nDarwin said, \"I have never been an atheist\n\n00:20:39.548 --> 00:20:42.246\nin the same sense of denying\nthe existence of a God.\n\n00:20:42.754 --> 00:20:44.934\nI think that generally an 'agnostic'\n\n00:20:44.958 --> 00:20:48.066\nwould be the most correct\ndescription of my state of mind.\"\n\n00:20:48.804 --> 00:20:53.622\nHe even became uncharacteristically\ntetchy with Edward Aveling.\n\n00:20:54.217 --> 00:20:55.934\nAveling was a militant atheist\n\n00:20:55.958 --> 00:20:57.934\nwho failed to persuade Darwin\n\n00:20:57.958 --> 00:21:00.934\nto accept the dedication\nof his book on atheism --\n\n00:21:00.958 --> 00:21:03.648\nincidentally, giving rise\nto a fascinating myth\n\n00:21:03.672 --> 00:21:07.069\nthat Karl Marx tried to dedicate\n\"Das Kapital\" to Darwin,\n\n00:21:07.093 --> 00:21:09.461\nwhich he didn't, it was\nactually Edward Aveling.\n\n00:21:09.485 --> 00:21:13.934\nWhat happened was that Aveling's\nmistress was Marx's daughter,\n\n00:21:13.958 --> 00:21:17.239\nand when both Darwin and Marx were dead,\n\n00:21:17.263 --> 00:21:21.477\nMarx's papers became muddled\nup with Aveling's papers,\n\n00:21:21.501 --> 00:21:25.808\nand a letter from Darwin saying,\n\"My dear sir, thank you very much\n\n00:21:25.832 --> 00:21:28.195\nbut I don't want you\nto dedicate your book to me,\"\n\n00:21:28.219 --> 00:21:31.472\nwas mistakenly supposed\nto be addressed to Marx,\n\n00:21:31.496 --> 00:21:34.813\nand that gave rise to this whole\nmyth, which you've probably heard.\n\n00:21:34.837 --> 00:21:39.376\nIt's a sort of urban myth, that Marx\ntried to dedicate \"Kapital\" to Darwin.\n\n00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:45.767\nAnyway, it was Aveling, and when\nthey met, Darwin challenged Aveling.\n\n00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:50.479\n\"Why do you call yourselves atheists?\"\n\n00:21:54.106 --> 00:21:58.393\n\"'Agnostic, '\" retorted Aveling, \"was\nsimply 'atheist' writ respectable,\n\n00:21:58.417 --> 00:22:02.226\nand 'atheist' was simply\n'agnostic' writ aggressive.\"\n\n00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.472\nDarwin complained, \"But why\nshould you be so aggressive?\"\n\n00:22:06.099 --> 00:22:09.695\nDarwin thought that atheism might be\nwell and good for the intelligentsia,\n\n00:22:09.719 --> 00:22:12.957\nbut that ordinary people were\nnot, quote, \"ripe for it.\"\n\n00:22:13.815 --> 00:22:17.219\nWhich is, of course, our old friend,\nthe \"don't rock the boat\" argument.\n\n00:22:17.958 --> 00:22:22.934\nIt's not recorded whether Aveling told\nDarwin to come down off his high horse.\n\n00:22:22.958 --> 00:22:24.785\n(Laughter)\n\n00:22:24.809 --> 00:22:27.159\nBut in any case,\nthat was more than 100 years ago.\n\n00:22:27.183 --> 00:22:29.571\nYou'd think we might have\ngrown up since then.\n\n00:22:30.087 --> 00:22:35.351\nNow, a friend, an intelligent lapsed Jew,\n\n00:22:35.375 --> 00:22:39.500\nwho, incidentally, observes the Sabbath\nfor reasons of cultural solidarity,\n\n00:22:39.524 --> 00:22:43.116\ndescribes himself\nas a \"tooth-fairy agnostic.\"\n\n00:22:44.024 --> 00:22:45.587\nHe won't call himself an atheist\n\n00:22:45.611 --> 00:22:48.934\nbecause it's, in principle,\nimpossible to prove a negative,\n\n00:22:48.958 --> 00:22:51.934\nbut \"agnostic\" on its own might\nsuggest that God's existence\n\n00:22:51.958 --> 00:22:57.100\nwas therefore on equal terms\nof likelihood as his non-existence.\n\n00:22:57.124 --> 00:23:01.441\nSo, my friend is strictly\nagnostic about the tooth fairy,\n\n00:23:01.465 --> 00:23:04.458\nbut it isn't very likely, is it?\n\n00:23:04.482 --> 00:23:05.934\nLike God.\n\n00:23:05.958 --> 00:23:07.965\nHence the phrase, \"tooth-fairy agnostic.\"\n\n00:23:08.287 --> 00:23:10.049\nBertrand Russell made the same point\n\n00:23:10.073 --> 00:23:13.636\nusing a hypothetical teapot\nin orbit about Mars.\n\n00:23:14.096 --> 00:23:15.934\nYou would strictly have to be agnostic\n\n00:23:15.958 --> 00:23:18.387\nabout whether there is a teapot\nin orbit about Mars,\n\n00:23:18.411 --> 00:23:21.411\nbut that doesn't mean you treat\nthe likelihood of its existence\n\n00:23:21.435 --> 00:23:24.239\nas on all fours with its non-existence.\n\n00:23:24.263 --> 00:23:27.568\nThe list of things which we strictly\nhave to be agnostic about\n\n00:23:27.592 --> 00:23:30.934\ndoesn't stop at tooth fairies\nand teapots; it's infinite.\n\n00:23:30.958 --> 00:23:33.435\nIf you want to believe\none particular one of them --\n\n00:23:33.459 --> 00:23:37.539\nunicorns or tooth fairies\nor teapots or Yahweh --\n\n00:23:37.563 --> 00:23:39.934\nthe onus is on you to say why.\n\n00:23:39.958 --> 00:23:43.316\nThe onus is not on the rest\nof us to say why not.\n\n00:23:43.958 --> 00:23:45.340\nWe, who are atheists,\n\n00:23:45.364 --> 00:23:48.755\nare also a-fairyists and a-teapotists.\n\n00:23:48.779 --> 00:23:51.420\n(Laughter)\n\n00:23:51.444 --> 00:23:53.032\nBut we don't bother to say so.\n\n00:23:53.801 --> 00:23:57.627\nAnd this is why my friend\nuses \"tooth-fairy agnostic\"\n\n00:23:57.651 --> 00:24:00.226\nas a label for what most people\nwould call atheist.\n\n00:24:00.637 --> 00:24:06.056\nNonetheless, if we want to attract\ndeep-down atheists to come out publicly,\n\n00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.169\nwe're going to have find\nsomething better to stick on our banner\n\n00:24:09.193 --> 00:24:11.691\nthan \"tooth-fairy\" or \"teapot agnostic.\"\n\n00:24:12.601 --> 00:24:14.133\nSo, how about \"humanist\"?\n\n00:24:16.538 --> 00:24:20.934\nThis has the advantage of a worldwide\nnetwork of well-organized associations\n\n00:24:20.958 --> 00:24:22.934\nand journals and things already in place.\n\n00:24:22.958 --> 00:24:25.906\nMy problem with it is only\nits apparent anthropocentrism.\n\n00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:27.936\nOne of the things\nwe've learned from Darwin\n\n00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.436\nis that the human species is only one\n\n00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:34.264\namong millions of cousins,\nsome close, some distant.\n\n00:24:34.288 --> 00:24:36.821\nAnd there are other possibilities,\nlike \"naturalist,\"\n\n00:24:36.845 --> 00:24:39.280\nbut that also has problems of confusion,\n\n00:24:39.304 --> 00:24:41.510\nbecause Darwin would have\nthought naturalist --\n\n00:24:41.534 --> 00:24:44.669\n\"Naturalist\" means, of course,\nas opposed to \"supernaturalist\" --\n\n00:24:44.693 --> 00:24:46.057\nand it is used sometimes --\n\n00:24:46.081 --> 00:24:49.475\nDarwin would have been confused\nby the other sense of \"naturalist,\"\n\n00:24:49.499 --> 00:24:50.690\nwhich he was, of course,\n\n00:24:50.714 --> 00:24:55.706\nand I suppose there might be others\nwho would confuse it with \"nudism\".\n\n00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:56.948\n(Laughter)\n\n00:24:56.972 --> 00:25:03.870\nSuch people might be those\nbelonging to the British lynch mob,\n\n00:25:03.894 --> 00:25:08.934\nwhich last year attacked a pediatrician\nin mistake for a pedophile.\n\n00:25:08.958 --> 00:25:12.483\n(Laughter)\n\n00:25:14.507 --> 00:25:17.667\nI think the best of the available\nalternatives for \"atheist\"\n\n00:25:17.691 --> 00:25:18.934\nis simply \"non-theist.\"\n\n00:25:18.958 --> 00:25:21.958\nIt lacks the strong connotation\nthat there's definitely no God,\n\n00:25:21.982 --> 00:25:27.841\nand it could therefore easily be embraced\nby teapot or tooth-fairy agnostics.\n\n00:25:27.865 --> 00:25:33.396\nIt's completely compatible\nwith the God of the physicists.\n\n00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:39.934\nWhen atheists like Stephen Hawking\nand Albert Einstein use the word \"God,\"\n\n00:25:39.958 --> 00:25:43.671\nthey use it of course\nas a metaphorical shorthand\n\n00:25:43.695 --> 00:25:48.266\nfor that deep, mysterious part of physics\nwhich we don't yet understand.\n\n00:25:49.179 --> 00:25:54.195\n\"Non-theist\" will do for all that,\nyet unlike \"atheist,\"\n\n00:25:54.219 --> 00:26:01.068\nit doesn't have the same\nphobic, hysterical responses.\n\n00:26:01.516 --> 00:26:03.370\nBut I think, actually, the alternative\n\n00:26:03.394 --> 00:26:06.243\nis to grasp the nettle\nof the word \"atheism\" itself,\n\n00:26:06.267 --> 00:26:08.934\nprecisely because it is a taboo word,\n\n00:26:08.958 --> 00:26:12.236\ncarrying frissons of hysterical phobia.\n\n00:26:13.172 --> 00:26:16.604\nCritical mass may be harder\nto achieve with the word \"atheist\"\n\n00:26:16.628 --> 00:26:18.183\nthan with the word \"non-theist,\"\n\n00:26:18.207 --> 00:26:20.167\nor some other non-confrontational word.\n\n00:26:20.643 --> 00:26:24.405\nBut if we did achieve it\nwith that dread word \"atheist\" itself,\n\n00:26:24.429 --> 00:26:27.222\nthe political impact\nwould be even greater.\n\n00:26:28.301 --> 00:26:31.706\nNow, I said that if I were religious,\nI'd be very afraid of evolution --\n\n00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:35.364\nI'd go further: I would fear science\nin general, if properly understood.\n\n00:26:35.388 --> 00:26:38.601\nAnd this is because\nthe scientific worldview\n\n00:26:38.625 --> 00:26:41.690\nis so much more exciting, more poetic,\n\n00:26:41.714 --> 00:26:44.191\nmore filled with sheer wonder\n\n00:26:44.215 --> 00:26:49.251\nthan anything in the poverty-stricken\narsenals of the religious imagination.\n\n00:26:51.195 --> 00:26:55.934\nAs Carl Sagan, another recently\ndead hero, put it,\n\n00:26:55.958 --> 00:27:00.524\n\"How is it that hardly any major\nreligion has looked at science\n\n00:27:00.548 --> 00:27:04.843\nand concluded, 'This\nis better than we thought!\n\n00:27:04.867 --> 00:27:07.339\nThe universe is much bigger\nthan our prophet said,\n\n00:27:07.363 --> 00:27:10.570\ngrander, more subtle, more elegant'?\n\n00:27:10.594 --> 00:27:12.934\nInstead they say, 'No, no, no!\n\n00:27:12.958 --> 00:27:16.592\nMy god is a little god,\nand I want him to stay that way.'\n\n00:27:18.137 --> 00:27:20.267\nA religion, old or new,\n\n00:27:20.291 --> 00:27:22.934\nthat stressed the magnificence\nof the universe\n\n00:27:22.958 --> 00:27:24.934\nas revealed by modern science,\n\n00:27:24.958 --> 00:27:28.622\nmight be able to draw forth\nreserves of reverence and awe\n\n00:27:28.646 --> 00:27:31.583\nhardly tapped by the conventional faiths.\"\n\n00:27:33.178 --> 00:27:36.314\nNow, this is an elite audience,\n\n00:27:36.338 --> 00:27:41.092\nand I would therefore expect\nabout 10 percent of you to be religious.\n\n00:27:42.862 --> 00:27:47.341\nMany of you probably subscribe\nto our polite cultural belief\n\n00:27:47.365 --> 00:27:49.554\nthat we should respect religion.\n\n00:27:50.261 --> 00:27:53.934\nBut I also suspect\nthat a fair number of those\n\n00:27:53.958 --> 00:27:57.315\nsecretly despise religion as much as I do.\n\n00:27:57.727 --> 00:27:58.986\n(Laughter)\n\n00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.863\nIf you're one of them, and of course\nmany of you may not be,\n\n00:28:01.887 --> 00:28:03.195\nbut if you are one of them,\n\n00:28:03.219 --> 00:28:05.287\nI'm asking you to stop being polite,\n\n00:28:05.311 --> 00:28:07.120\ncome out, and say so.\n\n00:28:08.071 --> 00:28:10.070\nAnd if you happen to be rich,\n\n00:28:10.094 --> 00:28:13.676\ngive some thought to ways\nin which you might make a difference.\n\n00:28:14.327 --> 00:28:16.697\nThe religious lobby in this country\n\n00:28:16.721 --> 00:28:22.251\nis massively financed by foundations --\nto say nothing of all the tax benefits --\n\n00:28:22.275 --> 00:28:26.799\nby foundations, such as the Templeton\nFoundation and the Discovery Institute.\n\n00:28:27.473

as well as\nRichard Dawkins' books, I'd do it myself.\n\n00:28:43.412 --> 00:28:49.710\nPeople are always going on about,\n\"How did September the 11th change you?\"\n\n00:28:50.829 -->

Obviously, being a technology magazine, technology trends are something that we write about and need to know about.But also it's part of being any monthly magazine \u2014 you live in the future. And we have a long lead-time. We have to plan issues many months in advance; we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months, nine months down the road. So we're in the forecasting business.We also, like a lot of companies, create a product that's based on technology trends. In this case, ours is about ideas and information, and, if we're lucky, some entertainment. But the concept's quite the same. And so we have to understand not only why tech's important, where it's going, but also, very importantly, when \u2014 the timing is everything.And it's interesting, when you look at the predictions made during the peak of the boom in the 1990s, about e-commerce, or Internet traffic, or broadband adoption, or Internet advertising, they were all right \u2014 they were just wrong in time. Almost every one of those has come true just a few years later. But the difference of a few years on stock-market valuations is obviously extreme. And that's why timing is everything.You've probably seen something like this before. This is the classic Gartner Hype Curve, which talks about kind of the trajectory of a technology's lifespan. And just for fun, we put a bunch of technologies on it, to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak, or whether they were about to crash into the trough of disillusionment, or rise back in the slope of enlightenment, etc. And this is one way to do technology forecasting: get a sense of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn.We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important; we'll typically do it twice. Once, we want to do it first. We want to be the first to do it, for the geeks who appreciate that, we'll catch it right there at the technology-trigger. You can see in 1997, we put Linux on the cover. But then it comes back. And sufficiently big technologies are going to hit the mainstream, and they're going to burst out. And then it's time to do it again. Last year. And that's one way that we try to time technology trends.I'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that I call my \"grand unified theory of predicting the future,\" but it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future. It's based on the presumption, the observation even, that all important technologies go through four stages in their life \u2014 at least one of the four stages, sometimes all four of the stages. And at each one of these stages, can be seen as a collision \u2014 a collision with something else \u2014 for example, a critical price-line that changes both the technology and also changes its effect on the world. It's an inflection point. And these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be, and maybe how you can do something about it.The first is the critical price. The first stage in a technology's advance is that it'll fall below a critical price. After it falls below a critical price, it will tend, if it's successful, to rise above a critical mass, a penetration. Many technologies, at that point, displace another technology, and that's another important point. And then finally, a lot of technologies commoditize. Towards the end of their life, they become nearly free.Each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it; it's an opportunity for the technology to change. And even if you missed, you know, the first boom of Wi-Fi \u2014 you know, Wi-Fi did the critical price, it did the critical mass, but hasn't done displacement yet, and hasn't done free yet \u2014 there's still more opportunity in that.I'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this by telling the story of the DVD, which is a technology which has done all of these. The DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990s and it was quite expensive. But you can see that by 1998, it had fallen below 400 dollars, and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold. And it started to take off. And you can see that the units started to trend up, the hidden inflection point \u2014 it was taking off.The next thing it hit, a year later, was critical mass. In this case, 20 percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household. And what's interesting here is that something else took off along with it: home-theater units. Suddenly you have a DVD in the house; you've got high-quality digital video; you have a reason to have a big-screen television; you have a reason for Dolby 5.1 surround-sound. And maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them, and bring the rest of your entertainment in. What's interesting also is \u2014 note that Netflix was founded in 1999. Reed Hastings is here. He clearly saw that that was a moment, that was an inflection point that he could do something with.The next phase it hit was displacement. You can see around 2001 it finally out-sold the VCR. And here too, you can see the implications in the world at large. Netflix was right \u2014 the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD in a way that the video-rental stores couldn't. Among the DVD's many assets is that it's very small; you can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply. That gave an advantage; that was an implication of the technology's rise that wasn't obvious to everybody.And then finally, DVDs are approaching free. There's a company called Apex, a no-name Chinese firm, who has, several times in the past year, been the number-one DVD seller in America. Their average price, for last year, was 48 dollars. You're aware of the perhaps apocryphal Wal-Mart stampede over the 30-dollar DVD. But they're getting very, very cheap, and look at the interesting implication of it. As they get cheaper, the premium brands, the Sonys and such, are losing market share, and the no-names, the Apexes, are gaining them. They're being commodified, and that's what happens when things go to zero. It's a tough market out there. (Laughter)Now they've introduced these four ways of looking at technology, these four stages of technology's life. I'd like to talk about some other technologies out there, just technologies on our radar \u2014 and I'll use this lens, these four, as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its development. They're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there \u2014 they're just examples of technologies that are in each one of these periods. But I think that the implications of them approaching these crossovers, these intersections, are interesting to think about.Start with gene sequencing. As you probably know, gene sequencing \u2014 in a large part, because it's built on computers \u2014 is falling in price at a kind of a Moore's Law-like level. It is now possible \u2014 will be possible, and if Craig Venter indeed comes today, he may tell you something about this \u2014 to sequence the human genome for 40 million dollars by the end of this year. That's as opposed to billions just a few years ago. You know, our ability to capture the tools of creation is getting closer and closer.What's interesting is that at the same time, the number of genes that we're discovering is rising very quickly. Each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test. There will come a day when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done, very cheaply, if you want to know. You can learn about your own mosaic.Here's another technology that's approaching a critical price. This is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effect of generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails. In January 2000, the price was 10,000 dollars, or 27 dollars a day. The generics came in, first in Brazil and elsewhere, and the effect was just dramatic on pricing. Today it's less than 50 cents a day. And what's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity, if you look at the correlation between these two, as the anti-retrovirals come down, the number of people you can treat goes radically up. And the Clinton Foundation and WHO believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by 2005 \u2014 two million in sub-Saharan Africa. And the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that.Linux is another good example. Now we've switched to critical mass. These are now technologies that are hitting critical mass. If you look here, here's Linux in red, and it's hit 20 percent. Interestingly, it's done a crossover before, but not the crossovers that matter. The crossover that's going to matter is the one with the blue. But you can look and see the direction those lines are going, you can see that at the 20 percent, it's now taken seriously. It's not just for the geeks any more. That is, I imagine, what people in Redmond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about. (Laughter)Another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars. I don't know whether anybody has a Prius 2004, but they're fantastic. And if you look at the trends here, by about 2008 \u2014 and I don't think this is a crazy forecast \u2014 they'll be two percent of auto sales. Two percent isn't 20 percent, but in the car business, which is slow moving, that's huge; that's arrival. At two percent, you start seeing them on the roads everywhere.And what's interesting about the hybrids taking off is you've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry. It's the first radical change in automobile technology in 100 years. And once you have electric motors, you can do anything: you can change the structure of the car in any way you want. You can have regenerative braking; you can have drive-by-wire; you can have replaceable body shapes \u2014 it's a little thing that starts with a hybrid, but it can lead to a whole new era of the car.Voice Over IP is something you may have heard something about. Again, it's kind of coming out of nowhere; it's a little hard to use right now. There's a company created by the Kazaa founders called Skype. Look at these numbers. They launched it in August of last year; they already have nearly four million registered users \u2014 that's critical mass. And the same thing's happening on the carrier side. You're looking at IP taking over from some of the traditional telecom standards. This is a tipping point \u2014 if Malcolm's here, forgive me \u2014 and it's going to change the economics, and the speed, and the players in the industry. It's going to look a little bit like that.And finally, free. Free is really, really interesting. Free is something that comes with digital, because the reproduction costs are essentially free. It comes with IP, because it's such an efficient protocol. It comes with fiber optics, because there's so much bandwidth. Free is really, you know, the gift of Silicon Valley to the world. It's an economic force; it's a technical force. It's a deflationary force, if not handled right. It is abundance, as opposed to scarcity. Free is probably the most interesting thing.And here you have just the number of songs that can be stored on a hard drive. You know, there could be a film's [unclear] there, but it's basically, every song ever made could be stored on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008. It takes that entire element, the physical element, of songs off the table. And you've seen the numbers. I mean, you know, the music industry is imploding in front of our very eyes, and Hollywood's worried as well. They're facing a force that they haven't faced before. And their response is draconian, and not necessarily the one that's going to get them out of this.And finally, I'll give you one last example of free \u2014 perhaps the most powerful of all. I mentioned fiber optics \u2014 their abundance tends to make things free. This is the price of a phone call to India per minute. And what's interesting is that it was just 1990 when it was more than two dollars a minute. India had, still has, a regulated phone system and so did we. It was surprisingly non-innovative, moved very slowly, but then there was just so much fiber out there, you couldn't hold back, and look how quickly the price fell. It's seven cents a minute, in many cases.And the consequence of cheap phone calling, free phone calling, to India, is the pissed-off programmer, is the outsourcing. It is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization and one of the most powerful economic tools that we're seeing in our world today. The force of India, and then China, and any other country that can contact our markets and will work with our companies \u2014 because the communications are free \u2014 is just beginning to be felt. And I think that's probably one of the most important technology trends that we're looking at today.

And we have a long lead-time.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nWe have to plan issues many months in advance;\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nwe have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months,\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nnine months down the road. So we're in the forecasting business.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nWe also, like a lot of companies, create a product\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nthat's based on technology trends.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nIn this case, ours is about ideas and information, and, if we're lucky,\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nsome entertainment. But the concept's quite the same.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nAnd so we have to understand\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nnot only why tech's important, where it's going,\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nbut also, very importantly, when -- the timing is everything.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nAnd it's interesting, when you look at the predictions made\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nduring the peak of the boom in the 1990s, about e-commerce,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nor Internet traffic, or broadband adoption, or Internet advertising,\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nthey were all right -- they were just wrong in time.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nAlmost every one of those has come true just a few years later.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nBut the difference of a few years on stock-market valuations\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nis obviously extreme. And that's why timing is everything.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nYou've probably seen something like this before.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nThis is the classic Gartner Hype Curve, which talks about\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nkind of the trajectory of a technology's lifespan.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nAnd just for fun, we put a bunch of technologies on it,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nto show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nor whether they were about to crash\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\ninto the trough of disillusionment,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nor rise back in the slope of enlightenment, etc.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nAnd this is one way to do technology forecasting: get a sense\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nof where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nWe tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important;\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nwe'll typically do it twice.

Last year.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nAnd that's one way that we try to time technology trends.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nI'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nthat I call my \"grand unified theory of predicting the future,\"\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nbut it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nIt's based on the presumption, the observation even,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nthat all important technologies go through four stages in their life --\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nat least one of the four stages, sometimes all four of the stages.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nAnd at each one of these stages, can be seen as a collision --\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\na collision with something else --\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nfor example, a critical price-line that changes both the technology\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nand also changes its effect on the world. It's an inflection point.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd these are the inflection points that tell you\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nwhat the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nand maybe how you can do something about it.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nThe first is the critical price.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nThe first stage in a technology's advance\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nis that it'll fall below a critical price.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nAfter it falls below a critical price, it will tend,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nif it's successful, to rise above a critical mass, a penetration.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nMany technologies, at that point, displace another technology,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nand that's another important point.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nAnd then finally, a lot of technologies commoditize.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nTowards the end of their life, they become nearly free.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nEach one of those is an opportunity to do something about it;\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nit's an opportunity for the technology to change.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nAnd even if you missed, you know, the first boom of Wi-Fi --\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nyou know, Wi-Fi did the critical price, it did the critical mass,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nbut hasn't done displacement yet, and hasn't done free yet --\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nthere's still more opportunity in that.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nI'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nby telling the story of the DVD,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nwhich is a technology which has done all of these.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nThe DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990s\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nand it was quite expensive. But you can see that by 1998,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nit had fallen below 400 dollars, and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nAnd it started to take off. And you can see that the units\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nstarted to trend up, the hidden inflection point -- it was taking off.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nThe next thing it hit, a year later, was critical mass. In this case,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:58.958\n20 percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nAnd what's interesting here\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nis that something else took off along with it: home-theater units.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nSuddenly you have a DVD in the house;\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nyou've got high-quality digital video;\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nyou have a reason to have a big-screen television;\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nyou have a reason for Dolby 5.1 surround-sound.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAnd maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nand bring the rest of your entertainment in.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nWhat's interesting also is -- note that Netflix was founded in 1999.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nReed Hastings is here. He clearly saw that that was a moment,\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nthat was an inflection point that he could do something with.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nThe next phase it hit was displacement.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nYou can see around 2001 it finally out-sold the VCR.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nAnd here too, you can see the implications in the world at large.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nNetflix was right -- the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nin a way that the video-rental stores couldn't.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nAmong the DVD's many assets is that it's very small;\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nyou can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nThat gave an advantage; that was an implication\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nof the technology's rise that wasn't obvious to everybody.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nAnd then finally, DVDs are approaching free.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nThere's a company called Apex, a no-name Chinese firm,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nwho has, several times in the past year, been the number-one\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nDVD seller in America. Their average price, for last year, was 48 dollars.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nYou're aware of the\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nperhaps apocryphal Wal-Mart stampede\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nover the 30-dollar DVD.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nBut they're getting very, very cheap,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nand look at the interesting implication of it. As they get cheaper,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nthe premium brands, the Sonys and such, are losing market share,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nand the no-names, the Apexes, are gaining them.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nThey're being commodified, and that's what happens\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nwhen things go to zero. It's a tough market out there.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nNow they've introduced these four ways of looking at technology,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nthese four stages of technology's life.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nI'd like to talk about some other technologies out there,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\njust technologies on our radar -- and I'll use this lens,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nthese four, as a way to kind of tell you\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nwhere each one of those technologies is in its development.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nThey're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there --\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nthey're just examples of technologies\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nthat are in each one of these periods.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nBut I think that the implications of them approaching\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nthese crossovers, these intersections, are interesting to think about.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nStart with gene sequencing.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nAs you probably know, gene sequencing -- in a large part,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nbecause it's built on computers -- is falling in price\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nat a kind of a Moore's Law-like level.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nIt is now possible -- will be possible,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nand if Craig Venter indeed comes today,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nhe may tell you something about this --\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nto sequence the human genome for 40 million dollars by the end of this year.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nThat's as opposed to billions just a few years ago.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nYou know, our ability to capture the tools of creation\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nis getting closer and closer.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nWhat's interesting is that at the same time, the number of genes\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nthat we're discovering is rising very quickly.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nEach one of these genes has potential diagnostic test.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nThere will come a day\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nwhen you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done, very cheaply,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nif you want to know. You can learn about your own mosaic.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nHere's another technology that's approaching a critical price.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nThis is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effect\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nof generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nIn January 2000, the price was 10,000 dollars, or 27 dollars a day.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nThe generics came in, first in Brazil and elsewhere,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nand the effect was just dramatic on pricing.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nToday it's less than 50 cents a day.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nAnd what's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nif you look at the correlation between these two,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nas the anti-retrovirals come down, the number of people you can treat\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:03.958\ngoes radically up. And the Clinton Foundation and WHO\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nbelieve that they can treat three million people worldwide by 2005 --\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\ntwo million in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nAnd the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nLinux is another good example.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nNow we've switched to critical mass.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nThese are now technologies that are hitting critical mass.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nIf you look here, here's Linux in red, and it's hit 20 percent.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nInterestingly, it's done a crossover before,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nbut not the crossovers that matter.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nThe crossover that's going to matter is the one with the blue.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nBut you can look and see the direction those lines are going,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nyou can see that at the 20 percent, it's now taken seriously.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nIt's not just for the geeks any more.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nThat is, I imagine, what people in Redmond\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nwake up in the middle of the night thinking about.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nAnother technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nI don't know whether anybody has a Prius 2004, but they're fantastic.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nAnd if you look at the trends here, by about 2008 --\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nand I don't think this is a crazy forecast --\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nthey'll be two percent of auto sales.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nTwo percent isn't 20 percent, but in the car business,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nwhich is slow moving, that's huge; that's arrival.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nAt two percent, you start seeing them on the roads everywhere.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nAnd what's interesting about the hybrids taking off\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nis you've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nIt's the first radical change in automobile technology in 100 years.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nAnd once you have electric motors, you can do anything:\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nyou can change the structure of the car in any way you want.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nYou can have regenerative braking; you can have drive-by-wire;\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nyou can have replaceable body shapes --\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nit's a little thing that starts with a hybrid,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nbut it can lead to a whole new era of the car.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nVoice Over IP is something you may have heard something about.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nAgain, it's kind of coming out of nowhere;\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nit's a little hard to use right now.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nThere's a company created by the Kazaa founders called Skype.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nLook at these numbers. They launched it in August of last year;\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nthey already have nearly four million registered users --\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nthat's critical mass.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nAnd the same thing's happening on the carrier side.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nYou're looking at IP taking over from some of the traditional\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:13.958\ntelecom standards. This is a tipping point --\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nif Malcolm's here, forgive me -- and it's going to change the economics,\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nand the speed, and the players in the industry.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nIt's going to look a little bit like that.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nAnd finally, free. Free is really, really interesting.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nFree is something that comes with digital, because\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nthe reproduction costs are essentially free. It comes with IP,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nbecause it's such an efficient protocol. It comes with fiber optics,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nbecause there's so much bandwidth.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nFree is really, you know, the gift of Silicon Valley to the world.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nIt's an economic force; it's a technical force.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nIt's a deflationary force, if not handled right.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nIt is abundance, as opposed to scarcity.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nFree is probably the most interesting thing.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nAnd here you have just the number of songs\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nthat can be stored on a hard drive.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nYou know, there could be a film's [unclear] there,\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nbut it's basically, every song ever made could be stored\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:25.958\non 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008. It takes that entire element,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nthe physical element, of songs off the table.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nAnd you've seen the numbers.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nI mean, you know, the music industry is imploding\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nin front of our very eyes, and Hollywood's worried as well.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nThey're facing a force that they haven't faced before.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nAnd their response is draconian, and not necessarily\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nthe one that's going to get them out of this.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nAnd finally, I'll give you one last example of free --\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nperhaps the most powerful of all. I mentioned fiber optics --\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\ntheir abundance tends to make things free.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nThis is the price of a phone call to India per minute.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nAnd what's interesting is that it was just 1990\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nwhen it was more than two dollars a minute.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nIndia had, still has, a regulated phone system and so did we.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nIt was surprisingly non-innovative, moved very slowly,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nbut then there was just so much fiber out there,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nyou couldn't hold back, and look how quickly the price fell.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nIt's seven cents a minute, in many cases.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nAnd the consequence of cheap phone calling, free phone calling,\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nto India, is the pissed-off programmer, is the outsourcing.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nIt is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nand one of the most powerful economic tools\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nthat we're seeing in our world today.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nThe force of India, and then China, and any other country\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nthat can contact our markets\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nand will work with our companies -- because the communications are free --\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nis just beginning to be felt.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nAnd I think that's probably one\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nof the most important technology trends that we're looking at today.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nThank you."}]

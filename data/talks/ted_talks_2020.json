It's an extremely famous map among cartography nerds, because down here at the bottom of the Catskill Mountains, there is a little town called Roscoe \u2014 actually, this will go easier if I just put it up here \u2014 There's Roscoe, and then right above Roscoe is Rockland, New York, and then right above that is the tiny town of Agloe, New York.Agloe, New York, is very famous to cartographers, because it's a paper town. It's also known as a copyright trap. Mapmakers \u2014 because my map of New York and your map of New York are going to look very similar, on account of the shape of New York \u2014 often, mapmakers will insert fake places onto their maps, in order to protect their copyright. Because then, if my fake place shows up on your map, I can be well and truly sure that you have robbed me. Agloe is a scrabblization of the initials of the two guys who made this map, Ernest Alpers and Otto [G.] Lindberg, and they released this map in 1937. Decades later, Rand McNally releases a map with Agloe, New York, on it, at the same exact intersection of two dirt roads in the middle of nowhere. Well, you can imagine the delight over at General Drafting. They immediately call Rand McNally, and they say, \"We've caught you! We made Agloe, New York, up. It is a fake place. It's a paper town. We're going to sue your pants off!\" And Rand McNally says, \"No, no, no, no, Agloe is real.\" Because people kept going to that intersection of two dirt roads \u2014(Laughter)in the middle of nowhere, expecting there to be a place called Agloe \u2014 someone built a place called Agloe, New York.(Laughter)It had a gas station, a general store, two houses at its peak.(Laughter)And this is of course a completely irresistible metaphor to a novelist, because we would all like to believe that the stuff that we write down on paper can change the actual world in which we're actually living, which is why my third book is called \"Paper Towns\".But what interests me ultimately more than the medium in which this happened, is the phenomenon itself. It's easy enough to say that the world shapes our maps of the world, right? Like the overall shape of the world is obviously going to affect our maps. But what I find a lot more interesting is the way that the manner in which we map the world changes the world. Because the world would truly be a different place if North were down. And the world would be a truly different place if Alaska and Russia weren't on opposite sides of the map. And the world would be a different place if we projected Europe to show it in its actual size. The world is changed by our maps of the world. The way that we choose \u2014 sort of, our personal cartographic enterprise, also shapes the map of our lives, and that in turn shapes our lives.I believe that what we map changes the life we lead. And I don't mean that in some, like, secret-y Oprah's Angels network, like, you-can-think-your-way- out-of-cancer sense. But I do believe that while maps don't show you where you will go in your life, they show you where you might go. You very rarely go to a place that isn't on your personal map.So I was a really terrible student when I was a kid. My GPA was consistently in the low 2s. And I think the reason that I was such a terrible student is that I felt like education was just a series of hurdles that had been erected before me, and I had to jump over in order to achieve adulthood. And I didn't really want to jump over these hurdles, because they seemed completely arbitrary, so I often wouldn't, and then people would threaten me, you know, they'd threaten me with this \"going on [my] permanent record,\" or \"You'll never get a good job.\" I didn't want a good job! As far as I could tell at eleven or twelve years old, like, people with good jobs woke up very early in the morning,(Laughter)and the men who had good jobs, one of the first things they did was tie a strangulation item of clothing around their necks. They literally put nooses on themselves, and then they went off to their jobs, whatever they were. That's not a recipe for a happy life. These people \u2014 in my, symbol-obsessed, twelve year-old imagination \u2014 these people who are strangling themselves as one of the first things they do each morning, they can't possibly be happy. Why would I want to jump over all of these hurdles and have that be the end? That's a terrible end!And then, when I was in tenth grade, I went to this school, Indian Springs School, a small boarding school, outside of Birmingham, Alabama. And all at once I became a learner. And I became a learner, because I found myself in a community of learners. I found myself surrounded by people who celebrated intellectualism and engagement, and who thought that my ironic oh-so-cool disengagement wasn't clever, or funny, but, like, it was a simple and unspectacular response to very complicated and compelling problems. And so I started to learn, because learning was cool. I learned that some infinite sets are bigger than other infinite sets, and I learned that iambic pentameter is and why it sounds so good to human ears. I learned that the Civil War was a nationalizing conflict, I learned some physics, I learned that correlation shouldn't be confused with causation \u2014 all of these things, by the way, enriched my life on a literally daily basis. And it's true that I don't use most of them for my \"job,\" but that's not what it's about for me. It's about cartography.What is the process of cartography? It's, you know, sailing upon some land, and thinking, \"I think I'll draw that bit of land,\" and then wondering, \"Maybe there's some more land to draw.\" And that's when learning really began for me. It's true that I had teachers that didn't give up on me, and I was very fortunate to have those teachers, because I often gave them cause to think there was no reason to invest in me. But a lot of the learning that I did in high school wasn't about what happened inside the classroom, it was about what happened outside of the classroom. For instance, I can tell you that \"There's a certain Slant of light, Winter Afternoons \u2014 That oppresses, like the Heft Of Cathedral Tunes \u2014\" not because I memorized Emily Dickinson in school when I was in high school, but because there was a girl when I was in high school, and her name was Amanda, and I had a crush on her, and she liked Emily Dickinson poetry. The reason I can tell you what opportunity cost is, is because one day when I was playing Super Mario Kart on my couch, my friend Emmet walked in, and he said, \"How long have you been playing Super Mario Kart?\" And I said, \"I don't know, like, six hours?\" and he said, \"Do you realize that if you'd worked at Baskin-Robbins those six hours, you could have made 30 dollars, so in some ways, you just paid thirty dollars to play Super Mario Kart.\" And I was, like, \"I'll take that deal.\"(Laughter)But I learned what opportunity cost is.And along the way, the map of my life got better. It got bigger; it contained more places. There were more things that might happen, more futures I might have. It wasn't a formal, organized learning process, and I'm happy to admit that. It was spotty, it was inconsistent, there was a lot I didn't know. I might know, you know, Cantor's idea that some infinite sets are larger than other infinite sets, but I didn't really understand the calculus behind that idea. I might know the idea of opportunity cost, but I didn't know the law of diminishing returns. But the great thing about imagining learning as cartography, instead of imagining it as arbitrary hurdles that you have to jump over, is that you see a bit of coastline, and that makes you want to see more. And so now I do know at least some of the calculus that underlies all of that stuff.So, I had one learning community in high school, then I went to another for college, and then I went to another, when I started working at a magazine called \"Booklist,\" where I was an assistant, surrounded by astonishingly well-read people. And then I wrote a book. And like all authors dream of doing, I promptly quit my job.(Laughter)And for the first time since high school, I found myself without a learning community, and it was miserable. I hated it. I read many, many books during this two-year period. I read books about Stalin, and books about how the Uzbek people came to identify as Muslims, and I read books about how to make atomic bombs, but it just felt like I was creating my own hurdles, and then jumping over them myself, instead of feeling the excitement of being part of a community of learners, a community of people who are engaged together in the cartographic enterprise of trying to better understand and map the world around us.And then, in 2006, I met that guy. His name is Ze Frank. I didn't actually meet him, just on the Internet. Ze Frank was running, at the time, a show called \"The Show with Ze Frank,\" and I discovered the show, and that was my way back into being a community learner again. Here's Ze talking about Las Vegas:(Video) Ze Frank: Las Vegas was built in the middle of a huge, hot desert. Almost everything here was brought from somewhere else \u2014 the sort of rocks, the trees, the waterfalls. These fish are almost as out of place as my pig that flew. Contrasted to the scorching desert that surrounds this place, so are these people. Things from all over the world have been rebuilt here, away from their histories, and away from the people that experience them differently. Sometimes improvements were made \u2014 even the Sphinx got a nose job. Here, there's no reason to feel like you're missing anything. This New York means the same to me as it does to everyone else. Everything is out of context, and that means context allows for everything: Self Parking, Events Center, Shark Reef. This fabrication of place could be one of the world's greatest achievements, because no one belongs here; everyone does. As I walked around this morning, I noticed most of the buildings were huge mirrors reflecting the sun back into the desert. But unlike most mirrors, which present you with an outside view of yourself embedded in a place, these mirrors come back empty.John Green: Makes me nostalgic for the days when you could see the pixels in online video.(Laughter)Ze isn't just a great public intellectual, he's also a brilliant community builder, and the community of people that built up around these videos was in many ways a community of learners. So we played Ze Frank at chess collaboratively, and we beat him. We organized ourselves to take a young man on a road trip across the United States. We turned the Earth into a sandwich, by having one person hold a piece of bread at one point on the Earth, and on the exact opposite point of the Earth, have another person holding a piece of bread. I realize that these are silly ideas, but they are also \"learny\" ideas, and that was what was so exciting to me, and if you go online, you can find communities like this all over the place. Follow the calculus tag on Tumblr, and yes, you will see people complaining about calculus, but you'll also see people re-blogging those complaints, making the argument that calculus is interesting and beautiful, and here's a way in to thinking about the problem that you find unsolvable. You can go to places like Reddit, and find sub-Reddits, like \"Ask a Historian\" or \"Ask Science,\" where you can ask people who are in these fields a wide range of questions, from very serious ones to very silly ones. But to me, the most interesting communities of learners that are growing up on the Internet right now are on YouTube, and admittedly, I am biased. But I think in a lot of ways, the YouTube page resembles a classroom. Look for instance at \"Minute Physics,\" a guy who's teaching the world about physics:(Video) Let's cut to the chase. As of July 4, 2012, the Higgs boson is the last fundamental piece of the standard model of particle physics to be discovered experimentally. But, you might ask, why was the Higgs boson included in the standard model, alongside well-known particles like electrons and photons and quarks, if it hadn't been discovered back then in the 1970s? Good question. There are two main reasons. First, just like the electron is an excitation in the electron field, the Higgs boson is simply a particle which is an excitation of the everywhere-permeating Higgs field. The Higgs field in turn plays an integral role in our model for the weak nuclear force. In particular, the Higgs field helps explain why it's so weak. We'll talk more about this in a later video, but even though weak nuclear theory was confirmed in the 1980s, in the equations, the Higgs field is so inextricably jumbled with the weak force, that until now we've been unable to confirm its actual and independent existence.JG: Or here's a video that I made as part of my show \"Crash Course,\" talking about World War I:(Video) The immediate cause was of course the assassination in Sarajevo of the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand, on June 28, 1914, by a Bosnian-Serb nationalist named Gavrilo Princip. Quick aside: It's worth noting that the first big war of the twentieth century began with an act of terrorism. So Franz Ferdinand wasn't particularly well-liked by his uncle, the emperor Franz Joseph \u2014 now that is a mustache! But even so, the assassination led Austria to issue an ultimatum to Serbia, whereupon Serbia accepted some, but not all, of Austria's demands, leading Austria to declare war against Serbia. And then Russia, due to its alliance with the Serbs, mobilized its army. Germany, because it had an alliance with Austria, told Russia to stop mobilizing, which Russia failed to do, so then Germany mobilized its own army, declared war on Russia, cemented an alliance with the Ottomans, and then declared war on France, because, you know, France.(Laughter)And it's not just physics and world history that people are choosing to learn through YouTube. Here's a video about abstract mathematics.(Video) So you're me, and you're in math class yet again, because they make you go every single day. And you're learning about, I don't know, the sums of infinite series. That's a high school topic, right? Which is odd, because it's a cool topic, but they somehow manage to ruin it anyway. So I guess that's why they allow infinite series in the curriculum. So, in a quite understandable need for distraction, you're doodling and thinking more about what the plural of \"series\" should be than about the topic at hand: \"serieses,\" \"seriese,\" \"seriesen,\" and \"serii?\" Or is it that the singular should be changed: one \"serie,\" or \"serum,\" just like the singular of \"sheep\" should be \"shoop.\" But the whole concept of things like 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 and so on approaches one, is useful if, say, you want to draw a line of elephants, each holding the tail of the next one: normal elephant, young elephant, baby elephant, dog-sized elephant, puppy-sized elephant, all the way down to Mr. Tusks and beyond. Which is at least a tiny bit awesome, because you can get an infinite number of elephants in a line, and still have it fit across a single notebook page.JG: And lastly, here's Destin, from \"Smarter Every Day,\" talking about the conservation of angular momentum, and, since it's YouTube, cats:(Video) Hey, it's me, Destin. Welcome back to \"Smarter Every Day.\" So you've probably observed that cats almost always land on their feet. Today's question is: why? Like most simple questions, there's a very complex answer. For instance, let me reword this question: How does a cat go from feet-up to feet-down in a falling reference frame, without violating the conservation of angular momentum?(Laughter)JG: So, here's something all four of these videos have in common: They all have more than half a million views on YouTube. And those are people watching not in classrooms, but because they are part of the communities of learning that are being set up by these channels. And I said earlier that YouTube is like a classroom to me, and in many ways it is, because here is the instructor \u2014 it's like the old-fashioned classroom: here's the instructor, and then beneath the instructor are the students, and they're all having a conversation. And I know that YouTube comments have a very bad reputation in the world of the Internet, but in fact, if you go on comments for these channels, what you'll find is people engaging the subject matter, asking difficult, complicated questions that are about the subject matter, and then other people answering those questions. And because the YouTube page is set up so that the page in which I'm talking to you is on the exact \u2014 the place where I'm talking to you is on the exact same page as your comments, you are participating in a live and real and active way in the conversation. And because I'm in comments usually, I get to participate with you. And you find this whether it's world history, or mathematics, or science, or whatever it is.You also see young people using the tools and the sort of genres of the Internet in order to create places for intellectual engagement, instead of the ironic detachment that maybe most of us associate with memes and other Internet conventions \u2014 you know, \"Got bored. Invented calculus.\" Or, here's Honey Boo Boo criticizing industrial capitalism:[\"Liberal capitalism is not at all the Good of humanity. Quite the contrary; it is the vehicle of savage, destructive nihilism.\"]In case you can't see what she says ... yeah.I really believe that these spaces, these communities, have become for a new generation of learners, the kind of communities, the kind of cartographic communities that I had when I was in high school, and then again when I was in college. And as an adult, re-finding these communities has re-introduced me to a community of learners, and has encouraged me to continue to be a learner even in my adulthood, so that I no longer feel like learning is something reserved for the young. Vi Hart and \"Minute Physics\" introduced me to all kinds of things that I didn't know before. And I know that we all hearken back to the days of the Parisian salon in the Enlightenment, or to the Algonquin Round Table, and wish, \"Oh, I wish I could have been a part of that, I wish I could have laughed at Dorothy Parker's jokes.\" But I'm here to tell you that these places exist, they still exist. They exist in corners of the Internet, where old men fear to tread.(Laughter)And I truly, truly believe that when we invented Agloe, New York, in the 1960s, when we made Agloe real, we were just getting started.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2305, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.148 --> 00:00:14.809\nThis is a map of New York State\n\n00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:18.351\nthat was made in 1937\nby the General Drafting Company.\n\n00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:21.872\nIt's an extremely famous map\namong cartography nerds,\n\n00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:24.617\nbecause down here at the bottom\nof the Catskill Mountains,\n\n00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:26.520\nthere is a little town called Roscoe --\n\n00:00:26.544 --> 00:00:29.242\nactually, this will go easier\nif I just put it up here --\n\n00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:32.796\nThere's Roscoe, and then right\nabove Roscoe is Rockland, New York,\n\n00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.633\nand then right above that\nis the tiny town of Agloe, New York.\n\n00:00:36.657 --> 00:00:39.716\nAgloe, New York, is very famous\nto cartographers,\n\n00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.016\nbecause it's a paper town.\n\n00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.262\nIt's also known as a copyright trap.\n\n00:00:44.286 --> 00:00:47.640\nMapmakers -- because my map of New York\nand your map of New York\n\n00:00:47.664 --> 00:00:51.330\nare going to look very similar,\non account of the shape of New York --\n\n00:00:51.354 --> 00:00:56.127\noften, mapmakers will insert\nfake places onto their maps,\n\n00:00:56.151 --> 00:00:57.913\nin order to protect their copyright.\n\n00:00:57.937 --> 00:01:00.825\nBecause then, if my fake place\nshows up on your map,\n\n00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:04.504\nI can be well and truly sure\nthat you have robbed me.\n\n00:01:04.528 --> 00:01:09.169\nAgloe is a scrabblization of the initials\nof the two guys who made this map,\n\n00:01:09.193 --> 00:01:12.114\nErnest Alpers and Otto [G.] Lindberg,\n\n00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:15.414\nand they released this map in 1937.\n\n00:01:15.438 --> 00:01:18.757\nDecades later, Rand McNally releases a map\n\n00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:22.805\nwith Agloe, New York, on it,\nat the same exact intersection\n\n00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.097\nof two dirt roads\nin the middle of nowhere.\n\n00:01:26.163 --> 00:01:29.424\nWell, you can imagine the delight\nover at General Drafting.\n\n00:01:29.448 --> 00:01:32.660\nThey immediately call\nRand McNally, and they say,\n\n00:01:32.684 --> 00:01:36.278\n\"We've caught you!\nWe made Agloe, New York, up.\n\n00:01:36.302 --> 00:01:38.356\nIt is a fake place.

--> 00:01:51.118\nBecause people kept going\nto that intersection of two dirt roads --\n\n00:01:51.142 --> 00:01:52.166\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.686\nin the middle of nowhere,

completely\nirresistible metaphor to a novelist,\n\n00:02:12.056 --> 00:02:16.667\nbecause we would all like to believe\nthat the stuff that we write down on paper\n\n00:02:16.691 --> 00:02:19.483\ncan change the actual world\nin which we're actually living,\n\n00:02:19.507 --> 00:02:21.896\nwhich is why my third book\nis called \"Paper Towns\".\n\n00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.459\nBut what interests me ultimately more\nthan the medium in which this happened,\n\n00:02:26.483 --> 00:02:28.864\nis the phenomenon itself.\n\n00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:33.556\nIt's easy enough to say that the world\nshapes our maps of the world, right?\n\n00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.007\nLike the overall shape of the world\nis obviously going to affect our maps.\n\n00:02:38.461 -->

00:03:20.703\nI believe that what we map\nchanges the life we lead.\n\n00:03:20.727 --> 00:03:25.141\nAnd I don't mean that in some, like,\nsecret-y Oprah's Angels network, like,\n\n00:03:25.165 --> 00:03:28.135\nyou-can-think-your-way-\nout-of-cancer sense.\n\n00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:34.692\nBut I do believe that while maps don't\nshow you where you will go in your life,\n\n00:03:34.716 --> 00:03:36.707\nthey show you where you might go.\n\n00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:41.204\nYou very rarely go to a place\nthat isn't on your personal map.\n\n00:03:41.811 --> 00:03:44.926\nSo I was a really terrible student\nwhen I was a kid.\n\n00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.622\nMy GPA was consistently in the low 2s.\n\n00:03:48.493 --> 00:03:51.254\nAnd I think the reason that I was\nsuch a terrible student\n\n00:03:51.278 --> 00:03:54.433\nis that I felt like education\nwas just a series of hurdles\n\n00:03:54.457 --> 00:03:56.614\nthat had been erected before me,\n\n00:03:56.638 --> 00:04:00.265\nand I had to jump over\nin order to achieve adulthood.\n\n00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:02.773\nAnd I didn't really want\nto jump over these hurdles,\n\n00:04:02.797 --> 00:04:05.731\nbecause they seemed completely\narbitrary, so I often wouldn't,\n\n00:04:05.755 --> 00:04:07.832\nand then people would\nthreaten me, you know,\n\n00:04:07.856 --> 00:04:10.785\nthey'd threaten me with this\n\"going on [my] permanent record,\"\n\n00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:13.018\nor \"You'll never get a good job.\"\n\n00:04:13.042 --> 00:04:14.521\nI didn't want a good job!\n\n00:04:14.961 --> 00:04:17.557\nAs far as I could tell at eleven\nor twelve years old,\n\n00:04:17.581 --> 00:04:20.733\nlike, people with good jobs woke up\nvery early in the morning,\n\n00:04:20.757 --> 00:04:22.762\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:22.786 --> 00:04:27.358\nand the men who had good jobs,\none of the first things they did\n\n00:04:27.382 --> 00:04:31.305\nwas tie a strangulation item\nof clothing around their necks.\n\n00:04:31.882 --> 00:04:33.930\nThey literally put nooses on themselves,\n\n00:04:33.954 --> 00:04:36.680\nand then they went off to their jobs,\nwhatever they were.\n\n00:04:37.413 --> 00:04:39.443\nThat's not a recipe for a happy life.\n\n00:04:39.876 --> 00:04:43.795\nThese people -- in my, symbol-obsessed,\ntwelve year-old imagination --\n\n00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:46.378\nthese people who are strangling themselves\n\n00:04:46.402 --> 00:04:48.758\nas one of the first things\nthey do each morning,\n\n00:04:48.782 --> 00:04:50.542\nthey can't possibly be happy.\n\n00:04:50.566 --> 00:04:52.978\nWhy would I want to jump\nover all of these hurdles\n\n00:04:53.002 --> 00:04:55.002\nand have that be the end?\n\n00:04:55.026 --> 00:04:56.193\nThat's a terrible end!\n\n00:04:57.412 --> 00:05:00.590\nAnd then, when I was in tenth grade,\nI went to this school,\n\n00:05:00.614 --> 00:05:03.376\nIndian Springs School,\na small boarding school,\n\n00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.210\noutside of Birmingham, Alabama.\n\n00:05:05.234 --> 00:05:08.749\nAnd all at once I became a learner.\n\n00:05:08.773 --> 00:05:10.969\nAnd I became a learner,\nbecause I found myself\n\n00:05:10.993 --> 00:05:13.017\nin a community of learners.\n\n00:05:13.041 --> 00:05:14.804\nI found myself surrounded by people\n\n00:05:14.828 --> 00:05:18.058\nwho celebrated intellectualism\nand engagement,\n\n00:05:18.082 --> 00:05:22.255\nand who thought that my ironic\noh-so-cool disengagement\n\n00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:24.133\nwasn't clever, or funny,\n\n00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:27.919\nbut, like, it was a simple\nand unspectacular response\n\n00:05:27.943 --> 00:05:30.217\nto very complicated\nand compelling problems.\n\n00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.143\nAnd so I started to learn,\nbecause learning was cool.\n\n00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:36.470\nI learned that some infinite sets\nare bigger than other infinite sets,\n\n00:05:36.494 --> 00:05:40.588\nand I learned that iambic pentameter is\nand why it sounds so good to human ears.\n\n00:05:40.612 --> 00:05:44.054\nI learned that the Civil War\nwas a nationalizing conflict,\n\n00:05:44.078 --> 00:05:45.245\nI learned some physics,\n\n00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:48.425\nI learned that correlation shouldn't be\nconfused with causation --\n\n00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:50.242\nall of these things, by the way,\n\n00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:54.518\nenriched my life\non a literally daily basis.\n\n00:05:54.542 --> 00:05:58.128\nAnd it's true that I don't use\nmost of them for my \"job,\"\n\n00:05:58.152 --> 00:06:00.066\nbut that's not what it's about for me.\n\n00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.041\nIt's about cartography.\n\n00:06:02.065 --> 00:06:04.326\nWhat is the process of cartography?\n\n00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.511\nIt's, you know, sailing\nupon some land, and thinking,\n\n00:06:07.535 --> 00:06:09.636\n\"I think I'll draw that bit of land,\"\n\n00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.983\nand then wondering, \"Maybe there's\nsome more land to draw.\"\n\n00:06:13.007 --> 00:06:15.214\nAnd that's when learning\nreally began for me.\n\n00:06:15.238 --> 00:06:17.874\nIt's true that I had teachers\nthat didn't give up on me,\n\n00:06:17.898 --> 00:06:20.216\nand I was very fortunate\nto have those teachers,\n\n00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.414\nbecause I often gave them cause to think\nthere was no reason to invest in me.\n\n00:06:24.882 --> 00:06:27.988\nBut a lot of the learning\nthat I did in high school\n\n00:06:28.012 --> 00:06:31.191\nwasn't about what happened\ninside the classroom,\n\n00:06:31.215 --> 00:06:33.673\nit was about what happened\noutside of the classroom.\n\n00:06:33.697 --> 00:06:35.054\nFor instance, I can tell you\n\n00:06:35.078 --> 00:06:37.911\nthat \"There's a certain Slant of light,\nWinter Afternoons --\n\n00:06:37.935 --> 00:06:40.388\nThat oppresses, like the Heft\nOf Cathedral Tunes --\"\n\n00:06:40.412 --> 00:06:43.728\nnot because I memorized\nEmily Dickinson in school\n\n00:06:43.752 --> 00:06:45.028\nwhen I was in high school,\n\n00:06:45.052 --> 00:06:47.647\nbut because there was a girl\nwhen I was in high school,\n\n00:06:47.671 --> 00:06:50.158\nand her name was Amanda,\nand I had a crush on her,\n\n00:06:50.182 --> 00:06:52.556\nand she liked Emily Dickinson poetry.\n\n00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.264\nThe reason I can tell you\nwhat opportunity cost is,\n\n00:06:55.288 --> 00:06:58.940\nis because one day when I was playing\nSuper Mario Kart on my couch,\n\n00:06:58.964 --> 00:07:00.836\nmy friend Emmet walked in, and he said,\n\n00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.218\n\"How long have you been playing\nSuper Mario Kart?\"\n\n00:07:03.242 --> 00:07:06.712\nAnd I said, \"I don't know,\nlike, six hours?\" and he said,\n\n00:07:06.736 --> 00:07:10.104\n\"Do you realize that if you'd worked\nat Baskin-Robbins those six hours,\n\n00:07:10.128 --> 00:07:12.386\nyou could have made 30 dollars,\nso in some ways,\n\n00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.330\nyou just paid thirty dollars\nto play Super Mario Kart.\"\n\n00:07:15.354 --> 00:07:17.612\nAnd I was, like, \"I'll take that deal.\"\n\n00:07:17.636 --> 00:07:19.985\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:23.934\nBut I learned what opportunity cost is.\n\n00:07:25.037 --> 00:07:28.719\nAnd along the way, the map\nof my life got better.\n\n00:07:28.743 --> 00:07:31.600\nIt got bigger; it contained more places.\n\n00:07:31.624 --> 00:07:33.589\nThere were more things that might happen,\n\n00:07:33.613 --> 00:07:35.572\nmore futures I might have.\n\n00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.907\nIt wasn't a formal, organized\nlearning process,\n\n00:07:39.931 --> 00:07:41.662\nand I'm happy to admit that.\n\n00:07:41.686 --> 00:07:44.818\nIt was spotty, it was inconsistent,\nthere was a lot I didn't know.\n\n00:07:44.842 --> 00:07:47.136\nI might know, you know, Cantor's idea\n\n00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.993\nthat some infinite sets are larger\nthan other infinite sets,\n\n00:07:50.017 --> 00:07:52.914\nbut I didn't really understand\nthe calculus behind that idea.\n\n00:07:52.938 --> 00:07:54.953\nI might know the idea of opportunity cost,\n\n00:07:54.977 --> 00:07:57.287\nbut I didn't know the law\nof diminishing returns.\n\n00:07:57.311 --> 00:08:00.284\nBut the great thing about imagining\nlearning as cartography,\n\n00:08:00.308 --> 00:08:02.396\ninstead of imagining it\nas arbitrary hurdles\n\n00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.778\nthat you have to jump over,\n\n00:08:03.802 --> 00:08:07.274\nis that you see a bit of coastline,\nand that makes you want to see more.\n\n00:08:07.298 --> 00:08:09.735\nAnd so now I do know\nat least some of the calculus\n\n00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:11.491\nthat underlies all of that stuff.\n\n00:08:11.515 --> 00:08:13.285\nSo, I had one learning community\n\n00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:15.923\nin high school, then I went\nto another for college,\n\n00:08:15.947 --> 00:08:17.247\nand then I went to another,\n\n00:08:17.271 --> 00:08:19.867\nwhen I started working\nat a magazine called \"Booklist,\"\n\n00:08:19.891 --> 00:08:23.244\nwhere I was an assistant, surrounded\nby astonishingly well-read people.\n\n00:08:23.268 --> 00:08:24.794\nAnd then I wrote a book.\n\n00:08:24.818 --> 00:08:27.018\nAnd like all authors dream of doing,\n\n00:08:27.042 --> 00:08:28.971\nI promptly quit my job.\n\n00:08:28.995 --> 00:08:30.584\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:30.608 --> 00:08:32.584\nAnd for the first time since high school,\n\n00:08:32.608 --> 00:08:37.211\nI found myself without a learning\ncommunity, and it was miserable.\n\n00:08:37.235 --> 00:08:38.669\nI hated it.\n\n00:08:38.693 --> 00:08:42.067\nI read many, many books\nduring this two-year period.\n\n00:08:42.091 --> 00:08:43.854\nI read books about Stalin,\n\n00:08:43.878 --> 00:08:47.369\nand books about how the Uzbek people\ncame to identify as Muslims,\n\n00:08:47.393 --> 00:08:49.743\nand I read books about\nhow to make atomic bombs,\n\n00:08:49.767 --> 00:08:52.916\nbut it just felt like I was\ncreating my own hurdles,\n\n00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.296\nand then jumping over them myself,\ninstead of feeling the excitement\n\n00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.969\nof being part of a community of learners,\na community of people\n\n00:08:59.993 --> 00:09:02.976\nwho are engaged together\nin the cartographic enterprise\n\n00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.556\nof trying to better understand\nand map the world around us.\n\n00:09:06.937 --> 00:09:10.026\nAnd then, in 2006, I met that guy.\n\n00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.201\nHis name is Ze Frank.\n\n00:09:11.225 --> 00:09:13.862\nI didn't actually meet him,\njust on the Internet.\n\n00:09:14.413 --> 00:09:19.416\nZe Frank was running, at the time,\na show called \"The Show with Ze Frank,\"\n\n00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.914\nand I discovered the show,\n\n00:09:20.938 --> 00:09:24.172\nand that was my way back\ninto being a community learner again.\n\n00:09:24.196 --> 00:09:26.351\nHere's Ze talking about Las Vegas:\n\n00:09:27.781 --> 00:09:31.300\n(Video) Ze Frank: Las Vegas was built\nin the middle of a huge, hot desert.\n\n00:09:31.324 --> 00:09:34.020\nAlmost everything here was brought\nfrom somewhere else --\n\n00:09:34.044 --> 00:09:36.220\nthe sort of rocks, the trees,\nthe waterfalls.\n\n00:09:36.244 --> 00:09:39.253\nThese fish are almost as out of place\nas my pig that flew.\n\n00:09:39.277 --> 00:09:42.143\nContrasted to the scorching desert\nthat surrounds this place,\n\n00:09:42.167 --> 00:09:43.321\nso are these people.\n\n00:09:43.345 --> 00:09:47.276\nThings from all over the world have been\nrebuilt here, away from their histories,\n\n00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.048\nand away from the people\nthat experience them differently.\n\n00:09:50.072 --> 00:09:53.252\nSometimes improvements were made --\neven the Sphinx got a nose job.\n\n00:09:53.276 --> 00:09:56.167\nHere, there's no reason to feel\nlike you're missing anything.\n\n00:09:56.191 --> 00:09:59.161\nThis New York means the same to me\nas it does to everyone else.\n\n00:09:59.185 --> 00:10:02.742\nEverything is out of context, and that\nmeans context allows for everything:\n\n00:10:02.766 --> 00:10:04.696\nSelf Parking, Events Center, Shark Reef.\n\n00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.318\nThis fabrication of place could be one\nof the world's greatest achievements,\n\n00:10:08.342 --> 00:10:10.363\nbecause no one belongs here;\neveryone does.\n\n00:10:10.387 --> 00:10:13.411\nAs I walked around this morning,\nI noticed most of the buildings\n\n00:10:13.435 --> 00:10:16.175\nwere huge mirrors reflecting\nthe sun back into the desert.\n\n00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:17.360\nBut unlike most mirrors,\n\n00:10:17.384 --> 00:10:20.759\nwhich present you with an outside view\nof yourself embedded in a place,\n\n00:10:20.783 --> 00:10:22.228\nthese mirrors come back empty.\n\n00:10:22.252 --> 00:10:24.431\nJohn Green: Makes me\nnostalgic for the days\n\n00:10:24.455 --> 00:10:26.637\nwhen you could see\nthe pixels in online video.\n\n00:10:26.661 --> 00:10:27.668\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:27.692 --> 00:10:31.778\nZe isn't just a great public intellectual,\nhe's also a brilliant community builder,\n\n00:10:31.802 --> 00:10:34.663\nand the community of people\nthat built up around these videos\n\n00:10:34.687 --> 00:10:36.699\nwas in many ways a community of learners.\n\n00:10:36.723 --> 00:10:40.247\nSo we played Ze Frank at chess\ncollaboratively, and we beat him.\n\n00:10:40.271 --> 00:10:44.684\nWe organized ourselves to take a young man\non a road trip across the United States.\n\n00:10:44.708 --> 00:10:46.659\nWe turned the Earth into a sandwich,\n\n00:10:46.683 --> 00:10:50.392\nby having one person hold a piece of bread\nat one point on the Earth,\n\n00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:52.545\nand on the exact opposite\npoint of the Earth,\n\n00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:55.081\nhave another person\nholding a piece of bread.\n\n00:10:55.551 --> 00:11:01.559\nI realize that these are silly ideas,\nbut they are also \"learny\" ideas,\n\n00:11:01.583 --> 00:11:03.505\nand that was what was so exciting to me,\n\n00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:07.119\nand if you go online, you can find\ncommunities like this all over the place.\n\n00:11:07.143 --> 00:11:09.024\nFollow the calculus tag on Tumblr,\n\n00:11:09.048 --> 00:11:11.699\nand yes, you will see people\ncomplaining about calculus,\n\n00:11:11.723 --> 00:11:14.393\nbut you'll also see people\nre-blogging those complaints,\n\n00:11:14.417 --> 00:11:17.601\nmaking the argument that calculus\nis interesting and beautiful,\n\n00:11:17.625 --> 00:11:21.578\nand here's a way in to thinking about\nthe problem that you find unsolvable.\n\n00:11:21.602 --> 00:11:24.198\nYou can go to places like Reddit,\nand find sub-Reddits,\n\n00:11:24.222 --> 00:11:26.840\nlike \"Ask a Historian\" or \"Ask Science,\"\n\n00:11:26.864 --> 00:11:30.095\nwhere you can ask people\nwho are in these fields\n\n00:11:30.119 --> 00:11:31.587\na wide range of questions,\n\n00:11:31.611 --> 00:11:33.952\nfrom very serious ones to very silly ones.\n\n00:11:33.976 --> 00:11:36.908\nBut to me, the most interesting\ncommunities of learners\n\n00:11:36.932 --> 00:11:39.795\nthat are growing up on the Internet\nright now are on YouTube,\n\n00:11:39.819 --> 00:11:41.415\nand admittedly, I am biased.\n\n00:11:41.439 --> 00:11:45.973\nBut I think in a lot of ways,\nthe YouTube page resembles a classroom.\n\n00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:47.821\nLook for instance at \"Minute Physics,\"\n\n00:11:47.845 --> 00:11:50.638\na guy who's teaching\nthe world about physics:\n\n00:11:50.662 --> 00:11:52.163\n(Video) Let's cut to the chase.\n\n00:11:52.187 --> 00:11:55.545\nAs of July 4, 2012, the Higgs boson\nis the last fundamental piece\n\n00:11:55.569 --> 00:11:59.049\nof the standard model of particle physics\nto be discovered experimentally.\n\n00:11:59.073 --> 00:12:01.127\nBut, you might ask,\nwhy was the Higgs boson\n\n00:12:01.151 --> 00:12:02.637\nincluded in the standard model,\n\n00:12:02.661 --> 00:12:05.931\nalongside well-known particles\nlike electrons and photons and quarks,\n\n00:12:05.955 --> 00:12:08.475\nif it hadn't been discovered\nback then in the 1970s?\n\n00:12:08.499 --> 00:12:10.499\nGood question. There are two main reasons.\n\n00:12:10.523 --> 00:12:13.782\nFirst, just like the electron\nis an excitation in the electron field,\n\n00:12:13.806 --> 00:12:16.600\nthe Higgs boson is simply a particle\nwhich is an excitation\n\n00:12:16.624 --> 00:12:18.607\nof the everywhere-permeating Higgs field.\n\n00:12:18.631 --> 00:12:20.875\nThe Higgs field in turn\nplays an integral role\n\n00:12:20.899 --> 00:12:22.828\nin our model for the weak nuclear force.\n\n00:12:22.852 --> 00:12:26.012\nIn particular, the Higgs field\nhelps explain why it's so weak.\n\n00:12:26.036 --> 00:12:28.100\nWe'll talk more about this\nin a later video,\n\n00:12:28.124 --> 00:12:31.958\nbut even though weak nuclear theory was\nconfirmed in the 1980s, in the equations,\n\n00:12:31.982 --> 00:12:35.694\nthe Higgs field is so inextricably jumbled\nwith the weak force, that until now\n\n00:12:35.718 --> 00:12:38.885\nwe've been unable to confirm\nits actual and independent existence.\n\n00:12:38.909 --> 00:12:40.684\nJG: Or here's a video that I made\n\n00:12:40.708 --> 00:12:43.917\nas part of my show \"Crash Course,\"\ntalking about World War I:\n\n00:12:43.941 --> 00:12:47.312\n(Video) The immediate cause was\nof course the assassination in Sarajevo\n\n00:12:47.336 --> 00:12:49.347\nof the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand,\n\n00:12:49.371 --> 00:12:53.797\non June 28, 1914, by a Bosnian-Serb\nnationalist named Gavrilo Princip.\n\n00:12:53.821 --> 00:12:55.263\nQuick aside: It's worth noting\n\n00:12:55.287 --> 00:12:57.779\nthat the first big war\nof the twentieth century began\n\n00:12:57.803 --> 00:12:59.024\nwith an act of terrorism.\n\n00:12:59.048 --> 00:13:01.379\nSo Franz Ferdinand\nwasn't particularly well-liked\n\n00:13:01.403 --> 00:13:05.037\nby his uncle, the emperor Franz Joseph --\nnow that is a mustache!\n\n00:13:05.061 --> 00:13:08.836\nBut even so, the assassination led Austria\nto issue an ultimatum to Serbia,\n\n00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.072\nwhereupon Serbia accepted some,\nbut not all, of Austria's demands,\n\n00:13:12.096 --> 00:13:14.656\nleading Austria to declare\nwar against Serbia.\n\n00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.061\nAnd then Russia, due to its alliance\nwith the Serbs, mobilized its army.\n\n00:13:18.085 --> 00:13:20.395\nGermany, because it had\nan alliance with Austria,\n\n00:13:20.419 --> 00:13:21.916\ntold Russia to stop mobilizing,\n\n00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.199\nwhich Russia failed to do, so then Germany\nmobilized its own army,\n\n00:13:25.223 --> 00:13:28.292\ndeclared war on Russia,\ncemented an alliance with the Ottomans,\n\n00:13:28.316 --> 00:13:31.895\nand then declared war on France,\nbecause, you know, France.\n\n00:13:31.919 --> 00:13:35.372\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:35.396 --> 00:13:37.640\nAnd it's not just physics\nand world history\n\n00:13:37.664 --> 00:13:40.796\nthat people are choosing\nto learn through YouTube.\n\n00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.198\nHere's a video about abstract mathematics.\n\n00:13:45.872 --> 00:13:48.556\n(Video) So you're me, and you're\nin math class yet again,\n\n00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.582\nbecause they make you go every single day.\n\n00:13:50.606 --> 00:13:53.873\nAnd you're learning about, I don't know,\nthe sums of infinite series.\n\n00:13:53.897 --> 00:13:55.523\nThat's a high school topic, right?\n\n00:13:55.547 --> 00:13:59.463\nWhich is odd, because it's a cool topic,\nbut they somehow manage to ruin it anyway.\n\n00:13:59.487 --> 00:14:02.645\nSo I guess that's why they allow\ninfinite series in the curriculum.\n\n00:14:02.669 --> 00:14:05.821\nSo, in a quite understandable need\nfor distraction, you're doodling\n\n00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:08.777\nand thinking more about what\nthe plural of \"series\" should be\n\n00:14:08.801 --> 00:14:12.443\nthan about the topic at hand: \"serieses,\"\n\"seriese,\" \"seriesen,\" and \"serii?\"\n\n00:14:12.467 --> 00:14:15.766\nOr is it that the singular should be\nchanged: one \"serie,\" or \"serum,\"\n\n00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.234\njust like the singular of \"sheep\"\nshould be \"shoop.\"\n\n00:14:18.258 --> 00:14:19.751\nBut the whole concept of things\n\n00:14:19.775 --> 00:14:23.236\nlike 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 and so on\napproaches one, is useful if, say,\n\n00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.023\nyou want to draw a line of elephants,\n\n00:14:25.047 --> 00:14:26.863\neach holding the tail of the next one:\n\n00:14:26.887 --> 00:14:30.055\nnormal elephant, young elephant,\nbaby elephant, dog-sized elephant,\n\n00:14:30.079 --> 00:14:33.050\npuppy-sized elephant, all the way\ndown to Mr. Tusks and beyond.\n\n00:14:33.074 --> 00:14:34.855\nWhich is at least a tiny bit awesome,\n\n00:14:34.879 --> 00:14:37.826\nbecause you can get an infinite number\nof elephants in a line,\n\n00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:40.303\nand still have it fit across\na single notebook page.\n\n00:14:40.327 --> 00:14:42.949\nJG: And lastly, here's Destin,\nfrom \"Smarter Every Day,\"\n\n00:14:42.973 --> 00:14:45.382\ntalking about the conservation\nof angular momentum,\n\n00:14:45.406 --> 00:14:46.883\nand, since it's YouTube, cats:\n\n00:14:46.907 --> 00:14:50.018\n(Video) Hey, it's me, Destin.\nWelcome back to \"Smarter Every Day.\"\n\n00:14:50.042 --> 00:14:53.384\nSo you've probably observed that cats\nalmost always land on their feet.\n\n00:14:53.408 --> 00:14:55.368\nToday's question is: why?\n\n00:14:55.392 --> 00:14:58.148\nLike most simple questions,\nthere's a very complex answer.\n\n00:14:58.172 --> 00:15:00.182\nFor instance, let me reword this question:\n\n00:15:00.206 --> 00:15:05.401\nHow does a cat go from feet-up\nto feet-down in a falling reference frame,\n\n00:15:05.425 --> 00:15:08.390\nwithout violating the conservation\nof angular momentum?\n\n00:15:08.414 --> 00:15:09.425\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:09.449 --> 00:15:12.926\nJG: So, here's something all four\nof these videos have in common:\n\n00:15:13.355 --> 00:15:16.474\nThey all have more than half\na million views on YouTube.\n\n00:15:16.498 --> 00:15:19.567\nAnd those are people watching\nnot in classrooms,\n\n00:15:19.591 --> 00:15:23.232\nbut because they are part\nof the communities of learning\n\n00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:25.271\nthat are being set up by these channels.\n\n00:15:25.644 --> 00:15:28.375\nAnd I said earlier that YouTube\nis like a classroom to me,\n\n00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:31.082\nand in many ways it is,\nbecause here is the instructor --\n\n00:15:31.106 --> 00:15:34.124\nit's like the old-fashioned classroom:\nhere's the instructor,\n\n00:15:34.148 --> 00:15:36.471\nand then beneath the instructor\nare the students,\n\n00:15:36.495 --> 00:15:38.566\nand they're all having a conversation.\n\n00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:42.619\nAnd I know that YouTube comments\nhave a very bad reputation\n\n00:15:42.643 --> 00:15:44.038\nin the world of the Internet,\n\n00:15:44.062 --> 00:15:47.133\nbut in fact, if you go on comments\nfor these channels,\n\n00:15:47.157 --> 00:15:50.312\nwhat you'll find is people engaging\nthe subject matter,\n\n00:15:50.336 --> 00:15:54.583\nasking difficult, complicated questions\nthat are about the subject matter,\n\n00:15:54.607 --> 00:15:57.345\nand then other people\nanswering those questions.\n\n00:15:57.369 --> 00:16:02.203\nAnd because the YouTube page is set up so\nthat the page in which I'm talking to you\n\n00:16:02.227 --> 00:16:06.070\nis on the exact -- the place where I'm\ntalking to you is on the exact same page\n\n00:16:06.094 --> 00:16:07.252\nas your comments,\n\n00:16:07.276 --> 00:16:12.908\nyou are participating in a live and real\nand active way in the conversation.\n\n00:16:12.932 --> 00:16:16.503\nAnd because I'm in comments usually,\nI get to participate with you.\n\n00:16:16.527 --> 00:16:18.981\nAnd you find this\nwhether it's world history,\n\n00:16:19.005 --> 00:16:22.067\nor mathematics, or science,\nor whatever it is.\n\n00:16:22.091 --> 00:16:27.709\nYou also see young people using the tools\nand the sort of genres of the Internet\n\n00:16:27.733 --> 00:16:30.810\nin order to create places\nfor intellectual engagement,\n\n00:16:30.834 --> 00:16:32.434\ninstead of the ironic detachment\n\n00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:37.155\nthat maybe most of us associate with memes\nand other Internet conventions --\n\n00:16:37.179 --> 00:16:39.703\nyou know, \"Got bored. Invented calculus.\"\n\n00:16:39.727 --> 00:16:43.178\nOr, here's Honey Boo Boo\ncriticizing industrial capitalism:\n\n00:16:43.202 --> 00:16:45.868\n[\"Liberal capitalism is not at all\nthe Good of humanity.\n\n00:16:45.892 --> 00:16:49.451\nQuite the contrary; it is the vehicle\nof savage, destructive nihilism.\"]\n\n00:16:49.475 --> 00:16:51.759\nIn case you can't see\nwhat she says ... yeah.\n\n00:16:52.283 --> 00:16:55.940\nI really believe that these spaces,\n\n00:16:55.964 --> 00:17:00.997\nthese communities, have become\nfor a new generation of learners,\n\n00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:05.386\nthe kind of communities,\nthe kind of cartographic communities\n\n00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:09.953\nthat I had when I was in high school,\nand then again when I was in college.\n\n00:17:09.977 --> 00:17:13.246\nAnd as an adult, re-finding\nthese communities\n\n00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:16.580\nhas re-introduced me\nto a community of learners,\n\n00:17:16.604 --> 00:17:21.502\nand has encouraged me to continue\nto be a learner even in my adulthood,\n\n00:17:21.526 --> 00:17:26.237\nso that I no longer feel like learning\nis something reserved for the young.\n\n00:17:26.261 --> 00:17:28.484\nVi Hart and \"Minute Physics\" introduced me\n\n00:17:28.508 --> 00:17:31.308\nto all kinds of things\nthat I didn't know before.\n\n00:17:31.712 --> 00:17:33.391\nAnd I know that we all hearken back\n\n00:17:33.415 --> 00:17:36.501\nto the days of the Parisian salon\nin the Enlightenment,\n\n00:17:36.525 --> 00:17:38.554\nor to the Algonquin Round Table, and wish,\n\n00:17:38.578 --> 00:17:40.703\n\"Oh, I wish I could have been\na part of that,\n\n00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:43.572\nI wish I could have laughed\nat Dorothy Parker's jokes.\"\n\n00:17:43.596 --> 00:17:48.374\nBut I'm here to tell you that these places\nexist, they still exist.\n\n00:17:48.398 --> 00:17:52.927\nThey exist in corners of the Internet,\nwhere old men fear to tread.\n\n00:17:52.951 --> 00:17:53.954\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:53.978 --> 00:18:00.803\nAnd I truly, truly believe that when\nwe invented Agloe, New York, in the 1960s,\n\n00:18:00.827 --> 00:18:04.625\nwhen we made Agloe real,\nwe were just getting started.\n\n00:18:05.204 --> 00:18:06.356\nThank you.\n\n00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.961\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Street art with a message of hope and peace", "duration": "339", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/el_seed_street_art_with_a_message_of_hope_and_peace", "transcript": "In 2012, when I painted the minaret of Jara Mosque in my hometown of Gab\u00e9s, in the south of Tunisia, I never thought that graffiti would bring so much attention to a city.At the beginning, I was just looking for a wall in my hometown, and it happened that the minaret was built in '94. And for 18 years, those 57 meters of concrete stayed grey. When I met the imam for the first time, and I told him what I wanted to do, he was like, \"Thank God you finally came,\" and he told me that for years he was waiting for somebody to do something on it. The most amazing thing about this imam is that he didn't ask me anything \u2014 neither a sketch, or what I was going to write.In every work that I create, I write messages with my style of calligraffiti \u2014 a mix of calligraphy and graffiti. I use quotes or poetry. For the minaret, I thought that the most relevant message to be put on a mosque should come from the Quran, so I picked this verse: \"Oh humankind, we have created you from a male and a female, and made you people and tribe, so you may know each other.\" It was a universal call for peace, tolerance, and acceptance coming from the side that we don't usually portray in a good way in the media.I was amazed to see how the local community reacted to the painting, and how it made them proud to see the minaret getting so much attention from international press all around the world. For the imam, it was not just the painting; it was really deeper than that. He hoped that this minaret would become a monument for the city, and attract people to this forgotten place of Tunisia. The universality of the message, the political context of Tunisia at this time, and the fact that I was writing Quran in a graffiti way were not insignificant. It reunited the community.Bringing people, future generations, together through Arabic calligraphy is what I do. Writing messages is the essence of my artwork. What is funny, actually, is that even Arabic-speaking people really need to focus a lot to decipher what I'm writing. You don't need to know the meaning to feel the piece. I think that Arabic script touches your soul before it reaches your eyes. There is a beauty in it that you don't need to translate. Arabic script speaks to anyone, I believe; to you, to you, to you, to anybody, and then when you get the meaning, you feel connected to it. I always make sure to write messages that are relevant to the place where I'm painting, but messages that have a universal dimension, so anybody around the world can connect to it.I was born and raised in France, in Paris, and I started learning how to write and read Arabic when I was 18. Today I only write messages in Arabic. One of the reasons this is so important to me, is because of all the reaction that I've experienced all around the world.In Rio de Janeiro, I translated this Portuguese poem from Gabriela T\u00f4rres Barbosa, who was giving an homage to the poor people of the favela, and then I painted it on the rooftop. The local community were really intrigued by what I was doing, but as soon as I gave them the meaning of the calligraphy, they thanked me, as they felt connected to the piece.In South Africa, in Cape Town, the local community of Philippi offered me the only concrete wall of the slum. It was a school, and I wrote on it a quote from Nelson Mandela, saying, \"[in Arabic],\" which means, \"It seems impossible until it's done.\" Then this guy came to me and said, \"Man, why you don't write in English?\" and I replied to him, \"I would consider your concern legit if you asked me why I didn't write in Zulu.\"In Paris, once, there was this event, and someone gave his wall to be painted. And when he saw I was painting in Arabic, he got so mad \u2014 actually, hysterical \u2014 and he asked for the wall to be erased. I was mad and disappointed. But a week later, the organizer of the event asked me to come back, and he told me that there was a wall right in front of this guy's house. So, this guy \u2014 (Laughter) like, was forced to see it every day. At the beginning, I was going to write, \"[In Arabic],\" which means, \"In your face,\" but \u2014 (Laughter) I decided to be smarter and I wrote, \"[In Arabic],\" which means, \"Open your heart.\"I'm really proud of my culture, and I'm trying to be an ambassador of it through my artwork. And I hope that I can break the stereotypes we all know, with the beauty of Arabic script. Today, I don't write the translation of the message anymore on the wall. I don't want the poetry of the calligraphy to be broken, as it's art and you can appreciate it without knowing the meaning, as you can enjoy any music from other countries. Some people see that as a rejection or a closed door, but for me, it's more an invitation \u2014 to my language, to my culture, and to my art.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2304, "subtitle":

00:02:34.785\nThere is a beauty in it\nthat you don't need to translate.\n\n00:02:35.586 --> 00:02:37.864\nArabic script speaks to anyone, I believe;\n\n00:02:37.888 --> 00:02:41.405\nto you, to you, to you, to anybody,\n\n00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:43.389\nand then when you get the meaning,\n\n\n00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.393\nyou feel connected to it.\n\n00:02:45.393 --> 00:02:47.740\nI always make sure to write messages\n\n00:02:47.764 --> 00:02:50.135\nthat are relevant to the place\nwhere I'm painting,\n\n00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.240\nbut messages that have\na universal dimension,\n\n00:02:53.264 --> 00:02:56.006\nso anybody around the world\ncan connect to it.\n\n00:02:56.657 --> 00:02:58.984\nI was born and raised in France, in Paris,\n\n00:02:59.008 --> 00:03:02.953\nand I started learning how to write\nand read Arabic when I was 18.\n\n00:03:03.518 --> 00:03:07.018\nToday I only write messages in Arabic.\n\n00:03:07.042 --> 00:03:10.239\nOne of the reasons\nthis is so important to me,\n\n00:03:10.263 --> 00:03:14.079\nis because of all the reaction that\nI've experienced all around the world.\n\n00:03:15.658 --> 00:03:19.564\nIn Rio de Janeiro, I translated\nthis Portuguese poem\n\n00:03:19.588 --> 00:03:21.500\nfrom Gabriela T\u00f4rres Barbosa,\n\n00:03:21.524 --> 00:03:24.904\nwho was giving an homage\nto the poor people of the favela,\n\n00:03:24.928 --> 00:03:26.896\nand then I painted it on the rooftop.\n\n00:03:27.325 --> 00:03:30.238\nThe local community were really\nintrigued by what I was doing,\n\n00:03:30.262 --> 00:03:33.855\nbut as soon as I gave them\nthe meaning of the calligraphy,\n\n00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.808\nthey thanked me, as they felt\nconnected to the piece.\n\n00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:40.671\nIn South Africa, in Cape Town,\n\n00:03:40.695 --> 00:03:43.744\nthe local community of Philippi\n\n00:03:43.768 --> 00:03:46.815\noffered me the only\nconcrete wall of the slum.\n\n00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:49.212\nIt was a school, and I wrote on it\n\n00:03:49.236 --> 00:03:50.704\na quote from Nelson Mandela,\n\n00:03:50.728 --> 00:03:53.391\nsaying, \"[in Arabic],\"\n\n00:03:53.415 --> 00:03:56.098\nwhich means, \"It seems\nimpossible until it's done.\"\n\n00:03:56.447 --> 00:04:00.032\nThen this guy came to me and said,\n\"Man, why you don't write in English?\"\n\n00:04:00.056 --> 00:04:04.151\nand I replied to him, \"I would consider\nyour concern legit if you asked me\n\n00:04:04.175 --> 00:04:05.759\nwhy I didn't write in Zulu.\"\n\n00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.014\nIn Paris, once, there was this event,\n\n00:04:09.038 --> 00:04:12.944\nand someone gave his wall to be painted.\n\n00:04:13.974 --> 00:04:16.331\nAnd when he saw I was painting in Arabic,\n\n00:04:16.355 --> 00:04:20.379\nhe got so mad -- actually, hysterical --\nand he asked for the wall to be erased.\n\n00:04:20.403 --> 00:04:22.370\nI was mad and disappointed.\n\n00:04:22.394 --> 00:04:26.271\nBut a week later, the organizer\nof the event asked me to come back,\n\n00:04:26.295 --> 00:04:30.013\nand he told me that there was a wall\nright in front of this guy's house.\n\n00:04:30.037 --> 00:04:31.189\nSo, this guy --\n\n00:04:31.213 --> 00:04:33.432\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:33.456 --> 00:04:35.481\nlike, was forced to see it every day.\n\n00:04:35.505 --> 00:04:38.489\nAt the beginning, I was going\nto write, \"[In Arabic],\"\n\n00:04:38.513 --> 00:04:40.504\nwhich means, \"In your face,\" but --\n\n00:04:40.528 --> 00:04:42.871\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:42.895 --> 00:04:46.554\nI decided to be smarter\nand I wrote, \"[In Arabic],\"\n\n00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:48.212\nwhich means, \"Open your heart.\"\n\n00:04:49.053 --> 00:04:52.129\nI'm really proud of my culture,\n\n00:04:52.153 --> 00:04:57.668\nand I'm trying to be an ambassador\nof it through my artwork.\n\n00:04:57.692 --> 00:05:02.628\nAnd I hope that I can break\nthe stereotypes we all know,\n\n00:05:02.652 --> 00:05:04.426\nwith the beauty of Arabic script.\n\n00:05:05.165 --> 00:05:10.613\nToday, I don't write the translation\nof the message anymore on the wall.\n\n00:05:11.106 --> 00:05:14.783\nI don't want the poetry\nof the calligraphy to be broken,\n\n00:05:14.807 --> 00:05:17.988\nas it's art and you can appreciate it\nwithout knowing the meaning,\n\n00:05:18.012 --> 00:05:21.048\nas you can enjoy any music\nfrom other countries.\n\n00:05:21.588 --> 00:05:25.363\nSome people see that\nas a rejection or a closed door,\n\n00:05:25.387 --> 00:05:27.856\nbut for me, it's more an invitation --\n\n00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.159\nto my language,\nto my culture, and to my art.\n\n00:05:31.183 --> 00:05:32.341\nThank you.\n\n00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:35.217\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "What explains the rise of humans?", "duration": "1028", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/yuval_noah_harari_what_explains_the_rise_of_humans", "transcript": "Seventy-thousand years ago, our ancestors were insignificant animals. The most important thing to know about prehistoric humans is that they were unimportant. Their impact on the world was not much greater than that of jellyfish or fireflies or woodpeckers. Today, in contrast, we control this planet. And the question is: How did we come from there to here? How did we turn ourselves from insignificant apes, minding their own business in a corner of Africa, into the rulers of planet Earth?Usually, we look for the difference between us and all the other animals on the individual level. We want to believe \u2014 I want to believe \u2014 that there is something special about me, about my body, about my brain, that makes me so superior to a dog or a pig, or a chimpanzee. But the truth is that, on the individual level, I'm embarrassingly similar to a chimpanzee. And if you take me and a chimpanzee and put us together on some lonely island, and we had to struggle for survival to see who survives better, I would definitely place my bet on the chimpanzee, not on myself. And this is not something wrong with me personally. I guess if they took almost any one of you, and placed you alone with a chimpanzee on some island, the chimpanzee would do much better.The real difference between humans and all other animals is not on the individual level; it's on the collective level. Humans control the planet because they are the only animals that can cooperate both flexibly and in very large numbers. Now, there are other animals \u2014 like the social insects, the bees, the ants \u2014 that can cooperate in large numbers, but they don't do so flexibly. Their cooperation is very rigid. There is basically just one way in which a beehive can function. And if there's a new opportunity or a new danger, the bees cannot reinvent the social system overnight. They cannot, for example, execute the queen and establish a republic of bees, or a communist dictatorship of worker bees.Other animals, like the social mammals \u2014 the wolves, the elephants, the dolphins, the chimpanzees \u2014 they can cooperate much more flexibly, but they do so only in small numbers, because cooperation among chimpanzees is based on intimate knowledge, one of the other. I'm a chimpanzee and you're a chimpanzee, and I want to cooperate with you. I need to know you personally. What kind of chimpanzee are you? Are you a nice chimpanzee? Are you an evil chimpanzee? Are you trustworthy? If I don't know you, how can I cooperate with you?The only animal that can combine the two abilities together and cooperate both flexibly and still do so in very large numbers is us, Homo sapiens. One versus one, or even 10 versus 10, chimpanzees might be better than us. But, if you pit 1,000 humans against 1,000 chimpanzees, the humans will win easily, for the simple reason that a thousand chimpanzees cannot cooperate at all. And if you now try to cram 100,000 chimpanzees into Oxford Street, or into Wembley Stadium, or Tienanmen Square or the Vatican, you will get chaos, complete chaos. Just imagine Wembley Stadium with 100,000 chimpanzees. Complete madness.In contrast, humans normally gather there in tens of thousands, and what we get is not chaos, usually. What we get is extremely sophisticated and effective networks of cooperation. All the huge achievements of humankind throughout history, whether it's building the pyramids or flying to the moon, have been based not on individual abilities, but on this ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers.Think even about this very talk that I'm giving now: I'm standing here in front of an audience of about 300 or 400 people, most of you are complete strangers to me. Similarly, I don't really know all the people who have organized and worked on this event. I don't know the pilot and the crew members of the plane that brought me over here, yesterday, to London. I don't know the people who invented and manufactured this microphone and these cameras, which are recording what I'm saying. I don't know the people who wrote all the books and articles that I read in preparation for this talk. And I certainly don't know all the people who might be watching this talk over the Internet, somewhere in Buenos Aires or in New Delhi.Nevertheless, even though we don't know each other, we can work together to create this global exchange of ideas. This is something chimpanzees cannot do. They communicate, of course, but you will never catch a chimpanzee traveling to some distant chimpanzee band to give them a talk about bananas or about elephants, or anything else that might interest chimpanzees. Now cooperation is, of course, not always nice; all the horrible things humans have been doing throughout history \u2014 and we have been doing some very horrible things \u2014 all those things are also based on large-scale cooperation. Prisons are a system of cooperation; slaughterhouses are a system of cooperation; concentration camps are a system of cooperation. Chimpanzees don't have slaughterhouses and prisons and concentration camps.Now suppose I've managed to convince you perhaps that yes, we control the world because we can cooperate flexibly in large numbers. The next question that immediately arises in the mind of an inquisitive listener is: How, exactly, do we do it? What enables us alone, of all the animals, to cooperate in such a way? The answer is our imagination. We can cooperate flexibly with countless numbers of strangers, because we alone, of all the animals on the planet, can create and believe fictions, fictional stories. And as long as everybody believes in the same fiction, everybody obeys and follows the same rules, the same norms, the same values.All other animals use their communication system only to describe reality. A chimpanzee may say, \"Look! There's a lion, let's run away!\" Or, \"Look! There's a banana tree over there! Let's go and get bananas!\" Humans, in contrast, use their language not merely to describe reality, but also to create new realities, fictional realities. A human can say, \"Look, there is a god above the clouds! And if you don't do what I tell you to do, when you die, God will punish you and send you to hell.\" And if you all believe this story that I've invented, then you will follow the same norms and laws and values, and you can cooperate. This is something only humans can do. You can never convince a chimpanzee to give you a banana by promising him, \"... after you die, you'll go to chimpanzee heaven ...\" (Laughter) \"... and you'll receive lots and lots of bananas for your good deeds. So now give me this banana.\" No chimpanzee will ever believe such a story. Only humans believe such stories, which is why we control the world, whereas the chimpanzees are locked up in zoos and research laboratories.Now you may find it acceptable that yes, in the religious field, humans cooperate by believing in the same fictions. Millions of people come together to build a cathedral or a mosque or fight in a crusade or a jihad, because they all believe in the same stories about God and heaven and hell. But what I want to emphasize is that exactly the same mechanism underlies all other forms of mass-scale human cooperation, not only in the religious field.Take, for example, the legal field. Most legal systems today in the world are based on a belief in human rights. But what are human rights? Human rights, just like God and heaven, are just a story that we've invented. They are not an objective reality; they are not some biological effect about homo sapiens. Take a human being, cut him open, look inside, you will find the heart, the kidneys, neurons, hormones, DNA, but you won't find any rights. The only place you find rights are in the stories that we have invented and spread around over the last few centuries. They may be very positive stories, very good stories, but they're still just fictional stories that we've invented.The same is true of the political field. The most important factors in modern politics are states and nations. But what are states and nations? They are not an objective reality. A mountain is an objective reality. You can see it, you can touch it, you can even smell it. But a nation or a state, like Israel or Iran or France or Germany, this is just a story that we've invented and became extremely attached to.The same is true of the economic field. The most important actors today in the global economy are companies and corporations. Many of you today, perhaps, work for a corporation, like Google or Toyota or McDonald's. What exactly are these things? They are what lawyers call legal fictions. They are stories invented and maintained by the powerful wizards we call lawyers. (Laughter) And what do corporations do all day? Mostly, they try to make money. Yet, what is money? Again, money is not an objective reality; it has no objective value. Take this green piece of paper, the dollar bill. Look at it \u2014 it has no value. You cannot eat it, you cannot drink it, you cannot wear it. But then came along these master storytellers \u2014 the big bankers, the finance ministers, the prime ministers \u2014 and they tell us a very convincing story: \"Look, you see this green piece of paper? It is actually worth 10 bananas.\" And if I believe it, and you believe it, and everybody believes it, it actually works. I can take this worthless piece of paper, go to the supermarket, give it to a complete stranger whom I've never met before, and get, in exchange, real bananas which I can actually eat. This is something amazing. You could never do it with chimpanzees. Chimpanzees trade, of course: \"Yes, you give me a coconut, I'll give you a banana.\" That can work. But, you give me a worthless piece of paper and you except me to give you a banana? No way! What do you think I am, a human? (Laughter)Money, in fact, is the most successful story ever invented and told by humans, because it is the only story everybody believes. Not everybody believes in God, not everybody believes in human rights, not everybody believes in nationalism, but everybody believes in money, and in the dollar bill. Take, even, Osama Bin Laden. He hated American politics and American religion and American culture, but he had no objection to American dollars. He was quite fond of them, actually. (Laughter)To conclude, then: We humans control the world because we live in a dual reality. All other animals live in an objective reality. Their reality consists of objective entities, like rivers and trees and lions and elephants. We humans, we also live in an objective reality. In our world, too, there are rivers and trees and lions and elephants. But over the centuries, we have constructed on top of this objective reality a second layer of fictional reality, a reality made of fictional entities, like nations, like gods, like money, like corporations. And what is amazing is that as history unfolded, this fictional reality became more and more powerful so that today, the most powerful forces in the world are these fictional entities. Today, the very survival of rivers and trees and lions and elephants depends on the decisions and wishes of fictional entities, like the United States, like Google, like the World Bank \u2014 entities that exist only in our own imagination.Thank you. (Applause)Bruno Giussani: Yuval, you have a new book out. After Sapiens, you wrote another one, and it's out in Hebrew, but not yet translated into ...Yuval Noah Harari: I'm working on the translation as we speak.BG: In the book, if I understand it correctly, you argue that the amazing breakthroughs that we are experiencing right now not only will potentially make our lives better, but they will create \u2014 and I quote you \u2014 \"... new classes and new class struggles, just as the industrial revolution did.\" Can you elaborate for us?YNH: Yes. In the industrial revolution, we saw the creation of a new class of the urban proletariat. And much of the political and social history of the last 200 years involved what to do with this class, and the new problems and opportunities. Now, we see the creation of a new massive class of useless people. (Laughter) As computers become better and better in more and more fields, there is a distinct possibility that computers will out-perform us in most tasks and will make humans redundant. And then the big political and economic question of the 21st century will be, \"What do we need humans for?\", or at least, \"What do we need so many humans for?\"BG: Do you have an answer in the book?YNH: At present, the best guess we have is to keep them happy with drugs and computer games ... (Laughter) but this doesn't sound like a very appealing future.BG: Ok, so you're basically saying in the book and now, that for all the discussion about the growing evidence of significant economic inequality, we are just kind of at the beginning of the process?YNH: Again, it's not a prophecy; it's seeing all kinds of possibilities before us. One possibility is this creation of a new massive class of useless people. Another possibility is the division of humankind into different biological castes, with the rich being upgraded into virtual gods, and the poor being degraded to this level of useless people.BG: I feel there is another TED talk coming up in a year or two. Thank you, Yuval, for making the trip.YNH: Thanks!

00:03:14.214\nAre you a nice chimpanzee?\n\n00:03:14.238 --> 00:03:15.891\nAre you an evil chimpanzee?\n\n00:03:15.915 --> 00:03:17.359\nAre you trustworthy?\n\n00:03:17.383 --> 00:03:20.436\nIf I don't know you, how can I\ncooperate with you?\n\n00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:25.385\nThe only animal that can combine\nthe two abilities together\n\n00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:30.705\nand cooperate both flexibly\nand still do so in very large numbers\n\n00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:32.359\nis us, Homo sapiens.\n\n00:03:32.931 --> 00:03:37.062\nOne versus one, or even 10 versus 10,\n\n00:03:37.086 --> 00:03:39.655\nchimpanzees might be better than us.\n\n00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.249\nBut, if you pit 1,000 humans\nagainst 1,000 chimpanzees,\n\n00:03:45.273 --> 00:03:48.891\nthe humans will win easily,\nfor the simple reason\n\n00:03:48.915 --> 00:03:52.648\nthat a thousand chimpanzees\ncannot cooperate at all.\n\n00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:57.346\nAnd if you now try to cram\n100,000 chimpanzees\n\n00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.986\ninto Oxford Street,\nor into Wembley Stadium,\n\n00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.542\nor Tienanmen Square or the Vatican,\n\n00:04:03.566 --> 00:04:06.183\nyou will get chaos, complete chaos.\n\n00:04:06.207 --> 00:04:10.066\nJust imagine Wembley Stadium\nwith 100,000 chimpanzees.\n\n00:04:10.574 --> 00:04:11.764\nComplete madness.\n\n00:04:12.177 --> 00:04:18.119\nIn contrast, humans normally\ngather there in tens of thousands,\n\n00:04:18.143 --> 00:04:21.207\nand what we get is not chaos, usually.\n\n00:04:21.231 --> 00:04:27.318\nWhat we get is extremely sophisticated\nand effective networks of cooperation.\n\n00:04:28.512 --> 00:04:33.102\nAll the huge achievements\nof humankind throughout history,\n\n00:04:33.126 --> 00:04:36.409\nwhether it's building the pyramids\nor flying to the moon,\n\n00:04:36.433 --> 00:04:39.008\nhave been based not\non individual abilities,\n\n00:04:39.032 --> 00:04:42.857\nbut on this ability to cooperate\nflexibly in large numbers.\n\n00:04:43.423 --> 00:04:47.080\nThink even about this very talk\nthat I'm giving now:\n\n00:04:47.104 --> 00:04:53.088\nI'm standing here in front of an audience\nof about 300 or 400 people,\n\n00:04:53.112 --> 00:04:56.236\nmost of you are complete strangers to me.\n\n00:04:56.886 --> 00:05:01.870\nSimilarly, I don't really know\nall the people who have organized\n\n00:05:01.894 --> 00:05:03.521\nand worked on this event.\n\n00:05:03.952 --> 00:05:07.745\nI don't know the pilot\nand the crew members of the plane\n\n00:05:07.769 --> 00:05:10.680\nthat brought me over here,\nyesterday, to London.\n\n00:05:11.244 --> 00:05:14.967\nI don't know the people\nwho invented and manufactured\n\n00:05:14.991 --> 00:05:19.501\nthis microphone and these cameras,\nwhich are recording what I'm saying.\n\n00:05:20.081 --> 00:05:23.618\nI don't know the people\nwho wrote all the books and articles\n\n00:05:23.642 --> 00:05:26.035\nthat I read in preparation for this talk.\n\n00:05:26.453 --> 00:05:29.263\nAnd I certainly don't know all the people\n\n00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:32.506\nwho might be watching this talk\nover the Internet,\n\n00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.557\nsomewhere in Buenos Aires or in New Delhi.\n\n00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.629\nNevertheless, even though\nwe don't know each other,\n\n00:05:39.653 --> 00:05:45.506\nwe can work together to create\nthis global exchange of ideas.\n\n00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:49.090\nThis is something chimpanzees cannot do.\n\n00:05:49.114 --> 00:05:50.928\nThey communicate, of course,\n\n00:05:50.952 --> 00:05:56.751\nbut you will never catch a chimpanzee\ntraveling to some distant chimpanzee band\n\n00:05:56.775 --> 00:06:00.895\nto give them a talk about bananas\nor about elephants,\n\n00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:03.927\nor anything else that might\ninterest chimpanzees.\n\n00:06:05.347 --> 00:06:08.837\nNow cooperation is, of course,\nnot always nice;\n\n00:06:08.861 --> 00:06:12.886\nall the horrible things humans\nhave been doing throughout history --\n\n00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.649\nand we have been doing\nsome very horrible things --\n\n00:06:15.673 --> 00:06:20.822\nall those things are also based\non large-scale cooperation.\n\n00:06:20.846 --> 00:06:23.442\nPrisons are a system of cooperation;\n\n00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:26.456\nslaughterhouses are a system\nof cooperation;\n\n00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.484\nconcentration camps\nare a system of cooperation.\n\n00:06:29.865 --> 00:06:35.045\nChimpanzees don't have slaughterhouses\nand prisons and concentration camps.\n\n00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:39.971\nNow suppose I've managed\nto convince you perhaps that yes,\n\n00:06:39.995 --> 00:06:45.053\nwe control the world because we can\ncooperate flexibly in large numbers.\n\n00:06:45.474 --> 00:06:48.422\nThe next question that immediately arises\n\n00:06:48.446 --> 00:06:51.329\nin the mind of an inquisitive listener is:\n\n00:06:51.353 --> 00:06:53.637\nHow, exactly, do we do it?\n\n00:06:54.041 --> 00:06:59.823\nWhat enables us alone, of all the animals,\nto cooperate in such a way?\n\n00:07:01.672 --> 00:07:04.218\nThe answer is our imagination.\n\n00:07:04.956 --> 00:07:10.388\nWe can cooperate flexibly\nwith countless numbers of strangers,\n\n00:07:10.412 --> 00:07:14.108\nbecause we alone, of all\nthe animals on the planet,\n\n00:07:14.132 --> 00:07:18.755\ncan create and believe fictions,\nfictional stories.\n\n00:07:19.284 --> 00:07:23.872\nAnd as long as everybody believes\nin the same fiction,\n\n00:07:23.896 --> 00:07:27.438\neverybody obeys and follows\nthe same rules,\n\n00:07:27.462 --> 00:07:29.751\nthe same norms, the same values.\n\n00:07:30.597 --> 00:07:34.496\nAll other animals use\ntheir communication system\n\n00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.016\nonly to describe reality.\n\n00:07:37.548 --> 00:07:41.765\nA chimpanzee may say, \"Look!\nThere's a lion, let's run away!\"\n\n00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:45.895\nOr, \"Look! There's a banana tree\nover there! Let's go and get bananas!\"\n\n00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:52.196\nHumans, in contrast, use their language\nnot merely to describe reality,\n\n00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:56.744\nbut also to create new realities,\nfictional realities.\n\n00:07:57.236 --> 00:08:01.190\nA human can say, \"Look,\nthere is a god above the clouds!\n\n00:08:01.214 --> 00:08:03.294\nAnd if you don't do what I tell you to do,\n\n00:08:03.318 --> 00:08:06.523\nwhen you die, God will punish you\nand send you to hell.\"\n\n00:08:06.944 --> 00:08:10.716\nAnd if you all believe this story\nthat I've invented,\n\n00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.555\nthen you will follow the same\nnorms and laws and values,\n\n00:08:14.579 --> 00:08:15.871\nand you can cooperate.\n\n00:08:16.236 --> 00:08:18.586\nThis is something only humans can do.\n\n00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:23.006\nYou can never convince a chimpanzee\nto give you a banana\n\n00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.823\nby promising him, \"... after you die,\nyou'll go to chimpanzee heaven ...\"\n\n00:08:26.847 --> 00:08:27.870\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:27.894 --> 00:08:31.156\n\"... and you'll receive lots and lots\nof bananas for your good deeds.\n\n00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.602\nSo now give me this banana.\"\n\n00:08:32.626 --> 00:08:35.384\nNo chimpanzee will ever\nbelieve such a story.\n\n00:08:35.734 --> 00:08:38.424\nOnly humans believe such stories,\n\n00:08:38.448 --> 00:08:40.531\nwhich is why we control the world,\n\n00:08:40.555 --> 00:08:45.400\nwhereas the chimpanzees are locked up\nin zoos and research laboratories.\n\n00:08:46.862 --> 00:08:49.802\nNow you may find it acceptable that yes,\n\n00:08:49.826 --> 00:08:55.966\nin the religious field, humans cooperate\nby believing in the same fictions.\n\n00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:00.942\nMillions of people come together\nto build a cathedral or a mosque\n\n00:09:00.966 --> 00:09:06.708\nor fight in a crusade or a jihad, because\nthey all believe in the same stories\n\n00:09:06.732 --> 00:09:09.445\nabout God and heaven and hell.\n\n00:09:09.937 --> 00:09:15.176\nBut what I want to emphasize\nis that exactly the same mechanism\n\n00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:21.064\nunderlies all other forms\nof mass-scale human cooperation,\n\n00:09:21.088 --> 00:09:23.608\nnot only in the religious field.\n\n00:09:23.632 --> 00:09:25.910\nTake, for example, the legal field.\n\n00:09:26.489 --> 00:09:32.466\nMost legal systems today in the world\nare based on a belief in human rights.\n\n00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:34.982\nBut what are human rights?\n\n00:09:35.554 --> 00:09:40.256\nHuman rights, just like God and heaven,\nare just a story that we've invented.\n\n00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.598\nThey are not an objective reality;\n\n00:09:42.622 --> 00:09:46.288\nthey are not some biological effect\nabout homo sapiens.\n\n00:09:46.677 --> 00:09:50.476\nTake a human being,\ncut him open, look inside,\n\n00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:55.627\nyou will find the heart, the kidneys,\nneurons, hormones, DNA,\n\n00:09:55.651 --> 00:09:57.539\nbut you won't find any rights.\n\n00:09:58.158 --> 00:10:02.079\nThe only place you find rights\nare in the stories\n\n00:10:02.103 --> 00:10:06.236\nthat we have invented and spread around\nover the last few centuries.\n\n00:10:06.565 --> 00:10:11.495\nThey may be very positive stories,\nvery good stories,\n\n00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:15.082\nbut they're still just fictional stories\nthat we've invented.\n\n00:10:15.622 --> 00:10:18.142\nThe same is true of the political field.\n\n00:10:18.523 --> 00:10:24.893\nThe most important factors\nin modern politics are states and nations.\n\n00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.091\nBut what are states and nations?\n\n00:10:27.551 --> 00:10:29.676\nThey are not an objective reality.\n\n00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.413\nA mountain is an objective reality.\n\n00:10:32.437 --> 00:10:35.721\nYou can see it, you can touch it,\nyou can even smell it.\n\n00:10:36.181 --> 00:10:37.953\nBut a nation or a state,\n\n00:10:37.977 --> 00:10:41.757\nlike Israel or Iran or France or Germany,\n\n00:10:41.781 --> 00:10:44.521\nthis is just a story that we've invented\n\n00:10:44.545 --> 00:10:46.519\nand became extremely attached to.\n\n00:10:46.907 --> 00:10:49.411\nThe same is true of the economic field.\n\n00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:53.556\nThe most important actors today\nin the global economy\n\n00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.842\nare companies and corporations.\n\n00:10:56.365 --> 00:11:00.096\nMany of you today, perhaps, work\nfor a corporation,\n\n00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.170\nlike Google or Toyota or McDonald's.\n\n00:11:03.535 --> 00:11:05.353\nWhat exactly are these things?\n\n00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.887\nThey are what lawyers call legal fictions.\n\n00:11:10.317 --> 00:11:13.793\nThey are stories invented and maintained\n\n00:11:13.817 --> 00:11:17.150\nby the powerful wizards we call lawyers.\n\n00:11:17.174 --> 00:11:18.619\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:18.643 --> 00:11:22.062\nAnd what do corporations do all day?\n\n00:11:22.086 --> 00:11:24.939\nMostly, they try to make money.\n\n00:11:25.369 --> 00:11:26.702\nYet, what is money?\n\n00:11:26.726 --> 00:11:31.892\nAgain, money is not an objective reality;\nit has no objective value.\n\n00:11:31.916 --> 00:11:35.233\nTake this green piece\nof paper, the dollar bill.\n\n00:11:35.257 --> 00:11:37.634\nLook at it -- it has no value.\n\n00:11:37.658 --> 00:11:39.892\nYou cannot eat it, you cannot drink it,\n\n00:11:39.916 --> 00:11:41.208\nyou cannot wear it.\n\n00:11:41.591 --> 00:11:45.632\nBut then came along\nthese master storytellers --\n\n00:11:45.656 --> 00:11:47.140\nthe big bankers,\n\n00:11:47.164 --> 00:11:48.604\nthe finance ministers,\n\n00:11:48.628 --> 00:11:49.982\nthe prime ministers --\n\n00:11:50.006 --> 00:11:52.484\nand they tell us a very convincing story:\n\n00:11:52.508 --> 00:11:54.466\n\"Look, you see this green piece of paper?\n\n00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.073\nIt is actually worth 10 bananas.\"\n\n00:11:57.549 --> 00:11:59.658\nAnd if I believe it, and you believe it,\n\n00:11:59.682 --> 00:12:01.198\nand everybody believes it,\n\n00:12:01.222 --> 00:12:03.086\nit actually works.\n\n00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:06.023\nI can take this worthless piece of paper,\n\n00:12:06.047 --> 00:12:07.684\ngo to the supermarket,\n\n00:12:07.708 --> 00:12:11.715\ngive it to a complete stranger\nwhom I've never met before,\n\n00:12:11.739 --> 00:12:16.424\nand get, in exchange, real bananas\nwhich I can actually eat.\n\n00:12:16.828 --> 00:12:18.549\nThis is something amazing.\n\n00:12:18.573 --> 00:12:20.651\nYou could never do it with chimpanzees.\n\n00:12:20.675 --> 00:12:22.620\nChimpanzees trade, of course:\n\n00:12:22.644 --> 00:12:25.394\n\"Yes, you give me a coconut,\nI'll give you a banana.\"\n\n00:12:25.418 --> 00:12:26.656\nThat can work.\n\n00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.672\nBut, you give me\na worthless piece of paper\n\n00:12:29.696 --> 00:12:31.710\nand you except me to give you a banana?\n\n00:12:31.734 --> 00:12:32.886\nNo way!\n\n00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.491\nWhat do you think I am, a human?\n\n00:12:34.515 --> 00:12:36.888\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:36.912 --> 00:12:41.031\nMoney, in fact, is\nthe most successful story\n\n00:12:41.055 --> 00:12:43.711\never invented and told by humans,\n\n00:12:43.735 --> 00:12:48.078\nbecause it is the only story\neverybody believes.\n\n00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:51.440\nNot everybody believes in God,\n\n00:12:51.464 --> 00:12:54.489\nnot everybody believes in human rights,\n\n00:12:54.513 --> 00:12:57.298\nnot everybody believes in nationalism,\n\n00:12:57.322 --> 00:13:01.065\nbut everybody believes in money,\nand in the dollar bill.\n\n00:13:01.472 --> 00:13:03.453\nTake, even, Osama Bin Laden.\n\n00:13:03.477 --> 00:13:07.164\nHe hated American politics\nand American religion\n\n00:13:07.188 --> 00:13:08.637\nand American culture,\n\n00:13:08.661 --> 00:13:11.467\nbut he had no objection\nto American dollars.\n\n00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:13.586\nHe was quite fond of them, actually.\n\n00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.513\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:16.124 --> 00:13:17.824\nTo conclude, then:\n\n00:13:17.848 --> 00:13:23.616\nWe humans control the world\nbecause we live in a dual reality.\n\n00:13:24.489 --> 00:13:28.402\nAll other animals live\nin an objective reality.\n\n00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:33.502\nTheir reality consists\nof objective entities,\n\n00:13:33.526 --> 00:13:37.469\nlike rivers and trees\nand lions and elephants.\n\n00:13:38.025 --> 00:13:41.708\nWe humans, we also live\nin an objective reality.\n\n00:13:41.732 --> 00:13:46.800\nIn our world, too,

I document what these groups do when they're not shooting. My goal is to better understand these violent actors and to study ways to encourage transition from violent engagement to nonviolent confrontation. I work in the field, in the policy world and in the library.Understanding non-state armed groups is key to solving most ongoing conflict, because war has changed. It used to be a contest between states. No longer. It is now a conflict between states and non-state actors. For example, of the 216 peace agreements signed between 1975 and 2011, 196 of them were between a state and a non-state actor. So we need to understand these groups; we need to either engage them or defeat them in any conflict resolution process that has to be successful.So how do we do that? We need to know what makes these organizations tick. We know a lot about how they fight, why they fight, but no one looks at what they're doing when they're not fighting. Yet, armed struggle and unarmed politics are related. It is all part of the same organization. We cannot understand these groups, let alone defeat them, if we don't have the full picture.And armed groups today are complex organizations. Take the Lebanese Hezbollah, known for its violent confrontation against Israel. But since its creation in the early 1980s, Hezbollah has also set up a political party, a social-service network, and a military apparatus. Similarly, the Palestinian Hamas, known for its suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the Gaza Strip since 2007. So these groups do way more than just shoot. They multi-task. They set up complex communication machines \u2014 radio stations, TV channels, Internet websites and social media strategies. And up here, you have the ISIS magazine, printed in English and published to recruit. Armed groups also invest in complex fund-raising \u2014 not looting, but setting up profitable businesses; for example, construction companies. Now, these activities are keys. They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to better recruit and to build their brand.Armed groups also do something else: they build stronger bonds with the population by investing in social services. They build schools, they run hospitals, they set up vocational-training programs or micro-loan programs. Hezbollah offers all of these services and more. Armed groups also seek to win the population over by offering something that the state is not providing: safety and security. The initial rise of the Taliban in war-torn Afghanistan, or even the beginning of the ascent of ISIS, can be understood also by looking at these groups' efforts to provide security. Now, unfortunately, in these cases, the provision of security came at an unbearably high price for the population. But in general, providing social services fills a gap, a governance gap left by the government, and allows these groups to increase their strength and their power. For example, the 2006 electoral victory of the Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without acknowledging the group's social work.Now, this is a really complex picture, yet in the West, when we look at armed groups, we only think of the violent side. But that's not enough to understand these groups' strength, strategy or long-term vision. These groups are hybrid. They rise because they fill a gap left by the government, and they emerge to be both armed and political, engage in violent struggle and provide governance.And the more these organizations are complex and sophisticated, the less we can think of them as the opposite of a state. Now, what do you call a group like Hezbollah? They run part of a territory, they administer all their functions, they pick up the garbage, they run the sewage system. Is this a state? Is it a rebel group? Or maybe something else, something different and new? And what about ISIS? The lines are blurred. We live in a world of states, non-states, and in-between, and the more states are weak, like in the Middle East today, the more non-state actors step in and fill that gap. This matters for governments, because to counter these groups, they will have to invest more in non-military tools. Filling that governance gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach. This also matters very much for peacemaking and peacebuilding. If we better understand armed groups, we will better know what incentives to offer to encourage the transition from violence to nonviolence.So in this new contest between states and non-states, military power can win some battles, but it will not give us peace nor stability. To achieve these objectives, what we need is a long-term investment in filling that security gap, in filling that governance gap that allowed these groups to thrive in the first place.Thank

It's a seductive place, isn't it?I don't live there. (Laughter) But I did journey on a 27,000-mile trip for two years, to the fastest-growing and whitest counties in America.What is a Whitopia? I define Whitopia in three ways: First, a Whitopia has posted at least six percent population growth since 2000. Secondly, the majority of that growth comes from white migrants. And third, the Whitopia has an ineffable charm, a pleasant look and feel, a je Ne sais quoi. (Laughter)To learn how and why Whitopias are ticking, I immersed myself for several months apiece in three of them: first, St. George, Utah; second, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; and third, Forsyth County, Georgia.First stop, St. George \u2014 a beautiful town of red rock landscapes. In the 1850s, Brigham Young dispatched families to St. George to grow cotton because of the hot, arid climate. And so they called it Utah's Dixie, and the name sticks to this day. I approached my time in each Whitopia like an anthropologist. I made detailed spreadsheets of all the power brokers in the communities, who I needed to meet, where I needed to be, and I threw myself with gusto in these communities. I went to zoning board meetings, I went to Democratic clubs and Republican clubs. I went to poker nights. In St. George, I rented a home at the Entrada, one of the town's premier gated communities. There were no Motel 6's or Howard Johnsons for me. I lived in Whitopia as a resident, and not like a visitor.I rented myself this home by phone. (Laughter) (Applause)Golf is the perfect seductive symbol of Whitopia. When I went on my journey, I had barely ever held a golf club. By the time I left, I was golfing at least three times a week. (Laughter)Golf helps people bond. Some of the best interviews I ever scored during my trip were on the golf courses. One venture capitalist, for example, invited me to golf in his private club that had no minority members.I also went fishing. (Laughter) Because I had never fished, this fellow had to teach me how to cast my line and what bait to use.I also played poker every weekend. It was Texas Hold 'em with a $10 buy-in. My poker mates may have been bluffing about the hands that they drew, but they weren't bluffing about their social beliefs. Some of the most raw, salty conversations I ever had during my journey were at the poker table.I'm a gung ho entertainer. I love to cook, I hosted many dinner parties, and in return, people invited me to their dinner parties, and to their barbecues, and to their pool parties, and to their birthday parties.But it wasn't all fun. Immigration turned out to be a big issue in this Whitopia. The St. George's Citizens Council on Illegal Immigration held regular and active protests against immigration, and so what I gleaned from this Whitopia is what a hot debate this would become. It was a real-time preview, and so it has become.Next stop: Almost Heaven, a cabin I rented for myself in Coeur d'Alene, in the beautiful North Idaho panhandle. I rented this place for myself, also by phone. (Laughter)The book \"A Thousand Places To See Before You Die\" lists Coeur d'Alene \u2014 it's a gorgeous paradise for huntsmen, boatmen and fishermen.My growing golf skills came in handy in Coeur d'Alene. I golfed with retired LAPD cops. In 1993, around 11,000 families and cops fled Los Angeles after the L.A. racial unrest, for North Idaho, and they've built an expatriated community. Given the conservatism of these cops, there's no surprise that North Idaho has a strong gun culture. In fact, it is said, North Idaho has more gun dealers than gas stations. So what's a resident to do to fit in? I hit the gun club. When I rented a gun, the gentleman behind the counter was perfectly pleasant and kind, until I showed him my New York City driver's license. That's when he got nervous. I'm not as bad a shot as I thought I might have been.What I learned from North Idaho is the peculiar brand of paranoia that can permeate a community when so many cops and guns are around.In North Idaho, in my red pickup truck, I kept a notepad. And in that notepad I counted more Confederate flags than black people. In North Idaho, I found Confederate flags on key chains, on cellphone paraphernalia, and on cars.About a seven-minute drive from my hidden lake cabin was the compound of Aryan Nations, the white supremacist group. America's Promise Ministries, the religious arm of Aryan Nations, happened to have a three-day retreat during my visit. So I decided to crash it. (Laughter) I'm the only non-Aryan journalist I'm aware of ever to have done so. (Laughter) Among the many memorable episodes of that retreat... (Laughter) ...is when Abe, an Aryan, sidled up next to me. He slapped my knee, and he said, \"Hey Rich, I just want you to know one thing. We are not white supremacists. We are white separatists. We don't think we're better than you, we just want to be away from you.\" (Laughter)Indeed, most white people in Whitopia are neither white supremacists or white separatists; in fact, they're not there for explicitly racial reasons at all. Rather, they emigrate there for friendliness, comfort, security, safety \u2014 reasons that they implicitly associate to whiteness in itself.Next stop was Georgia. In Georgia, I stayed in an exurb north of Atlanta. In Utah, I found poker; in Idaho, I found guns; in Georgia, I found God. (Laughter) The way that I immersed myself in this Whitopia was to become active at First Redeemer Church, a megachurch that's so huge that it has golf carts to escort the congregants around its many parking lots on campus. I was active in the youth ministry. And for me, personally, I was more comfortable in this Whitopia than say, in a Colorado, or an Idaho, or even a suburban Boston. That is because [there], in Georgia, white people and black people are more historically familiar to one another. I was less exotic in this Whitopia. (Laughter)But what does it all mean? Whitopian dreaming, Whitopia migration, is a push-pull phenomenon, full of alarming pushes and alluring pulls, and Whitopia operates at the level of conscious and unconscious bias. It's possible for people to be in Whitopia not for racist reasons, though it has racist outcomes. Many Whitopians feel pushed by illegals, social welfare abuse, minorities, density, crowded schools. Many Whitopians feel pulled by merit, freedom, the allure of privatism \u2014 privatized places, privatized people, privatized things. And I learned in Whitopia how a country can have racism without racists.Many of my smug urban liberal friends couldn't believe I would go on such a venture. The reality is that many white Americans are affable and kind. Interpersonal race relations \u2014 how we treat each other as human beings \u2014 are vastly better than in my parents' generation. Can you imagine me going to Whitopia 40 years ago? What a journey that would have been. (Laughter) And yet, some things haven't changed. America is as residentially and educationally segregated today as it was in 1970.As Americans, we often find ways to cook for each other, to dance with each other, to host with each other, but why can't that translate into how we treat each other as communities? It's a devastating irony, how we have gone forward as individuals, and backwards as communities.One of the Whitopian outlooks that really hit me was a proverbial saying: \"One black man is a delightful dinner guest; 50 black men is a ghetto.\"One of the big contexts animating my Whitopian journey was the year 2042. By 2042, white people will no longer be the American majority. As such, will there be more Whitopias? In looking at this, the danger of Whitopia is that the more segregation we have, the less we can look at and confront conscious and unconscious bias.I ventured on my two-year, 27,000 mile journey to learn where, why, and how white people are fleeing, but I didn't expect to have so much fun on my journey. (Laughter) I didn't expect to learn so much about myself. I don't expect I'll be living in a Whitopia \u2014 or a Blacktopia, for that matter. I do plan to continue golfing every chance I get. (Laughter) And I'll just have to leave the guns and megachurches back in Whitopia.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2308, "subtitle":

00:07:29.017\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:29.041 --> 00:07:32.933\n...is when Abe, an Aryan,\nsidled up next to me.\n\n00:07:32.957 --> 00:07:38.377\nHe slapped my knee, and he said, \"Hey\nRich, I just want you to know one thing.\n\n00:07:38.401 --> 00:07:42.901\nWe are not white supremacists.\nWe are white separatists.\n\n00:07:42.925 --> 00:07:44.799\nWe don't think we're better than you,\n\n00:07:44.823 --> 00:07:46.512\nwe just want to be away from you.\"\n\n00:07:46.536 --> 00:07:50.950\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:50.974 --> 00:07:57.969\nIndeed, most white people in Whitopia\nare neither white supremacists\n\n00:07:57.993 --> 00:07:59.808\nor white separatists;\n\n00:07:59.832 --> 00:08:03.757\nin fact, they're not there\nfor explicitly racial reasons at all.\n\n00:08:04.098 --> 00:08:07.154\nRather, they emigrate there\n\n00:08:07.178 --> 00:08:10.886\nfor friendliness, comfort,\nsecurity, safety --\n\n00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:15.903\nreasons that they implicitly associate\nto whiteness in itself.\n\n00:08:17.022 --> 00:08:18.896\nNext stop was Georgia.\n\n00:08:20.182 --> 00:08:24.294\nIn Georgia, I stayed in an exurb\nnorth of Atlanta.\n\n00:08:24.985 --> 00:08:26.780\nIn Utah, I found poker;\n\n00:08:26.804 --> 00:08:28.495\nin Idaho, I found guns;\n\n00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:30.073\nin Georgia, I found God.\n\n00:08:30.097 --> 00:08:31.336\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.933\nThe way that I immersed myself\nin this Whitopia\n\n00:08:34.957 --> 00:08:38.348\nwas to become active\nat First Redeemer Church,\n\n00:08:38.372 --> 00:08:41.876\na megachurch that's so huge\nthat it has golf carts\n\n00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:47.065\nto escort the congregants around\nits many parking lots on campus.\n\n00:08:47.716 --> 00:08:50.425\nI was active in the youth ministry.\n\n00:08:50.449 --> 00:08:55.381\nAnd for me, personally,\nI was more comfortable in this Whitopia\n\n00:08:55.405 --> 00:09:00.038\nthan say, in a Colorado, or an Idaho,\nor even a suburban Boston.\n\n00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:04.047\nThat is because [there], in Georgia,\n\n00:09:04.071 --> 00:09:08.590\nwhite people and black people are more\nhistorically familiar to one another.\n\n00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.846\nI was less exotic in this Whitopia.\n\n00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:13.870\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:14.642 --> 00:09:16.229\nBut what does it all mean?\n\n00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.381\nWhitopian dreaming, Whitopia migration,\nis a push-pull phenomenon,\n\n00:09:22.405 --> 00:09:26.546\nfull of alarming pushes\nand alluring pulls,\n\n00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:33.183\nand Whitopia operates at the level\nof conscious and unconscious bias.\n\n00:09:33.818 --> 00:09:39.221\nIt's possible for people to be in Whitopia\nnot for racist reasons,\n\n00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:41.535\nthough it has racist outcomes.\n\n00:09:43.662 --> 00:09:47.506\nMany Whitopians feel pushed by illegals,\n\n00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:53.047\nsocial welfare abuse, minorities,\ndensity, crowded schools.\n\n00:09:53.071 --> 00:09:58.250\nMany Whitopians feel pulled by merit,\n\n00:09:58.274 --> 00:10:04.038\nfreedom, the allure of privatism --\nprivatized places, privatized people,\n\n00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:05.379\nprivatized things.\n\n00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:13.070\nAnd I learned in Whitopia\nhow a country can have racism\n\n00:10:13.094 --> 00:10:14.429\nwithout racists.\n\n00:10:15.199 --> 00:10:17.986\nMany of my smug urban liberal friends\n\n00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.747\ncouldn't believe I would go\non such a venture.\n\n00:10:21.405 --> 00:10:26.927\nThe reality is that many white Americans\nare affable and kind.\n\n00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:32.370\nInterpersonal race relations --\nhow we treat each other as human beings --\n\n00:10:32.394 --> 00:10:36.001\nare vastly better than in\nmy parents' generation.\n\n00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.743\nCan you imagine me going\nto Whitopia 40 years ago?\n\n00:10:41.554 --> 00:10:43.442\nWhat a journey that would have been.\n\n00:10:43.466 --> 00:10:45.224\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:45.248 --> 00:10:47.117\nAnd yet, some things haven't changed.\n\n00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:54.241\nAmerica is as residentially\nand educationally segregated today\n\n00:10:54.265 --> 00:10:56.832\nas it was in 1970.\n\n00:10:59.481 --> 00:11:04.112\nAs Americans, we often find ways\nto cook for each other,\n\n00:11:04.136 --> 00:11:05.756\nto dance with each other,\n\n00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.653\nto host with each other,\n\n00:11:07.677 --> 00:11:12.725\nbut why can't that translate into how we\ntreat each other as communities?\n\n00:11:13.193 --> 00:11:15.313\nIt's a devastating irony,\n\n00:11:15.337 --> 00:11:18.649\nhow we have gone forward as individuals,\n\n00:11:18.673 --> 00:11:21.283\nand backwards as communities.\n\n00:11:23.724 --> 00:11:28.017\nOne of the Whitopian outlooks\nthat really hit me\n\n00:11:28.041 --> 00:11:30.213\nwas a proverbial saying:\n\n00:11:30.237 --> 00:11:33.713\n\"One black man is\na delightful dinner guest;\n\n00:11:33.737 --> 00:11:35.779\n50 black men is a ghetto.\"\n\n00:11:40.837 --> 00:11:47.713\nOne of the big contexts animating\nmy Whitopian journey was the year 2042.\n\n00:11:48.626 --> 00:11:54.734\nBy 2042, white people will no longer be\nthe American majority.\n\n00:11:55.408 --> 00:11:58.709\nAs such, will there be more Whitopias?\n\n00:12:00.884 --> 00:12:02.571\nIn looking at this,\n\n00:12:02.595 --> 00:12:09.302\nthe danger of Whitopia is\nthat the more segregation we have,\n\n00:12:09.326 --> 00:12:15.127\nthe less we can look at and confront\nconscious and unconscious bias.\n\n00:12:18.262 --> 00:12:22.623\nI ventured on my two-year,\n27,000 mile journey\n\n00:12:22.647 --> 00:12:27.734\nto learn where, why, and how\nwhite people are fleeing,\n\n00:12:27.758 --> 00:12:30.500\nbut I didn't expect to have\nso much fun on my journey.\n\n00:12:30.524 --> 00:12:31.531\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:31.555 --> 00:12:34.445\nI didn't expect to learn\nso much about myself.\n\n00:12:35.366 --> 00:12:38.814\nI don't expect I'll be living\nin a Whitopia --\n\n00:12:38.838 --> 00:12:40.949\nor a Blacktopia, for that matter.\n\n00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:45.159\nI do plan to continue golfing\nevery chance I get.\n\n00:12:45.183 --> 00:12:46.745\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:46.769 --> 00:12:51.394\nAnd I'll just have to leave the guns\nand megachurches back in Whitopia.\n\n00:12:52.672 --> 00:12:53.824\nThank you.\n\n00:12:53.848 -->

love. He says, \"Don't hate the media. Be the media.\" I'm an artist. I like working with media and technology because A, I'm familiar with them and I like the power they hold. And B, I hate them and I'm terrified of the power they hold.(Laughter)I remember watching, in 2003, an interview between Fox News host Tony Snow and then-US Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld. They were talking about the recent invasion of Iraq, and Rumsfeld is asked the question, \"Well, we're hear about our body counts, but we never hear about theirs, why?\" And Rumsfeld's answer is, \"Well, we don't do body counts on other people.\" Right?It's estimated that between 150,000 to one million Iraqis, civilians, have died as a result of the US-led invasion in 2003. That number is in stark contrast with the 4,486 US service members who died during that same window of time. I wanted to do more than just bring awareness to this terrifying number. I wanted to create a monument for the individual civilians who died as a result of the invasion.Monuments to war, such as Maya Lin's Vietnam Memorial, are often enormous in scale. Very powerful and very one-sided. I wanted my monument to live in the world, and to circulate. I remember when I was a boy in school, my teacher assigned us this classic civics assignment where you take a sheet of paper and you write a member of your government. And we were told, if we wrote a really good letter, if we really thought about it, we would get back more than just a simple formed letter as a reply.This is my \"Notepad.\" What looks like an everyday, yellow legal tablet of paper is actually a monument to the individual Iraqi civilians that died as a result of the US invasion. \"Notepad\" is an act of protest and an act of commemoration disguised as an everyday tablet of paper. The lines of the paper, when magnified, are revealed to be micro-printed text that contains the details, the names, the dates and locations of individual Iraqi civilians that died.So, for the last 5 years, I've been taking pads of this paper, tons of this stuff, and smuggling it into the stationery supplies of the United States and the Coalition governments.(Laughter)(Applause)I don't have to tell you guys this is not the place to discuss how I did that.(Laughter)But also, I've been meeting one-on-one with members and former members of the so-called Coalition of the Willing, who assisted in the invasion.And so, whenever I can, I meet with one of them, and I share the project with them. And last summer, I had the chance to meet with former United States Attorney General and Torture Memo author, Alberto Gonzales.(Video) Matt Kenyon: May I give this to you? This is a special legal tablet. It's actually part of an ongoing art project.Alberto Gonzalez: This is a special legal pad?MK: Yes. You won't believe me, but it's in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art; I'm an artist.MK: And all of the lines of the paper are actually \u2014AG: Are they going to disappear?MK: No, they're micro-printed text that contains the names of individual Iraqi civilians who have died since the invasion of Iraq.AG: Yeah. OK.AG: Thank you. MK: Thank you.(Laughter)The way he says \"thank you\" really creeps me out.(Laughter)OK, so I'd like each of you to look under your chairs. There's an envelope. And please open it. The paper you're holding in your hand contains the details of Iraqi civilians that died as result of the invasion. I'd like you to use this paper and write a member of government. You can help to smuggle this civilian body count into government archives. Because every letter that's sent in to the government, and this is all across the world, of course \u2014 every letter that is sent in is archived, filed and recorded. Together, we can put this in the mailboxes and under the noses of people in power. Everything that's sent in eventually becomes part of the permanent archive of our government, our shared historical record.Thank you.(Applause)Tom Rielly: So, tell me Matt, how did this idea come into your head, of \"Notepad\"?Matt Kenyon: I'd just finished a project that dealt with the US Coalition side of the war and it was a black armband that was called the \"Improvised Empathetic Device\" which accumulated, in real time, the names, ranks, cause of death and location of US service members who had died overseas, and each time the Department of Defense or CENTCOM released their data, it would stab me in the arm. And so, I became aware that there was a spectacle associated with our own people who were dying overseas, but a disproportionate amount of casualties were the civilian casualties.TR: Thank you so much.MK: Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2306, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:17.856\nThere's this quote by activist and punk\nrock

You swallow an aspirin. But for this pill to get to your head, where the pain is, it goes through your stomach, intestines and various other organs first.Swallowing pills is the most effective and painless way of delivering any medication in the body. The downside, though, is that swallowing any medication leads to its dilution. And this is a big problem, particularly in HIV patients. When they take their anti-HIV drugs, these drugs are good for lowering the virus in the blood, and increasing the CD4 cell counts. But they are also notorious for their adverse side effects, but mostly bad, because they get diluted by the time they get to the blood, and worse, by the time they get to the sites where it matters most: within the HIV viral reservoirs. These areas in the body \u2014 such as the lymph nodes, the nervous system, as well as the lungs \u2014 where the virus is sleeping, and will not readily get delivered in the blood of patients that are under consistent anti-HIV drugs therapy. However, upon discontinuation of therapy, the virus can awake and infect new cells in the blood.Now, all this is a big problem in treating HIV with the current drug treatment, which is a life-long treatment that must be swallowed by patients. One day, I sat and thought, \"Can we deliver anti-HIV directly within its reservoir sites, without the risk of drug dilution?\" As a laser scientist, the answer was just before my eyes: Lasers, of course. If they can be used for dentistry, for diabetic wound-healing and surgery, they can be used for anything imaginable, including transporting drugs into cells.As a matter of fact, we are currently using laser pulses to poke or drill extremely tiny holes, which open and close almost immediately in HIV-infected cells, in order to deliver drugs within them. \"How is that possible?\" you may ask. Well, we shine a very powerful but super-tiny laser beam onto the membrane of HIV-infected cells while these cells are immersed in liquid containing the drug. The laser pierces the cell, while the cell swallows the drug in a matter of microseconds. Before you even know it, the induced hole becomes immediately repaired.Now, we are currently testing this technology in test tubes or in Petri dishes, but the goal is to get this technology in the human body, apply it in the human body. \"How is that possible?\" you may ask. Well, the answer is: through a three-headed device. Using the first head, which is our laser, we will make an incision in the site of infection. Using the second head, which is a camera, we meander to the site of infection. Finally, using a third head, which is a drug-spreading sprinkler, we deliver the drugs directly at the site of infection, while the laser is again used to poke those cells open.Well, this might not seem like much right now. But one day, if successful, this technology can lead to complete eradication of HIV in the body. Yes. A cure for HIV.

(Laughter) Beyond flying, breathing fire, and making hot men spontaneously appear ... (Laughter) I can do things like read and write music. Fun fact is that I wrote my personal statement to college in a dream. And I did accepted. So, yeah.I am a very visual thinker. I think in pictures, not words. To me, words are more like instincts and language.There are many people like me; Nikola Tesla, for example, who could visualize, design, test, and troubleshoot everything \u2014 all of his inventions \u2014 in his mind, accurately.Language is kind of exclusive to our species, anyway. I am a bit more primitive, like a beta version of Google Translate. (Laughter)My brain has the ability to hyper-focus on things that interest me. For example, once I had an affair with calculus that lasted longer than some celebrity marriages. (Laughter)There are some other unusual things about me. You may have noticed that I don't have much inflection in my voice. That's why people often confuse me with a GPS. (Laughter) This can make basic communication a challenge, unless you need directions. (Laughter) Thank you. (Applause)A few years ago, when I started doing presentations, I went to get head shots done for the first time. The photographer told me to look flirty. (Laughter) And I had no idea what she was talking about. (Laughter)She said, \"Do that thing, you know, with your eyes, when you're flirting with guys.\"\"What thing?\" I asked.\"You know, squint.\"And so I tried, really. It looked something like this. (Laughter) I looked like I was searching for Waldo. (Laughter)There's a reason for this, as there is a reason that Waldo is hiding. (Laughter)I have Asperger's, a high-functioning form of autism that impairs the basic social skills one is expected to display. It's made life difficult in many ways, and growing up, I struggled to fit in socially. My friends would tell jokes, but I didn't understand them. My personal heroes were George Carlin and Stephen Colbert \u2014 and they taught me humor. My personality switched from being shy and awkward to being defiant and cursing out a storm. Needless to say, I did not have many friends. I was also hypersensitive to texture. The feel of water on my skin was like pins and needles, and so for years, I refused to shower. I can assure you that my hygiene routine is up to standards now, though. (Laughter)I had to do a lot to get here, and my parents \u2014 things kind of got out of control when I was sexually assaulted by a peer, and on top of everything, it made a difficult situation worse. And I had to travel 2,000 miles across the country to get treatment, but within days of them prescribing a new medication, my life turned into an episode of the Walking Dead. I became paranoid, and began to hallucinate that rotting corpses were coming towards me. My family finally rescued me, but by that time, I had lost 19 pounds in those three weeks, as well as developing severe anemia, and was on the verge of suicide.I transferred to a new treatment center that understood my aversions, my trauma, and my social anxiety, and they knew how to treat it, and I got the help I finally needed. And after 18 months of hard work, I went on to do incredible things.One of the things with Asperger's is that oftentimes, these people have a very complex inner life, and I know for myself, I have a very colorful personality, rich ideas, and just a lot going on in my mind. But there's a gap between where that stands, and how I communicate it with the rest of the world. And this can make basic communication a challenge.Not many places would hire me, due to my lack of social skills, which is why I applied to Waffle House. (Laughter) Waffle House is an exceptional 24-hour diner \u2014 (Laughter) (Applause) thank you \u2014 where you can order your hash browns the many ways that someone would dispose of a human corpse ... (Laughter) Sliced, diced, peppered, chunked, topped, capped, and covered. (Laughter) As social norms would have it, you should only go to Waffle House at an ungodly hour in the night. (Laughter) So one time, at 2 am, I was chatting with a waitress, and I asked her, \"What's the most ridiculous thing that's happened to you on the job?\" And she told me that one time, a man walked in completely naked. (Laughter) I said, \"Great! Sign me up for the graveyard shift!\" (Laughter) Needless to say, Waffle House did not hire me.So in terms of having Asperger's, it can be viewed as a disadvantage, and sometimes it is a real pain in the butt, but it's also the opposite. It's a gift, and it allows me to think innovatively. At 19, I won a research competition for my research on coral reefs, and I ended up speaking at the UN Convention of Biological Diversity, presenting this research. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) And at 22, I'm getting ready to graduate college, and I am a co-founder of a biotech company called AutismSees. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)But consider what I had to do to get here: 25 therapists, 11 misdiagnoses, and years of pain and trauma. I spent a lot of time thinking if there's a better way, and I think there is: autism-assistive technology. This technology could play an integral role in helping people with autistic spectrum disorder, or ASD.The app Podium, released by my company, AutismSees, has the ability to independently assess and help develop communication skills. In addition to this, it tracks eye contact through camera and simulates a public-speaking and job-interview experience. And so maybe one day, Waffle House will hire me, after practicing on it some more. (Laughter) And one of the great things is that I've used Podium to help me prepare for today, and it's been a great help. But it's more than that. There's more that can be done. For people with ASD \u2014 it has been speculated that many innovative scientists, researchers, artists, and engineers have it; like, for example, Emily Dickinson, Jane Austen, Isaac Newton, and Bill Gates are some examples. But the problem that's encountered is that these brilliant ideas often can't be shared if there are communication roadblocks. And so, many people with autism are being overlooked every day, and they're being taken advantage of. So my dream for people with autism is to change that, to remove the roadblocks that prevent them from succeeding.One of the reasons I love lucid dreaming is because it allows me to be free, without judgment of social and physical consequences. When I'm flying over scenes that I create in my mind, I am at peace. I am free from judgment, and so I can do whatever I want, you know? I'm making out with Brad Pitt, and Angelina is totally cool with it. (Laughter)But the goal of autism-assistive technology is bigger than that, and more important. My goal is to shift people's perspective of autism and people with higher-functioning Asperger's because there is a lot they can do. I mean, look at Temple Grandin, for example. And by doing so, we allow people to share their talents with this world and move this world forward. In addition, we give them the courage to pursue their dreams in the real world, in real time.Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2310, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.704 --> 00:00:15.331\nToday, I want to talk to you about dreams.\n\n00:00:15.957 --> 00:00:18.674\nI have been a lucid dreamer my whole life,\n\n00:00:18.698 --> 00:00:20.674\nand it's cooler than in the movies.\n\n00:00:20.698 --> 00:00:22.641\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:25.373\nBeyond flying, breathing fire,\n\n00:00:25.397 --> 00:00:28.238\nand making hot men\nspontaneously appear ...\n\n00:00:28.262 --> 00:00:30.239\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:32.671\nI can do things like read and write music.\n\n00:00:33.302 --> 00:00:36.633\nFun fact is that I wrote\nmy personal statement to college\n\n00:00:36.657 --> 00:00:37.977\nin a dream.\n\n00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:40.756\nAnd I did accepted.

exclusive\nto our species, anyway.\n\n00:01:09.957 --> 00:01:12.067\nI am a bit more primitive,\n\n00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:14.659\nlike a beta version of Google Translate.\n\n00:01:14.683 --> 00:01:17.295\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:22.582\nMy brain has the ability\nto hyper-focus on things that interest me.\n\n00:01:23.265 --> 00:01:25.932\nFor example, once\nI had an affair with calculus\n\n00:01:25.956 --> 00:01:28.645\nthat lasted longer\nthan some celebrity marriages.\n\n00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:31.596\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:32.485 --> 00:01:35.001\nThere are some other\nunusual things about me.\n\n00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:39.175\nYou may have noticed\nthat I don't have much inflection\n\n00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:40.413\nin my voice.\n\n00:01:40.437 --> 00:01:43.498\nThat's why people\noften confuse me with a GPS.\n\n00:01:43.522 --> 00:01:47.396\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:47.992 --> 00:01:51.939\nThis can make basic communication\na challenge, unless you need directions.\n\n00:01:51.963 --> 00:01:56.378\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:56.402 --> 00:01:57.576\nThank you.\n\n00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.827\n(Applause)\n\n00:02:02.558 --> 00:02:05.797\nA few years ago, when I started\ndoing presentations,\n\n00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:08.450\nI went to get head shots done\nfor the first time.\n\n00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:12.082\nThe photographer told me to look flirty.\n\n00:02:12.106 --> 00:02:14.375\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:16.988\nAnd I had no idea\nwhat she was talking about.\n\n00:02:17.012 --> 00:02:18.658\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:18.682 --> 00:02:21.110\nShe said, \"Do that thing,\nyou know, with your eyes,\n\n00:02:21.134 --> 00:02:23.035\nwhen you're flirting with guys.\"\n\n00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.150\n\"What thing?\" I asked.\n\n00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:27.019\n\"You know, squint.\"\n\n00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:29.195\nAnd so I tried, really.\n\n00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:30.880\nIt looked something like this.\n\n00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.801\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:33.825 --> 00:02:36.448\nI looked like I was searching for Waldo.\n\n00:02:36.472 --> 00:02:38.858\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.272\nThere's a reason for this,\n\n00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:44.865\nas there is a reason that Waldo is hiding.\n\n00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:49.336\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:52.876 --> 00:02:54.464\nI have Asperger's,\n\n00:02:54.488 --> 00:02:56.480\na high-functioning form of autism\n\n00:02:56.504 --> 00:02:59.980\nthat impairs the basic social skills\none is expected to display.\n\n00:03:02.684 --> 00:03:05.768\nIt's made life difficult in many ways,\n\n00:03:05.792 --> 00:03:09.532\nand growing up,\nI struggled to fit in socially.\n\n00:03:09.913 --> 00:03:13.540\nMy friends would tell jokes,\nbut I didn't understand them.\n\n00:03:14.278 --> 00:03:18.934\nMy personal heroes were George Carlin\nand Stephen Colbert --\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.339\nand they taught me humor.\n\n00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:26.645\nMy personality switched\nfrom being shy and awkward\n\n00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.462\nto being defiant and cursing out a storm.\n\n00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.013\nNeedless to say,\nI did not have many friends.\n\n00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:35.950\nI was also hypersensitive to texture.\n\n00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.367\nThe feel of water on my skin\nwas like pins and needles,\n\n00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:42.685\nand so for years, I refused to shower.\n\n00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.177\nI can assure you that my hygiene routine\nis up to standards now, though.\n\n00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:48.834\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:50.445 --> 00:03:54.838\nI had to do a lot to get here,\nand my parents --\n\n00:03:54.862 --> 00:03:59.491\nthings kind of got out of control\nwhen I was sexually assaulted by a peer,\n\n00:03:59.515 --> 00:04:04.315\nand on top of everything,\nit made a difficult situation worse.\n\n00:04:05.228 --> 00:04:10.791\nAnd I had to travel 2,000 miles\nacross the country to get treatment,\n\n00:04:10.815 --> 00:04:14.489\nbut within days of them prescribing\na new medication,\n\n00:04:14.513 --> 00:04:17.265\nmy life turned into an episode\nof the Walking Dead.\n\n00:04:18.067 --> 00:04:21.179\nI became paranoid,\nand began to hallucinate\n\n00:04:21.203 --> 00:04:24.227\nthat rotting corpses\nwere coming towards me.\n\n00:04:24.727 --> 00:04:27.569\nMy family finally rescued me,\n\n00:04:27.593 --> 00:04:32.282\nbut by that time, I had lost 19 pounds\nin those three weeks,\n\n00:04:32.306 --> 00:04:34.735\nas well as developing severe anemia,\n\n00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.520\nand was on the verge of suicide.\n\n00:04:38.138 --> 00:04:42.813\nI transferred to a new treatment center\nthat understood my aversions,\n\n00:04:42.837 --> 00:04:46.518\nmy trauma, and my social anxiety,\n\n00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:49.858\nand they knew how to treat it,\nand I got the help I finally needed.\n\n00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.732\nAnd after 18 months of hard work,\n\n00:04:52.756 --> 00:04:55.848\nI went on to do incredible things.\n\n00:04:56.668 --> 00:05:00.096\nOne of the things with Asperger's\nis that oftentimes,\n\n00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.213\nthese people have\na very complex inner life,\n\n00:05:02.237 --> 00:05:05.078\nand I know for myself,\nI have a very colorful personality,\n\n00:05:05.102 --> 00:05:08.806\nrich ideas, and just a lot\ngoing on in my mind.\n\n00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.203\nBut there's a gap\nbetween where that stands,\n\n00:05:12.227 --> 00:05:14.818\nand how I communicate it\nwith the rest of the world.\n\n00:05:15.374 --> 00:05:18.850\nAnd this can make\nbasic communication a challenge.\n\n00:05:20.064 --> 00:05:23.323\nNot many places would hire me,\ndue to my lack of social skills,\n\n00:05:23.347 --> 00:05:25.647\nwhich is why I applied to Waffle House.\n\n00:05:25.671 --> 00:05:31.258\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:32.028 --> 00:05:35.706\nWaffle House is an exceptional\n24-hour diner --\n\n00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.683\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:37.707 --> 00:05:40.961\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:40.985 --> 00:05:42.925\nthank you --\n\n00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:44.708\nwhere you can order your hash browns\n\n00:05:44.732 --> 00:05:47.885\nthe many ways that someone\nwould dispose of a human corpse ...\n\n00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:49.542\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:49.566 --> 00:05:54.295\nSliced, diced, peppered, chunked,\ntopped, capped, and covered.\n\n00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.422\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:56.446 --> 00:05:57.891\nAs social norms would have it,\n\n00:05:57.915 --> 00:06:01.412\nyou should only go to Waffle House\nat an ungodly hour in the night.\n\n00:06:01.436 --> 00:06:02.587\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:02.611 --> 00:06:06.967\nSo one time, at 2 am, I was chatting\nwith a waitress, and I asked her,\n\n00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:10.261\n\"What's the most ridiculous thing\nthat's happened to you on the job?\"\n\n00:06:10.831 --> 00:06:14.094\nAnd she told me that one time,\na man walked in completely naked.\n\n00:06:14.118 --> 00:06:15.348\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:15.712 --> 00:06:18.220\nI said, \"Great! Sign me up\nfor the graveyard shift!\"\n\n00:06:18.244 --> 00:06:20.848\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:20.872 --> 00:06:23.663\nNeedless to say,\nWaffle House did not hire me.\n\n00:06:25.796 --> 00:06:30.176\nSo in terms of having Asperger's,\nit can be viewed as a disadvantage,\n\n00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.367\nand sometimes it is\na real pain in the butt,\n\n00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:34.145\nbut it's also the opposite.\n\n00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.760\nIt's a gift, and it allows me\nto think innovatively.\n\n00:06:38.768 --> 00:06:45.598\nAt 19, I won a research competition\nfor my research on coral reefs,\n\n00:06:45.622 --> 00:06:47.137\nand I ended up speaking\n\n00:06:47.161 --> 00:06:49.412\nat the UN Convention\nof Biological Diversity,\n\n00:06:49.436 --> 00:06:50.932\npresenting this research.\n\n00:06:50.956 --> 00:06:52.644\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:52.668 --> 00:06:53.826\nThank you.\n\n00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.748\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:58.772 --> 00:07:02.767\nAnd at 22, I'm getting ready\nto graduate college,\n\n00:07:02.791 --> 00:07:07.326\nand I am a co-founder of a biotech\ncompany called AutismSees.\n\n00:07:08.233 --> 00:07:09.241\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:09.265 --> 00:07:10.520\nThank you.\n\n00:07:10.544 --> 00:07:13.221\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:13.245 --> 00:07:16.429\nBut consider what I had to do to get here:\n\n00:07:16.453 --> 00:07:21.744\n25 therapists, 11 misdiagnoses,\nand years of pain and trauma.\n\n00:07:22.656 --> 00:07:25.727\nI spent a lot of time thinking\nif there's a better way,\n\n00:07:25.751 --> 00:07:29.803\nand I think there is:\nautism-assistive technology.\n\n00:07:30.461 --> 00:07:32.478\nThis technology\ncould play an integral role\n\n00:07:32.502 --> 00:07:35.357\nin helping people\nwith autistic spectrum disorder,\n\n00:07:35.381 --> 00:07:36.535\nor ASD.\n\n00:07:38.423 --> 00:07:43.389\nThe app Podium, released\nby my company, AutismSees,\n\n00:07:43.413 --> 00:07:48.687\nhas the ability to independently assess\nand help develop communication skills.\n\n00:07:49.282 --> 00:07:53.604\nIn addition to this, it tracks\neye contact through camera\n\n00:07:53.628 --> 00:07:59.535\nand simulates a public-speaking\nand job-interview experience.\n\n00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:03.076\nAnd so maybe one day,\nWaffle House will hire me,\n\n00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.280\nafter practicing on it some more.\n\n00:08:05.304 --> 00:08:06.485\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.639\nAnd one of the great things\nis that I've used Podium\n\n00:08:14.663 --> 00:08:19.749\nto help me prepare for today,\nand it's been a great help.\n\n00:08:19.773 --> 00:08:21.400\nBut it's more than that.\n\n00:08:21.424 --> 00:08:22.978\nThere's more that can be done.\n\n00:08:24.232 --> 00:08:27.324\nFor people with ASD --\n\n00:08:27.348 --> 00:08:31.865\nit has been speculated\nthat many innovative scientists,\n\n00:08:31.889 --> 00:08:36.480\nresearchers, artists,\nand engineers have it;\n\n00:08:36.504 --> 00:08:42.534\nlike, for example, Emily Dickinson,\nJane Austen, Isaac Newton, and Bill Gates\n\n00:08:42.558 --> 00:08:44.295\nare some examples.\n\n00:08:44.319 --> 00:08:46.072\nBut the problem that's encountered\n\n00:08:46.096 --> 00:08:49.933\nis that these brilliant ideas\noften can't be shared\n\n00:08:49.957 --> 00:08:52.221\nif there are communication roadblocks.\n\n00:08:53.207 --> 00:08:57.933\nAnd so, many people with autism\nare being overlooked every day,\n\n00:08:57.957 --> 00:08:59.767\nand they're being taken advantage of.\n\n00:09:01.133 --> 00:09:08.028\nSo my dream for people with autism\nis to change that,\n\n00:09:08.052 --> 00:09:10.979\nto remove the roadblocks\nthat prevent them from succeeding.\n\n00:09:11.766 --> 00:09:14.268\nOne of the reasons I love lucid dreaming\n\n00:09:14.292 --> 00:09:17.174\nis because it allows me to be free,\n\n00:09:17.198 --> 00:09:21.263\nwithout judgment of social\nand physical consequences.\n\n00:09:21.596 --> 00:09:24.598\nWhen I'm flying over scenes\nthat I create in my mind,\n\n00:09:24.622 --> 00:09:25.851\nI am at peace.\n\n00:09:27.304 --> 00:09:29.324\nI am free from judgment,\n\n00:09:29.348 --> 00:09:31.364\nand so I can do whatever I want, you know?\n\n00:09:31.388 --> 00:09:36.292\nI'm making out with Brad Pitt,\nand Angelina is totally cool with it.\n\n00:09:36.316 --> 00:09:38.196\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:39.717 --> 00:09:43.616\nBut the goal of autism-assistive\ntechnology is bigger than that,\n\n00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.001\nand more important.\n\n00:09:45.683 --> 00:09:49.604\nMy goal is to shift people's perspective\n\n00:09:49.628 --> 00:09:54.608\nof autism and people\nwith higher-functioning Asperger's\n\n00:09:54.632 --> 00:09:58.496\nbecause there is a lot they can do.\n\n00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.956\nI mean, look at\nTemple Grandin, for example.\n\n00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:07.075\nAnd by doing so, we allow people\nto share their talents with this world\n\n00:10:07.099 --> 00:10:09.466\nand move this world forward.\n\n00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:12.712\nIn addition, we give them the courage\nto pursue their dreams\n\n00:10:12.736 --> 00:10:15.024\nin the real world, in real time.\n\n00:10:15.048 --> 00:10:16.207\nThank you.\n\n00:10:16.231 --> 00:10:19.879\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:19.903 --> 00:10:21.054\nThank you.\n\n00:10:21.078 --> 00:10:24.918\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A visual history of human knowledge", "duration": "769", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/manuel_lima_a_visual_history_of_human_knowledge", "transcript": "Over the past 10 years, I've been researching the way people organize and visualize information. And I've noticed an interesting shift.For a long period of time, we believed in a natural ranking order in the world around us, also known as the great chain of being, or \"Scala naturae\" in Latin, a top-down structure that normally starts with God at the very top, followed by angels, noblemen, common people, animals, and so on. This idea was actually based on Aristotle's ontology, which classified all things known to man in a set of opposing categories, like the ones you see behind me. But over time, interestingly enough, this concept adopted the branching schema of a tree in what became known as the Porphyrian tree, also considered to be the oldest tree of knowledge.The branching scheme of the tree was, in fact, such a powerful metaphor for conveying information that it became, over time, an important communication tool to map a variety of systems of knowledge. We can see trees being used to map morality, with the popular tree of virtues and tree of vices, as you can see here, with these beautiful illustrations from medieval Europe. We can see trees being used to map consanguinity, the various blood ties between people. We can also see trees being used to map genealogy, perhaps the most famous archetype of the tree diagram. I think many of you in the audience have probably seen family trees. Many of you probably even have your own family trees drawn in such a way. We can see trees even mapping systems of law, the various decrees and rulings of kings and rulers. And finally, of course, also a very popular scientific metaphor, we can see trees being used to map all species known to man. And trees ultimately became such a powerful visual metaphor because in many ways, they really embody this human desire for order, for balance, for unity, for symmetry.However, nowadays we are really facing new complex, intricate challenges that cannot be understood by simply employing a simple tree diagram. And a new metaphor is currently emerging, and it's currently replacing the tree in visualizing various systems of knowledge. It's really providing us with a new lens to understand the world around us. And this new metaphor is the metaphor of the network. And we can see this shift from trees into networks in many domains of knowledge.We can see this shift in the way we try to understand the brain. While before, we used to think of the brain as a modular, centralized organ, where a given area was responsible for a set of actions and behaviors, the more we know about the brain, the more we think of it as a large music symphony, played by hundreds and thousands of instruments. This is a beautiful snapshot created by the Blue Brain Project, where you can see 10,000 neurons and 30 million connections. And this is only mapping 10 percent of a mammalian neocortex. We can also see this shift in the way we try to conceive of human knowledge.These are some remarkable trees of knowledge, or trees of science, by Spanish scholar Ramon Llull. And Llull was actually the precursor, the very first one who created the metaphor of science as a tree, a metaphor we use every single day, when we say, \"Biology is a branch of science,\" when we say, \"Genetics is a branch of science.\" But perhaps the most beautiful of all trees of knowledge, at least for me, was created for the French encyclopedia by Diderot and d'Alembert in 1751. This was really the bastion of the French Enlightenment, and this gorgeous illustration was featured as a table of contents for the encyclopedia. And it actually maps out all domains of knowledge as separate branches of a tree.But knowledge is much more intricate than this. These are two maps of Wikipedia showing the inter-linkage of articles \u2014 related to history on the left, and mathematics on the right. And I think by looking at these maps and other ones that have been created of Wikipedia \u2014 arguably one of the largest rhizomatic structures ever created by man \u2014 we can really understand how human knowledge is much more intricate and interdependent, just like a network.We can also see this interesting shift in the way we map social ties between people. This is the typical organization chart. I'm assuming many of you have seen a similar chart as well, in your own corporations, or others. It's a top-down structure that normally starts with the CEO at the very top, and where you can drill down all the way to the individual workmen on the bottom. But humans sometimes are, well, actually, all humans are unique in their own way, and sometimes you really don't play well under this really rigid structure.I think the Internet is really changing this paradigm quite a lot. This is a fantastic map of online social collaboration between Perl developers. Perl is a famous programming language, and here, you can see how different programmers are actually exchanging files, and working together on a given project. And here, you can notice that this is a completely decentralized process \u2014 there's no leader in this organization, it's a network.We can also see this interesting shift when we look at terrorism. One of the main challenges of understanding terrorism nowadays is that we are dealing with decentralized, independent cells, where there's no leader leading the whole process. And here, you can actually see how visualization is being used. The diagram that you see behind me shows all the terrorists involved in the Madrid attack in 2004. And what they did here is, they actually segmented the network into three different years, represented by the vertical layers that you see behind me. And the blue lines tie together the people that were present in that network year after year. So even though there's no leader per se, these people are probably the most influential ones in that organization, the ones that know more about the past, and the future plans and goals of this particular cell.We can also see this shift from trees into networks in the way we classify and organize species. The image on the right is the only illustration that Darwin included in \"The Origin of Species,\" which Darwin called the \"Tree of Life.\" There's actually a letter from Darwin to the publisher, expanding on the importance of this particular diagram. It was critical for Darwin's theory of evolution. But recently, scientists discovered that overlaying this tree of life is a dense network of bacteria, and these bacteria are actually tying together species that were completely separated before, to what scientists are now calling not the tree of life, but the web of life, the network of life.And finally, we can really see this shift, again, when we look at ecosystems around our planet. No more do we have these simplified predator-versus-prey diagrams we have all learned at school. This is a much more accurate depiction of an ecosystem. This is a diagram created by Professor David Lavigne, mapping close to 100 species that interact with the codfish off the coast of Newfoundland in Canada. And I think here, we can really understand the intricate and interdependent nature of most ecosystems that abound on our planet.But even though recent, this metaphor of the network, is really already adopting various shapes and forms, and it's almost becoming a growing visual taxonomy. It's almost becoming the syntax of a new language. And this is one aspect that truly fascinates me. And these are actually 15 different typologies I've been collecting over time, and it really shows the immense visual diversity of this new metaphor. And here is an example. On the very top band, you have radial convergence, a visualization model that has become really popular over the last five years. At the top left, the very first project is a gene network, followed by a network of IP addresses \u2014 machines, servers \u2014 followed by a network of Facebook friends. You probably couldn't find more disparate topics, yet they are using the same metaphor, the same visual model, to map the never-ending complexities of its own subject. And here are a few more examples of the many I've been collecting, of this growing visual taxonomy of networks.But networks are not just a scientific metaphor. As designers, researchers, and scientists try to map a variety of complex systems, they are in many ways influencing traditional art fields, like painting and sculpture, and influencing many different artists. And perhaps because networks have this huge aesthetical force to them \u2014 they're immensely gorgeous \u2014 they are really becoming a cultural meme, and driving a new art movement, which I've called \"networkism.\" And we can see this influence in this movement in a variety of ways. This is just one of many examples, where you can see this influence from science into art. The example on your left side is IP-mapping, a computer-generated map of IP addresses; again \u2014 servers, machines. And on your right side, you have \"Transient Structures and Unstable Networks\" by Sharon Molloy, using oil and enamel on canvas. And here are a few more paintings by Sharon Molloy, some gorgeous, intricate paintings.And here's another example of that interesting cross-pollination between science and art. On your left side, you have \"Operation Smile.\" It is a computer-generated map of a social network. And on your right side, you have \"Field 4,\" by Emma McNally, using only graphite on paper. Emma McNally is one of the main leaders of this movement, and she creates these striking, imaginary landscapes, where you can really notice the influence from traditional network visualization.But networkism doesn't happen only in two dimensions. This is perhaps one of my favorite projects of this new movement. And I think the title really says it all \u2014 it's called: \"Galaxies Forming Along Filaments, Like Droplets Along the Strands of a Spider's Web.\" And I just find this particular project to be immensely powerful. It was created by Tom\u00e1s Saraceno, and he occupies these large spaces, creates these massive installations using only elastic ropes. As you actually navigate that space and bounce along those elastic ropes, the entire network kind of shifts, almost like a real organic network would.And here's yet another example of networkism taken to a whole different level. This was created by Japanese artist Chiharu Shiota in a piece called \"In Silence.\" And Chiharu, like Tom\u00e1s Saraceno, fills these rooms with this dense network, this dense web of elastic ropes and black wool and thread, sometimes including objects, as you can see here, sometimes even including people, in many of her installations.But networks are also not just a new trend, and it's too easy for us to dismiss it as such. Networks really embody notions of decentralization, of interconnectedness, of interdependence. And this new way of thinking is critical for us to solve many of the complex problems we are facing nowadays, from decoding the human brain, to understanding the vast universe out there. On your left side, you have a snapshot of a neural network of a mouse \u2014 very similar to our own at this particular scale. And on your right side, you have the Millennium Simulation. It was the largest and most realistic simulation of the growth of cosmic structure. It was able to recreate the history of 20 million galaxies in approximately 25 terabytes of output. And coincidentally or not, I just find this particular comparison between the smallest scale of knowledge \u2014 the brain \u2014 and the largest scale of knowledge \u2014 the universe itself \u2014 to be really quite striking and fascinating. Because as Bruce Mau once said, \"When everything is connected to everything else, for better or for worse, everything matters.\"Thank you so much.(Applause)", "id": 2296, "subtitle":

visualize information.\n\n00:00:19.744 --> 00:00:21.783\nAnd I've noticed an interesting shift.\n\n00:00:22.124 --> 00:00:23.844\nFor a long period of time,\n\n00:00:23.868 --> 00:00:28.296\nwe believed in a natural ranking order\nin the world around us,\n\n00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.065\nalso known as the great chain of being,\nor \"Scala naturae\" in Latin,\n\n00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:37.264\na top-down structure that normally starts\nwith God at the very top,\n\n00:00:37.288 --> 00:00:39.693\nfollowed by angels, noblemen,\n\n00:00:39.717 --> 00:00:42.730\ncommon people, animals, and so on.\n\n00:00:43.957 --> 00:00:48.232\nThis idea was actually based\non Aristotle's ontology,\n\n00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:52.700\nwhich classified all things known to man\nin a set of opposing categories,\n\n00:00:52.724 --> 00:00:54.446\nlike the ones you see behind me.\n\n00:00:56.645 --> 00:00:59.392\nBut over time, interestingly enough,\n\n00:00:59.416 --> 00:01:03.562\nthis concept adopted\nthe branching schema of a tree\n\n00:01:03.586 --> 00:01:06.459\nin what became known\nas the Porphyrian tree,\n\n00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:10.125\nalso considered to be\nthe oldest tree of knowledge.\n\n00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:13.370\nThe branching scheme\nof the tree was, in fact,\n\n00:01:13.394 --> 00:01:16.343\nsuch a powerful metaphor\nfor conveying information\n\n00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:19.637\nthat it became, over time,\nan important communication tool\n\n00:01:19.661 --> 00:01:21.935\nto map a variety of systems of knowledge.\n\n00:01:22.606 --> 00:01:25.689\nWe can see trees being used\nto map morality,\n\n00:01:25.713 --> 00:01:28.562\nwith the popular tree of virtues\nand tree of vices,\n\n00:01:28.586 --> 00:01:32.378\nas you can see here, with these beautiful\nillustrations from medieval Europe.\n\n00:01:32.783 --> 00:01:35.871\nWe can see trees being used\nto map consanguinity,\n\n00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:38.139\nthe various blood ties between people.\n\n00:01:39.068 --> 00:01:42.164\nWe can also see trees being used\nto map genealogy,\n\n00:01:42.188 --> 00:01:44.998\nperhaps the most famous archetype\nof the tree diagram.\n\n00:01:45.022 --> 00:01:48.338\nI think many of you in the audience\nhave probably seen family trees.\n\n00:01:48.362 --> 00:01:52.067\nMany of you probably even have\nyour own family trees drawn in such a way.\n\n00:01:53.116 --> 00:01:56.027\nWe can see trees even mapping\nsystems of law,\n\n00:01:56.051 --> 00:01:59.902\nthe various decrees and rulings\nof kings and rulers.\n\n00:02:01.743 --> 00:02:05.501\nAnd finally, of course,\nalso a very popular scientific metaphor,\n\n00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:09.085\nwe can see trees being used\nto map all species known to man.\n\n00:02:11.135 --> 00:02:15.041\nAnd trees ultimately became\nsuch a powerful visual metaphor\n\n00:02:15.065 --> 00:02:17.933\nbecause in many ways,\nthey really embody this human desire\n\n00:02:17.957 --> 00:02:20.993\nfor order, for balance,\nfor unity, for symmetry.\n\n00:02:21.957 --> 00:02:26.280\nHowever, nowadays we are really facing\nnew complex, intricate challenges\n\n00:02:26.304 --> 00:02:30.494\nthat cannot be understood by simply\nemploying a simple tree diagram.\n\n00:02:31.995 --> 00:02:35.237\nAnd a new metaphor is currently emerging,\n\n00:02:35.261 --> 00:02:37.411\nand it's currently replacing the tree\n\n00:02:37.435 --> 00:02:39.998\nin visualizing various\nsystems of knowledge.\n\n00:02:40.022 --> 00:02:44.274\nIt's really providing us with a new lens\nto understand the world around us.\n\n00:02:45.453 --> 00:02:48.652\nAnd this new metaphor\nis the metaphor of the network.\n\n00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.780\nAnd we can see this shift\nfrom trees into networks\n\n00:02:52.804 --> 00:02:54.444\nin many domains of knowledge.\n\n00:02:54.468 --> 00:02:58.657\nWe can see this shift in the way\nwe try to understand the brain.\n\n00:03:00.411 --> 00:03:02.449\nWhile before, we used\nto think of the brain\n\n00:03:02.473 --> 00:03:04.464\nas a modular, centralized organ,\n\n00:03:04.488 --> 00:03:08.526\nwhere a given area was responsible\nfor a set of actions and behaviors,\n\n00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.289\nthe more we know about the brain,\n\n00:03:10.313 --> 00:03:13.599\nthe more we think of it\nas a large music symphony,\n\n00:03:13.623 --> 00:03:16.233\nplayed by hundreds\nand thousands of instruments.\n\n00:03:16.257 --> 00:03:19.933\nThis is a beautiful snapshot\ncreated by the Blue Brain Project,\n\n00:03:19.957 --> 00:03:24.020\nwhere you can see 10,000 neurons\nand 30 million connections.\n\n00:03:24.694 --> 00:03:28.582\nAnd this is only mapping 10 percent\nof a mammalian neocortex.\n\n00:03:30.773 --> 00:03:34.933\nWe can also see this shift in the way\nwe try to conceive of human knowledge.\n\n00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.168\nThese are some remarkable trees\nof knowledge, or trees of science,\n\n00:03:39.192 --> 00:03:41.413\nby Spanish scholar Ramon Llull.\n\n00:03:41.957 --> 00:03:43.767\nAnd Llull was actually the precursor,\n\n00:03:43.791 --> 00:03:47.505\nthe very first one who created\nthe metaphor of science as a tree,\n\n00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:50.497\na metaphor we use\nevery single day, when we say,\n\n00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:52.186\n\"Biology is a branch of science,\"\n\n00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.363\nwhen we say,\n\n00:03:53.387 --> 00:03:55.320\n\"Genetics is a branch of science.\"\n\n00:03:56.241 --> 00:03:59.836\nBut perhaps the most beautiful of all\ntrees of knowledge, at least for me,\n\n00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.312\nwas created for the French encyclopedia\nby Diderot and d'Alembert in 1751.\n\n00:04:04.336 --> 00:04:06.971\nThis was really the bastion\nof the French Enlightenment,\n\n00:04:06.995 --> 00:04:10.820\nand this gorgeous illustration\nwas featured as a table of contents\n\n00:04:10.844 --> 00:04:12.415\nfor the encyclopedia.\n\n00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:16.626\nAnd it actually maps out\nall domains of knowledge\n\n00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.768\nas separate branches of a tree.\n\n00:04:19.824 --> 00:04:22.157\nBut knowledge is much more\nintricate than this.\n\n00:04:22.752 --> 00:04:27.392\nThese are two maps of Wikipedia\nshowing the inter-linkage of articles --\n\n00:04:27.416 --> 00:04:31.306\nrelated to history on the left,\nand mathematics on the right.\n\n00:04:31.924 --> 00:04:33.663\nAnd I think by looking at these maps\n\n00:04:33.687 --> 00:04:36.231\nand other ones that have been\ncreated of Wikipedia --\n\n00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:39.647\narguably one of the largest rhizomatic\nstructures ever created by man --\n\n00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:43.493\nwe can really understand\nhow human knowledge is much more intricate\n\n00:04:43.517 --> 00:04:45.953\nand interdependent, just like a network.\n\n00:04:47.413 --> 00:04:49.576\nWe can also see this interesting shift\n\n00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.300\nin the way we map\nsocial ties between people.\n\n00:04:53.482 --> 00:04:55.777\nThis is the typical organization chart.\n\n00:04:55.801 --> 00:04:58.595\nI'm assuming many of you have seen\na similar chart as well,\n\n00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:00.365\nin your own corporations, or others.\n\n00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:01.874\nIt's a top-down structure\n\n00:05:01.898 --> 00:05:04.759\nthat normally starts\nwith the CEO at the very top,\n\n00:05:04.783 --> 00:05:08.743\nand where you can drill down all the

organization,\n\n00:05:43.937 --> 00:05:45.094\nit's a network.\n\n00:05:46.295 --> 00:05:51.000\nWe can also see this interesting shift\nwhen we look at terrorism.\n\n00:05:51.571 --> 00:05:54.675\nOne of the main challenges\nof understanding terrorism nowadays\n\n00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.429\nis that we are dealing with\ndecentralized, independent cells,\n\n00:05:58.453 --> 00:06:01.275\nwhere there's no leader\nleading the whole process.\n\n00:06:02.476 --> 00:06:05.774\nAnd here, you can actually see\nhow visualization is being used.\n\n00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:07.455\nThe diagram that you see behind me\n\n00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.297\nshows all the terrorists involved\nin the Madrid attack in 2004.\n\n00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.827\nAnd what they did here is,\nthey actually segmented the network\n\n00:06:14.851 --> 00:06:16.350\ninto three different years,\n\n00:06:16.374 --> 00:06:19.416\nrepresented by the vertical layers\nthat you see behind me.\n\n00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.409\nAnd the blue lines tie together\n\n00:06:21.433 --> 00:06:25.051\nthe people that were present\nin that network year after year.\n\n00:06:25.075 --> 00:06:27.103\nSo even though there's no leader per se,\n\n00:06:27.127 --> 00:06:30.762\nthese people are probably the most\ninfluential ones in that organization,\n\n00:06:30.786 --> 00:06:32.794\nthe ones that know more about the past,\n\n00:06:32.818 --> 00:06:35.695\nand the future plans and goals\nof this particular cell.\n\n00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.196\nWe can also see this shift\nfrom trees into networks\n\n00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.211\nin the way we classify\nand organize species.\n\n00:06:45.203 --> 00:06:48.032\nThe image on the right\nis the only illustration\n\n00:06:48.056 --> 00:06:51.168\nthat Darwin included\nin \"The Origin of Species,\"\n\n00:06:51.192 --> 00:06:53.453\nwhich Darwin called the \"Tree of Life.\"\n\n00:06:54.056 --> 00:06:56.941\nThere's actually a letter\nfrom Darwin to the publisher,\n\n00:06:56.965 --> 00:06:59.621\nexpanding on the importance\nof this particular diagram.\n\n00:06:59.645 --> 00:07:02.287\nIt was critical for Darwin's\ntheory of evolution.\n\n00:07:03.366 --> 00:07:06.933\nBut recently, scientists discovered\nthat overlaying this tree of life\n\n00:07:06.957 --> 00:07:09.392\nis a dense network of bacteria,\n\n00:07:09.416 --> 00:07:11.577\nand these bacteria\nare actually tying together\n\n00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:13.773\nspecies that were completely\nseparated before,\n\n00:07:13.797 --> 00:07:16.877\nto what scientists are now calling\nnot the tree of life,\n\n00:07:16.901 --> 00:07:19.757\nbut the web of life, the network of life.\n\n00:07:21.447 --> 00:07:23.961\nAnd finally, we can really\nsee this shift, again,\n\n00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:26.409\nwhen we look at ecosystems\naround our planet.\n\n00:07:27.557 --> 00:07:30.723\nNo more do we have these simplified\npredator-versus-prey diagrams\n\n00:07:30.747 --> 00:07:32.194\nwe have all learned at school.\n\n00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:36.148\nThis is a much more accurate\ndepiction of an ecosystem.\n\n00:07:36.172 --> 00:07:39.076\nThis is a diagram created\nby Professor David Lavigne,\n\n00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.600\nmapping close to 100 species\nthat interact with the codfish\n\n00:07:42.624 --> 00:07:45.575\noff the coast of Newfoundland in Canada.\n\n00:07:46.202 --> 00:07:50.139\nAnd I think here, we can really understand\nthe intricate and interdependent nature\n\n00:07:50.163 --> 00:07:52.686\nof most ecosystems\nthat abound on our planet.\n\n00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.044\nBut even though recent,\nthis metaphor of the network,\n\n00:07:58.068 --> 00:08:01.171\nis really already adopting\nvarious shapes and forms,\n\n00:08:01.195 --> 00:08:03.658\nand it's almost becoming\na growing visual taxonomy.\n\n00:08:03.682 --> 00:08:06.329\nIt's almost

typologies\n\n00:08:12.193 --> 00:08:14.328\nI've been collecting over time,\n\n00:08:14.352 --> 00:08:18.374\nand it really shows the immense\nvisual diversity of this new metaphor.\n\n00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:20.181\nAnd here is an example.\n\n00:08:20.776 --> 00:08:24.709\nOn the very top band,\nyou have radial convergence,\n\n00:08:24.733 --> 00:08:28.672\na visualization model that has become\nreally popular over the last five years.\n\n00:08:29.156 --> 00:08:33.510\nAt the top left, the very first project\nis a gene network,\n\n00:08:33.534 --> 00:08:37.543\nfollowed by a network\nof IP addresses -- machines, servers --\n\n00:08:37.567 --> 00:08:40.539\nfollowed by a network of Facebook friends.\n\n00:08:41.198 --> 00:08:43.706\nYou probably couldn't find\nmore disparate topics,\n\n00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:47.524\nyet they are using the same metaphor,\nthe same visual model,\n\n00:08:47.548 --> 00:08:51.154\nto map the never-ending complexities\nof its own subject.\n\n00:08:52.503 --> 00:08:55.627\nAnd here are a few more examples\nof the many I've been collecting,\n\n00:08:55.651 --> 00:08:58.389\nof this growing visual\ntaxonomy of networks.\n\n00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:03.071\nBut networks are not just\na scientific metaphor.\n\n00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:09.691\nAs designers, researchers, and scientists\ntry to map a variety of complex systems,\n\n00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:12.528\nthey are in many ways influencing\ntraditional art fields,\n\n00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:13.954\nlike painting and sculpture,\n\n00:09:13.978 --> 00:09:15.971\nand influencing many different artists.\n\n00:09:16.676 --> 00:09:20.718\nAnd perhaps because networks have\nthis huge aesthetical force to them --\n\n00:09:20.742 --> 00:09:22.700\nthey're immensely gorgeous --\n\n00:09:22.724 --> 00:09:24.780\nthey are really becoming a cultural meme,\n\n00:09:24.804 --> 00:09:29.129\nand driving a new art movement,\nwhich I've called \"networkism.\"\n\n00:09:30.502 --> 00:09:33.710\nAnd we can see this influence\nin this movement in a variety of ways.\n\n00:09:33.734 --> 00:09:35.527\nThis is just one of many examples,\n\n00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:38.276\nwhere you can see this influence\nfrom science into art.\n\n00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.171\nThe example on your left side\nis IP-mapping,\n\n00:09:41.195 --> 00:09:44.854\na computer-generated map of IP addresses;\nagain -- servers, machines.\n\n00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:46.416\nAnd on your right side,\n\n00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:51.058\nyou have \"Transient

Molloy,\n\n00:09:56.957 --> 00:09:58.889\nsome gorgeous, intricate paintings.\n\n00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:03.639\nAnd here's another example\nof that interesting cross-pollination\n\n00:10:03.663 --> 00:10:05.067\nbetween science and art.\n\n00:10:05.433 --> 00:10:08.098\nOn your left side,\nyou have \"Operation Smile.\"\n\n00:10:08.122 --> 00:10:11.011\nIt is a computer-generated map\nof a social

00:10:20.849\nEmma McNally is one of the main\nleaders of this movement,\n\n00:10:20.873 --> 00:10:23.442\nand she creates these striking,\nimaginary landscapes,\n\n00:10:23.466 --> 00:10:28.131\nwhere you can really notice the influence\nfrom traditional network visualization.\n\n00:10:30.282 --> 00:10:33.289\nBut networkism doesn't happen\nonly in two dimensions.\n\n00:10:33.313 --> 00:10:35.591\nThis is perhaps\none of my favorite projects\n\n00:10:35.615 --> 00:10:37.020\nof this new movement.\n\n00:10:37.044 --> 00:10:39.678\nAnd I think the title really\nsays it all -- it's called:\n\n00:10:39.702 --> 00:10:41.869\n\"Galaxies Forming Along Filaments,\n\n00:10:41.893 --> 00:10:45.225\nLike Droplets Along the Strands\nof a Spider's Web.\"\n\n00:10:46.574 --> 00:10:49.654\nAnd I just find this particular project\nto be immensely powerful.\n\n00:10:49.678 --> 00:10:51.638\nIt was created by Tom\u00e1s Saraceno,\n\n00:10:51.662 --> 00:10:54.360\nand he occupies these large spaces,\n\n00:10:54.384 --> 00:10:57.726\ncreates these massive installations\nusing only elastic ropes.\n\n00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.567\nAs you actually navigate that space\nand bounce along those elastic ropes,\n\n00:11:01.591 --> 00:11:06.166\nthe entire network kind of shifts,\nalmost like a real organic network would.\n\n00:11:07.372 --> 00:11:09.404\nAnd here's yet another example\n\n00:11:09.428 --> 00:11:11.817\nof networkism taken\nto a whole different level.\n\n00:11:12.261 --> 00:11:15.474\nThis was created\nby Japanese artist Chiharu Shiota\n\n00:11:15.498 --> 00:11:17.253\nin a piece called \"In Silence.\"\n\n00:11:17.792 --> 00:11:23.147\nAnd Chiharu, like Tom\u00e1s Saraceno,\nfills these rooms with this dense network,\n\n00:11:23.171 --> 00:11:26.933\nthis dense web of elastic ropes\nand black wool and thread,\n\n00:11:26.957 --> 00:11:29.716\nsometimes including objects,\nas you can see

--> 00:11:40.411\nand it's too easy for us\nto dismiss it as such.\n\n00:11:40.987 --> 00:11:44.594\nNetworks really embody\nnotions of decentralization,\n\n00:11:44.618 --> 00:11:47.752\nof interconnectedness, of interdependence.\n\n00:11:48.261 --> 00:11:50.737\nAnd this new way of thinking is critical\n\n00:11:50.761 --> 00:11:54.491\nfor us to solve many of the complex\nproblems we are facing nowadays,\n\n00:11:54.515 --> 00:11:56.356\nfrom decoding the human brain,\n\n00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.783\nto understanding\nthe vast universe out there.\n\n00:11:59.704 -->

Yes, really", "duration": "815", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/tony_wyss_coray_how_young_blood_might_help_reverse_aging_yes_really", "transcript": "This is a painting from the 16th century from Lucas Cranach the Elder. It shows the famous Fountain of Youth. If you drink its water or you bathe in it, you will get health and youth. Every culture, every civilization has dreamed of finding eternal youth. There are people like Alexander the Great or Ponce De Le\u00f3n, the explorer, who spent much of their life chasing the Fountain of Youth. They didn't find it. But what if there was something to it? What if there was something to this Fountain of Youth?I will share an absolutely amazing development in aging research that could revolutionize the way we think about aging and how we may treat age-related diseases in the future. It started with experiments that showed, in a recent number of studies about growing, that animals \u2014 old mice \u2014 that share a blood supply with young mice can get rejuvenated. This is similar to what you might see in humans, in Siamese twins, and I know this sounds a bit creepy. But what Tom Rando, a stem-cell researcher, reported in 2007, was that old muscle from a mouse can be rejuvenated if it's exposed to young blood through common circulation. This was reproduced by Amy Wagers at Harvard a few years later, and others then showed that similar rejuvenating effects could be observed in the pancreas, the liver and the heart. But what I'm most excited about, and several other labs as well, is that this may even apply to the brain.So, what we found is that an old mouse exposed to a young environment in this model called parabiosis, shows a younger brain \u2014 and a brain that functions better. And I repeat: an old mouse that gets young blood through shared circulation looks younger and functions younger in its brain. So when we get older \u2014 we can look at different aspects of human cognition, and you can see on this slide here, we can look at reasoning, verbal ability and so forth. And up to around age 50 or 60, these functions are all intact, and as I look at the young audience here in the room, we're all still fine.(Laughter)But it's scary to see how all these curves go south. And as we get older, diseases such as Alzheimer's and others may develop. We know that with age, the connections between neurons \u2014 the way neurons talk to each other, the synapses \u2014 they start to deteriorate; neurons die, the brain starts to shrink, and there's an increased susceptibility for these neurodegenerative diseases.One big problem we have \u2014 to try to understand how this really works at a very molecular mechanistic level \u2014 is that we can't study the brains in detail, in living people. We can do cognitive tests, we can do imaging \u2014 all kinds of sophisticated testing. But we usually have to wait until the person dies to get the brain and look at how it really changed through age or in a disease. This is what neuropathologists do, for example. So, how about we think of the brain as being part of the larger organism. Could we potentially understand more about what happens in the brain at the molecular level if we see the brain as part of the entire body? So if the body ages or gets sick, does that affect the brain? And vice versa: as the brain gets older, does that influence the rest of the body? And what connects all the different tissues in the body is blood. Blood is the tissue that not only carries cells that transport oxygen, for example, the red blood cells, or fights infectious diseases, but it also carries messenger molecules, hormone-like factors that transport information from one cell to another, from one tissue to another, including the brain. So if we look at how the blood changes in disease or age, can we learn something about the brain? We know that as we get older, the blood changes as well, so these hormone-like factors change as we get older. And by and large, factors that we know are required for the development of tissues, for the maintenance of tissues \u2014 they start to decrease as we get older, while factors involved in repair, in injury and in inflammation \u2014 they increase as we get older.So there's this unbalance of good and bad factors, if you will. And to illustrate what we can do potentially with that, I want to talk you through an experiment that we did. We had almost 300 blood samples from healthy human beings 20 to 89 years of age, and we measured over 100 of these communication factors, these hormone-like proteins that transport information between tissues. And what we noticed first is that between the youngest and the oldest group, about half the factors changed significantly. So our body lives in a very different environment as we get older, when it comes to these factors. And using statistical or bioinformatics programs, we could try to discover those factors that best predict age \u2014 in a way, back-calculate the relative age of a person. And the way this looks is shown in this graph. So, on the one axis you see the actual age a person lived, the chronological age. So, how many years they lived.And then we take these top factors that I showed you, and we calculate their relative age, their biological age. And what you see is that there is a pretty good correlation, so we can pretty well predict the relative age of a person. But what's really exciting are the outliers, as they so often are in life. You can see here, the person I highlighted with the green dot is about 70 years of age but seems to have a biological age, if what we're doing here is really true, of only about 45. So is this a person that actually looks much younger than their age? But more importantly: Is this a person who is maybe at a reduced risk to develop an age-related disease and will have a long life \u2014 will live to 100 or more? On the other hand, the person here, highlighted with the red dot, is not even 40, but has a biological age of 65. Is this a person at an increased risk of developing an age-related disease? So in our lab, we're trying to understand these factors better, and many other groups are trying to understand, what are the true aging factors, and can we learn something about them to possibly predict age-related diseases?So what I've shown you so far is simply correlational, right? You can just say, \"Well, these factors change with age,\" but you don't really know if they do something about aging. So what I'm going to show you now is very remarkable and it suggests that these factors can actually modulate the age of a tissue. And that's where we come back to this model called parabiosis.So, parabiosis is done in mice by surgically connecting the two mice together, and that leads then to a shared blood system, where we can now ask, \"How does the old brain get influenced by exposure to the young blood?\" And for this purpose, we use young mice that are an equivalency of 20-year-old people, and old mice that are roughly 65 years old in human years.What we found is quite remarkable. We find there are more neural stem cells that make new neurons in these old brains. There's an increased activity of the synapses, the connections between neurons. There are more genes expressed that are known to be involved in the formation of new memories. And there's less of this bad inflammation. But we observed that there are no cells entering the brains of these animals. So when we connect them, there are actually no cells going into the old brain, in this model. Instead, we've reasoned, then, that it must be the soluble factors, so we could collect simply the soluble fraction of blood which is called plasma, and inject either young plasma or old plasma into these mice, and we could reproduce these rejuvenating effects, but what we could also do now is we could do memory tests with mice.As mice get older, like us humans, they have memory problems. It's just harder to detect them, but I'll show you in a minute how we do that. But we wanted to take this one step further, one step closer to potentially being relevant to humans. What I'm showing you now are unpublished studies, where we used human plasma, young human plasma, and as a control, saline, and injected it into old mice, and asked, can we again rejuvenate these old mice? Can we make them smarter?And to do this, we used a test. It's called a Barnes maze. This is a big table that has lots of holes in it, and there are guide marks around it, and there's a bright light, as on this stage here. The mice hate this and they try to escape, and find the single hole that you see pointed at with an arrow, where a tube is mounted underneath where they can escape and feel comfortable in a dark hole. So we teach them, over several days, to find this space on these cues in the space, and you can compare this for humans, to finding your car in a parking lot after a busy day of shopping.(Laughter)Many of us have probably had some problems with that.So, let's look at an old mouse here. This is an old mouse that has memory problems, as you'll notice in a moment. It just looks into every hole, but it didn't form this spacial map that would remind it where it was in the previous trial or the last day. In stark contrast, this mouse here is a sibling of the same age, but it was treated with young human plasma for three weeks, with small injections every three days. And as you noticed, it almost looks around, \"Where am I?\" \u2014 and then walks straight to that hole and escapes. So, it could remember where that hole was.So by all means, this old mouse seems to be rejuvenated \u2014 it functions more like a younger mouse. And it also suggests that there is something not only in young mouse plasma, but in young human plasma that has the capacity to help this old brain. So to summarize, we find the old mouse, and its brain in particular, are malleable. They're not set in stone; we can actually change them. It can be rejuvenated. Young blood factors can reverse aging, and what I didn't show you \u2014 in this model, the young mouse actually suffers from exposure to the old. So there are old-blood factors that can accelerate aging. And most importantly, humans may have similar factors, because we can take young human blood and have a similar effect. Old human blood, I didn't show you, does not have this effect; it does not make the mice younger.So, is this magic transferable to humans? We're running a small clinical study at Stanford, where we treat Alzheimer's patients with mild disease with a pint of plasma from young volunteers, 20-year-olds, and do this once a week for four weeks, and then we look at their brains with imaging. We test them cognitively, and we ask their caregivers for daily activities of living. What we hope is that there are some signs of improvement from this treatment. And if that's the case, that could give us hope that what I showed you works in mice might also work in humans.Now, I don't think we will live forever. But maybe we discovered that the Fountain of Youth is actually within us, and it has just dried out. And if we can turn it back on a little bit, maybe we can find the factors that are mediating these effects, we can produce these factors synthetically and we can treat diseases of aging, such as Alzheimer's disease or other dementias.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2315, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.092 --> 00:00:17.751\nThis is a

00:02:30.184\nwe can look at different aspects\nof human cognition,\n\n00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:31.961\nand you can see on this slide here,\n\n00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:35.368\nwe can look at reasoning,\nverbal ability and so forth.\n\n00:02:35.857 --> 00:02:41.136\nAnd up to around age 50 or 60,\nthese functions are all intact,\n\n00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.642\nand as I look at the young audience\nhere in the room, we're all still fine.\n\n00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:46.674\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:46.698 --> 00:02:50.505\nBut it's scary to see\nhow all these curves go south.\n\n00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:52.118\nAnd as we get older,\n\n00:02:52.142 --> 00:02:56.193\ndiseases such as Alzheimer's\nand others may develop.\n\n00:02:56.962 --> 00:03:00.533\nWe know that with age,\nthe connections between neurons --\n\n00:03:00.557 --> 00:03:05.208\nthe way neurons talk to each other,\nthe synapses -- they start to deteriorate;\n\n00:03:05.232 --> 00:03:08.538\nneurons die, the brain starts to shrink,\n\n00:03:08.562 --> 00:03:12.554\nand there's an increased susceptibility\nfor these neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n00:03:13.531 --> 00:03:18.440\nOne big problem we have -- to try\nto understand how this really works\n\n00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:21.060\nat a very molecular mechanistic level --\n\n00:03:21.084 --> 00:03:25.134\nis that we can't study the brains\nin detail, in living people.\n\n00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:28.977\nWe can do cognitive tests,\nwe can do imaging --\n\n00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:31.697\nall kinds of sophisticated testing.\n\n00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:35.339\nBut we usually have to wait\nuntil the person dies\n\n00:03:35.363 --> 00:03:40.457\nto get the brain and look at how it really\nchanged through age or in a disease.\n\n00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:43.910\nThis is what neuropathologists\ndo, for example.\n\n00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:49.958\nSo, how about we think of the brain\nas being part of the larger organism.\n\n00:03:49.982 --> 00:03:52.459\nCould we potentially understand more\n\n00:03:52.483 --> 00:03:55.412\nabout what happens in the brain\nat the molecular level\n\n00:03:55.436 --> 00:03:59.022\nif we see the brain\nas part of the entire body?\n\n00:03:59.046 --> 00:04:03.923\nSo if the body ages or gets sick,\ndoes that affect the brain?\n\n00:04:03.947 --> 00:04:08.370\nAnd vice versa: as the brain gets older,\ndoes that influence the rest of the body?\n\n00:04:09.008 --> 00:04:12.499\nAnd what connects all the different\ntissues in the body\n\n00:04:12.523 --> 00:04:13.673\nis blood.\n\n00:04:14.324 --> 00:04:20.149\nBlood is the tissue that not only carries\ncells that transport oxygen, for example,\n\n00:04:20.173 --> 00:04:21.414\nthe red blood cells,\n\n00:04:21.438 --> 00:04:23.638\nor fights infectious diseases,\n\n00:04:23.662 --> 00:04:27.933\nbut it also carries messenger molecules,\n\n00:04:27.957 --> 00:04:31.869\nhormone-like factors\nthat transport information\n\n00:04:31.893 --> 00:04:36.026\nfrom one cell to another,\nfrom one tissue to another,\n\n00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.507\nincluding the brain.\n\n00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:42.669\nSo if we look at how the blood\nchanges in disease or age,\n\n00:04:42.693 --> 00:04:45.056\ncan we learn something about the brain?\n\n00:04:45.609 --> 00:04:50.445\nWe know that as we get older,\nthe blood changes as well,\n\n00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:53.428\nso these hormone-like factors\nchange as we get older.\n\n00:04:53.452 --> 00:04:57.651\nAnd by and large,\nfactors that we know are required\n\n00:04:57.675 --> 00:05:01.096\nfor the development of tissues,\nfor the maintenance of tissues --\n\n00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.997\nthey start to decrease as we get older,\n\n00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:08.724\nwhile factors involved in repair,\nin injury and in inflammation --\n\n00:05:08.748 --> 00:05:10.698\nthey increase as we get older.\n\n00:05:10.722 --> 00:05:15.764\nSo there's this unbalance of good\nand bad factors, if you will.\n\n00:05:16.946 --> 00:05:19.939\nAnd to illustrate what we can do\npotentially with that,\n\n00:05:19.963 --> 00:05:22.615\nI want to talk you through\nan experiment that we did.\n\n00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.288\nWe had almost 300 blood samples\nfrom healthy human beings\n\n00:05:26.312 --> 00:05:28.829\n20 to 89 years of age,\n\n00:05:28.853 --> 00:05:32.748\nand we measured over 100\nof these communication factors,\n\n00:05:32.772 --> 00:05:36.866\nthese hormone-like proteins that\ntransport information between tissues.\n\n00:05:37.224 --> 00:05:38.900\nAnd what we noticed first\n\n00:05:38.924 --> 00:05:41.741\nis that between the youngest\nand the oldest group,\n\n00:05:41.765 --> 00:05:45.062\nabout half the factors\nchanged significantly.\n\n00:05:45.086 --> 00:05:48.221\nSo our body lives in a very\ndifferent environment as we get older,\n\n00:05:48.245 --> 00:05:49.996\nwhen it comes to these factors.\n\n00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.516\nAnd using statistical\nor bioinformatics programs,\n\n00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.234\nwe could try to discover\nthose factors that best predict age --\n\n00:05:58.258 --> 00:06:01.901\nin a way, back-calculate\nthe relative age of a person.\n\n00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:05.151\nAnd the way this looks\nis shown in this graph.\n\n00:06:05.576 --> 00:06:10.945\nSo, on the one axis you see\nthe actual age a person lived,\n\n00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:12.274\nthe chronological age.\n\n00:06:12.298 --> 00:06:14.020\nSo, how many years they lived.\n\n00:06:14.044 --> 00:06:16.752\nAnd then we take these top factors\nthat I showed you,\n\n00:06:16.776 --> 00:06:21.620\nand we calculate their relative age,\ntheir biological age.\n\n00:06:22.666 --> 00:06:26.300\nAnd what you see is that\nthere is a pretty good correlation,\n\n00:06:26.324 --> 00:06:29.639\nso we can pretty well predict\nthe relative age of a person.\n\n00:06:29.663 --> 00:06:33.578\nBut what's really exciting\nare the outliers,\n\n00:06:33.602 --> 00:06:35.406\nas they so often are in life.\n\n00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.448\nYou can see here, the person\nI highlighted with the green dot\n\n00:06:40.472 --> 00:06:43.068\nis about 70 years of age\n\n00:06:43.092 --> 00:06:48.098\nbut seems to have a biological age,\nif what we're doing here is really true,\n\n00:06:48.122 --> 00:06:50.165\nof only about 45.\n\n00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:53.673\nSo is this a person that actually\nlooks much younger than their age?\n\n00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:58.657\nBut more importantly: Is this a person\nwho is maybe at a reduced risk\n\n00:06:58.681 --> 00:07:02.005\nto develop an age-related disease\nand will have a long life --\n\n00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:03.524\nwill live to 100 or more?\n\n00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.921\nOn the other hand, the person here,\nhighlighted with the red dot,\n\n00:07:08.945 --> 00:07:13.851\nis not even 40,\nbut has a biological age of 65.\n\n00:07:13.875 --> 00:07:18.273\nIs this a person at an increased risk\nof developing an age-related disease?\n\n00:07:18.297 --> 00:07:21.953\nSo in our lab, we're trying\nto understand these factors better,\n\n00:07:21.977 --> 00:07:24.215\nand many other groups\nare trying to understand,\n\n00:07:24.239 --> 00:07:26.315\nwhat are the true aging factors,\n\n00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:31.312\nand can we learn something about them\nto possibly predict age-related diseases?\n\n00:07:32.239 --> 00:07:36.301\nSo what I've shown you so far\nis simply correlational, right?\n\n00:07:36.325 --> 00:07:40.356\nYou can just say,\n\"Well, these factors change with age,\"\n\n00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.035\nbut you don't really know\nif they do something about aging.\n\n00:07:44.989 --> 00:07:48.037\nSo what I'm going to show you now\nis very remarkable\n\n00:07:48.061 --> 00:07:53.132\nand it suggests that these factors\ncan actually modulate the age of a tissue.\n\n00:07:53.803 --> 00:07:57.101\nAnd that's where we come back\nto this model called parabiosis.\n\n00:07:57.125 --> 00:07:59.665\nSo, parabiosis is done in mice\n\n00:07:59.689 --> 00:08:04.601\nby surgically connecting\nthe two mice together,\n\n00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:06.958\nand that leads then\nto a shared blood system,\n\n00:08:06.982 --> 00:08:11.769\nwhere we can now ask,\n\"How does the old brain get influenced\n\n00:08:11.793 --> 00:08:13.531\nby exposure to the young blood?\"\n\n00:08:14.102 --> 00:08:16.306\nAnd for this purpose, we use young mice\n\n00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.783\nthat are an equivalency\nof 20-year-old people,\n\n00:08:19.807 --> 00:08:24.143\nand old mice that are roughly\n65 years old in human years.\n\n00:08:24.916 --> 00:08:27.742\nWhat we found is quite remarkable.\n\n00:08:27.766 --> 00:08:31.486\nWe find there are more neural stem cells\nthat make new neurons\n\n00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:32.842\nin these old brains.\n\n00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:35.891\nThere's an increased\nactivity of the synapses,\n\n00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:37.954\nthe connections between neurons.\n\n00:08:37.978 --> 00:08:41.263\nThere are more genes expressed\nthat are known to be involved\n\n00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:43.034\nin the formation of new memories.\n\n00:08:43.617 --> 00:08:46.125\nAnd there's less of this bad inflammation.\n\n00:08:47.385 --> 00:08:53.881\nBut we observed that there are no cells\nentering the brains of these animals.\n\n00:08:53.905 --> 00:08:55.291\nSo when we connect them,\n\n00:08:55.315 --> 00:09:00.691\nthere are actually no cells\ngoing into the old brain, in this model.\n\n00:09:01.337 --> 00:09:04.998\nInstead, we've reasoned, then,\nthat it must be the soluble factors,\n\n00:09:05.022 --> 00:09:09.805\nso we could collect simply the soluble\nfraction of blood which is called plasma,\n\n00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:13.773\nand inject either young plasma\nor old plasma into these mice,\n\n00:09:13.797 --> 00:09:16.165\nand we could reproduce\nthese rejuvenating effects,\n\n00:09:16.189 --> 00:09:17.903\nbut what we could also do now\n\n00:09:17.927 --> 00:09:20.377\nis we could do memory tests with mice.\n\n00:09:20.401 --> 00:09:24.254\nAs mice get older, like us humans,\nthey have memory problems.\n\n00:09:24.776 --> 00:09:26.369\nIt's just harder to detect them,\n\n00:09:26.393 --> 00:09:28.737\nbut I'll show you in a minute\nhow we do that.\n\n00:09:28.761 --> 00:09:31.456\nBut we wanted to take this\none step further,\n\n00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.520\none step closer to potentially\nbeing relevant to humans.\n\n00:09:35.544 --> 00:09:38.741\nWhat I'm showing you now\nare unpublished studies,\n\n00:09:38.765 --> 00:09:43.298\nwhere we used human plasma,\nyoung human plasma,\n\n00:09:43.322 --> 00:09:45.171\nand as a control, saline,\n\n00:09:45.195 --> 00:09:47.071\nand injected it into old mice,\n\n00:09:47.095 --> 00:09:51.947\nand asked, can we again\nrejuvenate these old mice?\n\n00:09:51.971 --> 00:09:53.631\nCan we make them smarter?\n\n00:09:54.062 --> 00:09:57.351\nAnd to do this, we used a test.\nIt's called a Barnes maze.\n\n00:09:57.375 --> 00:10:00.530\nThis is a big table\nthat has lots of holes in it,\n\n00:10:00.554 --> 00:10:04.037\nand there are guide marks around it,\n\n00:10:04.061 --> 00:10:06.667\nand there's a bright light,\nas on this stage here.\n\n00:10:06.691 --> 00:10:09.824\nThe mice hate this and they try to escape,\n\n00:10:09.848 --> 00:10:14.104\nand find the single hole that you see\npointed at with an arrow,\n\n00:10:14.128 --> 00:10:16.073\nwhere a tube is mounted underneath\n\n00:10:16.097 --> 00:10:19.290\nwhere they can escape\nand feel comfortable in a dark hole.\n\n00:10:19.935 --> 00:10:21.737\nSo we teach them, over several days,\n\n00:10:21.761 --> 00:10:24.664\nto find this space\non these cues in the space,\n\n00:10:24.688 --> 00:10:27.482\nand you can compare this for humans,\n\n00:10:27.506 --> 00:10:31.736\nto finding your car in a parking lot\nafter a busy day of shopping.\n\n00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.761\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:32.785 --> 00:10:36.536\nMany of us have probably had\nsome problems with that.\n\n00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.578\nSo, let's look at an old mouse here.\n\n00:10:38.912 --> 00:10:41.088\nThis is an old mouse\nthat has memory problems,\n\n00:10:41.112 --> 00:10:42.801\nas you'll notice in a moment.\n\n00:10:43.263 --> 00:10:47.987\nIt just looks into every hole,\nbut it didn't form this spacial map\n\n00:10:48.011 --> 00:10:53.258\nthat would remind it where it was\nin the previous trial or the last day.\n\n00:10:53.831 --> 00:10:59.298\nIn stark contrast, this mouse here\nis a sibling of the same age,\n\n00:10:59.322 --> 00:11:04.741\nbut it was treated with young\nhuman plasma for three weeks,\n\n00:11:04.765 --> 00:11:07.298\nwith small injections every three days.\n\n00:11:07.699 --> 00:11:11.922\nAnd as you noticed, it almost\nlooks around, \"Where am I?\" --\n\n00:11:11.946 --> 00:11:14.853\nand then walks straight\nto that hole and escapes.\n\n00:11:14.877 --> 00:11:17.741\nSo, it could remember where that hole was.\n\n00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.388\nSo by all means, this old mouse\nseems to be rejuvenated --\n\n00:11:22.412 --> 00:11:24.791\nit functions more like a younger mouse.\n\n00:11:24.815 --> 00:11:27.521\nAnd it also suggests\nthat there is something\n\n00:11:27.545 --> 00:11:32.536\nnot only in young mouse plasma,\nbut in young human plasma\n\n00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.220\nthat has the capacity\nto help this old brain.\n\n00:11:36.792 --> 00:11:37.944\nSo to summarize,\n\n00:11:37.968 --> 00:11:42.167\nwe find the old mouse, and its brain\nin particular, are malleable.\n\n00:11:42.191 --> 00:11:45.642\nThey're not set in stone;\nwe can actually change them.\n\n00:11:45.666 --> 00:11:47.139\nIt can be rejuvenated.\n\n00:11:47.638 --> 00:11:50.235\nYoung blood factors can reverse aging,\n\n00:11:50.259 --> 00:11:51.971\nand what I didn't show you --\n\n00:11:51.995 --> 00:11:57.217\nin this model, the young mouse actually\nsuffers from exposure to the old.\n\n00:11:57.241 --> 00:12:00.621\nSo there are old-blood factors\nthat can accelerate aging.\n\n00:12:01.683 --> 00:12:06.000\nAnd most importantly,\nhumans may have similar factors,\n\n00:12:06.024 --> 00:12:10.102\nbecause we can take young human\nblood and have a similar effect.\n\n00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:14.106\nOld human blood, I didn't show you,\ndoes not have this effect;\n\n00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:15.892\nit does not make the mice younger.\n\n00:12:17.029 --> 00:12:20.657\nSo, is this magic transferable to humans?\n\n00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:24.310\nWe're running a small\nclinical study at Stanford,\n\n00:12:24.334 --> 00:12:28.210\nwhere we treat Alzheimer's patients\nwith mild disease\n\n00:12:28.234 --> 00:12:34.844\nwith a pint of plasma\nfrom young volunteers, 20-year-olds,\n\n00:12:34.868 --> 00:12:37.463\nand do this once a week for four weeks,\n\n00:12:37.487 --> 00:12:40.650\nand then we look\nat their brains with imaging.\n\n00:12:41.008 --> 00:12:42.852\nWe test them cognitively,\n\n00:12:42.876 --> 00:12:46.882\nand we ask their caregivers\nfor daily activities of

factors\nthat are mediating these effects,\n\n00:13:19.035 --> 00:13:21.622\nwe can produce these factors synthetically\n\n00:13:21.646 --> 00:13:25.659\nand we can treat diseases of aging,\nsuch as

surveillance ... with the phone in your pocket", "duration": "376", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/christopher_soghoian_a_brief_history_of_phone_wiretapping_and_how_to_avoid_it", "transcript": "For more than 100 years, the telephone companies have provided wiretapping assistance to governments.For much of this time, this assistance was manual. Surveillance took place manually and wires were connected by hand. Calls were recorded to tape. But as in so many other industries, computing has changed everything. The telephone companies built surveillance features into the very core of their networks. I want that to sink in for a second: Our telephones and the networks that carry our calls were wired for surveillance first. First and foremost.So what that means is that when you're talking to your spouse, your children, a colleague or your doctor on the telephone, someone could be listening. Now, that someone might be your own government; it could also be another government, a foreign intelligence service, or a hacker, or a criminal, or a stalker or any other party that breaks into the surveillance system, that hacks into the surveillance system of the telephone companies.But while the telephone companies have built surveillance as a priority, Silicon Valley companies have not. And increasingly, over the last couple years, Silicon Valley companies have built strong encryption technology into their communications products that makes surveillance extremely difficult.For example, many of you might have an iPhone, and if you use an iPhone to send a text message to other people who have an iPhone, those text messages cannot easily be wiretapped. And in fact, according to Apple, they're not able to even see the text messages themselves. Likewise, if you use FaceTime to make an audio call or a video call with one of your friends or loved ones, that, too, cannot be easily wiretapped.And it's not just Apple. WhatsApp, which is now owned by Facebook and used by hundreds of millions of people around the world, also has built strong encryption technology into its product, which means that people in the Global South can easily communicate without their governments, often authoritarian, wiretapping their text messages.So, after 100 years of being able to listen to any telephone call \u2014 anytime, anywhere \u2014 you might imagine that government officials are not very happy. And in fact, that's what's happening. Government officials are extremely mad. And they're not mad because these encryption tools are now available. What upsets them the most is that the tech companies have built encryption features into their products and turned them on by default. It's the default piece that matters.In short, the tech companies have democratized encryption. And so, government officials like British Prime Minister David Cameron, they believe that all communications \u2014 emails, texts, voice calls \u2014 all of these should be available to governments, and encryption is making that difficult.Now, look \u2014 I'm extremely sympathetic to their point of view. We live in a dangerous time in a dangerous world, and there really are bad people out there. There are terrorists and other serious national security threats that I suspect we all want the FBI and the NSA to monitor.But those surveillance features come at a cost. The reason for that is that there is no such thing as a terrorist laptop, or a drug dealer's cell phone. We all use the same communications devices. What that means is that if the drug dealers' telephone calls or the terrorists' telephone calls can be intercepted, then so can the rest of ours, too. And I think we really need to ask: Should a billion people around the world be using devices that are wiretap friendly?So the scenario of hacking of surveillance systems that I've described \u2014 this is not imaginary. In 2009, the surveillance systems that Google and Microsoft built into their networks \u2014 the systems that they use to respond to lawful surveillance requests from the police \u2014 those systems were compromised by the Chinese government, because the Chinese government wanted to figure out which of their own agents the US government was monitoring.By the same token, in 2004, the surveillance system built into the network of Vodafone Greece \u2014 Greece's largest telephone company \u2014 was compromised by an unknown entity, and that feature, the surveillance feature, was used to wiretap the Greek Prime Minister and members of the Greek cabinet. The foreign government or hackers who did that were never caught.And really, this gets to the very problem with these surveillance features, or backdoors. When you build a backdoor into a communications network or piece of technology, you have no way of controlling who's going to go through it. You have no way of controlling whether it'll be used by your side or the other side, by good guys, or by bad guys.And so for that reason, I think that it's better to build networks to be as secure as possible. Yes, this means that in the future, encryption is going to make wiretapping more difficult. It means that the police are going to have a tougher time catching bad guys. But the alternative would mean to live in a world where anyone's calls or anyone's text messages could be surveilled by criminals, by stalkers and by foreign intelligence agencies. And I don't want to live in that kind of world.And so right now, you probably have the tools to thwart many kinds of government surveillance already on your phones and already in your pockets, you just might not realize how strong and how secure those tools are, or how weak the other ways you've used to communicate really are.And so, my message to you is this: We need to use these tools. We need to secure our telephone calls. We need to secure our text messages. I want you to use these tools. I want you to tell your loved ones, I want you to tell your colleagues: Use these encrypted communications tools. Don't just use them because they're cheap and easy, but use them because they're secure.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2314, "subtitle":

mountains, and I sort of came like a forest gnome to New York City a while back. (Laughter) Really messed with my head, but I'll get into that later.I'll start with when I was eight years old. I took a wood box, and I buried a dollar bill, a pen and a fork inside this box in Colorado. And I thought some strange humanoids or aliens in 500 years would find this box and learn about the way our species exchanged ideas, maybe how we ate our spaghetti. I really didn't know. Anyway, this is kind of funny, because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.Now, at some point I was in Hawaii \u2014 I like to hike and surf and do all that weird stuff, and I was making a collage for my ma. And I took a dictionary and I ripped it up, and I made it into a sort of Agnes Martin grid, and I poured resin all over it and a bee got stuck. Now, she's afraid of bees and she's allergic to them, so I poured more resin on the canvas, thinking I could hide it or something. Instead, the opposite happened: It sort of created a magnification, like a magnifying glass, on the dictionary text.So what did I do? I built more boxes. This time, I started putting electronics, frogs, strange bottles I'd find in the street \u2014 anything I could find \u2014 because I was always finding things my whole life, and trying to make relationships and tell stories between these objects. So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized: Holy moly, I can draw in space! I can make free-floating lines, like the way you would draw around a dead body at a crime scene. So I took the objects out, and I created my own taxonomy of invented specimens. First, botanical \u2014 which you can kind of get a sense of. Then I made some weird insects and creatures. It was really fun; I was just drawing on the layers of resin.And it was cool, because I was actually starting to have shows and stuff, I was making some money, I could take my girlfriend for dinner, and like, go to Sizzler. It was some good shit, man. (Laughter)At some point, I got up to the human form, life-size resin sculptures with drawings of humans inside the layers. This was great, except for one thing: I was going to die. I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me. And I went to bed every night thinking about it.So I tried using glass. I started drawing on the layers of glass, almost like if you drew on a window, then you put another window, and another window, and you had all these windows together that made a three-dimensional composition. And this really worked, because I could stop using the resin.So I did this for years, which culminated in a very large work, which I call \"The Triptych.\" \"The Triptych\" was largely inspired by Hieronymus Bosch's \"[The] Garden of Earthly Delights,\" which is a painting in the [Museo del] Prado in Spain. Do you guys know this painting? Good, it's a cool painting. It's kind of ahead of its time, they say. So, \"The Triptych.\" I'll walk you through this piece. It weighs 24,000 pounds. It's 18 feet long. It's double-sided, so it's 36 feet of composition. It's kind of weird. Well, that's the blood fountain. (Laughter) To the left, you have Jesus and the locusts. There's a cave where all these animal-headed creatures travel between two worlds. They go from the representational world, to this analog-mesh underworld, where they're hiding. This is where the animal-headed creatures are by the lighthouse, and they're all about to commit mass suicide into the ocean. The ocean is made up of thousands of elements. This is a bird god tied up to a battleship. (Laughter) Billy Graham is in the ocean; the Horizon from the oil spill; Waldo; Osama Bin Laden's shelter \u2014 there's all kinds of weird stuff that you can find if you look really hard, in the ocean. Anyway, this is a lady creature. She's coming out of the ocean, and she's spitting oil into one hand and she has clouds coming out of her other hand. Her hands are like scales, and she has the mythological reference of the Earth and cosmos in balance.So that's one side of \"The Triptych.\" It's a little narrative thing. That's her hand that she's spitting into. And then, when you go to the other side, she has like a trunk, like a bird's beak, and she's spitting clouds out of her trunk. Then she has an 18-foot-long serpent's tail that connects \"The Triptych.\" Anyway, her tail catches on fire from the back of the volcano. (Laughter) I don't know why that happened.(Laughter)That happens, you know. Her tail terminates in a cycloptic eyeball, made out of 1986 terrorist cards. Have you guys seen those? They were made in the 1980's, they're like baseball cards of terrorists. Way ahead of their time.(Laughter)That will bring you to my latest project. I'm in the middle of two projects: One's called \"Psychogeographies.\" It's about a six-year project to make 100 of these humans. Each one is an archive of our culture, through our ripped-up media and matter, whether it's encyclopedias or dictionaries or magazines. But each one acts as a sort of an archive in the shape of a human, and they travel in groups of 20, 4, or 12 at a time. They're like cells \u2014 they come together, they divide. And you kind of walk through them. It's taking me years. Each one is basically a 3,000-pound microscope slide with a human stuck inside.This one has a little cave in his chest. That's his head; there's the chest, you can kind of see the beginning. I'm going to go down the body for you: There's a waterfall coming out of his chest, covering his penis \u2014 or not-penis, or whatever it is, a kind of androgynous thing. I'll take you quickly through these works, because I can't explain them for too long. There are the layers, you can kind of see it. That's a body getting split in half. This one has two heads, and it's communicating between the two heads. You can see the pills coming out, going into one head from this weird statue. There's a little forest scene inside the chest cavity. Can you see that?Anyway, this talk's all about these boxes, like the boxes we're in. This box we're in, the solar system is a box. This brings you to my latest box. It's a brick box. It's called Pioneer Works.(Cheers)Inside of this box is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a writer, a radio station, a museum, a school, a publishing arm to disseminate all the content we make there into the world; a garden. We shake this box up, and all these people kind of start hitting each other like particles.And I think that's the way you change the world. You redefine your insides and the box that you're living in. And you come together to realize that we're all in this together, that this delusion of difference \u2014 this idea of countries, of borders, of religion \u2014 doesn't work. We're all really made up of the same stuff, in the same box. And if we don't start exchanging that stuff sweetly and nicely, we're all going to die real soon.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2319, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.728\nI was raised by lesbians in the mountains,\n\n00:00:14.752 --> 00:00:18.326\nand I sort of came like a forest gnome\nto New York City a while back.\n\n00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.484\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:19.508 --> 00:00:24.292\nReally messed with my head,\nbut I'll get into that later.\n\n00:00:24.927 --> 00:00:27.353\nI'll start with when\nI was eight years old.\n\n00:00:27.697 --> 00:00:29.613\nI took a wood box,\n\n00:00:29.637 --> 00:00:34.732\nand I buried a dollar bill, a pen\nand a fork inside this box in Colorado.\n\n00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:40.673\nAnd I thought some strange humanoids\nor aliens in 500 years would find this box\n\n00:00:40.697 --> 00:00:45.223\nand learn about the way\nour species exchanged ideas,\n\n00:00:45.247 --> 00:00:47.281\nmaybe how we ate our spaghetti.\n\n00:00:47.305 --> 00:00:48.637\nI really didn't know.\n\n00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:50.796\nAnyway, this is kind of funny,\n\n00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.167\nbecause here I am, 30 years later,\nand I'm still making boxes.\n\n00:00:56.247 --> 00:00:59.230\nNow, at some point I was in Hawaii --\n\n00:00:59.254 --> 00:01:01.756\nI like to hike and surf\nand do all that weird stuff,\n\n00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.872\nand I was making a collage for my ma.\n\n00:01:04.308 --> 00:01:06.396\nAnd I took a dictionary\nand I ripped it up,\n\n00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.155\nand I made it into a sort\nof Agnes Martin grid,\n\n00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:11.750\nand I poured resin all over it\nand a bee got stuck.\n\n00:01:11.774 --> 00:01:14.492\nNow, she's afraid of bees\nand she's allergic to them,\n\n00:01:14.516 --> 00:01:18.751\nso I poured more resin on the canvas,\nthinking I could hide it or something.\n\n00:01:18.775 --> 00:01:20.315\nInstead, the opposite happened:\n\n00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:22.021\nIt sort of created a magnification,\n\n00:01:22.045 --> 00:01:24.433\nlike a magnifying glass,\non the dictionary text.\n\n00:01:25.236 --> 00:01:27.458\nSo what did I do? I built more boxes.\n\n00:01:27.916 --> 00:01:31.820\nThis time, I started putting\nelectronics, frogs,\n\n00:01:31.844 --> 00:01:35.391\nstrange bottles I'd find in the street --\nanything I could find --\n\n00:01:35.415 --> 00:01:37.764\nbecause I was always\nfinding things my whole life,\n\n00:01:37.788 --> 00:01:41.426\nand trying to make relationships\nand tell stories between these objects.\n\n00:01:41.854 --> 00:01:44.235\nSo I started drawing around the objects,\n\n00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.571\nand I realized: Holy moly,\nI can draw in space!\n\n00:01:47.595 --> 00:01:49.594\nI can make free-floating lines,\n\n00:01:49.618 --> 00:01:52.641\nlike the way you would draw\naround a dead body at a crime scene.\n\n00:01:52.665 --> 00:01:53.941\nSo I took the objects out,\n\n00:01:53.965 --> 00:01:56.930\nand I created my own taxonomy\nof invented specimens.\n\n00:01:57.418 --> 00:02:00.732\nFirst, botanical --\nwhich you can kind of get a sense of.\n\n00:02:01.478 --> 00:02:04.618\nThen I made some\nweird insects and creatures.\n\n00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.824\nIt was really fun; I was just\ndrawing on the layers of resin.\n\n00:02:08.848 --> 00:02:12.306\nAnd it was cool, because I was actually\nstarting to have shows and stuff,\n\n00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.302\nI was making some money,\nI could take my girlfriend for dinner,\n\n00:02:15.326 --> 00:02:16.581\nand like, go to Sizzler.\n\n00:02:16.605 --> 00:02:18.010\nIt was some good shit, man.\n\n00:02:18.034 --> 00:02:19.662\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:19.686 --> 00:02:23.592\nAt some point, I got up to the human form,\n\n00:02:23.616 --> 00:02:28.243\nlife-size resin sculptures\nwith drawings of humans inside the layers.\n\n00:02:28.267 --> 00:02:30.726\nThis was great, except for one thing:\n\n00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.000\nI was going to die.\n\n00:02:32.494 --> 00:02:35.557\nI didn't know what to do,\nbecause the resin was going to kill me.\n\n00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:37.894\nAnd I went to bed every night\nthinking about it.\n\n00:02:37.918 --> 00:02:40.410\nSo I tried using glass.\n\n00:02:40.434 --> 00:02:42.423\nI started drawing on the layers of glass,\n\n00:02:42.447 --> 00:02:45.519\nalmost like if you drew on a window,\nthen you put another window,\n\n00:02:45.543 --> 00:02:48.286\nand another window, and you had\nall these windows together\n\n00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.445\nthat made a three-dimensional composition.\n\n00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:53.402\nAnd this really worked,\nbecause I could stop using the resin.\n\n00:02:53.895 --> 00:02:55.276\nSo I did this for years,\n\n00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.735\nwhich culminated in a very large work,\nwhich I call \"The Triptych.\"\n\n00:03:00.085 --> 00:03:02.006\n\"The Triptych\" was largely inspired\n\n00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.967\nby Hieronymus Bosch's\n\"[The] Garden of Earthly Delights,\"\n\n00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:07.615\nwhich is a painting\nin the [Museo del] Prado in Spain.\n\n00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:09.338\nDo you guys know this painting?\n\n00:03:09.362 --> 00:03:10.655\nGood, it's a cool painting.\n\n00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:12.653\nIt's kind of ahead of its time, they say.\n\n00:03:12.677 --> 00:03:15.168\nSo, \"The Triptych.\"\nI'll walk you through this piece.\n\n00:03:15.192 --> 00:03:17.490\nIt weighs 24,000 pounds.\n\n00:03:18.863 --> 00:03:20.840\nIt's 18 feet long.\n\n00:03:20.864 --> 00:03:23.615\nIt's double-sided,\nso it's 36 feet of composition.\n\n00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:24.797\nIt's kind of weird.\n\n00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:29.018\nWell, that's the blood fountain.\n\n00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:31.255\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:33.498\nTo the left, you have\nJesus and the locusts.\n\n00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.637\nThere's a cave\n\n00:03:35.661 --> 00:03:38.908\nwhere all these animal-headed creatures\ntravel between two worlds.\n\n00:03:38.932 --> 00:03:40.854\nThey go from the representational world,\n\n00:03:40.878 --> 00:03:43.762\nto this analog-mesh underworld,\nwhere they're hiding.\n\n00:03:43.786 --> 00:03:46.849\nThis is where the animal-headed creatures\nare by the lighthouse,\n\n00:03:46.873 --> 00:03:49.712\nand they're all about to commit\nmass suicide into the ocean.\n\n00:03:49.736 --> 00:03:52.704\nThe ocean is made up\nof thousands of elements.\n\n00:03:52.728 --> 00:03:55.027\nThis is a bird god\ntied up to a battleship.\n\n00:03:55.051 --> 00:03:56.089\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:56.113 --> 00:03:57.717\nBilly Graham is in the ocean;\n\n00:03:57.741 --> 00:04:01.968\nthe Horizon from the oil spill;\nWaldo;

Quantum biology asks a very simple question: Does quantum mechanics \u2014 that weird and wonderful and powerful theory of the subatomic world of atoms and molecules that underpins so much of modern physics and chemistry \u2014 also play a role inside the living cell? In other words: Are there processes, mechanisms, phenomena in living organisms that can only be explained with a helping hand from quantum mechanics? Now, quantum biology isn't new; it's been around since the early 1930s. But it's only in the last decade or so that careful experiments \u2014 in biochemistry labs, using spectroscopy \u2014 have shown very clear, firm evidence that there are certain specific mechanisms that require quantum mechanics to explain them.Quantum biology brings together quantum physicists, biochemists, molecular biologists \u2014 it's a very interdisciplinary field. I come from quantum physics, so I'm a nuclear physicist.I've spent more than three decades trying to get my head around quantum mechanics. One of the founders of quantum mechanics, Niels Bohr, said, If you're not astonished by it, then you haven't understood it. So I sort of feel happy that I'm still astonished by it. That's a good thing. But it means I study the very smallest structures in the universe \u2014 the building blocks of reality. If we think about the scale of size, start with an everyday object like the tennis ball, and just go down orders of magnitude in size \u2014 from the eye of a needle down to a cell, down to a bacterium, down to an enzyme \u2014 you eventually reach the nano-world.Now, nanotechnology may be a term you've heard of. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter. My area is the atomic nucleus, which is the tiny dot inside an atom. It's even smaller in scale. This is the domain of quantum mechanics, and physicists and chemists have had a long time to try and get used to it. Biologists, on the other hand, have got off lightly, in my view. They are very happy with their balls-and-sticks models of molecules.(Laughter)The balls are the atoms, the sticks are the bonds between the atoms. And when they can't build them physically in the lab, nowadays, they have very powerful computers that will simulate a huge molecule. This is a protein made up of 100,000 atoms. It doesn't really require much in the way of quantum mechanics to explain it. Quantum mechanics was developed in the 1920s. It is a set of beautiful and powerful mathematical rules and ideas that explain the world of the very small. And it's a world that's very different from our everyday world, made up of trillions of atoms. It's a world built on probability and chance. It's a fuzzy world. It's a world of phantoms, where particles can also behave like spread-out waves.If we imagine quantum mechanics or quantum physics, then, as the fundamental foundation of reality itself, then it's not surprising that we say quantum physics underpins organic chemistry. After all, it gives us the rules that tell us how the atoms fit together to make organic molecules. Organic chemistry, scaled up in complexity, gives us molecular biology, which of course leads to life itself. So in a way, it's sort of not surprising. It's almost trivial. You say, \"Well, of course life ultimately must depend of quantum mechanics.\" But so does everything else. So does all inanimate matter, made up of trillions of atoms.Ultimately, there's a quantum level where we have to delve into this weirdness. But in everyday life, we can forget about it. Because once you put together trillions of atoms, that quantum weirdness just dissolves away. Quantum biology isn't about this. Quantum biology isn't this obvious. Of course quantum mechanics underpins life at some molecular level. Quantum biology is about looking for the non-trivial \u2014 the counterintuitive ideas in quantum mechanics \u2014 and to see if they do, indeed, play an important role in describing the processes of life.Here is my perfect example of the counterintuitiveness of the quantum world. This is the quantum skier. He seems to be intact, he seems to be perfectly healthy, and yet, he seems to have gone around both sides of that tree at the same time. Well, if you saw tracks like that you'd guess it was some sort of stunt, of course. But in the quantum world, this happens all the time. Particles can multitask, they can be in two places at once. They can do more than one thing at the same time. Particles can behave like spread-out waves. It's almost like magic.Physicists and chemists have had nearly a century of trying to get used to this weirdness. I don't blame the biologists for not having to or wanting to learn quantum mechanics.You see, this weirdness is very delicate; and we physicists work very hard to maintain it in our labs. We cool our system down to near absolute zero, we carry out our experiments in vacuums, we try and isolate it from any external disturbance. That's very different from the warm, messy, noisy environment of a living cell. Biology itself, if you think of molecular biology, seems to have done very well in describing all the processes of life in terms of chemistry \u2014 chemical reactions. And these are reductionist, deterministic chemical reactions, showing that, essentially, life is made of the same stuff as everything else, and if we can forget about quantum mechanics in the macro world, then we should be able to forget about it in biology, as well.Well, one man begged to differ with this idea. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, of Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat fame, was an Austrian physicist. He was one of the founders of quantum mechanics in the 1920s. In 1944, he wrote a book called \"What is Life?\" It was tremendously influential. It influenced Francis Crick and James Watson, the discoverers of the double-helix structure of DNA. To paraphrase a description in the book, he says: At the molecular level, living organisms have a certain order, a structure to them that's very different from the random thermodynamic jostling of atoms and molecules in inanimate matter of the same complexity.In fact, living matter seems to behave in this order, in a structure, just like inanimate matter cooled down to near absolute zero, where quantum effects play a very important role. There's something special about the structure \u2014 the order \u2014 inside a living cell. So, Schr\u00f6dinger speculated that maybe quantum mechanics plays a role in life. It's a very speculative, far-reaching idea, and it didn't really go very far.But as I mentioned at the start, in the last 10 years, there have been experiments emerging, showing where some of these certain phenomena in biology do seem to require quantum mechanics.I want to share with you just a few of the exciting ones. This is one of the best-known phenomena in the quantum world, quantum tunneling. The box on the left shows the wavelike, spread-out distribution of a quantum entity \u2014 a particle, like an electron, which is not a little ball bouncing off a wall. It's a wave that has a certain probability of being able to permeate through a solid wall, like a phantom leaping through to the other side. You can see a faint smudge of light in the right-hand box. Quantum tunneling suggests that a particle can hit an impenetrable barrier, and yet somehow, as though by magic, disappear from one side and reappear on the other. The nicest way of explaining it is if you want to throw a ball over a wall, you have to give it enough energy to get over the top of the wall. In the quantum world, you don't have to throw it over the wall, you can throw it at the wall, and there's a certain non-zero probability that it'll disappear on your side, and reappear on the other.This isn't speculation, by the way. We're happy \u2014 well, \"happy\" is not the right word \u2014(Laughter)we are familiar with this.(Laughter)Quantum tunneling takes place all the time; in fact, it's the reason our Sun shines. The particles fuse together, and the Sun turns hydrogen into helium through quantum tunneling. Back in the 70s and 80s, it was discovered that quantum tunneling also takes place inside living cells. Enzymes, those workhorses of life, the catalysts of chemical reactions \u2014 enzymes are biomolecules that speed up chemical reactions in living cells, by many, many orders of magnitude. And it's always been a mystery how they do this.Well, it was discovered that one of the tricks that enzymes have evolved to make use of, is by transferring subatomic particles, like electrons and indeed protons, from one part of a molecule to another via quantum tunneling. It's efficient, it's fast, it can disappear \u2014 a proton can disappear from one place, and reappear on the other. Enzymes help this take place.This is research that's been carried out back in the 80s, particularly by a group in Berkeley, Judith Klinman. Other groups in the UK have now also confirmed that enzymes really do this.Research carried out by my group \u2014 so as I mentioned, I'm a nuclear physicist, but I've realized I've got these tools of using quantum mechanics in atomic nuclei, and so can apply those tools in other areas as well. One question we asked is whether quantum tunneling plays a role in mutations in DNA. Again, this is not a new idea; it goes all the way back to the early 60s. The two strands of DNA, the double-helix structure, are held together by rungs; it's like a twisted ladder. And those rungs of the ladder are hydrogen bonds \u2014 protons, that act as the glue between the two strands. So if you zoom in, what they're doing is holding these large molecules \u2014 nucleotides \u2014 together. Zoom in a bit more. So, this a computer simulation. The two white balls in the middle are protons, and you can see that it's a double hydrogen bond. One prefers to sit on one side; the other, on the other side of the two strands of the vertical lines going down, which you can't see. It can happen that these two protons can hop over. Watch the two white balls. They can jump over to the other side. If the two strands of DNA then separate, leading to the process of replication, and the two protons are in the wrong positions, this can lead to a mutation.This has been known for half a century. The question is: How likely are they to do that, and if they do, how do they do it? Do they jump across, like the ball going over the wall? Or can they quantum-tunnel across, even if they don't have enough energy? Early indications suggest that quantum tunneling can play a role here. We still don't know yet how important it is; this is still an open question. It's speculative, but it's one of those questions that is so important that if quantum mechanics plays a role in mutations, surely this must have big implications, to understand certain types of mutations, possibly even those that lead to turning a cell cancerous.Another example of quantum mechanics in biology is quantum coherence, in one of the most important processes in biology, photosynthesis: plants and bacteria taking sunlight, and using that energy to create biomass. Quantum coherence is the idea of quantum entities multitasking. It's the quantum skier. It's an object that behaves like a wave, so that it doesn't just move in one direction or the other, but can follow multiple pathways at the same time.Some years ago, the world of science was shocked when a paper was published showing experimental evidence that quantum coherence takes place inside bacteria, carrying out photosynthesis. The idea is that the photon, the particle of light, the sunlight, the quantum of light captured by a chlorophyll molecule, is then delivered to what's called the reaction center, where it can be turned into chemical energy. And in getting there, it doesn't just follow one route; it follows multiple pathways at once, to optimize the most efficient way of reaching the reaction center without dissipating as waste heat. Quantum coherence taking place inside a living cell. A remarkable idea, and yet evidence is growing almost weekly, with new papers coming out, confirming that this does indeed take place.My third and final example is the most beautiful, wonderful idea. It's also still very speculative, but I have to share it with you. The European robin migrates from Scandinavia down to the Mediterranean, every autumn, and like a lot of other marine animals and even insects, they navigate by sensing the Earth's magnetic field. Now, the Earth's magnetic field is very, very weak; it's 100 times weaker than a fridge magnet, and yet it affects the chemistry \u2014 somehow \u2014 within a living organism. That's not in doubt \u2014 a German couple of ornithologists, Wolfgang and Roswitha Wiltschko, in the 1970s, confirmed that indeed, the robin does find its way by somehow sensing the Earth's magnetic field, to give it directional information \u2014 a built-in compass.The puzzle, the mystery was: How does it do it? Well, the only theory in town \u2014 we don't know if it's the correct theory, but the only theory in town \u2014 is that it does it via something called quantum entanglement. Inside the robin's retina \u2014 I kid you not \u2014 inside the robin's retina is a protein called cryptochrome, which is light-sensitive. Within cryptochrome, a pair of electrons are quantum-entangled. Now, quantum entanglement is when two particles are far apart, and yet somehow remain in contact with each other. Even Einstein hated this idea; he called it \"spooky action at a distance.\"(Laughter)So if Einstein doesn't like it, then we can all be uncomfortable with it. Two quantum-entangled electrons within a single molecule dance a delicate dance that is very sensitive to the direction the bird flies in the Earth's magnetic field.We don't know if it's the correct explanation, but wow, wouldn't it be exciting if quantum mechanics helps birds navigate? Quantum biology is still in it infancy. It's still speculative. But I believe it's built on solid science. I also think that in the coming decade or so, we're going to start to see that actually, it pervades life \u2014 that life has evolved tricks that utilize the quantum world.

reality.\n\n00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:57.054\nIf we think about the scale of size,\n\n00:01:57.078 --> 00:02:00.030\nstart with an everyday object\nlike the tennis ball,\n\n00:02:00.054 --> 00:02:02.955\nand just go down orders\nof magnitude in size --\n\n00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.176\nfrom the eye of a needle down to a cell,\ndown to a bacterium, down to an enzyme --\n\n00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.929\nyou eventually reach the nano-world.\n\n00:02:09.953 --> 00:02:12.448\nNow, nanotechnology may be\na term you've heard of.\n\n00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.652\nA nanometer is a billionth of a meter.\n\n00:02:16.518 --> 00:02:20.888\nMy area is the atomic nucleus,\nwhich is the tiny dot inside an atom.\n\n00:02:20.912 --> 00:02:22.844\nIt's even smaller in scale.\n\n00:02:22.868 --> 00:02:24.786\nThis is the domain of quantum mechanics,\n\n00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.326\nand physicists and chemists\nhave had a long time\n\n00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.651\nto try and get used to it.\n\n00:02:29.206 --> 00:02:33.663\nBiologists, on the other hand,\nhave got off lightly, in my view.\n\n00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:38.360\nThey are very happy with their\nballs-and-sticks models of molecules.\n\n00:02:38.384 --> 00:02:39.466\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.688\nThe balls are the atoms, the sticks\nare the bonds between the atoms.\n\n00:02:42.712 --> 00:02:45.206\nAnd when they can't build them\nphysically in the lab,\n\n00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.622\nnowadays, they have\nvery powerful computers\n\n00:02:47.646 --> 00:02:49.613\nthat will simulate a huge molecule.\n\n00:02:49.637 --> 00:02:53.301\nThis is a protein made up\nof 100,000 atoms.\n\n00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:58.296\nIt doesn't really require much in the way\nof quantum mechanics to explain it.\n\n00:02:59.653 --> 00:03:02.542\nQuantum mechanics\nwas developed in the 1920s.\n\n00:03:02.923 --> 00:03:09.803\nIt is a set of beautiful and powerful\nmathematical rules and ideas\n\n00:03:09.827 --> 00:03:12.435\nthat explain the world of the very small.\n\n00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.831\nAnd it's a world that's very different\nfrom our everyday world,\n\n00:03:15.855 --> 00:03:17.374\nmade up of trillions of atoms.\n\n00:03:17.398 --> 00:03:20.955\nIt's a world built\non probability and chance.\n\n00:03:21.776 --> 00:03:23.078\nIt's a fuzzy world.\n\n00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:24.832\nIt's a world of phantoms,\n\n00:03:24.856 --> 00:03:28.204\nwhere particles can also behave\nlike spread-out waves.\n\n00:03:30.115 --> 00:03:32.977\nIf we imagine quantum mechanics\nor quantum physics, then,\n\n00:03:33.001 --> 00:03:38.215\nas the fundamental\nfoundation of reality itself,\n\n00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.969\nthen it's not surprising that we say\n\n00:03:39.993 --> 00:03:42.413\nquantum physics underpins\norganic chemistry.\n\n00:03:42.437 --> 00:03:44.557\nAfter all, it gives us\nthe rules that tell us\n\n00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:47.222\nhow the atoms fit together\nto make organic molecules.\n\n00:03:47.246 --> 00:03:50.485\nOrganic chemistry,\nscaled up in complexity,\n\n00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:53.831\ngives us molecular biology,\nwhich of course leads to life itself.\n\n00:03:54.132 --> 00:03:56.109\nSo in a way, it's sort of not surprising.\n\n00:03:56.133 --> 00:03:57.347\nIt's almost trivial.\n\n00:03:57.371 --> 00:04:01.591\nYou say, \"Well, of course life ultimately\nmust depend of quantum mechanics.\"\n\n00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.489\nBut so does everything else.\n\n00:04:04.513 --> 00:04:08.128\nSo does all inanimate matter,\nmade up of trillions of atoms.\n\n00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.337\nUltimately, there's a quantum level\n\n00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:15.544\nwhere we have to delve into\nthis weirdness.\n\n00:04:15.568 --> 00:04:17.984\nBut in everyday life,\nwe can forget about it.\n\n00:04:18.362 --> 00:04:21.561\nBecause once you put together\ntrillions of atoms,\n\n00:04:21.585 --> 00:04:24.200\nthat quantum weirdness\njust dissolves away.\n\n00:04:27.246 --> 00:04:29.815\nQuantum biology isn't about this.\n\n00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:32.395\nQuantum biology isn't this obvious.\n\n00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.648\nOf course quantum mechanics\nunderpins life at some molecular level.\n\n00:04:37.212 --> 00:04:43.216\nQuantum biology is about looking\nfor the non-trivial --\n\n00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.716\nthe counterintuitive ideas\nin quantum mechanics --\n\n00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.755\nand to see if they do, indeed,\nplay an important role\n\n00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:53.231\nin describing the processes of life.\n\n00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:59.831\nHere is my perfect example\nof the counterintuitiveness\n\n00:04:59.855 --> 00:05:01.301\nof the quantum world.\n\n00:05:01.325 --> 00:05:02.576\nThis is the quantum skier.\n\n00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.240\nHe seems to be intact,\nhe seems to be perfectly healthy,\n\n00:05:05.264 --> 00:05:09.391\nand yet, he seems to have gone around\nboth sides of that tree at the same time.\n\n00:05:09.415 --> 00:05:11.078\nWell, if you saw tracks like that\n\n00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:13.411\nyou'd guess it was some\nsort of stunt, of course.\n\n00:05:13.435 --> 00:05:16.026\nBut in the quantum world,\nthis happens all the time.\n\n00:05:16.822 --> 00:05:19.848\nParticles can multitask,\nthey can be in two places at once.\n\n00:05:19.872 --> 00:05:22.200\nThey can do more than one thing\nat the same time.\n\n00:05:22.224 --> 00:05:24.867\nParticles can behave\nlike spread-out waves.\n\n00:05:25.256 --> 00:05:26.855\nIt's almost like magic.\n\n00:05:27.496 --> 00:05:30.245\nPhysicists and chemists have had\nnearly a century\n\n00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:32.915\nof trying to get used to this weirdness.\n\n00:05:33.403 --> 00:05:34.753\nI don't blame the biologists\n\n00:05:34.777 --> 00:05:37.412\nfor not having to or wanting\nto learn quantum mechanics.\n\n00:05:37.436 --> 00:05:40.634\nYou see, this weirdness is very delicate;\n\n00:05:40.658 --> 00:05:45.108\nand we physicists work very hard\nto maintain it in our labs.\n\n00:05:45.132 --> 00:05:49.336\nWe cool our system down\nto near absolute zero,\n\n00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.305\nwe carry out our experiments in vacuums,\n\n00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:54.856\nwe try and isolate it\nfrom any external disturbance.\n\n00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.638\nThat's very different from the warm,\nmessy, noisy environment of a living cell.\n\n00:06:01.918 --> 00:06:04.705\nBiology itself, if you think of\nmolecular biology,\n\n00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.186\nseems to have done very well\nin describing all the processes of life\n\n00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.696\nin terms of chemistry --\nchemical reactions.\n\n00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.570\nAnd these are reductionist,\ndeterministic chemical reactions,\n\n00:06:15.594 --> 00:06:20.708\nshowing that, essentially, life is made\nof the same stuff as everything else,\n\n00:06:20.732 --> 00:06:23.792\nand if we can forget about quantum\nmechanics in the macro world,\n\n00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:27.062\nthen we should be able to forget\nabout it in biology, as well.\n\n00:06:27.664 --> 00:06:31.028\nWell, one man begged\nto differ with this idea.\n\n00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.489\nErwin Schr\u00f6dinger,\nof Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat fame,\n\n00:06:35.513 --> 00:06:36.830\nwas an Austrian physicist.\n\n00:06:36.854 --> 00:06:40.037\nHe was one of the founders\nof quantum mechanics in the 1920s.\n\n00:06:40.621 --> 00:06:43.328\nIn 1944, he wrote a book\ncalled \"What is Life?\"\n\n00:06:43.797 --> 00:06:45.528\nIt was tremendously influential.\n\n00:06:45.552 --> 00:06:48.433\nIt influenced Francis Crick\nand James Watson,\n\n00:06:48.457 --> 00:06:50.980\nthe discoverers of the double-helix\nstructure of DNA.\n\n00:06:51.301 --> 00:06:54.969\nTo paraphrase a description\nin the book, he says:\n\n00:06:54.993 --> 00:07:00.779\nAt the molecular level,\nliving organisms have a certain order,\n\n00:07:00.803 --> 00:07:04.035\na structure to them that's very different\n\n00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:08.795\nfrom the random thermodynamic jostling\nof atoms and molecules\n\n00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:12.525\nin inanimate matter\nof the same complexity.\n\n00:07:13.462 --> 00:07:18.476\nIn fact, living matter seems to behave\nin this order, in a structure,\n\n00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.334\njust like inanimate matter\ncooled down to near absolute zero,\n\n00:07:22.358 --> 00:07:25.391\nwhere quantum effects\nplay a very important role.\n\n00:07:26.238 --> 00:07:30.398\nThere's something special\nabout the structure -- the order --\n\n00:07:30.422 --> 00:07:31.982\ninside a living cell.\n\n00:07:32.006 --> 00:07:37.299\nSo, Schr\u00f6dinger speculated that maybe\nquantum mechanics plays a role in life.\n\n00:07:38.054 --> 00:07:41.479\nIt's a very speculative,\nfar-reaching idea,\n\n00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:44.376\nand it didn't really go very far.\n\n00:07:45.494 --> 00:07:47.027\nBut as I mentioned at the start,\n\n00:07:47.051 --> 00:07:49.850\nin the last 10 years, there have been\nexperiments emerging,\n\n00:07:49.874 --> 00:07:53.929\nshowing where some of these\ncertain phenomena in biology\n\n00:07:53.953 --> 00:07:55.716\ndo seem to require quantum mechanics.\n\n00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.863\nI want to share with you\njust a few of the exciting ones.\n\n00:08:00.173 --> 00:08:03.880\nThis is one of the best-known\nphenomena in the quantum world,\n\n00:08:03.904 --> 00:08:05.605\nquantum tunneling.\n\n00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:10.018\nThe box on the left shows\nthe wavelike, spread-out distribution\n\n00:08:10.042 --> 00:08:12.803\nof a quantum entity --\na particle, like an electron,\n\n00:08:12.827 --> 00:08:16.464\nwhich is not a little ball\nbouncing off a wall.\n\n00:08:16.488 --> 00:08:21.227\nIt's a wave that has a certain probability\nof being able to permeate\n\n00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:24.657\nthrough a solid wall, like a phantom\nleaping through to the other side.\n\n00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:28.779\nYou can see a faint smudge of light\nin the right-hand box.\n\n00:08:29.731 --> 00:08:34.343\nQuantum tunneling suggests that a particle\ncan hit an impenetrable barrier,\n\n00:08:34.367 --> 00:08:36.827\nand yet somehow, as though by magic,\n\n00:08:36.851 --> 00:08:39.295\ndisappear from one side\nand reappear on the other.\n\n00:08:39.616 --> 00:08:43.867\nThe nicest way of explaining it is\nif you want to throw a ball over a wall,\n\n00:08:43.891 --> 00:08:47.468\nyou have to give it enough energy\nto get over the top of the wall.\n\n00:08:47.492 --> 00:08:50.550\nIn the quantum world,\nyou don't have to throw it over the wall,\n\n00:08:50.574 --> 00:08:53.981\nyou can throw it at the wall,\nand there's a certain non-zero probability\n\n00:08:54.005 --> 00:08:57.328\nthat it'll disappear on your side,\nand reappear on the other.\n\n00:08:57.352 --> 00:08:59.030\nThis isn't speculation, by the way.\n\n00:08:59.054 --> 00:09:02.450\nWe're happy -- well, \"happy\"\nis not the right word --\n\n00:09:02.474 --> 00:09:04.519\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:04.543 --> 00:09:06.161\nwe are familiar with this.\n\n00:09:06.185 --> 00:09:08.930\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:08.954 --> 00:09:11.248\nQuantum tunneling\ntakes place all the time;\n\n00:09:11.272 --> 00:09:13.939\nin fact, it's the reason our Sun shines.\n\n00:09:14.613 --> 00:09:16.122\nThe particles fuse together,\n\n00:09:16.146 --> 00:09:19.844\nand the Sun turns hydrogen\ninto helium through quantum tunneling.\n\n00:09:21.422 --> 00:09:26.642\nBack in the 70s and 80s, it was discovered\nthat quantum tunneling also takes place\n\n00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:27.858\ninside living cells.\n\n00:09:28.248 --> 00:09:34.514\nEnzymes, those workhorses of life,\nthe catalysts of chemical reactions --\n\n00:09:34.538 --> 00:09:38.704\nenzymes are biomolecules that speed up\nchemical reactions in living cells,\n\n00:09:38.728 --> 00:09:40.431\nby many, many orders of magnitude.\n\n00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:43.239\nAnd it's always been a mystery\nhow they do this.\n\n00:09:43.608 --> 00:09:44.797\nWell, it was discovered\n\n00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:49.673\nthat one of the tricks that enzymes\nhave evolved to make use of,\n\n00:09:49.697 --> 00:09:54.925\nis by transferring subatomic particles,\nlike electrons and indeed protons,\n\n00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:59.610\nfrom one part of a molecule\nto another via quantum tunneling.\n\n00:10:00.291 --> 00:10:03.142\nIt's efficient, it's fast,\nit can disappear --\n\n00:10:03.166 --> 00:10:06.277\na proton can disappear from one place,\nand reappear on the other.\n\n00:10:06.301 --> 00:10:07.930\nEnzymes help this take place.\n\n00:10:08.506 --> 00:10:11.189\nThis is research that's been\ncarried out back in the 80s,\n\n00:10:11.213 --> 00:10:15.250\nparticularly by a group\nin Berkeley, Judith Klinman.\n\n00:10:15.274 --> 00:10:17.479\nOther groups in the UK\nhave now also confirmed\n\n00:10:17.503 --> 00:10:18.914\nthat enzymes really do this.\n\n00:10:21.006 --> 00:10:23.555\nResearch carried out by my group --\n\n00:10:23.579 --> 00:10:26.013\nso as I mentioned,\nI'm a nuclear physicist,\n\n00:10:26.037 --> 00:10:29.092\nbut I've realized I've got these tools\nof using quantum mechanics\n\n00:10:29.116 --> 00:10:34.201\nin atomic nuclei, and so can apply\nthose tools in other areas as well.\n\n00:10:35.362 --> 00:10:37.172\nOne question we asked\n\n00:10:37.196 --> 00:10:41.494\nis whether quantum tunneling\nplays a role in mutations in DNA.\n\n00:10:41.801 --> 00:10:45.461\nAgain, this is not a new idea;\nit goes all the way back to the early 60s.\n\n00:10:45.485 --> 00:10:48.446\nThe two strands of DNA,\nthe double-helix structure,\n\n00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.293\nare held together by rungs;\nit's like a twisted ladder.\n\n00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:54.824\nAnd those rungs of the ladder\nare hydrogen bonds --\n\n00:10:54.848 --> 00:10:58.638\nprotons, that act as the glue\nbetween the two strands.\n\n00:10:58.662 --> 00:11:03.412\nSo if you zoom in, what they're doing\nis holding these large molecules --\n\n00:11:03.436 --> 00:11:05.043\nnucleotides -- together.\n\n00:11:06.088 --> 00:11:07.238\nZoom in a bit more.\n\n00:11:07.262 --> 00:11:09.178\nSo, this a computer simulation.\n\n00:11:09.813 --> 00:11:13.355\nThe two white balls\nin the middle are protons,\n\n00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:15.678\nand you can see that\nit's a double hydrogen bond.\n\n00:11:15.702 --> 00:11:19.016\nOne prefers to sit on one side;\nthe other, on the other side\n\n00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.598\nof the two strands of the vertical lines\ngoing down, which you can't see.\n\n00:11:24.368 --> 00:11:27.763\nIt can happen that\nthese two protons can hop over.\n\n00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:29.223\nWatch the two white balls.\n\n00:11:29.706 --> 00:11:31.704\nThey can jump over to the other side.\n\n00:11:32.197 --> 00:11:37.843\nIf the two strands of DNA then separate,\nleading to the process of replication,\n\n00:11:37.867 --> 00:11:41.066\nand the two protons\nare in the wrong positions,\n\n00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:42.853\nthis can lead to a mutation.\n\n00:11:43.162 --> 00:11:45.034\nThis has been known for half a century.\n\n00:11:45.058 --> 00:11:47.401\nThe question is: How likely\nare they to do that,\n\n00:11:47.425 --> 00:11:49.803\nand if they do, how do they do it?\n\n00:11:49.827 --> 00:11:52.846\nDo they jump across,\nlike the ball going over the wall?\n\n00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:56.372\nOr can they quantum-tunnel across,\neven if they don't have enough energy?\n\n00:11:57.047 --> 00:12:01.299\nEarly indications suggest that\nquantum tunneling can play a role here.\n\n00:12:01.323 --> 00:12:03.447\nWe still don't know yet\nhow important it is;\n\n00:12:03.471 --> 00:12:05.263\nthis is still an open question.\n\n00:12:06.157 --> 00:12:07.307\nIt's speculative,\n\n00:12:07.331 --> 00:12:09.974\nbut it's one of those questions\nthat is so important\n\n00:12:09.998 --> 00:12:12.444\nthat if quantum mechanics\nplays a role in mutations,\n\n00:12:12.468 --> 00:12:14.767\nsurely this must have big implications,\n\n00:12:14.791 --> 00:12:17.485\nto understand certain types of mutations,\n\n00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:21.265\npossibly even those that lead\nto turning a cell cancerous.\n\n00:12:22.761 --> 00:12:28.060\nAnother example of quantum mechanics\nin biology is quantum coherence,\n\n00:12:28.084 --> 00:12:30.437\nin one of the most\nimportant processes in biology,\n\n00:12:30.461 --> 00:12:34.402\nphotosynthesis: plants\nand bacteria taking sunlight,\n\n00:12:34.426 --> 00:12:37.380\nand using that energy to create biomass.\n\n00:12:38.173 --> 00:12:42.325\nQuantum coherence is the idea\nof quantum entities multitasking.\n\n00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.474\nIt's the quantum skier.\n\n00:12:44.498 --> 00:12:47.450\nIt's an object that behaves like a wave,\n\n00:12:47.474 --> 00:12:50.376\nso that it doesn't just move\nin one direction or the other,\n\n00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.720\nbut can follow multiple pathways\nat the same time.\n\n00:12:54.666 --> 00:12:58.582\nSome years ago,\nthe world of science was shocked\n\n00:12:58.606 --> 00:13:02.190\nwhen a paper was published\nshowing experimental evidence\n\n00:13:02.214 --> 00:13:05.990\nthat quantum coherence\ntakes place inside bacteria,\n\n00:13:06.014 --> 00:13:07.700\ncarrying out photosynthesis.\n\n00:13:07.724 --> 00:13:10.788\nThe idea is that the photon,\nthe particle of light, the sunlight,\n\n00:13:10.812 --> 00:13:14.156\nthe quantum of light\ncaptured by a chlorophyll molecule,\n\n00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.771\nis then delivered to what's called\nthe reaction center,\n\n00:13:16.795 --> 00:13:18.859\nwhere it can be turned into\nchemical energy.\n\n00:13:18.883 --> 00:13:21.531\nAnd in getting there,\nit doesn't just follow one route;\n\n00:13:21.555 --> 00:13:23.770\nit follows multiple pathways at once,\n\n00:13:23.794 --> 00:13:28.131\nto optimize the most efficient way\nof reaching the reaction center\n\n00:13:28.155 --> 00:13:29.876\nwithout dissipating as waste heat.\n\n00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:34.495\nQuantum coherence taking place\ninside a living cell.\n\n00:13:34.519 --> 00:13:36.639\nA remarkable idea,\n\n00:13:36.663 --> 00:13:42.898\nand yet evidence is growing almost weekly,\nwith new papers coming out,\n\n00:13:42.922 --> 00:13:45.134\nconfirming that this\ndoes indeed take place.\n\n00:13:45.513 --> 00:13:50.252\nMy third and final example\nis the most beautiful, wonderful idea.\n\n00:13:50.276 --> 00:13:54.339\nIt's also still very speculative,\nbut I have to share it with you.\n\n00:13:54.363 --> 00:13:58.975\nThe European robin\nmigrates from Scandinavia\n\n00:13:58.999 --> 00:14:01.634\ndown to the Mediterranean, every autumn,\n\n00:14:01.658 --> 00:14:05.031\nand like a lot of other\nmarine animals and even insects,\n\n00:14:05.055 --> 00:14:09.355\nthey navigate by sensing\nthe Earth's magnetic field.\n\n00:14:10.926 --> 00:14:13.353\nNow, the Earth's magnetic field\nis very, very weak;\n\n00:14:13.377 --> 00:14:15.457\nit's 100 times weaker\nthan a fridge magnet,\n\n00:14:15.481 --> 00:14:21.082\nand yet it affects the chemistry --\nsomehow -- within a living organism.\n\n00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:25.696\nThat's not in doubt --\na German couple of ornithologists,\n\n00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:29.980\nWolfgang and Roswitha Wiltschko,\nin the 1970s, confirmed that indeed,\n\n00:14:30.004 --> 00:14:33.981\nthe robin does find its way by somehow\nsensing the Earth's magnetic field,\n\n00:14:34.005 --> 00:14:37.332\nto give it directional information --\na built-in compass.\n\n00:14:37.356 --> 00:14:39.605\nThe puzzle, the mystery was:\nHow does it do it?\n\n00:14:40.309 --> 00:14:43.339\nWell, the only theory in town --\n\n00:14:43.363 --> 00:14:46.799\nwe don't know if it's the correct theory,\nbut the only theory in town --\n\n00:14:46.823 --> 00:14:49.807\nis that it does it via something\ncalled quantum entanglement.\n\n00:14:50.525 --> 00:14:52.899\nInside the robin's retina --\n\n00:14:52.923 --> 00:14:57.155\nI kid you not -- inside the robin's retina\nis a protein called cryptochrome,\n\n00:14:57.179 --> 00:14:58.559\nwhich is light-sensitive.\n\n00:14:58.583 --> 00:15:02.522\nWithin cryptochrome, a pair of electrons\nare quantum-entangled.\n\n00:15:02.546 --> 00:15:05.778\nNow, quantum entanglement\nis when two particles are far apart,\n\n00:15:05.802 --> 00:15:08.636\nand yet somehow remain\nin contact with each other.\n\n00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:10.395\nEven Einstein hated this idea;\n\n00:15:10.419 --> 00:15:12.458\nhe called it \"spooky action\nat a distance.\"\n\n00:15:12.482 --> 00:15:14.363\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:14.387 --> 00:15:17.830\nSo if Einstein doesn't like it,\nthen we can all be uncomfortable with it.\n\n00:15:17.854 --> 00:15:20.707\nTwo quantum-entangled electrons\nwithin a single molecule\n\n00:15:20.731 --> 00:15:22.202\ndance a delicate dance\n\n00:15:22.226 --> 00:15:24.767\nthat is very sensitive\nto the direction the bird flies\n\n00:15:24.791 --> 00:15:26.322\nin the Earth's magnetic field.\n\n00:15:26.806 --> 00:15:29.416\nWe don't know if it's\nthe correct explanation,\n\n00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.984\nbut wow, wouldn't it be exciting\nif quantum mechanics helps birds navigate?\n\n00:15:35.027 --> 00:15:37.748\nQuantum biology is still in it infancy.\n\n00:15:37.772 --> 00:15:41.256\nIt's still speculative.\n\n00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.549\nBut I believe it's built on solid science.\n\n00:15:45.875 --> 00:15:49.684\nI also think that\nin the coming decade or so,\n\n00:15:49.708 --> 00:15:54.549\nwe're going to start to see\nthat actually, it pervades life --\n\n00:15:54.573 --> 00:15:59.169\nthat life has evolved tricks\nthat utilize the quantum world.\n\n00:15:59.984 --> 00:16:01.412\nWatch this space.\n\n00:16:01.436 --> 00:16:02.593\nThank you.\n\n00:16:02.617 --> 00:16:04.819\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The troubling reason why vaccines are made too late ... if they're made at all", "duration": "437", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/seth_berkley_the_troubling_reason_why_vaccines_are_made_too_late_if_they_re_made_at_all", "transcript": "The child's symptoms begin with mild fever, headache, muscle pains, followed by vomiting and diarrhea, then bleeding from the mouth, nose and gums. Death follows in the form of organ failure from low blood pressure.Sounds familiar? If you're thinking this is Ebola, actually, in this case, it's not. It's an extreme form of dengue fever, a mosquito-born disease which also does not have an effective therapy or a vaccine, and kills 22,000 people each year. That is actually twice the number of people that have been killed by Ebola in the nearly four decades that we've known about it. As for measles, so much in the news recently, the death toll is actually tenfold higher. Yet for the last year, it has been Ebola that has stolen all of the headlines and the fear.Clearly, there is something deeply rooted about it, something which scares us and fascinates us more than other diseases. But what is it, exactly? Well, it's hard to acquire Ebola, but if you do, the risk of a horrible death is high. Why? Because right now, we don't have any effective therapy or vaccine available.And so, that's the clue. We may have it someday. So we rightfully fear Ebola, because it doesn't kill as many people as other diseases. In fact, it's much less transmissible than viruses such as flu or measles. We fear Ebola because of the fact that it kills us and we can't treat it. We fear the certain inevitability that comes with Ebola. Ebola has this inevitability that seems to defy modern medical science.But wait a second, why is that? We've known about Ebola since 1976. We've known what it's capable of. We've had ample opportunity to study it in the 24 outbreaks that have occurred. And in fact, we've actually had vaccine candidates available now for more than a decade. Why is that those vaccines are just going into clinical trials now?This goes to the fundamental problem we have with vaccine development for infectious diseases. It goes something like this: The people most at risk for these diseases are also the ones least able to pay for vaccines. This leaves little in the way of market incentives for manufacturers to develop vaccines, unless there are large numbers of people who are at risk in wealthy countries. It's simply too commercially risky.As for Ebola, there is absolutely no market at all, so the only reason we have two vaccines in late-stage clinical trials now, is actually because of a somewhat misguided fear. Ebola was relatively ignored until September 11 and the anthrax attacks, when all of a sudden, people perceived Ebola as, potentially, a bioterrorism weapon.Why is it that the Ebola vaccine wasn't fully developed at this point? Well, partially, because it was really difficult \u2014 or thought to be difficult \u2014 to weaponize the virus, but mainly because of the financial risk in developing it. And this is really the point. The sad reality is, we develop vaccines not based upon the risk the pathogen poses to people, but on how economically risky it is to develop these vaccines. Vaccine development is expensive and complicated. It can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to take even a well-known antigen and turn it into a viable vaccine.Fortunately for diseases like Ebola, there are things we can do to remove some of these barriers. The first is to recognize when there's a complete market failure. In that case, if we want vaccines, we have to provide incentives or some type of subsidy. We also need to do a better job at being able to figure out which are the diseases that most threaten us. By creating capabilities within countries, we then create the ability for those countries to create epidemiological and laboratory networks which are capable of collecting and categorizing these pathogens. The data from that then can be used to understand the geographic and genetic diversity, which then can be used to help us understand how these are being changed immunologically, and what type of reactions they promote.So these are the things that can be done, but to do this, if we want to deal with a complete market failure, we have to change the way we view and prevent infectious diseases. We have to stop waiting until we see evidence of a disease becoming a global threat before we consider it as one. So, for Ebola, the paranoid fear of an infectious disease, followed by a few cases transported to wealthy countries, led the global community to come together, and with the work of dedicated vaccine companies, we now have these: Two Ebola vaccines in efficacy trials in the Ebola countries \u2014(Applause)and a pipeline of vaccines that are following behind.Every year, we spend billions of dollars, keeping a fleet of nuclear submarines permanently patrolling the oceans to protect us from a threat that almost certainly will never happen. And yet, we spend virtually nothing to prevent something as tangible and evolutionarily certain as epidemic infectious diseases. And make no mistake about it \u2014 it's not a question of \"if,\" but \"when.\" These bugs are going to continue to evolve and they're going to threaten the world. And vaccines are our best defense. So if we want to be able to prevent epidemics like Ebola, we need to take on the risk of investing in vaccine development and in stockpile creation. And we need to view this, then, as the ultimate deterrent \u2014 something we make sure is available, but at the same time, praying we never have to use it.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2317,

provide incentives\nor some type of subsidy.\n\n00:04:36.155 --> 00:04:40.495\nWe also need to do a better job\nat being able to figure out\n\n00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:42.877\nwhich are the diseases\nthat most threaten us.\n\n00:04:43.218 --> 00:04:48.133\nBy creating capabilities within countries,\nwe then create the ability\n\n00:04:48.157 --> 00:04:52.774\nfor those countries to create\nepidemiological and laboratory networks\n\n00:04:52.798 --> 00:04:57.067\nwhich are capable of collecting\nand categorizing these pathogens.\n\n00:04:58.075 --> 00:05:00.337\nThe data from that then can be used\n\n00:05:00.361 --> 00:05:03.640\nto understand the geographic\nand genetic diversity,\n\n00:05:03.664 --> 00:05:06.300\nwhich then can be used\nto help us understand\n\n00:05:06.324 --> 00:05:09.967\nhow these are being changed\nimmunologically,\n\n00:05:09.991 --> 00:05:12.315\nand what type of reactions they promote.\n\n00:05:13.156 --> 00:05:15.483\nSo these are the things that can be done,\n\n00:05:15.507 --> 00:05:19.191\nbut to do this, if we want to deal\nwith a complete market failure,\n\n00:05:19.215 --> 00:05:24.639\nwe have to change the way\nwe view and prevent infectious diseases.\n\n00:05:24.663 --> 00:05:28.850\nWe have to stop waiting\nuntil we see evidence\n\n00:05:28.874 --> 00:05:33.678\nof a disease becoming a global threat\nbefore we consider it as one.\n\n00:05:34.575 --> 00:05:36.814\nSo, for Ebola,\n\n00:05:36.838 --> 00:05:40.729\nthe paranoid fear\nof an infectious disease,\n\n00:05:40.753 --> 00:05:45.475\nfollowed by a few cases\ntransported to wealthy countries,\n\n00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:48.099\nled the global community to come together,\n\n00:05:48.123 --> 00:05:51.628\nand with the work\nof dedicated vaccine companies,\n\n00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:53.318\nwe now have these:\n\n00:05:54.423 --> 00:06:00.430\nTwo Ebola vaccines in efficacy trials\nin the Ebola countries --\n\n00:06:00.454 --> 00:06:05.959\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:05.983 --> 00:06:09.967\nand a pipeline of vaccines\nthat are following behind.\n\n00:06:10.721 --> 00:06:13.813\nEvery year, we spend billions of dollars,\n\n00:06:13.837 --> 00:06:18.910\nkeeping a fleet of nuclear submarines\npermanently patrolling the oceans\n\n00:06:18.934 --> 00:06:22.925\nto protect us from a threat\nthat almost certainly will never happen.\n\n00:06:23.485 --> 00:06:26.421\nAnd yet, we spend virtually nothing\n\n00:06:26.445 --> 00:06:31.472\nto prevent something as tangible\nand evolutionarily certain\n\n00:06:31.496 --> 00:06:33.674\nas epidemic infectious diseases.\n\n00:06:34.967 --> 00:06:38.862\nAnd make no mistake about it --\nit's not a question of \"if,\" but \"when.\"\n\n00:06:38.886 --> 00:06:41.798\nThese bugs are going to continue to evolve\n\n00:06:41.822 --> 00:06:43.825\nand they're going to threaten the world.\n\n00:06:44.238 --> 00:06:46.582\nAnd vaccines are our best defense.\n\n00:06:47.066 --> 00:06:51.375\nSo if we want to be able to prevent\nepidemics like Ebola,\n\n00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:55.845\nwe need to take on the risk\nof investing in vaccine development\n\n00:06:55.869 --> 00:06:57.907\nand in stockpile creation.\n\n00:06:58.718 --> 00:07:02.343\nAnd we need to view this, then,\nas the ultimate deterrent --\n\n00:07:02.367 --> 00:07:05.487\nsomething we make sure is available,\n\n00:07:05.511 --> 00:07:09.150\nbut at the same time,\npraying we never have to use it.\n\n00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:10.730\nThank you.\n\n00:07:10.754 --> 00:07:15.032\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "These robots come to the rescue after a disaster", "duration": "539", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/robin_murphy_these_robots_come_to_the_rescue_after_a_disaster", "transcript": "Over a million people are killed each year in disasters. Two and a half million people will be permanently disabled or displaced, and the communities will take 20 to 30 years to recover and billions of economic losses.If you can reduce the initial response by one day, you can reduce the overall recovery by a thousand days, or three years. See how that works? If the initial responders can get in, save lives, mitigate whatever flooding danger there is, that means the other groups can get in to restore the water, the roads, the electricity, which means then the construction people, the insurance agents, all of them can get in to rebuild the houses, which then means you can restore the economy, and maybe even make it better and more resilient to the next disaster. A major insurance company told me that if they can get a homeowner's claim processed one day earlier, it'll make a difference of six months in that person getting their home repaired.And that's why I do disaster robotics \u2014 because robots can make a disaster go away faster.Now, you've already seen a couple of these. These are the UAVs. These are two types of UAVs: a rotorcraft, or hummingbird; a fixed-wing, a hawk. And they're used extensively since 2005 \u2014 Hurricane Katrina. Let me show you how this hummingbird, this rotorcraft, works. Fantastic for structural engineers. Being able to see damage from angles you can't get from binoculars on the ground or from a satellite image, or anything flying at a higher angle. But it's not just structural engineers and insurance people who need this. You've got things like this fixed-wing, this hawk. Now, this hawk can be used for geospatial surveys. That's where you're pulling imagery together and getting 3D reconstruction.We used both of these at the Oso mudslides up in Washington State, because the big problem was geospatial and hydrological understanding of the disaster \u2014 not the search and rescue. The search and rescue teams had it under control and knew what they were doing. The bigger problem was that river and mudslide might wipe them out and flood the responders. And not only was it challenging to the responders and property damage, it's also putting at risk the future of salmon fishing along that part of Washington State. So they needed to understand what was going on. In seven hours, going from Arlington, driving from the Incident Command Post to the site, flying the UAVs, processing the data, driving back to Arlington command post \u2014 seven hours. We gave them in seven hours data that they could take only two to three days to get any other way \u2014 and at higher resolution. It's a game changer.And don't just think about the UAVs. I mean, they are sexy \u2014 but remember, 80 percent of the world's population lives by water, and that means our critical infrastructure is underwater \u2014 the parts that we can't get to, like the bridges and things like that. And that's why we have unmanned marine vehicles, one type of which you've already met, which is SARbot, a square dolphin. It goes underwater and uses sonar. Well, why are marine vehicles so important and why are they very, very important? They get overlooked. Think about the Japanese tsunami \u2014 400 miles of coastland totally devastated, twice the amount of coastland devastated by Hurricane Katrina in the United States. You're talking about your bridges, your pipelines, your ports \u2014 wiped out. And if you don't have a port, you don't have a way to get in enough relief supplies to support a population. That was a huge problem at the Haiti earthquake. So we need marine vehicles.Now, let's look at a viewpoint from the SARbot of what they were seeing. We were working on a fishing port. We were able to reopen that fishing port, using her sonar, in four hours. That fishing port was told it was going to be six months before they could get a manual team of divers in, and it was going to take the divers two weeks. They were going to miss the fall fishing season, which was the major economy for that part, which is kind of like their Cape Cod. UMVs, very important.But you know, all the robots I've shown you have been small, and that's because robots don't do things that people do. They go places people can't go. And a great example of that is Bujold. Unmanned ground vehicles are particularly small, so Bujold \u2014(Laughter)Say hello to Bujold.(Laughter)Bujold was used extensively at the World Trade Center to go through Towers 1, 2 and 4. You're climbing into the rubble, rappelling down, going deep in spaces. And just to see the World Trade Center from Bujold's viewpoint, look at this. You're talking about a disaster where you can't fit a person or a dog \u2014 and it's on fire. The only hope of getting to a survivor way in the basement, you have to go through things that are on fire. It was so hot, on one of the robots, the tracks began to melt and come off. Robots don't replace people or dogs, or hummingbirds or hawks or dolphins. They do things new. They assist the responders, the experts, in new and innovative ways.The biggest problem is not making the robots smaller, though. It's not making them more heat-resistant. It's not making more sensors. The biggest problem is the data, the informatics, because these people need to get the right data at the right time.So wouldn't it be great if we could have experts immediately access the robots without having to waste any time of driving to the site, so whoever's there, use their robots over the Internet. Well, let's think about that. Let's think about a chemical train derailment in a rural county. What are the odds that the experts, your chemical engineer, your railroad transportation engineers, have been trained on whatever UAV that particular county happens to have? Probably, like, none. So we're using these kinds of interfaces to allow people to use the robots without knowing what robot they're using, or even if they're using a robot or not. What the robots give you, what they give the experts, is data.The problem becomes: who gets what data when? One thing to do is to ship all the information to everybody and let them sort it out. Well, the problem with that is it overwhelms the networks, and worse yet, it overwhelms the cognitive abilities of each of the people trying to get that one nugget of information they need to make the decision that's going to make the difference. So we need to think about those kinds of challenges. So it's the data.Going back to the World Trade Center, we tried to solve that problem by just recording the data from Bujold only when she was deep in the rubble, because that's what the USAR team said they wanted. What we didn't know at the time was that the civil engineers would have loved, needed the data as we recorded the box beams, the serial numbers, the locations, as we went into the rubble. We lost valuable data. So the challenge is getting all the data and getting it to the right people.Now, here's another reason. We've learned that some buildings \u2014 things like schools, hospitals, city halls \u2014 get inspected four times by different agencies throughout the response phases. Now, we're looking, if we can get the data from the robots to share, not only can we do things like compress that sequence of phases to shorten the response time, but now we can begin to do the response in parallel. Everybody can see the data. We can shorten it that way.So really, \"disaster robotics\" is a misnomer. It's not about the robots. It's about the data.(Applause)So my challenge to you: the next time you hear about a disaster, look for the robots. They may be underground, they may be underwater, they may be in the sky, but they should be there. Look for the robots, because robots are coming to the rescue.(Applause)", "id": 2318, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.957 --> 00:00:17.933\nOver a

that's because robots\ndon't do things that people do.\n\n00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.933\nThey go places people can't go.\n\n00:04:47.957 --> 00:04:50.933\nAnd a great example of that is Bujold.\n\n00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:53.933\nUnmanned ground vehicles\nare particularly small,\n\n00:04:53.957 --> 00:04:55.275\nso Bujold --\n\n00:04:55.299 --> 00:04:56.807\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:58.014\nSay hello to Bujold.\n\n00:04:58.038 --> 00:05:00.722\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:01.564 --> 00:05:04.933\nBujold was used extensively\nat the World Trade Center\n\n00:05:04.957 --> 00:05:07.337\nto go through Towers 1, 2 and 4.\n\n00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:12.006\nYou're climbing into the rubble,\nrappelling down, going deep in spaces.\n\n00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.589\nAnd just to see the World Trade Center\nfrom Bujold's viewpoint, look at this.\n\n00:05:16.613 --> 00:05:21.682\nYou're talking about a disaster\nwhere you can't fit a person or a dog --\n\n00:05:21.706 --> 00:05:23.848\nand it's on fire.\n\n00:05:23.872 --> 00:05:27.606\nThe only hope of getting\nto a survivor way in the basement,\n\n00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.825\nyou have to go through things\nthat are on fire.\n\n00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:34.353\nIt was so hot, on one of the robots,\nthe tracks began to melt and come off.\n\n00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:37.907\nRobots don't replace people or dogs,\n\n00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:40.452\nor hummingbirds or hawks or dolphins.\n\n00:05:40.476 --> 00:05:42.512\nThey do things new.\n\n00:05:42.536 --> 00:05:48.225\nThey assist the responders,\nthe experts, in new and innovative ways.\n\n00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:52.678\nThe biggest problem is not\nmaking the robots smaller, though.\n\n00:05:52.702 --> 00:05:54.933\nIt's not making them more heat-resistant.\n\n00:05:54.957 --> 00:05:56.714\nIt's not making more sensors.\n\n00:05:56.738 --> 00:06:00.348\nThe biggest problem is the data,\nthe informatics,\n\n00:06:00.372 --> 00:06:04.408\nbecause these people need to get\nthe right data at the right time.\n\n00:06:04.432 --> 00:06:09.933\nSo wouldn't it be great if we could have\nexperts immediately access the robots\n\n00:06:09.957 --> 00:06:12.933\nwithout having to waste any time\nof driving to the site,\n\n00:06:12.957 --> 00:06:15.890\nso whoever's there,\nuse their robots over the Internet.\n\n00:06:15.914 --> 00:06:17.296\nWell, let's think about that.\n\n00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.692\nLet's think about a chemical\ntrain derailment in a rural county.\n\n00:06:20.716 --> 00:06:24.558\nWhat are the odds that the experts,\nyour chemical engineer,\n\n00:06:24.582 --> 00:06:26.444\nyour railroad transportation engineers,\n\n00:06:26.468 --> 00:06:31.329\nhave been trained on whatever UAV\nthat particular county happens to have?\n\n00:06:31.353 --> 00:06:32.886\nProbably, like, none.\n\n00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.300\nSo we're using these kinds of interfaces\n\n00:06:35.324 --> 00:06:39.664\nto allow people to use the robots\nwithout knowing what robot they're using,\n\n00:06:39.688 --> 00:06:42.474\nor even if they're using a robot or not.\n\n00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:50.244\nWhat the robots give you,\nwhat they give the experts, is data.\n\n00:06:50.268 --> 00:06:53.848\nThe problem becomes:\nwho gets what data when?\n\n00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:57.765\nOne thing to do is to ship\nall the information to everybody\n\n00:06:57.789 --> 00:06:59.301\nand let them sort it out.\n\n00:06:59.325 --> 00:07:03.181\nWell, the problem with that\nis it overwhelms the networks,\n\n00:07:03.205 --> 00:07:06.891\nand worse yet, it overwhelms\nthe cognitive abilities\n\n00:07:06.915 --> 00:07:11.424\nof each of the people trying to get\nthat one nugget of information\n\n00:07:11.448 --> 00:07:15.253\nthey need to make the decision\nthat's going to make the difference.\n\n00:07:15.957 --> 00:07:19.051\nSo we need to think\nabout those kinds of challenges.\n\n00:07:19.075 --> 00:07:20.340\nSo it's the data.\n\n00:07:20.364 --> 00:07:22.600\nGoing back to the World Trade Center,\n\n00:07:22.624 --> 00:07:26.933\nwe tried to solve that problem\nby just recording the data from Bujold\n\n00:07:26.957 --> 00:07:28.933\nonly when she was deep in the rubble,\n\n00:07:28.957 --> 00:07:31.521\nbecause that's what the USAR team\nsaid they wanted.\n\n00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:35.069\nWhat we didn't know at the time\n\n00:07:35.093 --> 00:07:37.691\nwas that the civil engineers\nwould have loved,\n\n00:07:37.715 --> 00:07:41.933\nneeded the data as we recorded\nthe box beams, the serial numbers,\n\n00:07:41.957 --> 00:07:44.576\nthe locations, as we went into the rubble.\n\n00:07:45.301 --> 00:07:46.768\nWe lost valuable data.\n\n00:07:46.792 --> 00:07:49.171\nSo the challenge is getting all the data\n\n00:07:49.195 --> 00:07:51.375\nand getting it to the right people.\n\n00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:53.476\nNow, here's another reason.\n\n00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.811\nWe've learned that some buildings --\n\n00:07:55.835 --> 00:07:59.107\nthings like schools,\nhospitals, city halls --\n\n00:07:59.131 --> 00:08:03.150\nget inspected four times\nby different agencies\n\n00:08:03.174 --> 00:08:05.424\nthroughout the response phases.\n\n00:08:06.114 --> 00:08:09.383\nNow, we're looking, if we can get\nthe data from the robots to share,\n\n00:08:09.407 --> 00:08:14.257\nnot only can we do things like\ncompress that sequence of phases\n\n00:08:14.281 --> 00:08:15.934\nto shorten the response time,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:20.316\nbut now we can begin\nto do the response in parallel.\n\n00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.719\nEverybody can see the data.\n\n00:08:21.743 --> 00:08:23.205\nWe can shorten it that way.\n\n00:08:23.957 --> 00:08:27.363\nSo really, \"disaster robotics\"\nis a misnomer.\n\n00:08:28.185 --> 00:08:30.080\nIt's not about the robots.\n\n00:08:30.104 --> 00:08:31.986\nIt's about the data.\n\n00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:35.721\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:35.745 --> 00:08:37.702\nSo my challenge to you:\n\n00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:40.026\nthe next time you hear about a disaster,\n\n00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:41.375\nlook for the robots.\n\n00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:44.524\nThey may be underground,\nthey may be underwater,\n\n00:08:44.548 --> 00:08:46.242\nthey may be in the sky,\n\n00:08:46.266 --> 00:08:48.231\nbut they should be there.\n\n00:08:48.255 --> 00:08:49.422\nLook for the robots,\n\n00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:52.193\nbecause robots are coming to the rescue.\n\n00:08:52.217 --> 00:08:57.878\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How too many rules at work keep you from getting things done", "duration": "998", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/yves_morieux_how_too_many_rules_at_work_keep_you_from_getting_things_done", "transcript": "Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize [winner] in economics, once wrote: \"Productivity is not everything, but in the long run, it is almost everything.\"So this is serious. There are not that many things on earth that are \"almost everything.\" Productivity is the principal driver of the prosperity of a society. So we have a problem. In the largest European economies, productivity used to grow five percent per annum in the '50s, '60s, early '70s. From '73 to '83: three percent per annum. From '83 to '95: two percent per annum. Since 1995: less than one percent per annum. The same profile in Japan. The same profile in the US, despite a momentary rebound 15 years ago, and despite all the technological innovations around us: the Internet, the information, the new information and communication technologies.When productivity grows three percent per annum, you double the standard of living every generation. Every generation is twice as well-off as its parents'. When it grows one percent per annum, it takes three generations to double the standard of living. And in this process, many people will be less well-off than their parents. They will have less of everything: smaller roofs, or perhaps no roof at all, less access to education, to vitamins, to antibiotics, to vaccination \u2014 to everything. Think of all the problems that we're facing at the moment. All. Chances are that they are rooted in the productivity crisis.Why this crisis? Because the basic tenets about efficiency \u2014 effectiveness in organizations, in management \u2014 have become counterproductive for human efforts. Everywhere in public services \u2014 in companies, in the way we work, the way we innovate, invest \u2014 try to learn to work better. Take the holy trinity of efficiency: clarity, measurement, accountability. They make human efforts derail.There are two ways to look at it, to prove it. One, the one I prefer, is rigorous, elegant, nice \u2014 math. But the full math version takes a little while, so there is another one. It is to look at a relay race. This is what we will do today. It's a bit more animated, more visual and also faster \u2014 it's a race. Hopefully, it's faster.(Laughter)World championship final \u2014 women. Eight teams in the final. The fastest team is the US team. They have the fastest women on earth. They are the favorite team to win. Notably, if you compare them to an average team, say, the French team,(Laughter)based on their best performances in the 100-meter race, if you add the individual times of the US runners, they arrive at the finish line 3.2 meters ahead of the French team. And this year, the US team is in great shape. Based on their best performance this year, they arrive 6.4 meters ahead of the French team, based on the data. We are going to look at the race. At some point you will see, towards the end, that Torri Edwards, the fourth US runner, is ahead. Not surprising \u2014 this year she got the gold medal in the 100-meter race. And by the way, Chryste Gaines, the second runner in the US team, is the fastest woman on earth. So, there are 3.5 billion women on earth. Where are the two fastest? On the US team. And the two other runners on the US team are not bad, either.(Laughter)So clearly, the US team has won the war for talent. But behind, the average team is trying to catch up. Let's watch the race.(Video: French sportscasters narrate race)(Video: Race narration ends)Yves Morieux: So what happened? The fastest team did not win; the slower one did. By the way, I hope you appreciate the deep historical research I did to make the French look good.(Laughter)But let's not exaggerate \u2014 it's not archeology, either.(Laughter)But why? Because of cooperation. When you hear this sentence: \"Thanks to cooperation, the whole is worth more than the sum of the parts.\" This is not poetry; this is not philosophy. This is math. Those who carry the baton are slower, but their baton is faster. Miracle of cooperation: it multiplies energy, intelligence in human efforts. It is the essence of human efforts: how we work together, how each effort contributes to the efforts of others. With cooperation, we can do more with less.Now, what happens to cooperation when the holy grail \u2014 the holy trinity, even \u2014 of clarity, measurement, accountability \u2014 appears?Clarity. Management reports are full of complaints about the lack of clarity. Compliance audits, consultants' diagnostics. We need more clarity, we need to clarify the roles, the processes. It is as though the runners on the team were saying, \"Let's be clear \u2014 where does my role really start and end? Am I supposed to run for 95 meters, 96, 97...?\" It's important, let's be clear. If you say 97, after 97 meters, people will drop the baton, whether there is someone to take it or not.Accountability. We are constantly trying to put accountability in someone's hands. Who is accountable for this process? We need somebody accountable for this process. So in the relay race, since passing the baton is so important, then we need somebody clearly accountable for passing the baton. So between each runner, now we will have a new dedicated athlete, clearly dedicated to taking the baton from one runner, and passing it to the next runner. And we will have at least two like that. Well, will we, in that case, win the race? That I don't know, but for sure, we would have a clear interface, a clear line of accountability. We will know who to blame. But we'll never win the race. If you think about it, we pay more attention to knowing who to blame in case we fail, than to creating the conditions to succeed. All the human intelligence put in organization design \u2014 urban structures, processing systems \u2014 what is the real goal? To have somebody guilty in case they fail. We are creating organizations able to fail, but in a compliant way, with somebody clearly accountable when we fail. And we are quite effective at that \u2014 failing.Measurement. What gets measured gets done. Look, to pass the baton, you have to do it at the right time, in the right hand, at the right speed. But to do that, you have to put energy in your arm. This energy that is in your arm will not be in your legs. It will come at the expense of your measurable speed. You have to shout early enough to the next runner when you will pass the baton, to signal that you are arriving, so that the next runner can prepare, can anticipate. And you have to shout loud. But the blood, the energy that will be in your throat will not be in your legs. Because you know, there are eight people shouting at the same time. So you have to recognize the voice of your colleague. You cannot say, \"Is it you?\" Too late!(Laughter)Now, let's look at the race in slow motion, and concentrate on the third runner. Look at where she allocates her efforts, her energy, her attention. Not all in her legs \u2014 that would be great for her own speed \u2014 but in also in her throat, arm, eye, brain. That makes a difference in whose legs? In the legs of the next runner. But when the next runner runs super-fast, is it because she made a super effort, or because of the way the third runner passed the baton? There is no metric on earth that will give us the answer. And if we reward people on the basis of their measurable performance, they will put their energy, their attention, their blood in what can get measured \u2014 in their legs. And the baton will fall and slow down.To cooperate is not a super effort, it is how you allocate your effort. It is to take a risk, because you sacrifice the ultimate protection granted by objectively measurable individual performance. It is to make a super difference in the performance of others, with whom we are compared. It takes being stupid to cooperate, then. And people are not stupid; they don't cooperate.You know, clarity, accountability, measurement were OK when the world was simpler. But business has become much more complex. With my teams, we have measured the evolution of complexity in business. It is much more demanding today to attract and retain customers, to build advantage on a global scale, to create value. And the more business gets complex, the more, in the name of clarity, accountability, measurement we multiply structures, processes, systems.You know, this drive for clarity and accountability triggers a counterproductive multiplication of interfaces, middle offices, coordinators that do not only mobilize people and resources, but that also add obstacles. And the more complicated the organization, the more difficult it is to understand what is really happening. So we need summaries, proxies, reports, key performance indicators, metrics. So people put their energy in what can get measured, at the expense of cooperation. And as performance deteriorates, we add even more structure, process, systems. People spend their time in meetings, writing reports they have to do, undo and redo. Based on our analysis, teams in these organizations spend between 40 and 80 percent of their time wasting their time, but working harder and harder, longer and longer, on less and less value-adding activities. This is what is killing productivity, what makes people suffer at work.Our organizations are wasting human intelligence. They have turned against human efforts. When people don't cooperate, don't blame their mindsets, their mentalities, their personality \u2014 look at the work situations. Is it really in their personal interest to cooperate or not, if, when they cooperate, they are individually worse off? Why would they cooperate? When we blame personalities instead of the clarity, the accountability, the measurement, we add injustice to ineffectiveness.We need to create organizations in which it becomes individually useful for people to cooperate. Remove the interfaces, the middle offices \u2014 all these complicated coordination structures. Don't look for clarity; go for fuzziness. Fuzziness overlaps. Remove most of the quantitative metrics to assess performance. Speed the \"what.\" Look at cooperation, the \"how.\" How did you pass the baton? Did you throw it, or did you pass it effectively? Am I putting my energy in what can get measured \u2014 my legs, my speed \u2014 or in passing the baton?You, as leaders, as managers, are you making it individually useful for people to cooperate? The future of our organizations, our companies, our societies hinges on your answer to these questions.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2321, "subtitle":

00:03:32.123\nIt is to look at a relay race.\n\n00:03:32.655 --> 00:03:34.323\nThis is what we will do today.\n\n00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:40.697\nIt's a bit more animated, more visual\nand also faster -- it's a race.\n\n00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.824\nHopefully, it's faster.\n\n00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:44.212\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:44.236 --> 00:03:49.194\nWorld championship final -- women.\n\n00:03:49.218 --> 00:03:51.329\nEight teams in the final.\n\n00:03:51.353 --> 00:03:54.158\nThe fastest team is the US team.\n\n00:03:55.087 --> 00:03:57.754\nThey have the fastest women on earth.\n\n00:03:58.111 --> 00:04:00.886\nThey are the favorite team to win.\n\n00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.100\nNotably, if you compare them\nto an average team,\n\n00:04:05.124 --> 00:04:06.498\nsay, the French team,\n\n00:04:06.522 --> 00:04:08.109\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:08.133 --> 00:04:13.328\nbased on their best performances\nin the 100-meter race,\n\n00:04:13.352 --> 00:04:19.121\nif you add the individual times\nof the US runners,\n\n00:04:19.145 --> 00:04:26.057\nthey arrive at the finish line\n3.2 meters ahead of the French team.\n\n00:04:26.396 --> 00:04:29.420\nAnd this year, the US team\nis in great shape.\n\n00:04:29.992 --> 00:04:32.378\nBased on their best performance this year,\n\n00:04:32.402 --> 00:04:37.307\nthey arrive 6.4 meters\nahead of the French team,\n\n00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:38.696\nbased on the data.\n\n00:04:39.232 --> 00:04:40.811\nWe are going to look at the race.\n\n00:04:40.835 --> 00:04:43.258\nAt some point you will see,\ntowards the end,\n\n00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:49.588\nthat Torri Edwards,\nthe fourth US runner, is ahead.\n\n00:04:49.612 --> 00:04:56.101\nNot surprising -- this year she got\nthe gold medal in the 100-meter race.\n\n00:04:56.125 --> 00:05:01.067\nAnd by the way, Chryste Gaines,\nthe second runner in the US team,\n\n00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:03.728\nis the fastest woman on earth.\n\n00:05:03.752 --> 00:05:08.905\nSo, there are 3.5 billion women on earth.\n\n00:05:09.848 --> 00:05:13.021\nWhere are the two fastest? On the US team.\n\n00:05:13.045 --> 00:05:16.318\nAnd the two other runners\non the US team are not bad, either.\n\n00:05:16.342 --> 00:05:18.058\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:18.082 --> 00:05:22.753\nSo clearly, the US team has won\nthe war for talent.\n\n00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:28.330\nBut behind, the average team\nis trying to catch up.\n\n00:05:28.354 --> 00:05:29.703\nLet's watch the race.\n\n00:05:30.258 --> 00:05:35.283\n(Video: French sportscasters narrate race)\n\n00:06:18.844 --> 00:06:20.844\n(Video: Race narration ends)\n\n00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.565\nYves Morieux: So what happened?\n\n00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:28.000\nThe fastest team did not win;\nthe slower one did.\n\n00:06:28.767 --> 00:06:30.704\nBy the way, I hope you appreciate\n\n00:06:30.728 --> 00:06:36.654\nthe deep historical research I did\nto make the French look good.\n\n00:06:36.678 --> 00:06:38.973\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:45.862\nBut let's not exaggerate --\nit's not archeology, either.\n\n00:06:45.886 --> 00:06:47.867\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:47.891 --> 00:06:49.057\nBut why?\n\n00:06:49.081 --> 00:06:50.621\nBecause of cooperation.\n\n00:06:50.645 --> 00:06:52.479\nWhen you hear this sentence:\n\n00:06:52.503 --> 00:06:56.904\n\"Thanks to cooperation, the whole\nis worth more than the sum of the parts.\"\n\n00:06:57.665 --> 00:07:00.980\nThis is not poetry;\nthis is not philosophy.\n\n00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:02.519\nThis is math.\n\n00:07:03.154 --> 00:07:06.434\nThose who carry the baton are slower,\n\n00:07:06.458 --> 00:07:08.155\nbut their baton is faster.\n\n00:07:08.806 --> 00:07:10.441\nMiracle of cooperation:\n\n00:07:11.015 --> 00:07:16.295\nit multiplies energy,\nintelligence in human efforts.\n\n00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:19.294\nIt is the essence of human efforts:\n\n00:07:19.318 --> 00:07:25.134\nhow we work together, how each effort\ncontributes to the efforts of others.\n\n00:07:25.975 --> 00:07:29.223\nWith cooperation,\nwe can do more with less.\n\n00:07:29.746 --> 00:07:35.294\nNow, what happens to cooperation\nwhen the holy grail --\n\n00:07:35.318 --> 00:07:37.756\nthe holy trinity, even --\n\n00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:44.001\nof clarity, measurement, accountability --\n\n00:07:44.025 --> 00:07:45.194\nappears?\n\n00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:48.062\nClarity.\n\n00:07:48.086 --> 00:07:52.667\nManagement reports are full of complaints\nabout the lack of clarity.\n\n00:07:53.382 --> 00:07:57.099\nCompliance audits,\nconsultants' diagnostics.\n\n00:07:58.448 --> 00:08:02.980\nWe need more clarity, we need\nto clarify the roles, the processes.\n\n00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:08.066\nIt is as though the runners\non the team were saying,\n\n00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:14.038\n\"Let's be clear -- where does my role\nreally start and end?\n\n00:08:14.896 --> 00:08:19.728\nAm I supposed to run for 95 meters,\n96, 97...?\"\n\n00:08:19.752 --> 00:08:21.542\nIt's important, let's be clear.\n\n00:08:22.843 --> 00:08:25.849\nIf you say 97, after 97 meters,\n\n00:08:25.873 --> 00:08:29.405\npeople will drop the baton, whether\nthere is someone to take it or not.\n\n00:08:31.103 --> 00:08:32.325\nAccountability.\n\n00:08:33.042 --> 00:08:36.492\nWe are constantly trying\nto put accountability\n\n00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:38.089\nin someone's hands.\n\n00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:41.090\nWho is accountable for this process?\n\n00:08:41.114 --> 00:08:44.235\nWe need somebody accountable\nfor this process.\n\n00:08:44.592 --> 00:08:49.053\nSo in the relay race,\nsince passing the baton is so important,\n\n00:08:49.077 --> 00:08:52.824\nthen we need somebody\nclearly accountable for passing the baton.\n\n00:08:53.744 --> 00:08:55.923\nSo between each runner,\n\n00:08:55.947 --> 00:09:00.671\nnow we will have a new dedicated athlete,\n\n00:09:00.695 --> 00:09:05.240\nclearly dedicated to taking\nthe baton from one runner,\n\n00:09:05.264 --> 00:09:07.560\nand passing it to the next runner.\n\n00:09:08.242 --> 00:09:10.751\nAnd we will have at least two like that.\n\n00:09:12.339 --> 00:09:18.799\nWell, will we, in that case, win the race?\n\n00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:21.862\nThat I don't know, but for sure,\n\n00:09:21.886 --> 00:09:25.156\nwe would have a clear interface,\n\n00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.824\na clear line of accountability.\n\n00:09:27.848 --> 00:09:29.776\nWe will know who to blame.\n\n00:09:30.792 --> 00:09:33.033\nBut we'll never win the race.\n\n00:09:33.057 --> 00:09:38.044\nIf you think about it,\nwe pay more attention\n\n00:09:38.068 --> 00:09:42.223\nto knowing who to blame in case we fail,\n\n00:09:42.247 --> 00:09:45.968\nthan to creating\nthe conditions to succeed.\n\n00:09:47.342 --> 00:09:50.705\nAll the human intelligence\nput in organization design --\n\n00:09:50.729 --> 00:09:53.514\nurban structures, processing systems --\n\n00:09:53.538 --> 00:09:55.162\nwhat is the real goal?\n\n00:09:56.305 --> 00:09:59.235\nTo have somebody guilty in case they fail.\n\n00:10:00.457 --> 00:10:05.344\nWe are creating\norganizations able to fail,\n\n00:10:05.368 --> 00:10:08.345\nbut in a compliant way,\n\n00:10:08.369 --> 00:10:11.811\nwith somebody clearly\naccountable when we fail.\n\n00:10:11.835 --> 00:10:15.659\nAnd we are quite effective\nat that -- failing.\n\n00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.011\nMeasurement.\n\n00:10:18.632 --> 00:10:20.060\nWhat gets measured gets done.\n\n00:10:20.084 --> 00:10:24.475\nLook, to pass the baton,\nyou have to do it at the right time,\n\n00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:26.974\nin the right hand, at the right speed.\n\n00:10:27.415 --> 00:10:29.974\nBut to do that, you have to put\nenergy in your arm.\n\n00:10:29.998 --> 00:10:32.989\nThis energy that is in your arm\nwill not be in your legs.\n\n00:10:33.449 --> 00:10:36.428\nIt will come at the expense\nof your measurable speed.\n\n00:10:37.325 --> 00:10:40.778\nYou have to shout early enough\nto the next runner\n\n00:10:40.802 --> 00:10:44.113\nwhen you will pass the baton,\nto signal that you are arriving,\n\n00:10:44.137 --> 00:10:47.342\nso that the next runner\ncan prepare, can anticipate.\n\n00:10:47.366 --> 00:10:49.529\nAnd you have to shout loud.\n\n00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:54.113\nBut the blood, the energy\nthat will be in your throat\n\n00:10:54.137 --> 00:10:55.537\nwill not be in your legs.\n\n00:10:55.561 --> 00:10:59.317\nBecause you know, there are\neight people shouting at the same time.\n\n00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:01.980\nSo you have to recognize the voice\nof your colleague.\n\n00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.083\nYou cannot say, \"Is it you?\"\n\n00:11:04.528 --> 00:11:05.682\nToo late!\n\n00:11:05.706 --> 00:11:06.912\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:06.936 --> 00:11:11.912\nNow, let's look at the race\nin slow motion,\n\n00:11:11.936 --> 00:11:14.484\nand concentrate on the third runner.\n\n00:11:14.508 --> 00:11:18.931\nLook at where she allocates her efforts,\n\n00:11:18.955 --> 00:11:21.662\nher energy, her attention.\n\n00:11:22.836 --> 00:11:25.980\nNot all in her legs -- that would\nbe great for her own speed --\n\n00:11:26.004 --> 00:11:29.494\nbut in also in her throat,\narm, eye, brain.\n\n00:11:29.518 --> 00:11:31.864\nThat makes a difference in whose legs?\n\n00:11:32.272 --> 00:11:34.384\nIn the legs of the next runner.\n\n00:11:34.686 --> 00:11:37.520\nBut when the next runner runs super-fast,\n\n00:11:37.544 --> 00:11:39.672\nis it because she made a super effort,\n\n00:11:39.696 --> 00:11:42.933\nor because of the way\nthe third runner passed the baton?\n\n00:11:43.361 --> 00:11:47.216\nThere is no metric on earth\nthat will give us the answer.\n\n00:11:48.268 --> 00:11:52.779\nAnd if we reward people on the basis\nof their measurable performance,\n\n00:11:52.803 --> 00:11:55.857\nthey will put their energy,\ntheir attention, their blood\n\n00:11:55.881 --> 00:11:57.904\nin what can get measured -- in their legs.\n\n00:11:58.539 --> 00:12:00.785\nAnd the baton will fall and slow down.\n\n00:12:01.492 --> 00:12:04.064\nTo cooperate is not a super effort,\n\n00:12:04.088 --> 00:12:06.111\nit is how you allocate your effort.\n\n00:12:07.238 --> 00:12:09.078\nIt is to take a risk,\n\n00:12:09.102 --> 00:12:13.332\nbecause you sacrifice\nthe ultimate protection\n\n00:12:13.356 --> 00:12:18.783\ngranted by objectively measurable\nindividual performance.\n\n00:12:20.474 --> 00:12:24.351\nIt is to make a super difference\nin the performance of others,\n\n00:12:24.375 --> 00:12:26.065\nwith whom we are compared.\n\n00:12:26.715 --> 00:12:29.049\nIt takes being stupid to cooperate, then.\n\n00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:32.239\nAnd people are not stupid;\nthey don't cooperate.\n\n00:12:32.696 --> 00:12:37.836\nYou know, clarity, accountability,\nmeasurement were OK\n\n00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.276\nwhen the world was simpler.\n\n00:12:40.887 --> 00:12:43.911\nBut business has become much more complex.\n\n00:12:43.935 --> 00:12:45.966\nWith my teams, we have measured\n\n00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:49.014\nthe evolution of complexity in business.\n\n00:12:49.038 --> 00:12:54.641\nIt is much more demanding today\nto attract and retain customers,\n\n00:12:54.665 --> 00:12:57.976\nto build advantage on a global scale,\n\n00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.459\nto create value.\n\n00:13:00.649 --> 00:13:03.406\nAnd the more business gets complex,\n\n00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:08.731\nthe more, in the name of clarity,\naccountability, measurement\n\n00:13:08.755 --> 00:13:12.419\nwe multiply structures,\nprocesses, systems.\n\n00:13:13.041 --> 00:13:17.850\nYou know, this drive for clarity\nand accountability triggers\n\n00:13:17.874 --> 00:13:23.229\na counterproductive multiplication\nof interfaces, middle offices,\n\n00:13:23.253 --> 00:13:28.290\ncoordinators that do not only\nmobilize people and resources,\n\n00:13:28.314 --> 00:13:30.623\nbut that also add obstacles.\n\n00:13:31.234 --> 00:13:35.804\nAnd the more complicated the organization,\n\n00:13:35.828 --> 00:13:39.481\nthe more difficult it is to understand\nwhat is really happening.\n\n00:13:39.505 --> 00:13:44.925\nSo we need summaries, proxies, reports,\n\n00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:48.249\nkey performance indicators, metrics.\n\n00:13:48.273 --> 00:13:52.985\nSo people put their energy\nin what can get measured,\n\n00:13:53.009 --> 00:13:55.104\nat the expense of cooperation.\n\n00:13:55.128 --> 00:13:57.660\nAnd as performance deteriorates,\n\n00:13:57.684 --> 00:14:00.813\nwe add even more structure,\nprocess, systems.\n\n00:14:00.837 --> 00:14:03.669\nPeople spend their time in meetings,\n\n00:14:03.693 --> 00:14:07.819\nwriting reports they have\nto do, undo and redo.\n\n00:14:08.247 --> 00:14:11.669\nBased on our analysis,\nteams in these organizations\n\n00:14:11.693 --> 00:14:17.864\nspend between 40 and 80 percent\nof their time wasting their time,\n\n00:14:17.888 --> 00:14:21.881\nbut working harder and harder,\nlonger and longer,\n\n00:14:21.905 --> 00:14:24.848\non less and less value-adding activities.\n\n00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.510\nThis is what is killing productivity,\n\n00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:30.732\nwhat makes people suffer at work.\n\n00:14:31.184 --> 00:14:35.721\nOur organizations are wasting\nhuman intelligence.\n\n00:14:35.745 --> 00:14:39.393\nThey have turned against human efforts.\n\n00:14:40.631 --> 00:14:43.521\nWhen people don't cooperate,\n\n00:14:43.545 --> 00:14:47.940\ndon't blame their mindsets,\ntheir mentalities, their personality --\n\n00:14:47.964 --> 00:14:50.115\nlook at the work situations.\n\n00:14:51.083 --> 00:14:55.332\nIs it really in their personal interest\nto cooperate or not,\n\n00:14:55.356 --> 00:14:59.341\nif, when they cooperate,\nthey are individually worse off?\n\n00:14:59.872 --> 00:15:01.491\nWhy would they cooperate?\n\n00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.472\nWhen we blame personalities\n\n00:15:05.496 --> 00:15:11.654\ninstead of the clarity,\nthe accountability, the measurement,\n\n00:15:11.678 --> 00:15:15.336\nwe add injustice to ineffectiveness.\n\n00:15:17.612 --> 00:15:19.525\nWe need to create organizations\n\n00:15:19.549 --> 00:15:23.863\nin which it becomes individually useful\nfor

I was interested in science \u2014 fascinated by it, excited to learn about it. And I had a high school science teacher who would say to the class, \"The girls don't have to listen to this.\"Encouraging, yes.(Laughter)I chose not to listen \u2014 but to that statement alone.So let me take you to the Andes mountains in Chile, 500 kilometers, 300 miles northeast of Santiago. It's very remote, it's very dry and it's very beautiful. And there's not much there. There are condors, there are tarantulas, and at night, when the light dims, it reveals one of the darkest skies on Earth. It's kind of a magic place, the mountain. It's a wonderful combination of very remote mountaintop with exquisitely sophisticated technology.And our ancestors, for as long as there's been recorded history, have looked at the night sky and pondered the nature of our existence. And we're no exception, our generation. The only difficulty is that the night sky now is blocked by the glare of city lights. And so astronomers go to these very remote mountaintops to view and to study the cosmos. So telescopes are our window to the cosmos.It's no exaggeration to say that the Southern Hemisphere is going to be the future of astronomy for the 21st century. We have an array of existing telescopes already, in the Andes mountains in Chile, and that's soon to be joined by a really sensational array of new capability. There will be two international groups that are going to be building giant telescopes, sensitive to optical radiation, as our eyes are. There will be a survey telescope that will be scanning the sky every few nights. There will be radio telescopes, sensitive to long-wavelength radio radiation. And then there will be telescopes in space. There'll be a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope; it's called the James Webb Telescope, and it will be launched in 2018. There'll be a satellite called TESS that will discover planets outside of our solar system.For the last decade, I've been leading a group \u2014 a consortium \u2014 international group, to build what will be, when it's finished, the largest optical telescope in existence. It's called the Giant Magellan Telescope, or GMT. This telescope is going to have mirrors that are 8.4 meters in diameter \u2014 each of the mirrors. That's almost 27 feet. So it dwarfs this stage \u2014 maybe out to the fourth row in this audience. Each of the seven mirrors in this telescope will be almost 27 feet in diameter. Together, the seven mirrors in this telescope will comprise 80 feet in diameter. So, essentially the size of this entire auditorium. The whole telescope will stand about 43 meters high, and again, being in Rio, some of you have been to see the statue of the giant Christ. The scale is comparable in height; in fact, it's smaller than this telescope will be. It's comparable to the size of the Statue of Liberty. And it's going to be housed in an enclosure that's 22 stories \u2014 60 meters high. But it's an unusual building to protect this telescope. It will have open windows to the sky, be able to point and look at the sky, and it will actually rotate on a base \u2014 2,000 tons of rotating building.The Giant Magellan Telescope will have 10 times the resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope. It will be 20 million times more sensitive than the human eye. And it may, for the first time ever, be capable of finding life on planets outside of our solar system. It's going to allow us to look back at the first light in the universe \u2014 literally, the dawn of the cosmos. The cosmic dawn. It's a telescope that's going to allow us to peer back, witness galaxies as they were when they were actually assembling, the first black holes in the universe, the first galaxies.Now, for thousands of years, we have been studying the cosmos, we've been wondering about our place in the universe. The ancient Greeks told us that the Earth was the center of the universe. Five hundred years ago, Copernicus displaced the Earth, and put the Sun at the heart of the cosmos. And as we've learned over the centuries, since Galileo Galilei, the Italian scientist, first turned, in that time, a two-inch, very small telescope, to the sky, every time we have built larger telescopes, we have learned something about the universe; we've made discoveries, without exception. We've learned in the 20th century that the universe is expanding and that our own solar system is not at the center of that expansion. We know now that the universe is made of about 100 billion galaxies that are visible to us, and each one of those galaxies has 100 billion stars within it.So we're looking now at the deepest image of the cosmos that's ever been taken. It was taken using the Hubble Space Telescope, and by pointing the telescope at what was previously a blank region of sky, before the launch of Hubble. And if you can imagine this tiny area, it's only one-fiftieth of the size of the full moon. So, if you can imagine the full moon. And there are now 10,000 galaxies visible within that image. And the faintness of those images and the tiny size is only a result of the fact that those galaxies are so far away, the vast distances. And each of those galaxies may contain within it a few billion or even hundreds of billions of individual stars. Telescopes are like time machines. So the farther back we look in space, the further back we see in time. And they're like light buckets \u2014 literally, they collect light. So larger the bucket, the larger the mirror we have, the more light we can see, and the farther back we can view.So, we've learned in the last century that there are exotic objects in the universe \u2014 black holes. We've even learned that there's dark matter and dark energy that we can't see. So you're looking now at an actual image of dark matter.(Laughter)You got it. Not all audiences get that.(Laughter)So the way we infer the presence of dark matter \u2014 we can't see it \u2014 but there's an unmistakable tug, due to gravity. We now can look out, we see this sea of galaxies in a universe that's expanding.What I do myself is to measure the expansion of the universe, and one of the projects that I carried out in the 1990s used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure how fast the universe is expanding. We can now trace back to 14 billion years. We've learned over time that stars have individual histories; that is, they have birth, they have middle ages and some of them even have dramatic deaths. So the embers from those stars actually then form the new stars that we see, most of which turn out to have planets going around them.And one of the really surprising results in the last 20 years has been the discovery of other planets going around other stars. These are called exoplanets. And until 1995, we didn't even know the existence of any other planets, other than going around our own sun. But now, there are almost 2,000 other planets orbiting other stars that we can now detect, measure masses for. There are 500 of those that are multiple-planet systems. And there are 4,000 \u2014 and still counting \u2014 other candidates for planets orbiting other stars. They come in a bewildering variety of different kinds. There are Jupiter-like planets that are hot, there are other planets that are icy, there are water worlds and there are rocky planets like the Earth, so-called \"super-Earths,\" and there have even been planets that have been speculated diamond worlds.So we know there's at least one planet, our own Earth, in which there is life. We've even found planets that are orbiting two stars. That's no longer the province of science fiction. So around our own planet, we know there's life, we've developed a complex life, we now can question our own origins. And given all that we've discovered, the overwhelming numbers now suggest that there may be millions, perhaps \u2014 maybe even hundreds of millions \u2014 of other [planets] that are close enough \u2014 just the right distance from their stars that they're orbiting \u2014 to have the existence of liquid water and maybe could potentially support life. So we marvel now at those odds, the overwhelming odds, and the amazing thing is that within the next decade, the GMT may be able to take spectra of the atmospheres of those planets, and determine whether or not they have the potential for life.So, what is the GMT project? It's an international project. It includes Australia, South Korea, and I'm happy to say, being here in Rio, that the newest partner in our telescope is Brazil.(Applause)It also includes a number of institutions across the United States, including Harvard University, the Smithsonian and the Carnegie Institutions, and the Universities of Arizona, Chicago, Texas-Austin and Texas A&M University. It also involves Chile.So, the making of the mirrors in this telescope is also fascinating in its own right. Take chunks of glass, melt them in a furnace that is itself rotating. This happens underneath the football stadium at the University of Arizona. It's tucked away under 52,000 seats. Nobody know it's happening. And there's essentially a rotating cauldron. The mirrors are cast and they're cooled very slowly, and then they're polished to an exquisite precision. And so, if you think about the precision of these mirrors, the bumps on the mirror, over the entire 27 feet, amount to less than one-millionth of an inch. So, can you visualize that? Ow!(Laughter)That's one five-thousandths of the width of one of my hairs, over this entire 27 feet. It's a spectacular achievement. It's what allows us to have the precision that we will have.So, what does that precision buy us? So the GMT, if you can imagine \u2014 if I were to hold up a coin, which I just happen to have, and I look at the face of that coin, I can see from here the writing on the coin; I can see the face on that coin. My guess that even in the front row, you can't see that. But if we were to turn the Giant Magellan Telescope, all 80-feet diameter that we see in this auditorium, and point it 200 miles away, if I were standing in S\u00e3o Paulo, we could resolve the face of this coin. That's the extraordinary resolution and power of this telescope. And if we were \u2014(Applause)If an astronaut went up to the Moon, a quarter of a million miles away, and lit a candle \u2014 a single candle \u2014 then we would be able to detect it, using the GMT. Quite extraordinary.This is a simulated image of a cluster in a nearby galaxy. \"Nearby\" is astronomical, it's all relative. It's tens of millions of light-years away. This is what this cluster would look like. So look at those four bright objects, and now lets compare it with a camera on the Hubble Space Telescope. You can see faint detail that starts to come through. And now finally \u2014 and look how dramatic this is \u2014 this is what the GMT will see. So, keep your eyes on those bright images again. This is what we see on one of the most powerful existing telescopes on the Earth, and this, again, what the GMT will see. Extraordinary precision.So, where are we? We have now leveled the top of the mountaintop in Chile. We blasted that off. We've tested and polished the first mirror. We've cast the second and the third mirrors. And we're about to cast the fourth mirror. We had a series of reviews this year, international panels that came in and reviewed us, and said, \"You're ready to go to construction.\" And so we plan on building this telescope with the first four mirrors. We want to get on the air quickly, and be taking science data \u2014 what we astronomers call \"first light,\" in 2021. And the full telescope will be finished in the middle of the next decade, with all seven mirrors.So we're now poised to look back at the distant universe, the cosmic dawn. We'll be able to study other planets in exquisite detail.But for me, one of the most exciting things about building the GMT is the opportunity to actually discover something that we don't know about \u2014 that we can't even imagine at this point, something completely new. And my hope is that with the construction of this and other facilities, that many young women and men will be inspired to reach for the stars.Thank you very much. Obrigado.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Wendy. Stay with me, because I have a question for you. You mentioned different facilities. So the Magellan Telescope is going up, but also ALMA and others in Chile and elsewhere, including in Hawaii. Is it about cooperation and complementarity, or about competition? I know there's competition in terms of funding, but what about the science?Wendy Freedman: In terms of the science, they're very complementary. The telescopes that are in space, the telescopes on the ground, telescopes with different wavelength capability, telescopes even that are similar, but different instruments \u2014 they will all look at different parts of the questions that we're asking. So when we discover other planets, we'll be able to test those observations, we'll be able to measure the atmospheres, be able to look in space with very high resolution. So, they're very complementary. You're right about the funding, we compete; but scientifically, it's very complementary.BG: Wendy, thank you very much for coming to TEDGlobal.WF: Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2320, "subtitle":

00:05:24.603\nWe've learned in the 20th century\nthat the universe is expanding\n\n00:05:24.627 --> 00:05:29.351\nand that our own solar system\nis not at the center of that expansion.\n\n00:05:29.715 --> 00:05:34.994\nWe know now that the universe\nis made of about 100 billion galaxies\n\n00:05:35.018 --> 00:05:36.668\nthat are visible to us,\n\n00:05:36.692 --> 00:05:42.103\nand each one of those galaxies\nhas 100 billion stars within it.\n\n00:05:43.192 --> 00:05:46.054\nSo we're looking now\nat the deepest image of the cosmos\n\n00:05:46.078 --> 00:05:47.577\nthat's ever been taken.\n\n00:05:47.973 --> 00:05:50.791\nIt was taken using\nthe Hubble Space Telescope,\n\n00:05:50.815 --> 00:05:55.705\nand by pointing the telescope at what\nwas previously a blank region of sky,\n\n00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.328\nbefore the launch of Hubble.\n\n00:05:57.352 --> 00:05:59.615\nAnd if you can imagine this tiny area,\n\n00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:02.969\nit's only one-fiftieth\nof the size of the full moon.\n\n00:06:02.993 --> 00:06:05.033\nSo, if you can imagine the full moon.\n\n00:06:05.057 --> 00:06:09.195\nAnd there are now 10,000 galaxies\nvisible within that image.\n\n00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.418\nAnd the faintness of those images\nand the tiny size is only a result\n\n00:06:14.442 --> 00:06:18.849\nof the fact that those galaxies\nare so far away, the vast distances.\n\n00:06:18.873 --> 00:06:21.806\nAnd each of those galaxies\nmay contain within it\n\n00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.839\na few billion or even hundreds\nof billions of individual stars.\n\n00:06:27.549 --> 00:06:29.568\nTelescopes are like time machines.\n\n00:06:29.592 --> 00:06:34.055\nSo the farther back we look in space,\nthe further back we see in time.\n\n00:06:34.428 --> 00:06:37.614\nAnd they're like light buckets --\nliterally, they collect light.\n\n00:06:37.638 --> 00:06:40.872\nSo larger the bucket,\nthe larger the mirror we have,\n\n00:06:40.896 --> 00:06:44.306\nthe more light we can see,\nand the farther back we can view.\n\n00:06:45.568 --> 00:06:47.839\nSo, we've learned in the last century\n\n00:06:47.863 --> 00:06:50.797\nthat there are exotic objects\nin the universe -- black holes.\n\n00:06:50.821 --> 00:06:53.598\nWe've even learned\nthat there's dark matter and dark energy\n\n00:06:53.622 --> 00:06:54.833\nthat we can't see.\n\n00:06:55.176 --> 00:06:58.734\nSo you're looking now\nat an actual image of dark matter.\n\n00:06:58.758 --> 00:06:59.908\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:59.932 --> 00:07:02.575\nYou got it. Not all audiences get that.\n\n00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:04.364\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:04.388 --> 00:07:07.112\nSo the way we infer\nthe presence of dark matter --\n\n00:07:07.136 --> 00:07:11.831\nwe can't see it -- but there's\nan unmistakable tug, due to gravity.\n\n00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.638\nWe now can look out,\nwe see this sea of galaxies\n\n00:07:16.662 --> 00:07:18.439\nin a universe that's expanding.\n\n00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.123\nWhat I do myself is to measure\nthe expansion of the universe,\n\n00:07:22.147 --> 00:07:25.288\nand one of the projects\nthat I carried out in the 1990s\n\n00:07:25.312 --> 00:07:30.428\nused the Hubble Space Telescope to measure\nhow fast the universe is expanding.\n\n00:07:31.314 --> 00:07:35.280\nWe can now trace back to 14 billion years.\n\n00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:40.025\nWe've learned over time\nthat stars have individual histories;\n\n00:07:40.049 --> 00:07:42.978\nthat is, they have birth,\nthey have middle ages\n\n00:07:43.002 --> 00:07:45.332\nand some of them\neven have dramatic deaths.\n\n00:07:45.787 --> 00:07:51.902\nSo the embers from those stars actually\nthen form the new stars that we see,\n\n00:07:51.926 --> 00:07:55.737\nmost of which turn out to have\nplanets going around them.\n\n00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:00.265\nAnd one of the really surprising results\nin the last 20 years\n\n00:08:00.289 --> 00:08:04.415\nhas been the discovery\nof other planets going around other stars.\n\n00:08:04.439 --> 00:08:06.345\nThese are called exoplanets.\n\n00:08:06.369 --> 00:08:11.365\nAnd until 1995, we didn't even know\nthe existence of any other planets,\n\n00:08:11.389 --> 00:08:13.723\nother than going around our own sun.\n\n00:08:14.318 --> 00:08:20.739\nBut now, there are almost 2,000\nother planets orbiting other stars\n\n00:08:20.763 --> 00:08:23.323\nthat we can now detect,\nmeasure masses for.\n\n00:08:23.347 --> 00:08:27.019\nThere are 500 of those\nthat are multiple-planet systems.\n\n00:08:27.043 --> 00:08:31.003\nAnd there are 4,000 --\nand still counting -- other candidates\n\n00:08:31.027 --> 00:08:33.241\nfor planets orbiting other stars.\n\n00:08:33.748 --> 00:08:36.721\nThey come in a bewildering variety\nof different kinds.\n\n00:08:37.092 --> 00:08:40.378\nThere are Jupiter-like\nplanets that are hot,\n\n00:08:40.402 --> 00:08:44.660\nthere are other planets that are icy,\nthere are water worlds\n\n00:08:44.684 --> 00:08:47.938\nand there are rocky planets\nlike the Earth, so-called \"super-Earths,\"\n\n00:08:47.962 --> 00:08:52.649\nand there have even been planets\nthat have been speculated diamond worlds.\n\n00:08:53.752 --> 00:08:58.707\nSo we know there's at least one planet,\nour own Earth, in which there is life.\n\n00:08:58.731 --> 00:09:02.891\nWe've even found planets\nthat are orbiting two stars.\n\n00:09:02.915 --> 00:09:06.096\nThat's no longer the province\nof science fiction.\n\n00:09:07.169 --> 00:09:09.383\nSo around our own planet,\nwe know there's life,\n\n00:09:09.407 --> 00:09:15.123\nwe've developed a complex life,\nwe now can question our own origins.\n\n00:09:15.686 --> 00:09:19.906\nAnd given all that we've discovered,\nthe overwhelming numbers now suggest\n\n00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:24.002\nthat there may be millions, perhaps --\nmaybe even hundreds of millions --\n\n00:09:24.026 --> 00:09:26.805\nof other [planets]\nthat are close enough --\n\n00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:30.119\njust the right distance from their stars\nthat they're orbiting --\n\n00:09:30.143 --> 00:09:35.679\nto have the existence of liquid water\nand maybe could potentially support life.\n\n00:09:36.079 --> 00:09:40.253\nSo we marvel now at those odds,\nthe overwhelming odds,\n\n00:09:40.277 --> 00:09:43.220\nand the amazing thing\nis that within the next decade,\n\n00:09:43.244 --> 00:09:48.474\nthe GMT may be able to take spectra\nof the atmospheres of those planets,\n\n00:09:48.498 --> 00:09:52.010\nand determine whether or not\nthey have the potential for life.\n\n00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.440\nSo, what is the GMT project?\n\n00:09:55.464 --> 00:09:57.338\nIt's an international project.\n\n00:09:57.362 --> 00:10:03.211\nIt includes Australia, South Korea,\nand I'm happy to say, being here in Rio,\n\n00:10:03.235 --> 00:10:06.270\nthat the newest partner\nin our telescope is Brazil.\n\n00:10:06.783 --> 00:10:11.242\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:11.266 --> 00:10:16.056\nIt also includes a number of institutions\nacross the United States,\n\n00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.176\nincluding Harvard University,\n\n00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.144\nthe Smithsonian\nand the Carnegie Institutions,\n\n00:10:22.168 --> 00:10:28.635\nand the Universities of Arizona, Chicago,\nTexas-Austin and Texas A&amp;M University.\n\n00:10:29.032 --> 00:10:30.919\nIt also involves Chile.\n\n00:10:32.681 --> 00:10:35.893\nSo, the making of the mirrors\nin this telescope is also fascinating\n\n00:10:35.917 --> 00:10:37.282\nin its own right.\n\n00:10:37.306 --> 00:10:41.941\nTake chunks of glass, melt them\nin a furnace that is itself rotating.\n\n00:10:42.709 --> 00:10:44.800\nThis happens underneath\nthe football stadium\n\n00:10:44.824 --> 00:10:46.866\nat the University of Arizona.\n\n00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.826\nIt's tucked away under 52,000 seats.\n\n00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:51.251\nNobody know it's happening.\n\n00:10:51.696 --> 00:10:55.020\nAnd there's essentially\na rotating cauldron.\n\n00:10:55.044 --> 00:10:58.079\nThe mirrors are cast\nand they're cooled very slowly,\n\n00:10:58.103 --> 00:11:01.016\nand then they're polished\nto an exquisite precision.\n\n00:11:01.595 --> 00:11:04.672\nAnd so, if you think\nabout the precision of these mirrors,\n\n00:11:04.696 --> 00:11:09.249\nthe bumps on the mirror,\nover the entire 27 feet,\n\n00:11:09.273 --> 00:11:12.952\namount to less\nthan one-millionth of an inch.\n\n00:11:12.976 --> 00:11:14.500\nSo, can you visualize that?\n\n00:11:15.047 --> 00:11:16.198\nOw!\n\n00:11:16.222 --> 00:11:17.546\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:23.841\nThat's one five-thousandths\nof the width of one of my hairs,\n\n00:11:23.865 --> 00:11:26.002\nover this entire 27 feet.\n\n00:11:26.026 --> 00:11:27.896\nIt's a spectacular achievement.\n\n00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.235\nIt's what allows us to have\nthe precision that we will have.\n\n00:11:32.834 --> 00:11:35.251\nSo, what does that precision buy us?\n\n00:11:35.801 --> 00:11:38.540\nSo the GMT, if you can imagine --\n\n00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:43.013\nif I were to hold up a coin,\nwhich I just happen to have,\n\n00:11:43.037 --> 00:11:48.028\nand I look at the face of that coin,\nI can see from here\n\n00:11:48.052 --> 00:11:52.037\nthe writing on the coin;\nI can see the face on that coin.\n\n00:11:52.061 --> 00:11:55.175\nMy guess that even in the front row,\nyou can't see that.\n\n00:11:55.603 --> 00:11:58.465\nBut if we were to turn\nthe Giant Magellan Telescope,\n\n00:11:58.489 --> 00:12:01.862\nall 80-feet diameter\nthat we see in this auditorium,\n\n00:12:01.886 --> 00:12:04.955\nand point it 200 miles away,\n\n00:12:04.979 --> 00:12:10.847\nif I were standing in S\u00e3o Paulo,\nwe could resolve the face of this coin.\n\n00:12:10.871 --> 00:12:14.478\nThat's the extraordinary resolution\nand power of this telescope.\n\n00:12:15.719 --> 00:12:18.417\nAnd if we were --\n\n00:12:18.441 --> 00:12:22.311\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:22.335 --> 00:12:26.936\nIf an astronaut went up to the Moon,\na quarter of a million miles away,\n\n00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.876\nand lit a candle -- a single candle --\n\n00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.710\nthen we would be able\nto detect it, using the GMT.\n\n00:12:33.305 --> 00:12:34.587\nQuite extraordinary.\n\n00:12:37.292 --> 00:12:42.973\nThis is a simulated image\nof a cluster in a nearby galaxy.\n\n00:12:42.997 --> 00:12:45.582\n\"Nearby\" is astronomical,\nit's all relative.\n\n00:12:45.606 --> 00:12:48.109\nIt's tens of millions of light-years away.\n\n00:12:48.133 --> 00:12:50.147\nThis is what this cluster would look like.\n\n00:12:50.171 --> 00:12:52.339\nSo look at those four bright objects,\n\n00:12:52.363 --> 00:12:56.370\nand now lets compare it with a camera\non the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\n00:12:56.394 --> 00:12:59.573\nYou can see faint detail\nthat starts to come through.\n\n00:12:59.597 --> 00:13:05.892\nAnd now finally -- and look how dramatic\nthis is -- this is what the GMT will see.\n\n00:13:05.916 --> 00:13:08.286\nSo, keep your eyes on those\nbright images again.\n\n00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:12.728\nThis is what we see on one of the most\npowerful existing telescopes on the Earth,\n\n00:13:12.752 --> 00:13:15.633\nand this, again, what the GMT will see.\n\n00:13:16.512 --> 00:13:18.370\nExtraordinary precision.\n\n00:13:18.933 --> 00:13:20.255\nSo, where are we?\n\n00:13:20.279 --> 00:13:23.461\nWe have now leveled the top\nof the mountaintop in Chile.\n\n00:13:23.485 --> 00:13:25.248\nWe blasted that off.\n\n00:13:25.272 --> 00:13:27.991\nWe've tested and polished\nthe first mirror.\n\n00:13:28.015 --> 00:13:30.604\nWe've cast the second\nand the third mirrors.\n\n00:13:30.628 --> 00:13:32.897\nAnd we're about to cast the fourth mirror.\n\n00:13:32.921 --> 00:13:34.808\nWe had a series of reviews this year,\n\n00:13:34.832 --> 00:13:37.374\ninternational panels\nthat came in and reviewed us,\n\n00:13:37.398 --> 00:13:39.929\nand said, \"You're ready\nto go to construction.\"\n\n00:13:39.953 --> 00:13:43.302\nAnd so we plan on building this telescope\nwith the first four mirrors.\n\n00:13:43.326 --> 00:13:47.455\nWe want to get on the air quickly,\nand be taking science data --\n\n00:13:47.479 --> 00:13:52.058\nwhat we astronomers call\n\"first light,\" in 2021.\n\n00:13:52.989 --> 00:13:56.435\nAnd the full telescope will be finished\nin the middle of the next decade,\n\n00:13:56.459 --> 00:13:57.855\nwith all seven mirrors.\n\n00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:02.058\nSo we're now poised to look back\nat the distant universe,\n\n00:14:02.082 --> 00:14:03.390\nthe cosmic dawn.\n\n00:14:03.762 --> 00:14:07.895\nWe'll be able to study other planets\nin exquisite detail.\n\n00:14:08.382 --> 00:14:12.119\nBut for me, one of the most\nexciting things about building the GMT\n\n00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:14.973\nis the opportunity\nto actually discover something\n\n00:14:14.997 --> 00:14:18.267\nthat we don't know about --\nthat we can't even imagine at this point,\n\n00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:19.933\nsomething completely new.\n\n00:14:20.671 --> 00:14:24.301\nAnd my hope is that with the construction\nof this and other facilities,\n\n00:14:24.325 --> 00:14:29.535\nthat many young women and men\nwill be inspired to reach for the stars.\n\n00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:31.266\nThank you very much.\n\n00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:32.765\nObrigado.\n\n00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:38.682\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:38.706 --> 00:14:40.308\nBruno Giussani: Thank you, Wendy.\n\n00:14:40.332 --> 00:14:42.599\nStay with me, because\nI have a question for you.\n\n00:14:42.623 --> 00:14:45.020\nYou mentioned different facilities.\n\n00:14:45.044 --> 00:14:49.897\nSo the Magellan Telescope is going up,\nbut also ALMA and others in Chile\n\n00:14:49.921 --> 00:14:52.057\nand elsewhere, including in Hawaii.\n\n00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.806\nIs it about cooperation\nand complementarity, or about competition?\n\n00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:00.552\nI know there's competition in terms\nof funding, but what about the science?\n\n00:15:00.576 --> 00:15:03.793\nWendy Freedman: In terms of the science,\nthey're very complementary.\n\n00:15:03.817 --> 00:15:06.844\nThe telescopes that are in space,\nthe telescopes on the ground,\n\n00:15:06.868 --> 00:15:09.298\ntelescopes with different\nwavelength capability,\n\n00:15:09.322 --> 00:15:12.265\ntelescopes even that are similar,\nbut different instruments --\n\n00:15:12.289 --> 00:15:16.035\nthey will all look at different parts\nof the questions that we're asking.\n\n00:15:16.059 --> 00:15:19.686\nSo when we discover other planets,\nwe'll be able to test those observations,\n\n00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.798\nwe'll be able to measure the atmospheres,\n\n00:15:21.822 --> 00:15:24.697\nbe able to look in space\nwith very high resolution.\n\n00:15:24.721 --> 00:15:26.198\nSo, they're very complementary.\n\n00:15:26.222 --> 00:15:28.459\nYou're right about\nthe funding, we compete;\n\n00:15:28.483 --> 00:15:31.148\nbut scientifically,\nit's very complementary.\n\n00:15:31.172 --> 00:15:33.825\nBG: Wendy, thank you very much\nfor coming to TEDGlobal.\n\n00:15:33.849 --> 00:15:35.000\nWF: Thank you.\n\n00:15:35.024

I was eight at the time, living in the village with my grandmother, who was raising me and other children. Famine had hit my country of Zimbabwe, and we just didn't have enough to eat. We were hungry. And that's when the girl in the blue uniform came to my village with the United Nations to feed the children.As she handed me my porridge, I asked her why she was there, and without hesitation, she said, \"As Africans, we must uplift all the people of Africa.\" I had absolutely no idea what she meant.(Laughter)But her words stuck with me.Two years later, famine hit my country for the second time. My grandmother had no choice but to send me to the city to live with an aunt I had never met before. So at the age of 10, I found myself in school for the very first time. And there, at the city school, I would experience what it was to be unequal. You see, in the village, we were all equal. But in the eyes and the minds of the other kids, I was not their equal. I couldn't speak English, and I was way behind in terms of reading and writing. But this feeling of inequality would get even more complex. Every school holiday spent back in the village with my grandmother made me consciously aware of the inequalities this incredible opportunity had created within my own family. Suddenly, I had much more than the rest of my village. And in their eyes, I was no longer their equal.I felt guilty. But I thought about the girl in the blue uniform, and I remember thinking, \"That's who I want to be \u2014 someone like her, someone who uplifts other people.\" This childhood experience led me to the United Nations, and to my current role with UN Women, where we are addressing one of the greatest inequalities that affects more than half of the world's population \u2014 women and girls.Today, I want to share with you a simple idea that seeks to uplift all of us together. Eight months ago, under the visionary leadership of Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, head of UN Women, we launched a groundbreaking initiative called HeForShe, inviting men and boys from around the world to stand in solidarity with each other and with women, to create a shared vision for gender equality. This is an invitation for those who believe in equality for women and men, and those who don't yet know that they believe.The initiative is based on a simple idea: that what we share is much more powerful than what divides us. We all feel the same things. We all want the same things, even when those things sometimes remain unspoken. HeForShe is about uplifting all of us, women and men together. It's moving us towards an inflection point for gender equality.Imagine a blank page with one horizontal line splitting it in half. Now imagine that women are represented here, and men are represented here. In our current population, HeForShe is about moving the 3.2 billion men, one man at a time, across that line, so that ultimately, men can stand alongside women and be on the right side of history, making gender equality a reality in the 21st century.However, engaging men in the movement would prove quite controversial. Why invite men? They are the problem.(Laughter)In fact, men don't care, we were told.But something incredible happened when we launched HeForShe. In just three days, more than 100,000 men had signed up and committed to be agents of change for equality. Within that first week, at least one man in every single country in the world stood up to be counted, and within that same week, HeForShe created more than 1.2 billion conversations on social media. And that's when the emails started pouring in, sometimes as many as a thousand a day. We heard from a man out of Zimbabwe, who, after hearing about HeForShe, created a \"husband school.\"(Laughter)He literally went around his village, hand-picking all of the men that were abusive to their partners, and committed to turn them into better husbands and fathers. In Pune, India, a youth advocate organized an innovative bicycle rally, mobilizing 700 cyclists to share the HeForShe messages within their own community.In another impact story, a man sent a very personal note of something that had happened in his own community. He wrote, \"Dear Madam, I have lived all of my life next door to a man who continuously beats up his wife. Two weeks ago, I was listening to my radio, and your voice came on, and you spoke about something called the HeForShe, and the need for men to play their role. Within a few hours, I heard the woman cry again next door, but for the first time, I didn't just sit there. I felt compelled to do something, so I went over and I confronted the husband. Madam, it has been two weeks, and the woman has not cried since. Thank you for giving me a voice.\"(Applause)Personal impact stories such as these show that we are tapping into something within men, but getting to a world where women and men are equal is not just a matter of bringing men to the cause. We want concrete, systematic, structural change that can equalize the political, economic and social realities for women and men. We are asking men to make concrete actions, calling them to intervene at a personal level, to change their behavior. We are calling upon governments, businesses, universities, to change their policies. We want male leaders to become role models and change agents within their own institutions.Already, a number of prominent men and leaders have stepped up and made some concrete HeForShe commitments. In a few early success stories, a leading French hospitality company, Accor, has committed to eliminate the pay gap for all of its 180,000 employees by 2020.(Applause)The government of Sweden, under its current feminist government, has committed to close both the employment and the pay gap for all of its citizens within the current electoral term. In Japan, the University of Nagoya is building, as part of their HeForShe commitments, what will become one of Japan's leading gender-research centers.Now, eight months later, a movement is building. We are seeing men sign up from every single walk of life, and from every single corner in the world, from the United Nations' own Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to the Secretary-Generals of NATO and the EU Council, from the prime minister of Bhutan to the president of Sierra Leone.In Europe alone, all the male EU Commissioners and the members of Parliament of the Swedish and Iceland governments have signed up to be HeForShe. In fact, one in 20 men in Iceland has joined the movement. The rallying call of our passionate goodwill ambassador, Emma Watson, has garnered more than five billion media impressions, mobilizing hundreds and thousands of students around the world to create more than a hundred HeForShe student associations.Now this is the beginning of the vision that HeForShe has for the world that we want to see. Einstein once said, \"A human being is part of the whole ... but he experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separate from the rest ... This delusion is a kind of prison for us ... Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion.\"If women and men are part of a greater whole, as Einstein suggests, it is my hope that HeForShe can help free us to realize that it is not our gender that defines us, but ultimately, our shared humanity. HeForShe is tapping into women's and men's dreams, the dreams that we have for ourselves, and the dreams that we have for our families, our children, friends, communities.So that's what it is about. HeForShe is about uplifting all of us together.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2311, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:15.710\nI will always

"https://www.ted.com/talks/jamie_bartlett_how_the_mysterious_dark_net_is_going_mainstream", "transcript": "If you want to buy high-quality, low-price cocaine, there really is only one place to go, and that is the dark net anonymous markets.Now, you can't get to these sites with a normal browser \u2014 Chrome or Firefox \u2014 because they're on this hidden part of the Internet, known as Tor hidden services, where URLs are a string of meaningless numbers and letters that end in .onion, and which you access with a special browser called the Tor browser.Now, the Tor browser was originally a U.S. Naval intelligence project. It then became open source, and it allows anybody to browse the net without giving away their location. And it does this by encrypting your IP address and then routing it via several other computers around the world that use the same software. You can use it on the normal Internet, but it's also your key to the dark net. And because of this fiendishly clever encryption system, the 20 or 30 \u2014 we don't know exactly \u2014 thousand sites that operate there are incredibly difficult to shut down. It is a censorship-free world visited by anonymous users.Little wonder, then, that it's a natural place to go for anybody with something to hide, and that something, of course, need not be illegal. On the dark net, you will find whistle-blower sites, The New Yorker. You will find political activism blogs. You will find libraries of pirated books. But you'll also find the drugs markets, illegal pornography, commercial hacking services, and much more besides. Now, the dark net is one of the most interesting, exciting places anywhere on the net. And the reason is, because although innovation, of course, takes place in big businesses, takes place in world-class universities, it also takes place in the fringes, because those on the fringes \u2014 the pariahs, the outcasts \u2014 they're often the most creative, because they have to be. In this part of the Internet, you will not find a single lolcat, a single pop-up advert anywhere. And that's one of the reasons why I think many of you here will be on the dark net fairly soon.(Laughter)Not that I'm suggesting anyone in this audience would use it to go and procure high-quality narcotics. But let's say for a moment that you were.(Laughter)Bear with me. The first thing you will notice on signing up to one of these sites is how familiar it looks. Every single product \u2014 thousands of products \u2014 has a glossy, high-res image, a detailed product description, a price. There's a \"Proceed to checkout\" icon. There is even, most beautifully of all, a \"Report this item\" button.(Laughter)Incredible.You browse through the site, you make your choice, you pay with the crypto-currency bitcoin, you enter an address \u2014  preferably not your home address \u2014 and you wait for your product to arrive in the post, which it nearly always does. And the reason it does is not because of the clever encryption. That's important. Something far simpler than that. It's the user reviews.(Laughter)You see, every single vendor on these sites uses a pseudonym, naturally enough, but they keep the same pseudonym to build up a reputation. And because it's easy for the buyer to change allegiance whenever they want, the only way of trusting a vendor is if they have a good history of positive feedback from other users of the site.And this introduction of competition and choice does exactly what the economists would predict. Prices tend to go down, product quality tends to go up, and the vendors are attentive, they're polite, they're consumer-centric, offering you all manner of special deals, one-offs, buy-one-get-one-frees, free delivery, to keep you happy.I spoke to Drugsheaven. Drugsheaven was offering excellent and consistent marijuana at a reasonable price. He had a very generous refund policy, detailed T's and C's, and good shipping times.\"Dear Drugsheaven,\" I wrote, via the internal emailing system that's also encrypted, of course. \"I'm new here. Do you mind if I buy just one gram of marijuana?\"A couple of hours later, I get a reply. They always reply.\"Hi there, thanks for your email. Starting small is a wise thing to do. I would, too, if I were you.\"(Laughter)\"So no problem if you'd like to start with just one gram. I do hope we can do business together. Best wishes, Drugsheaven.\"(Laughter)I don't know why he had a posh English accent, but I assume he did.Now, this kind of consumer-centric attitude is the reason why, when I reviewed 120,000 pieces of feedback that had been left on one of these sites over a three-month period, 95 percent of them were five out of five. The customer, you see, is king. But what does that mean? Well, on the one hand, that means there are more drugs, more available, more easily, to more people. And by my reckoning, that is not a good thing. But, on the other hand, if you are going to take drugs, you have a reasonably good way of guaranteeing a certain level of purity and quality, which is incredibly important if you're taking drugs. And you can do so from the comfort of your own home, without the risks associated with buying on the streets.Now, as I said, you've got to be creative and innovative to survive in this marketplace. And the 20 or so sites that are currently in operation \u2014 by the way, they don't always work, they're not always perfect; the site that I showed you was shut down 18 months ago, but not before it had turned over a billion dollars' worth of trade. But these markets, because of the difficult conditions in which they are operating, the inhospitable conditions, are always innovating, always thinking of ways of getting smarter, more decentralized, harder to censor, and more customer-friendly.Let's take the payment system. You don't pay with your credit card, of course \u2014 that would lead directly back to you. So you use the crypto-currency bitcoin, which is easily exchanged for real-world currencies and gives quite a high degree of anonymity to its users.But at the beginning of these sites, people noticed a flaw. Some of the unscrupulous dealers were running away with peoples' bitcoin before they'd mailed the drugs out. The community came up with a solution, called multi-signature escrow payments. So on purchasing my item, I would send my bitcoin to a neutral, secure third digital wallet. The vendor, who would see that I'd sent it, would be confident that they could then send the product to me, and then when I received it, at least two of the three people engaged in the transaction \u2014 vendor, buyer, site administrator \u2014 would have to sign the transaction off with a unique digital signature, and then the money would be transferred.Brilliant! Elegant. It works.But then they realized there was a problem with bitcoin, because every bitcoin transaction is actually recorded publicly in a public ledger. So if you're clever, you can try and work out who's behind them. So they came up with a tumbling service. Hundreds of people send their bitcoin into one address, they're tumbled and jumbled up, and then the right amount is sent on to the right recipients, but they're different bitcoins: micro-laundering systems.(Laughter)It's incredible.Interested in what drugs are trending right now on the dark net markets? Check Grams, the search engine. You can even buy some advertising space.(Laughter)Are you an ethical consumer worried about what the drugs industry is doing? Yeah. One vendor will offer you fair trade organic cocaine.(Laughter)That's not being sourced from Colombian druglords, but Guatemalan farmers. They even promised to reinvest 20 percent of any profits into local education programs.(Laughter)There's even a mystery shopper.Now, whatever you think about the morality of these sites \u2014 and I submit that it's not actually an easy question \u2014 the creation of functioning, competitive, anonymous markets, where nobody knows who anybody else is, constantly at risk of being shut down by the authorities, is a staggering achievement, a phenomenal achievement. And it's that kind of innovation that's why those on the fringes are often the harbingers of what is to come.It's easy to forget that because of its short life, the Internet has actually changed many times over the last 30 years or so. It started in the '70s as a military project, morphed in the 1980s to an academic network, co-opted by commercial companies in the '90s, and then invaded by all of us via social media in the noughties, but I think it's going to change again. And I think things like the dark net markets \u2014 creative, secure, difficult to censor \u2014 I think that's the future.And the reason it's the future is because we're all worried about our privacy. Surveys consistently show concerns about privacy. The more time we spend online, the more we worry about them, and those surveys show our worries are growing. We're worried about what happens to our data. We're worried about who might be watching us.Since the revelations from Edward Snowden, there's been a huge increase in the number of people using various privacy-enhancing tools. There are now between two and three million daily users of the Tor browser, the majority of which use is perfectly legitimate, sometimes even mundane. And there are hundreds of activists around the world working on techniques and tools to keep you private online \u2014 default encrypted messaging services. Ethereum, which is a project which tries to link up the connected but unused hard drives of millions of computers around the world, to create a sort of distributed Internet that no one really controls. Now, we've had distributed computing before, of course. We use it for everything from Skype to the search for extraterrestrial life. But you add distributed computing and powerful encryption \u2014 that's very, very hard to censor and control. Another called MaidSafe works on similar principles. Another called Twister, and so on and so on.And here's the thing \u2014 the more of us join, the more interesting those sites become, and then the more of us join, and so on. And I think that's what's going to happen.In fact, it's already happening. The dark net is no longer a den for dealers and a hideout for whistle-blowers. It's already going mainstream. Just recently, the musician Aphex Twin released his album as a dark net site. Facebook has started a dark net site. A group of London architects have opened a dark net site for people worried about regeneration projects. Yes, the dark net is going mainstream, and I predict that fairly soon, every social media company, every major news outlet, and therefore most of you in this audience, will be using the dark net, too.So the Internet is about to get more interesting, more exciting, more innovative, more terrible, more destructive. That's good news if you care about liberty. It's good news if you care about freedom. It's good news if you care about democracy. It's also good news if you want to browse for illegal pornography and if you want to buy and sell drugs with impunity. Neither entirely dark, nor entirely light. It's not one side or the other that's going to win out, but both.Thank you very much, indeed.(Applause)", "id": 2322, "subtitle":

predict.\n\n00:04:37.304 --> 00:04:41.990\nPrices tend to go down,\nproduct quality tends to go up,\n\n00:04:42.014 --> 00:04:44.387\nand the vendors are attentive,\n\n00:04:44.411 --> 00:04:46.842\nthey're polite, they're consumer-centric,\n\n00:04:46.866 --> 00:04:51.178\noffering you all manner\nof special deals, one-offs,\n\n00:04:51.202 --> 00:04:54.373\nbuy-one-get-one-frees, free delivery,\n\n00:04:54.397 --> 00:04:55.581\nto keep you happy.\n\n00:04:56.911 --> 00:04:59.829\nI spoke to Drugsheaven.\n\n00:04:59.853 --> 00:05:05.743\nDrugsheaven was offering\nexcellent and consistent marijuana\n\n00:05:05.767 --> 00:05:07.309\nat a reasonable price.\n\n00:05:08.112 --> 00:05:11.921\nHe had a very generous refund policy,\n\n00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:13.733\ndetailed T's and C's,\n\n00:05:13.757 --> 00:05:15.169\nand good shipping times.\n\n00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:17.827\n\"Dear Drugsheaven,\" I wrote,\n\n00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:21.665\nvia the internal emailing system\nthat's also encrypted, of course.\n\n00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:26.496\n\"I'm new here. Do you mind\nif I buy just one gram of marijuana?\"\n\n00:05:27.408 --> 00:05:29.532\nA couple of hours later, I get a reply.\n\n00:05:29.556 --> 00:05:30.742\nThey always reply.\n\n00:05:31.188 --> 00:05:32.984\n\"Hi there, thanks for your email.\n\n00:05:34.112 --> 00:05:39.380\nStarting small is a wise thing to do.\nI would, too, if I were you.\"\n\n00:05:39.404 --> 00:05:41.166\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.311\n\"So no problem if you'd like to start\nwith just one gram.\n\n00:05:44.335 --> 00:05:46.846\nI do hope we can do business together.\n\n00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.733\nBest wishes, Drugsheaven.\"\n\n00:05:48.757 --> 00:05:50.733\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:50.757 --> 00:05:54.021\nI don't know why he had a posh\nEnglish accent, but I assume he did.\n\n00:05:56.237 --> 00:06:00.733\nNow, this kind\nof consumer-centric attitude\n\n00:06:00.757 --> 00:06:06.193\nis the reason why, when I reviewed\n120,000 pieces of feedback\n\n00:06:06.217 --> 00:06:10.197\nthat had been left on one of these sites\nover a three-month period,\n\n00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:13.350\n95 percent of them were five out of five.\n\n00:06:14.521 --> 00:06:17.062\nThe customer, you see, is king.\n\n00:06:17.757 --> 00:06:18.967\nBut what does that mean?\n\n00:06:18.991 --> 00:06:20.932\nWell, on the one hand,\n\n00:06:20.956 --> 00:06:24.990\nthat means there are more drugs,\nmore available, more easily,\n\n00:06:25.014 --> 00:06:26.165\nto more people.\n\n00:06:26.757 --> 00:06:29.687\nAnd by my reckoning,\nthat is not a good thing.\n\n00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:34.470\nBut, on the other hand,\nif you are going to take drugs,\n\n00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:37.555\nyou have a reasonably good way\n\n00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:41.993\nof guaranteeing a certain level\nof purity and quality,\n\n00:06:42.017 --> 00:06:45.733\nwhich is incredibly important\nif you're taking drugs.\n\n00:06:45.757 --> 00:06:48.875\nAnd you can do so\nfrom the comfort of your own home,\n\n00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:53.086\nwithout the risks associated\nwith buying on the streets.\n\n00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:55.395\nNow, as I said,\n\n00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:59.521\nyou've got to be creative and innovative\nto survive in this marketplace.\n\n00:07:00.235 --> 00:07:03.329\nAnd the 20 or so sites\nthat are currently in operation --\n\n00:07:03.353 --> 00:07:07.058\nby the way, they don't always work,\nthey're not always perfect;\n\n00:07:07.082 --> 00:07:09.684\nthe site that I showed you\nwas shut down 18 months ago,\n\n00:07:09.708 --> 00:07:14.859\nbut not before it had turned\nover a billion dollars' worth of trade.\n\n00:07:17.428 --> 00:07:18.581\nBut these markets,\n\n00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:21.667\nbecause of the difficult conditions\nin which they are operating,\n\n00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:23.179\nthe inhospitable conditions,\n\n00:07:23.203 --> 00:07:26.551\nare always innovating, always\nthinking of ways of getting smarter,\n\n00:07:26.575 --> 00:07:28.813\nmore decentralized, harder to censor,\n\n00:07:28.837 --> 00:07:31.193\nand more customer-friendly.\n\n00:07:32.304 --> 00:07:33.733\nLet's take the payment system.\n\n00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:36.139\nYou don't pay with your credit card,\n\n00:07:36.163 --> 00:07:38.508\nof course -- that would lead\ndirectly back to you.\n\n00:07:38.532 --> 00:07:40.509\nSo you use the crypto-currency bitcoin,\n\n00:07:40.533 --> 00:07:44.988\nwhich is easily exchanged\nfor real-world currencies\n\n00:07:45.012 --> 00:07:48.757\nand gives quite a high degree\nof anonymity to its users.\n\n00:07:49.325 --> 00:07:52.252\nBut at the beginning of these sites,\npeople noticed a flaw.\n\n00:07:52.276 --> 00:07:56.341\nSome of the unscrupulous dealers\nwere running away with peoples' bitcoin\n\n00:07:56.365 --> 00:07:58.170\nbefore they'd mailed the drugs out.\n\n00:07:59.113 --> 00:08:05.008\nThe community came up with a solution,\ncalled multi-signature escrow payments.\n\n00:08:07.093 --> 00:08:10.586\nSo on purchasing my item,\n\n00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.636\nI would send my bitcoin\n\n00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.952\nto a neutral, secure third digital wallet.\n\n00:08:18.757 --> 00:08:21.346\nThe vendor, who would see\nthat I'd sent it,\n\n00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.326\nwould be confident that they\ncould then send the product to me,\n\n00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.733\nand then when I received it,\n\n00:08:25.757 --> 00:08:28.733\nat least two of the three people\nengaged in the transaction --\n\n00:08:28.757 --> 00:08:31.297\nvendor, buyer, site administrator --\n\n00:08:31.321 --> 00:08:33.733\nwould have to sign the transaction off\n\n00:08:33.757 --> 00:08:35.835\nwith a unique digital signature,\n\n00:08:35.859 --> 00:08:37.834\nand then the money would be transferred.\n\n00:08:38.221 --> 00:08:39.521\nBrilliant!\n\n00:08:39.545 --> 00:08:40.696\nElegant.\n\n00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.871\nIt works.\n\n00:08:42.835 --> 00:08:45.486\nBut then they realized there was\na problem with bitcoin,\n\n00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.211\nbecause every bitcoin transaction\n\n00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:49.733\nis actually recorded publicly\nin a public ledger.\n\n00:08:49.757 --> 00:08:53.034\nSo if you're clever, you can try\nand work out who's behind them.\n\n00:08:53.058 --> 00:08:56.343\nSo they came up with a tumbling service.\n\n00:08:56.367 --> 00:08:59.758\nHundreds of people send\ntheir bitcoin into one address,\n\n00:08:59.782 --> 00:09:01.757\nthey're tumbled and jumbled up,\n\n00:09:01.781 --> 00:09:05.571\nand then the right amount\nis sent on to the right recipients,\n\n00:09:05.595 --> 00:09:07.417\nbut they're different bitcoins:\n\n00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:09.131\nmicro-laundering systems.\n\n00:09:09.155 --> 00:09:10.689\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:10.713 --> 00:09:11.869\nIt's incredible.\n\n00:09:11.893 --> 00:09:17.086\nInterested in what drugs are trending\nright now on the dark net markets?\n\n00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.187\nCheck Grams, the search engine.\n\n00:09:19.211 --> 00:09:21.376\nYou can even buy some advertising space.\n\n00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.465\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:23.489 --> 00:09:28.427\nAre you an ethical consumer worried\nabout what the drugs industry is doing?\n\n00:09:29.022 --> 00:09:30.173\nYeah.\n\n00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.944\nOne vendor will offer you\nfair trade organic cocaine.\n\n00:09:33.968 --> 00:09:35.110\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:35.134 --> 00:09:38.429\nThat's not being sourced\nfrom Colombian druglords,\n\n00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:39.882\nbut Guatemalan farmers.\n\n00:09:39.906 --> 00:09:43.218\nThey even promised to reinvest\n20 percent of any profits\n\n00:09:43.242 --> 00:09:45.032\ninto local education programs.\n\n00:09:45.056 --> 00:09:46.078\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:46.102 --> 00:09:48.081\nThere's even a mystery shopper.\n\n00:09:48.894 --> 00:09:52.278\nNow, whatever you think\nabout the morality of these sites --\n\n00:09:52.302 --> 00:09:55.617\nand I submit that it's not\nactually an easy question --\n\n00:09:55.641 --> 00:10:01.143\nthe creation of functioning,\ncompetitive, anonymous markets,\n\n00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:03.733\nwhere nobody knows who anybody else is,\n\n00:10:03.757 --> 00:10:06.856\nconstantly at risk of being shut down\nby the authorities,\n\n00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.414\nis a staggering achievement,\n\n00:10:09.438 --> 00:10:11.476\na phenomenal achievement.\n\n00:10:12.537 --> 00:10:15.951\nAnd it's that kind of innovation\n\n00:10:15.975 --> 00:10:18.733\nthat's why those on the fringes\n\n00:10:18.757 --> 00:10:21.604\nare often the harbingers\nof what is to come.\n\n00:10:22.318 --> 00:10:24.422\nIt's easy to forget\n\n00:10:24.446 --> 00:10:26.508\nthat because of its short life,\n\n00:10:26.532 --> 00:10:30.179\nthe Internet has actually\nchanged many times\n\n00:10:30.203 --> 00:10:31.733\nover the last 30 years or so.\n\n00:10:31.757 --> 00:10:34.733\nIt started in the '70s\nas a military project,\n\n00:10:34.757 --> 00:10:38.733\nmorphed in the 1980s\nto an academic network,\n\n00:10:38.757 --> 00:10:41.219\nco-opted by commercial\ncompanies in the '90s,\n\n00:10:41.243 --> 00:10:44.698\nand then invaded by all of us\nvia social media in the noughties,\n\n00:10:44.722 --> 00:10:46.651\nbut I think it's going to change again.\n\n00:10:47.137 --> 00:10:49.733\nAnd I think things\nlike the dark net markets --\n\n00:10:49.757 --> 00:10:53.733\ncreative, secure, difficult to censor --\n\n00:10:53.757 --> 00:10:55.359\nI think that's the future.\n\n00:10:56.887 --> 00:10:58.515\nAnd the reason it's the future\n\n00:10:58.539 --> 00:11:01.207\nis because we're all worried\nabout our privacy.\n\n00:11:01.231 --> 00:11:04.456\nSurveys consistently show\nconcerns about privacy.\n\n00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.439\nThe more time we spend online,\nthe more we worry about them,\n\n00:11:08.463 --> 00:11:10.733\nand those surveys show\nour worries are growing.\n\n00:11:10.757 --> 00:11:12.873\nWe're worried about\nwhat happens to our data.\n\n00:11:12.897 --> 00:11:15.006\nWe're worried about\nwho might be watching us.\n\n00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.598\nSince the revelations from Edward Snowden,\n\n00:11:17.622 --> 00:11:20.068\nthere's been a huge increase\nin the number of people\n\n00:11:20.092 --> 00:11:23.184\nusing various privacy-enhancing tools.\n\n00:11:23.208 --> 00:11:26.445\nThere are now between two\nand three million daily users\n\n00:11:26.469 --> 00:11:27.744\nof the Tor browser,\n\n00:11:27.768 --> 00:11:32.935\nthe majority of which use\nis perfectly legitimate,\n\n00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:34.718\nsometimes even mundane.\n\n00:11:35.616 --> 00:11:38.767\nAnd there are hundreds of activists\naround the world\n\n00:11:38.791 --> 00:11:44.057\nworking on techniques and tools\nto keep you private online --\n\n00:11:45.069 --> 00:11:47.550\ndefault encrypted messaging services.\n\n00:11:47.574 --> 00:11:51.597\nEthereum, which is a project\nwhich tries to link up\n\n00:11:51.621 --> 00:11:56.699\nthe connected but unused hard drives\nof millions of computers around the world,\n\n00:11:56.723 --> 00:12:00.594\nto create a sort of distributed Internet\nthat no one really controls.\n\n00:12:00.618 --> 00:12:03.511\nNow, we've had distributed\ncomputing before, of course.\n\n00:12:03.535 --> 00:12:07.733\nWe use it for everything from Skype\nto the search for extraterrestrial life.\n\n00:12:07.757 --> 00:12:12.246\nBut you add distributed computing\nand powerful encryption --\n\n00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:16.157\nthat's very, very hard\nto censor and control.\n\n00:12:16.583 --> 00:12:19.396\nAnother called MaidSafe\nworks on similar principles.\n\n00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.868\nAnother called Twister,\nand so on and so on.\n\n00:12:23.354 --> 00:12:25.344\nAnd here's the thing --\n\n00:12:25.368 --> 00:12:26.832\nthe more of us join,\n\n00:12:26.856 --> 00:12:29.307\nthe more interesting those sites become,\n\n00:12:29.331 --> 00:12:31.819\nand then the more of us join, and so on.\n\n00:12:32.226 --> 00:12:34.251\nAnd I think that's what's going to happen.\n\n00:12:34.275 --> 00:12:36.423\nIn fact, it's already happening.\n\n00:12:36.447 --> 00:12:40.323\nThe dark net is no longer\na den for dealers\n\n00:12:40.347 --> 00:12:42.914\nand a hideout for whistle-blowers.\n\n00:12:42.938 --> 00:12:44.625\nIt's already going mainstream.\n\n00:12:45.656 --> 00:12:52.230\nJust recently, the musician Aphex Twin\nreleased his album as a dark net site.\n\n00:12:52.254 --> 00:12:56.207\nFacebook has started a dark net site.\n\n00:12:56.231 --> 00:12:59.864\nA group of London architects\nhave opened a dark net site\n\n00:12:59.888 --> 00:13:02.733\nfor people worried\nabout regeneration projects.\n\n00:13:02.757 --> 00:13:05.330\nYes, the dark net is going mainstream,\n\n00:13:05.354 --> 00:13:08.971\nand I predict that fairly soon,\nevery social media company,\n\n00:13:08.995 --> 00:13:10.430\nevery major news outlet,\n\n00:13:10.454 --> 00:13:13.538\nand therefore most of you\nin this audience,\n\n00:13:13.562 --> 00:13:15.918\nwill be using the dark net, too.\n\n00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.929\nSo the Internet is about to get\nmore interesting,\n\n00:13:19.953 --> 00:13:22.733\nmore exciting, more innovative,\n\n00:13:22.757 --> 00:13:24.482\nmore terrible,\n\n00:13:24.506 --> 00:13:25.860\nmore destructive.\n\n00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:29.371\nThat's good news\nif you care about liberty.\n\n00:13:29.395 --> 00:13:31.365\nIt's good news if you care about freedom.\n\n00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:33.508\nIt's good news if you care\nabout democracy.\n\n00:13:33.532 --> 00:13:34.910\nIt's also good news\n\n00:13:34.934 --> 00:13:37.380\nif you want to browse\nfor illegal pornography\n\n00:13:37.404 --> 00:13:39.733\nand if you want to buy and sell drugs\n\n00:13:39.757 --> 00:13:41.050\nwith impunity.\n\n00:13:41.834 --> 00:13:45.733\nNeither entirely dark, nor entirely light.\n\n00:13:45.757 --> 00:13:49.434\nIt's not one side or the other\nthat's going to win out, but both.\n\n00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.198\nThank you very much, indeed.\n\n00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:55.908\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The mathematician who cracked Wall

mathematical phenom. You had already taught at Harvard and MIT at a young age. And then the NSA came calling. What was that about?Jim Simons: Well the NSA \u2014 that's the National Security Agency \u2014 they didn't exactly come calling. They had an operation at Princeton, where they hired mathematicians to attack secret codes and stuff like that. And I knew that existed. And they had a very good policy, because you could do half your time at your own mathematics, and at least half your time working on their stuff. And they paid a lot. So that was an irresistible pull. So, I went there.CA: You were a code-cracker.JS: I was.CA: Until you got fired.JS: Well, I did get fired. Yes.CA: How come?JS: Well, how come? I got fired because, well, the Vietnam War was on, and the boss of bosses in my organization was a big fan of the war and wrote a New York Times article, a magazine section cover story, about how we would win in Vietnam. And I didn't like that war, I thought it was stupid. And I wrote a letter to the Times, which they published, saying not everyone who works for Maxwell Taylor, if anyone remembers that name, agrees with his views. And I gave my own views ...CA: Oh, OK. I can see that would \u2014JS: ... which were different from General Taylor's. But in the end, nobody said anything. But then, I was 29 years old at this time, and some kid came around and said he was a stringer from Newsweek magazine and he wanted to interview me and ask what I was doing about my views. And I told him, \"I'm doing mostly mathematics now, and when the war is over, then I'll do mostly their stuff.\" Then I did the only intelligent thing I'd done that day \u2014 I told my local boss that I gave that interview. And he said, \"What'd you say?\" And I told him what I said. And then he said, \"I've got to call Taylor.\" He called Taylor; that took 10 minutes. I was fired five minutes after that.CA: OK.JS: But it wasn't bad.CA: It wasn't bad, because you went on to Stony Brook and stepped up your mathematical career. You started working with this man here. Who is this?JS: Oh, [Shiing-Shen] Chern. Chern was one of the great mathematicians of the century. I had known him when I was a graduate student at Berkeley. And I had some ideas, and I brought them to him and he liked them. Together, we did this work which you can easily see up there. There it is.CA: It led to you publishing a famous paper together. Can you explain at all what that work was?JS: No.(Laughter)JS: I mean, I could explain it to somebody.(Laughter)CA: How about explaining this?JS: But not many. Not many people.CA: I think you told me it had something to do with spheres, so let's start here.JS: Well, it did, but I'll say about that work \u2014 it did have something to do with that, but before we get to that \u2014 that work was good mathematics. I was very happy with it; so was Chern. It even started a little sub-field that's now flourishing. But, more interestingly, it happened to apply to physics, something we knew nothing about \u2014 at least I knew nothing about physics, and I don't think Chern knew a heck of a lot. And about 10 years after the paper came out, a guy named Ed Witten in Princeton started applying it to string theory and people in Russia started applying it to what's called \"condensed matter.\" Today, those things in there called Chern-Simons invariants have spread through a lot of physics. And it was amazing. We didn't know any physics. It never occurred to me that it would be applied to physics. But that's the thing about mathematics \u2014 you never know where it's going to go.CA: This is so incredible. So, we've been talking about how evolution shapes human minds that may or may not perceive the truth. Somehow, you come up with a mathematical theory, not knowing any physics, discover two decades later that it's being applied to profoundly describe the actual physical world. How can that happen?JS: God knows.(Laughter)But there's a famous physicist named [Eugene] Wigner, and he wrote an essay on the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics. Somehow, this mathematics, which is rooted in the real world in some sense \u2014 we learn to count, measure, everyone would do that \u2014 and then it flourishes on its own. But so often it comes back to save the day. General relativity is an example. [Hermann] Minkowski had this geometry, and Einstein realized, \"Hey! It's the very thing in which I can cast general relativity.\" So, you never know. It is a mystery. It is a mystery.CA: So, here's a mathematical piece of ingenuity. Tell us about this.JS: Well, that's a ball \u2014 it's a sphere, and it has a lattice around it \u2014 you know, those squares. What I'm going to show here was originally observed by [Leonhard] Euler, the great mathematician, in the 1700s. And it gradually grew to be a very important field in mathematics: algebraic topology, geometry. That paper up there had its roots in this. So, here's this thing: it has eight vertices, 12 edges, six faces. And if you look at the difference \u2014 vertices minus edges plus faces \u2014 you get two. OK, well, two. That's a good number. Here's a different way of doing it \u2014 these are triangles covering \u2014 this has 12 vertices and 30 edges and 20 faces, 20 tiles. And vertices minus edges plus faces still equals two. And in fact, you could do this any which way \u2014 cover this thing with all kinds of polygons and triangles and mix them up. And you take vertices minus edges plus faces \u2014 you'll get two. Here's a different shape. This is a torus, or the surface of a doughnut: 16 vertices covered by these rectangles, 32 edges, 16 faces. Vertices minus edges comes out to be zero. It'll always come out to zero. Every time you cover a torus with squares or triangles or anything like that, you're going to get zero. So, this is called the Euler characteristic. And it's what's called a topological invariant. It's pretty amazing. No matter how you do it, you're always get the same answer. So that was the first sort of thrust, from the mid-1700s, into a subject which is now called algebraic topology.CA: And your own work took an idea like this and moved it into higher-dimensional theory, higher-dimensional objects, and found new invariances?JS: Yes. Well, there were already higher-dimensional invariants: Pontryagin classes \u2014 actually, there were Chern classes. There were a bunch of these types of invariants. I was struggling to work on one of them and model it sort of combinatorially, instead of the way it was typically done, and that led to this work and we uncovered some new things. But if it wasn't for Mr. Euler \u2014 who wrote almost 70 volumes of mathematics and had 13 children, who he apparently would dandle on his knee while he was writing \u2014 if it wasn't for Mr. Euler, there wouldn't perhaps be these invariants.CA: OK, so that's at least given us a flavor of that amazing mind in there. Let's talk about Renaissance. Because you took that amazing mind and having been a code-cracker at the NSA, you started to become a code-cracker in the financial industry. I think you probably didn't buy efficient market theory. Somehow you found a way of creating astonishing returns over two decades. The way it's been explained to me, what's remarkable about what you did wasn't just the size of the returns, it's that you took them with surprisingly low volatility and risk, compared with other hedge funds. So how on earth did you do this, Jim?JS: I did it by assembling a wonderful group of people. When I started doing trading, I had gotten a little tired of mathematics. I was in my late 30s, I had a little money. I started trading and it went very well. I made quite a lot of money with pure luck. I mean, I think it was pure luck. It certainly wasn't mathematical modeling. But in looking at the data, after a while I realized: it looks like there's some structure here. And I hired a few mathematicians, and we started making some models \u2014 just the kind of thing we did back at IDA [Institute for Defense Analyses]. You design an algorithm, you test it out on a computer. Does it work? Doesn't it work? And so on.CA: Can we take a look at this? Because here's a typical graph of some commodity. I look at that, and I say, \"That's just a random, up-and-down walk \u2014 maybe a slight upward trend over that whole period of time.\" How on earth could you trade looking at that, and see something that wasn't just random?JS: In the old days \u2014 this is kind of a graph from the old days, commodities or currencies had a tendency to trend. Not necessarily the very light trend you see here, but trending in periods. And if you decided, OK, I'm going to predict today, by the average move in the past 20 days \u2014 maybe that would be a good prediction, and I'd make some money. And in fact, years ago, such a system would work \u2014 not beautifully, but it would work. You'd make money, you'd lose money, you'd make money. But this is a year's worth of days, and you'd make a little money during that period. It's a very vestigial system.CA: So you would test a bunch of lengths of trends in time and see whether, for example, a 10-day trend or a 15-day trend was predictive of what happened next.JS: Sure, you would try all those things and see what worked best. Trend-following would have been great in the '60s, and it was sort of OK in the '70s. By the '80s, it wasn't.CA: Because everyone could see that. So, how did you stay ahead of the pack?JS: We stayed ahead of the pack by finding other approaches \u2014 shorter-term approaches to some extent. The real thing was to gather a tremendous amount of data \u2014 and we had to get it by hand in the early days. We went down to the Federal Reserve and copied interest rate histories and stuff like that, because it didn't exist on computers. We got a lot of data. And very smart people \u2014 that was the key. I didn't really know how to hire people to do fundamental trading. I had hired a few \u2014 some made money, some didn't make money. I couldn't make a business out of that. But I did know how to hire scientists, because I have some taste in that department. So, that's what we did. And gradually these models got better and better, and better and better.CA: You're credited with doing something remarkable at Renaissance, which is building this culture, this group of people, who weren't just hired guns who could be lured away by money. Their motivation was doing exciting mathematics and science.JS: Well, I'd hoped that might be true. But some of it was money.CA: They made a lot of money.JS: I can't say that no one came because of the money. I think a lot of them came because of the money. But they also came because it would be fun.CA: What role did machine learning play in all this?JS: In a certain sense, what we did was machine learning. You look at a lot of data, and you try to simulate different predictive schemes, until you get better and better at it. It doesn't necessarily feed back on itself the way we did things. But it worked.CA: So these different predictive schemes can be really quite wild and unexpected. I mean, you looked at everything, right? You looked at the weather, length of dresses, political opinion.JS: Yes, length of dresses we didn't try.CA: What sort of things?JS: Well, everything. Everything is grist for the mill \u2014 except hem lengths. Weather, annual reports, quarterly reports, historic data itself, volumes, you name it. Whatever there is. We take in terabytes of data a day. And store it away and massage it and get it ready for analysis. You're looking for anomalies. You're looking for \u2014 like you said, the efficient market hypothesis is not correct.CA: But any one anomaly might be just a random thing. So, is the secret here to just look at multiple strange anomalies, and see when they align?JS: Any one anomaly might be a random thing; however, if you have enough data you can tell that it's not. You can see an anomaly that's persistent for a sufficiently long time \u2014 the probability of it being random is not high. But these things fade after a while; anomalies can get washed out. So you have to keep on top of the business.CA: A lot of people look at the hedge fund industry now and are sort of ... shocked by it, by how much wealth is created there, and how much talent is going into it. Do you have any worries about that industry, and perhaps the financial industry in general? Kind of being on a runaway train that's \u2014 I don't know \u2014 helping increase inequality? How would you champion what's happening in the hedge fund industry?JS: I think in the last three or four years, hedge funds have not done especially well. We've done dandy, but the hedge fund industry as a whole has not done so wonderfully. The stock market has been on a roll, going up as everybody knows, and price-earnings ratios have grown. So an awful lot of the wealth that's been created in the last \u2014 let's say, five or six years \u2014 has not been created by hedge funds. People would ask me, \"What's a hedge fund?\" And I'd say, \"One and 20.\" Which means \u2014 now it's two and 20 \u2014 it's two percent fixed fee and 20 percent of profits. Hedge funds are all different kinds of creatures.CA: Rumor has it you charge slightly higher fees than that.JS: We charged the highest fees in the world at one time. Five and 44, that's what we charge.CA: Five and 44. So five percent flat, 44 percent of upside. You still made your investors spectacular amounts of money.JS: We made good returns, yes. People got very mad: \"How can you charge such high fees?\" I said, \"OK, you can withdraw.\" But \"How can I get more?\" was what people were \u2014(Laughter)But at a certain point, as I think I told you, we bought out all the investors because there's a capacity to the fund.CA: But should we worry about the hedge fund industry attracting too much of the world's great mathematical and other talent to work on that, as opposed to the many other problems in the world?JS: Well, it's not just mathematical. We hire astronomers and physicists and things like that. I don't think we should worry about it too much. It's still a pretty small industry. And in fact, bringing science into the investing world has improved that world. It's reduced volatility. It's increased liquidity. Spreads are narrower because people are trading that kind of stuff. So I'm not too worried about Einstein going off and starting a hedge fund.CA: You're at a phase in your life now where you're actually investing, though, at the other end of the supply chain \u2014 you're actually boosting mathematics across America. This is your wife, Marilyn. You're working on philanthropic issues together. Tell me about that.JS: Well, Marilyn started \u2014 there she is up there, my beautiful wife \u2014 she started the foundation about 20 years ago. I think '94. I claim it was '93, she says it was '94, but it was one of those two years.(Laughter)We started the foundation, just as a convenient way to give charity. She kept the books, and so on. We did not have a vision at that time, but gradually a vision emerged \u2014 which was to focus on math and science, to focus on basic research. And that's what we've done. Six years ago or so, I left Renaissance and went to work at the foundation. So that's what we do.CA: And so Math for America is basically investing in math teachers around the country, giving them some extra income, giving them support and coaching. And really trying to make that more effective and make that a calling to which teachers can aspire.JS: Yeah \u2014 instead of beating up the bad teachers, which has created morale problems all through the educational community, in particular in math and science, we focus on celebrating the good ones and giving them status. Yeah, we give them extra money, 15,000 dollars a year. We have 800 math and science teachers in New York City in public schools today, as part of a core. There's a great morale among them. They're staying in the field. Next year, it'll be 1,000 and that'll be 10 percent of the math and science teachers in New York [City] public schools.(Applause)CA: Jim, here's another project that you've supported philanthropically: Research into origins of life, I guess. What are we looking at here? JS: Well, I'll save that for a second. And then I'll tell you what you're looking at. Origins of life is a fascinating question. How did we get here? Well, there are two questions: One is, what is the route from geology to biology \u2014 how did we get here? And the other question is, what did we start with? What material, if any, did we have to work with on this route? Those are two very, very interesting questions. The first question is a tortuous path from geology up to RNA or something like that \u2014 how did that all work? And the other, what do we have to work with? Well, more than we think. So what's pictured there is a star in formation. Now, every year in our Milky Way, which has 100 billion stars, about two new stars are created. Don't ask me how, but they're created. And it takes them about a million years to settle out. So, in steady state, there are about two million stars in formation at any time. That one is somewhere along this settling-down period. And there's all this crap sort of circling around it, dust and stuff. And it'll form probably a solar system, or whatever it forms. But here's the thing \u2014 in this dust that surrounds a forming star have been found, now, significant organic molecules. Molecules not just like methane, but formaldehyde and cyanide \u2014 things that are the building blocks \u2014 the seeds, if you will \u2014 of life. So, that may be typical. And it may be typical that planets around the universe start off with some of these basic building blocks. Now does that mean there's going to be life all around? Maybe. But it's a question of how tortuous this path is from those frail beginnings, those seeds, all the way to life. And most of those seeds will fall on fallow planets.CA: So for you, personally, finding an answer to this question of where we came from, of how did this thing happen, that is something you would love to see.JS: Would love to see. And like to know \u2014 if that path is tortuous enough, and so improbable, that no matter what you start with, we could be a singularity. But on the other hand, given all this organic dust that's floating around, we could have lots of friends out there. It'd be great to know.CA: Jim, a couple of years ago, I got the chance to speak with Elon Musk, and I asked him the secret of his success, and he said taking physics seriously was it. Listening to you, what I hear you saying is taking math seriously, that has infused your whole life. It's made you an absolute fortune, and now it's allowing you to invest in the futures of thousands and thousands of kids across America and elsewhere. Could it be that science actually works? That math actually works?JS: Well, math certainly works. Math certainly works. But this has been fun. Working with Marilyn and giving it away has been very enjoyable.CA: I just find it \u2014 it's an inspirational thought to me, that by taking knowledge seriously, so much more can come from it.

Because everyone could see that.\n\n00:11:23.741 --> 00:11:26.523\nSo, how did you stay ahead of the pack?\n\n00:11:27.004 --> 00:11:33.136\nJS: We stayed ahead of the pack\nby finding other approaches --\n\n00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.901\nshorter-term approaches to some extent.\n\n00:11:37.065 --> 00:11:40.412\nThe real thing was to gather\na tremendous amount of data --\n\n00:11:40.436 --> 00:11:44.014\nand we had to get it by hand\nin the early days.\n\n00:11:44.038 --> 00:11:47.504\nWe went down to the Federal Reserve\nand copied interest rate histories\n\n00:11:47.528 --> 00:11:50.793\nand stuff like that,\nbecause it didn't exist on computers.\n\n00:11:50.817 --> 00:11:52.460\nWe got a lot of data.\n\n00:11:52.484 --> 00:11:56.644\nAnd very smart people -- that was the key.\n\n00:11:57.421 --> 00:12:01.197\nI didn't really know how to hire\npeople to do fundamental trading.\n\n00:12:01.707 --> 00:12:04.656\nI had hired a few -- some made money,\nsome didn't make money.\n\n00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.560\nI couldn't make a business out of that.\n\n00:12:06.584 --> 00:12:08.626\nBut I did know how to hire scientists,\n\n00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:12.039\nbecause I have some taste\nin that department.\n\n00:12:12.063 --> 00:12:13.901\nSo, that's what we did.\n\n00:12:13.925 --> 00:12:17.156\nAnd gradually these models\ngot better and better,\n\n00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.515\nand better and better.\n\n00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:21.753\nCA: You're credited with doing\nsomething remarkable at Renaissance,\n\n00:12:21.777 --> 00:12:24.378\nwhich is building this culture,\nthis group of people,\n\n00:12:24.402 --> 00:12:27.544\nwho weren't just hired guns\nwho could be lured away by money.\n\n00:12:27.568 --> 00:12:31.480\nTheir motivation was doing\nexciting mathematics and science.\n\n00:12:31.818 --> 00:12:34.217\nJS: Well, I'd hoped that might be true.\n\n00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:37.821\nBut some of it was money.\n\n00:12:37.845 --> 00:12:39.238\nCA: They made a lot of money.\n\n00:12:39.262 --> 00:12:41.799\nJS: I can't say that no one came\nbecause of the money.\n\n00:12:41.823 --> 00:12:44.076\nI think a lot of them\ncame because of the money.\n\n00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.121\nBut they also came\nbecause it would be fun.\n\n00:12:46.145 --> 00:12:48.633\nCA: What role did machine learning\nplay in all this?\n\n00:12:48.657 --> 00:12:51.721\nJS: In a certain sense,\nwhat we did was machine learning.\n\n00:12:52.837 --> 00:12:59.128\nYou look at a lot of data, and you try\nto simulate different predictive schemes,\n\n00:12:59.152 --> 00:13:01.334\nuntil you get better and better at it.\n\n00:13:01.358 --> 00:13:05.125\nIt doesn't necessarily feed back on itself\nthe way we did things.\n\n00:13:05.149 --> 00:13:07.458\nBut it worked.\n\n00:13:08.108 --> 00:13:12.167\nCA: So these different predictive schemes\ncan be really quite wild and unexpected.\n\n00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:14.105\nI mean, you looked at everything, right?\n\n00:13:14.129 --> 00:13:17.446\nYou looked at the weather,\nlength of dresses, political opinion.\n\n00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:20.307\nJS: Yes, length of dresses we didn't try.\n\n00:13:20.331 --> 00:13:22.388\nCA: What sort of things?\n\n00:13:22.412 --> 00:13:23.570\nJS: Well, everything.\n\n00:13:23.594 --> 00:13:26.858\nEverything is grist for the mill --\nexcept hem lengths.\n\n00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.110\nWeather, annual reports,\n\n00:13:31.134 --> 00:13:35.866\nquarterly reports, historic data itself,\nvolumes, you name it.\n\n00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.041\nWhatever there is.\n\n00:13:37.065 --> 00:13:39.686\nWe take in terabytes of data a day.\n\n00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:43.834\nAnd store it away and massage it\nand get it ready for analysis.\n\n00:13:45.404 --> 00:13:46.786\nYou're looking for anomalies.\n\n00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.763\nYou're looking for -- like you said,\n\n00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:52.239\nthe efficient market\nhypothesis is not correct.\n\n00:13:52.263 --> 00:13:55.730\nCA: But any one anomaly\nmight be just a random thing.\n\n00:13:55.754 --> 00:13:59.412\nSo, is the secret here to just look\nat multiple strange anomalies,\n\n00:13:59.436 --> 00:14:00.764\nand see when they align?\n\n00:14:01.196 --> 00:14:04.409\nJS: Any one anomaly\nmight be a random thing;\n\n00:14:04.433 --> 00:14:07.472\nhowever, if you have enough data\nyou can tell that it's not.\n\n00:14:07.496 --> 00:14:12.446\nYou can see an anomaly that's persistent\nfor a sufficiently long time --\n\n00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:17.445\nthe probability of it being\nrandom is not high.\n\n00:14:17.469 --> 00:14:22.327\nBut these things fade after a while;\nanomalies can get washed out.\n\n00:14:22.351 --> 00:14:24.771\nSo you have to keep on top\nof the business.\n\n00:14:24.795 --> 00:14:27.467\nCA: A lot of people look\nat the hedge fund industry now\n\n00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:31.889\nand are sort of

you have any worries\nabout that industry,\n\n00:14:41.511 --> 00:14:43.925\nand perhaps the financial\nindustry in general?\n\n00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:46.653\nKind of being on a runaway train that's --\n\n00:14:46.677 --> 00:14:50.707\nI don't know --\nhelping increase inequality?\n\n00:14:50.731 --> 00:14:54.562\nHow would you champion what's happening\nin the hedge fund industry?\n\n00:14:54.586 --> 00:14:57.194\nJS: I think in the last\nthree or four years,\n\n00:14:57.218 --> 00:14:59.321\nhedge funds have not done especially well.\n\n00:14:59.345 --> 00:15:00.745\nWe've done dandy,\n\n00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:04.770\nbut the hedge fund industry as a whole\nhas not done so wonderfully.\n\n00:15:04.794 --> 00:15:09.696\nThe stock market has been on a roll,\ngoing up as everybody knows,\n\n00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.165\nand price-earnings ratios have grown.\n\n00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:16.252\nSo an awful lot of the wealth\nthat's been created in the last --\n\n00:15:16.276 --> 00:15:19.626\nlet's say, five or six years --\nhas not been created by hedge funds.\n\n00:15:20.416 --> 00:15:23.637\nPeople would ask me,\n\"What's a hedge fund?\"\n\n00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:25.921\nAnd I'd say, \"One and 20.\"\n\n00:15:25.945 --> 00:15:29.511\nWhich means -- now it's two and 20 --\n\n00:15:29.535 --> 00:15:32.888\nit's two percent fixed fee\nand 20 percent of profits.\n\n00:15:32.912 --> 00:15:35.264\nHedge funds are all\ndifferent kinds of creatures.\n\n00:15:35.288 --> 00:15:38.527\nCA: Rumor has it you charge\nslightly higher fees than that.\n\n00:15:39.297 --> 00:15:42.378\nJS: We charged the highest fees\nin the world at one time.\n\n00:15:42.402 --> 00:15:45.628\nFive and 44, that's what we charge.\n\n00:15:45.652 --> 00:15:47.050\nCA: Five and 44.\n\n00:15:47.074 --> 00:15:50.308\nSo five percent flat,\n44 percent of upside.\n\n00:15:50.332 --> 00:15:53.115\nYou still made your investors\nspectacular amounts of money.\n\n00:15:53.139 --> 00:15:54.591\nJS: We made good returns, yes.\n\n00:15:54.615 --> 00:15:57.615\nPeople got very mad:\n\"How can you charge such high fees?\"\n\n00:15:57.639 --> 00:15:59.266\nI said, \"OK, you can withdraw.\"\n\n00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:02.108\nBut \"How can I get more?\"\nwas what people were --\n\n00:16:02.132 --> 00:16:03.636\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.100\nBut at a certain point,\nas I think I told you,\n\n00:16:06.124 --> 00:16:11.299\nwe bought out all the investors\nbecause there's a capacity to the fund.\n\n00:16:11.323 -->

astronomers and physicists\nand things like that.\n\n00:16:27.791 --> 00:16:30.222\nI don't think we should worry\nabout it too much.\n\n00:16:30.246 --> 00:16:33.388\nIt's still a pretty small industry.\n\n00:16:33.412 --> 00:16:39.409\nAnd in fact, bringing science\ninto the investing world\n\n00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:41.592\nhas improved that world.\n\n00:16:41.616 --> 00:16:45.686\nIt's reduced volatility.\nIt's increased liquidity.\n\n00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:48.899\nSpreads are narrower because\npeople are trading that kind of stuff.\n\n00:16:48.923 --> 00:16:53.999\nSo I'm not too

00:19:22.642\nOrigins of life is a fascinating question.\n\n00:19:22.666 --> 00:19:24.199\nHow did we get here?\n\n00:19:25.128 --> 00:19:26.899\nWell, there are two questions:\n\n00:19:26.923 --> 00:19:32.791\nOne is, what is the route\nfrom geology to biology --\n\n00:19:32.815 --> 00:19:34.196\nhow did we get here?\n\n00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.584\nAnd the other question is,\nwhat did we start with?\n\n00:19:36.608 --> 00:19:39.710\nWhat material, if any,\ndid we have to work with on this route?\n\n00:19:39.734 --> 00:19:42.795\nThose are two very,\nvery interesting questions.\n\n00:19:43.731 --> 00:19:49.565\nThe first question is a tortuous path\nfrom geology up to RNA\n\n00:19:49.589 --> 00:19:51.847\nor something like that --\nhow did that all work?\n\n00:19:51.871 --> 00:19:54.259\nAnd the other,\nwhat do we have to work with?\n\n00:19:54.283 --> 00:19:56.054\nWell, more than we think.\n\n00:19:56.078 --> 00:20:00.921\nSo what's pictured there\nis a star in formation.\n\n00:20:01.794 --> 00:20:05.219\nNow, every year in our Milky Way,\nwhich has 100 billion stars,\n\n00:20:05.243 --> 00:20:07.738\nabout two new stars are created.\n\n00:20:07.762 --> 00:20:10.232\nDon't ask me how, but they're created.\n\n00:20:10.256 --> 00:20:13.336\nAnd it takes them about a million\nyears to settle out.\n\n00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.266\nSo, in steady state,\n\n00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:20.138\nthere are about two million stars\nin formation at any time.\n\n00:20:20.162 --> 00:20:23.620\nThat one is somewhere\nalong this settling-down period.\n\n00:20:24.025 --> 00:20:26.961\nAnd there's all this crap\nsort of circling around it,\n\n00:20:26.985 --> 00:20:28.483\ndust and stuff.\n\n00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:32.460\nAnd it'll form probably a solar system,\nor whatever it forms.\n\n00:20:32.484 --> 00:20:34.660\nBut here's the thing --\n\n00:20:34.684 --> 00:20:41.032\nin this dust that surrounds a forming star\n\n00:20:41.056 --> 00:20:47.091\nhave been found, now,\nsignificant organic molecules.\n\n00:20:47.916 --> 00:20:54.055\nMolecules not just like methane,\nbut formaldehyde and cyanide --\n\n00:20:54.079 --> 00:21:00.596\nthings that are the building blocks --\nthe seeds, if you will -- of life.\n\n00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:03.786\nSo, that may be typical.\n\n00:21:04.353 --> 00:21:11.287\nAnd it may be typical\nthat planets around the universe\n\n00:21:11.311 --> 00:21:14.923\nstart off with some of these\nbasic building blocks.\n\n00:21:15.788 --> 00:21:18.503\nNow does that mean\nthere's going to be life all around?\n\n00:21:18.527 --> 00:21:19.891\nMaybe.\n\n00:21:19.915 --> 00:21:24.042\nBut it's a question\nof how tortuous this path is\n\n00:21:24.066 --> 00:21:28.460\nfrom those frail beginnings,\nthose seeds, all the way to life.\n\n00:21:28.484 --> 00:21:33.676\nAnd most of those seeds\nwill fall on fallow planets.\n\n00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.109\nCA: So for you, personally,\n\n00:21:35.133 --> 00:21:37.855\nfinding an answer to this question\nof where we came from,\n\n00:21:37.879 --> 00:21:41.537\nof how did this thing happen,\nthat is something you would love to see.\n\n00:21:41.561 --> 00:21:43.347\nJS: Would love to see.\n\n00:21:43.371 --> 00:21:44.861\nAnd like to know --\n\n00:21:44.885 --> 00:21:50.055\nif that path is tortuous enough,\nand so improbable,\n\n00:21:50.079 --> 00:21:54.833\nthat no matter what you start with,\nwe could be a singularity.\n\n00:21:55.294 --> 00:21:56.446\nBut on the other hand,\n\n00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:59.948\ngiven all this organic dust\nthat's floating around,\n\n00:21:59.972 --> 00:22:03.763\nwe could have lots of friends out there.\n\n00:22:04.905 --> 00:22:06.066\nIt'd be great to know.\n\n00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:09.570\nCA: Jim, a couple of years ago,\nI got the chance to speak with Elon Musk,\n\n00:22:09.594 --> 00:22:12.431\nand I asked him the secret of his success,\n\n00:22:12.455 --> 00:22:16.146\nand he said taking\nphysics seriously was it.\n\n00:22:16.654 --> 00:22:20.657\nListening to you, what I hear you saying\nis taking math seriously,\n\n00:22:20.681 --> 00:22:23.684\nthat has infused your whole life.\n\n00:22:24.081 --> 00:22:28.644\nIt's made you an absolute fortune,\nand now it's allowing you to invest\n\n00:22:28.668 --> 00:22:33.164\nin the futures of thousands and thousands\nof kids across America and elsewhere.\n\n00:22:33.525 --> 00:22:36.383\nCould it be that science actually works?\n\n00:22:36.407 --> 00:22:39.179\nThat math actually works?\n\n00:22:39.203 --> 00:22:43.575\nJS: Well, math certainly works.\nMath certainly works.\n\n00:22:43.599 --> 00:22:44.797\nBut this has been fun.\n\n00:22:44.821 --> 00:22:49.767\nWorking with Marilyn and giving it away\nhas been very enjoyable.\n\n00:22:49.791 --> 00:22:52.727\nCA: I just find it --\nit's an inspirational thought to me,\n\n00:22:52.751 --> 00:22:56.758\nthat by taking knowledge seriously,\nso much more can come from it.\n\n00:22:56.782 --> 00:22:59.800\nSo thank you for your amazing life,\nand for coming here to TED.\n\n00:22:59.824 --> 00:23:00.575\nThank you.\n\n00:23:00.609 --> 00:23:01.710\nJim Simons!\n\n00:23:01.764 --> 00:23:06.144\n(Applause)"}]

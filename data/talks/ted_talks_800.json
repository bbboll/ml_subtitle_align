When I bachelored, majoring in zoology at Tel Aviv University, I kind of fell in love with bugs. And then, within zoology, I took the course or the discipline of entomology, the science of insects. And then I thought to myself, how can I be practical or help in the science of entomology? And then I moved to the world of plant protection \u2014 plant protection from insects, from bad bugs. And then within plant protection, I came into the discipline of biological pest control, which we actually define as the use of living organisms to reduce populations of noxious plant pests. So it's a whole discipline in plant protection aimed at the reduction of chemicals.And biological pest control, by the way, or these \"good bugs\" that we are talking about, they've existed in the world for thousands and thousands of years, for a long, long time. But only in the last 120 years, people started, or people knew more and more how to exploit, or how to use, this biological control phenomenon, or in fact, natural control phenomenon, for their own needs. Because biological control phenomenon \u2014 you can see it in your backyard. Just take a magnifying glass. You see what I have here? That's a magnifier, times 10. You just open it, twist leaves, and you see a whole new world of minute insects, or little spiders of one millimeter, one-and-a-half, two millimeters long, and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones. So this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere. Here, in front of this building, I'm sure. Just have a look at the plants. So it's everywhere, and we need to know how to exploit it.Well, let's go hand by hand and browse through just a few examples. What is a pest? What damage does it actually inflict on the plant? And what is the natural enemy, the biological control agent, or the \"good bug\" that we're talking about? In general, I'm going to talk about insects and spiders, or mites, let us call them. Insects, those six-legged organisms and spiders or mites, the eight-legged organisms. Let's have a look at that. Here is a devastating pest, a spider mite, because it does a lot of webbing, like a spider. You see the mother in between, and two daughters, probably, on the left and right, and a single egg on the right-hand side. And then you see what kind of damage it can inflict.On your right-hand side, you can see a cucumber leaf, in the middle, a cotton leaf, and on the left, a tomato leaf with these little stipplings. They can literally turn from green to white, because of the sucking, piercing mouth parts of those spiders.But here comes nature, that provides us with a good spider. This is a predatory mite \u2014 just as small as a spider mite; one, two millimeters long, not more than that \u2014 running quickly, hunting, chasing the spider mites. And here, you can see this lady in action on your left-hand side \u2014 just pierces, sucks the body fluids on the left-hand side of the pest mite. And after five minutes, this is what you see: just a typical dead corpse \u2014 the shriveled, sucked-out, dead corpse of the spider mite, and next to it, two satiated individuals, predatory mites, a mother on the left-hand side, a young nymph on the right-hand side. By the way, a meal for them for 24 hours, is about five of the spider mites, of the bad mites, and-or 15 to 20 eggs of the pest mites. By the way, they are always hungry.(Laughter)And here is another example: aphids. It's springtime now in Israel. When temperatures rise sharply, you can see those bad ones, those aphids, all over the plants \u2014 in your hibiscus, in your lantana, in the young, fresh foliage of the so-called spring flush. By the way, with aphids you have only females, like Amazons. Females giving rise to females, giving rise to other females. No males at all. Parthenogenesis, as it's so called. And they're very happy with that, apparently.(Laughter)Here we can see the damage. Those aphids secrete a sticky, sugary liquid called honeydew, and this just clogs the upper parts of the plant. Here you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned from green to black because of a black fungus, sooty mold, which is covering it.And here comes the salvation, through this parasitic wasp. Here we are not talking about a predator. Here we are talking a parasite \u2014 not a two-legged parasite, but an eight-legged parasite, of course. This is a parasitic wasp, again, two millimeters long, slender, a very quick and sharp flier. And here you can see this parasite in action, like in an acrobatic maneuver. She stands vis-\u00e0-vis in front of the victim at the right-hand side, bending its abdomen and inserting a single egg into the body fluids of the aphid. By the way, the aphid tries to escape. She kicks and bites and secretes different liquids, but nothing will happen, in fact \u2014 only the egg of the parasitoid will be inserted into the body fluids of the aphid. And after a few days, depending upon temperature, the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside.(Laughter)This is all natural. This is all natural. This is not fiction, nothing at all. Again \u2014 in your backyard. In your backyard.(Laughter)(Applause)But this is the end result: mummies. This is the visual result of a dead aphid encompassing inside, a developing parasitoid that, after a few minutes, you see halfway out. The birth is almost complete. You can see, by the way, in different movies, etc., it takes just a few minutes. And if this is a female, she'll immediately mate with a male and off she goes, because time is very short. This female can live only three to four days, and she needs to give rise to around 400 eggs. That means she has 400 bad aphids to put her eggs into their body fluids. This is, of course, not the end of it.There is a whole wealth of other natural enemies and this is just the last example. Again, we'll start first with the pest: the thrips. By the way, all these weird names \u2014 I didn't bother you with the Latin names of these creatures, just the popular names. But this is a nice, slender, very bad pest. If you can see this: sweet peppers. This is not just an exotic, ornamental sweet pepper. This is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those thrip adults. And here comes the natural enemy, minute pirate bug \u2014 \"minute,\" because it is rather small. Here you can see the adult, black, and two young ones. And again, in action. This adult pierces the thrips, sucking it within just several minutes, going to the other prey, continuing all over the place. And if we spread those minute pirate bugs, the good ones, for example, in a sweet pepper plot, they go to the flowers. And look \u2014 this flower is flooded with predatory bugs, with the good ones, after wiping out the bad ones, the thrips. So this is a very positive situation. No harm to the developing fruit. No harm to the fruit set. Everything is just fine under these circumstances. But again, the question is, here you saw them on a one-to-one basis \u2014 the pest, the natural enemy.What we do is actually this. In Northeast Israel, in Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu, there is a facility that mass-produces those natural enemies. In other words, what we do there is amplify the natural control, or the biological control phenomenon. And in 30,000 square meters of state-of-the-art greenhouses, there, we are mass-producing those predatory mites, those minute pirate bugs, those parasitic wasps, etc. Many different parts. By the way, they have a very nice landscape \u2014 you see the Jordanian Mountains on the one hand, and the Jordan Valley on the other hand, and a good, mild winter and a nice, hot summer, which is an excellent condition to mass-produce those creatures. And by the way, mass-production \u2014 it is not genetic manipulation. There are no GMOs \u2014 genetically modified organisms \u2014 whatsoever. We take them from nature, and the only thing that we do is give them the optimal conditions, under the greenhouses or in the climate rooms, in order to proliferate, multiply and reproduce. And that's what we get.You see under a microscope. You see in the upper left corner? You see a single predatory mite. And this is the whole bunch of predatory mites. You see this ampul. You see this one. I have one gram of those predatory mites. One gram is 80,000 individuals. 80,000 individuals are good enough to control one acre, 4,000 square meters, of a strawberry plot against spider mites for the whole season of almost one year. And we can produce from this, believe you me, several dozens of kilograms on an annual basis. So this is what I call amplification of the phenomenon. And no, we do not disrupt the balance. On the contrary, because we bring it to every cultural plot where the balance was already disrupted by the chemicals. Here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit of the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals. That's the whole idea.And what is the impact? In this table, you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs. For example, in Israel, where we employ more than 1,000 hectares \u2014 10,000 dunams in Israeli terms \u2014 of biological pests controlling sweet pepper under protection, 75 percent of the pesticides were actually reduced. And Israeli strawberries, even more \u2014 80 percent of the pesticides, especially those aimed against pest mites in strawberries. So the impact is very strong. And there goes the question, especially if you ask growers, agriculturists: Why biological control? Why good bugs? By the way, the number of answers you get equals the number of people you ask. But if we go, for example, to this place, Southeast Israel, the Arava area above the Great Rift Valley, where the pearl of Israeli agriculture is located, especially under greenhouse conditions, or under screenhouse conditions \u2014 if you drive all the way to Eilat, you see this just in the middle of the desert. And if you zoom in, you can definitely watch this: grandparents with their grandchildren, distributing the natural enemies, the good bugs, instead of wearing special clothes and gas masks and applying chemicals. So safety, with respect to the application, is the number one answer that we get from growers, for \"Why biological control?\"Number two, many growers are, in fact, petrified by the idea of resistance, that the pests will become resistant to the chemicals, just like in our case, that bacteria becomes resistant to antibiotics. It's the same, and it can happen very quickly. Fortunately, in either biological control or even natural control, resistance is extremely rare. It hardly happens. Because this is evolution, this is the natural ratio, unlike resistance, which happens in the case of chemicals.And thirdly, public demand. The more the public demands the reduction of chemicals, the more growers become aware of the fact that they should, wherever they can and wherever possible, replace the chemical control with biological control. Even here, there is another grower, you see, very interested in the bugs, the bad ones and the good ones, wearing this magnifier already on her head, just walking safely in her crop.Finally, I want to get to my vision, or, in fact, to my dream. Because, you see, this is the reality. Have a look at the gap. If we take the overall turnover of the biocontrol industry worldwide, it's 250 million dollars. And look at the overall pesticide industry in all the crops throughout the world. I think it's times 100 or something like that. Twenty-five billion. So there is a huge gap to bridge. So actually, how can we do it? How can we bridge, or let's say, narrow, this gap over the years? First of all, we need to find more robust, good and reliable biological solutions, more good bugs that we can either mass-produce or actually conserve in the field. Secondly, to create even more intensive and strict public demand for the reduction of chemicals in agricultural fresh produce. And thirdly, also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry. And this gap really narrows. Step by step, it does narrow.So I think my last slide is: All we are saying \u2014 we can actually sing it \u2014 Give nature a chance. I'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol practitioners and implementers, in Israel and abroad, really give nature a chance.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 994, "subtitle":

00:01:12.200\nAnd biological pest control, by the way,\n\n00:01:12.224 --> 00:01:14.992\nor these \"good bugs\"\nthat we are talking about,\n\n00:01:15.016 --> 00:01:18.848\nthey've existed in the

00:02:21.234\nand browse through just a few examples.\n\n00:02:21.258 --> 00:02:22.773\nWhat is a pest?\n\n00:02:22.797 --> 00:02:26.107\nWhat damage does it actually\ninflict on the plant?\n\n00:02:26.131 --> 00:02:28.392\nAnd what is the natural enemy,\n\n00:02:28.416 --> 00:02:31.399\nthe biological control agent,\nor the \"good bug\"\n\n00:02:31.423 --> 00:02:32.624\nthat we're talking about?\n\n00:02:32.648 --> 00:02:37.661\nIn general, I'm going to talk\nabout insects and spiders,\n\n00:02:37.685 --> 00:02:39.908\nor mites, let us call them.\n\n00:02:39.932 --> 00:02:42.701\nInsects, those six-legged organisms\n\n00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:46.803\nand spiders or mites,\nthe eight-legged organisms.\n\n00:02:46.827 --> 00:02:48.234\nLet's have a look at that.\n\n00:02:48.258 --> 00:02:51.486\nHere is a devastating pest, a spider mite,\n\n00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.382\nbecause it does a lot\nof webbing, like a spider.\n\n00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:56.280\nYou see the mother in between,\n\n00:02:56.304 --> 00:02:58.714\nand two daughters, probably,\non the left and right,\n\n00:02:58.738 --> 00:03:00.806\nand a single egg on the right-hand side.\n\n00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.318\nAnd then you see\nwhat kind of damage it can inflict.\n\n00:03:03.342 --> 00:03:05.884\nOn your right-hand side,\nyou can see a cucumber leaf,\n\n00:03:05.908 --> 00:03:07.349\nin the middle, a cotton leaf,\n\n00:03:07.373 --> 00:03:10.571\nand on the left, a tomato leaf\nwith these little stipplings.\n\n00:03:10.595 --> 00:03:13.648\nThey can literally turn\nfrom green to white,\n\n00:03:13.672 --> 00:03:19.234\nbecause of the sucking, piercing\nmouth parts of those spiders.\n\n00:03:19.716 --> 00:03:23.386\nBut here comes nature,\nthat provides us with a good spider.\n\n00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.792\nThis is a predatory mite --\njust as small as a spider mite;\n\n00:03:26.816 --> 00:03:29.620\none, two millimeters long,\nnot more than that --\n\n00:03:29.644 --> 00:03:34.058\nrunning quickly, hunting,\nchasing the spider mites.\n\n00:03:34.082 --> 00:03:37.950\nAnd here, you can see this lady\nin action on your left-hand side --\n\n00:03:37.974 --> 00:03:43.600\njust pierces, sucks the body fluids\non the left-hand side of the pest mite.\n\n00:03:43.624 --> 00:03:46.234\nAnd after five minutes,\nthis is what you see:\n\n00:03:46.258 --> 00:03:48.577\njust a typical dead corpse --\n\n00:03:48.601 --> 00:03:52.234\nthe shriveled, sucked-out,\ndead corpse of the spider mite,\n\n00:03:52.258 --> 00:03:57.122\nand next to it, two satiated\nindividuals, predatory mites,\n\n00:03:57.146 --> 00:04:00.643\na mother on the left-hand side,\na young nymph on the right-hand side.\n\n00:04:00.667 --> 00:04:03.589\nBy the way, a meal for them for 24 hours,\n\n00:04:03.613 --> 00:04:07.863\nis about five of the spider mites,\nof the bad mites,\n\n00:04:07.887 --> 00:04:12.772\nand-or 15 to 20 eggs of the pest mites.\n\n00:04:12.796 --> 00:04:15.234\nBy the way, they are always hungry.\n\n00:04:15.258 --> 00:04:17.497\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:17.521 --> 00:04:19.828\nAnd here is another example: aphids.\n\n00:04:19.852 --> 00:04:21.706\nIt's springtime now in Israel.\n\n00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.235\nWhen temperatures rise sharply,\n\n00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:27.532\nyou can see those bad ones,\nthose aphids, all over the plants --\n\n00:04:27.556 --> 00:04:30.234\nin your hibiscus, in your lantana,\n\n00:04:30.258 --> 00:04:34.234\nin the young, fresh foliage\nof the so-called spring flush.\n\n00:04:34.258 --> 00:04:38.234\nBy the way, with aphids you have\nonly females, like Amazons.\n\n00:04:38.258 --> 00:04:41.683\nFemales giving rise to females,\ngiving rise to other females.\n\n00:04:41.707 --> 00:04:42.936\nNo males at all.\n\n00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.396\nParthenogenesis, as it's so called.\n\n00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.535\nAnd they're very happy\nwith that, apparently.\n\n00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:48.584\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:48.608 --> 00:04:50.234\nHere we can see the damage.\n\n00:04:50.258 --> 00:04:57.018\nThose aphids secrete a sticky,\nsugary liquid called honeydew,\n\n00:04:57.042 --> 00:05:01.061\nand this just clogs\nthe upper parts of the plant.\n\n00:05:01.085 --> 00:05:04.798\nHere you see a typical cucumber leaf\nthat turned from green to black\n\n00:05:04.822 --> 00:05:09.541\nbecause of a black fungus, sooty mold,\nwhich is covering it.\n\n00:05:09.565 --> 00:05:14.893\nAnd here comes the salvation,\nthrough this parasitic wasp.\n\n00:05:14.917 --> 00:05:17.019\nHere we are not talking about a predator.\n\n00:05:17.043 --> 00:05:19.507\nHere we are talking a parasite --\n\n00:05:19.531 --> 00:05:21.404\nnot a two-legged parasite,\n\n00:05:21.428 --> 00:05:24.437\nbut an eight-legged parasite, of course.\n\n00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:26.235\nThis is a parasitic wasp,\n\n00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:32.014\nagain, two millimeters long, slender,\na very quick and sharp flier.\n\n00:05:32.038 --> 00:05:34.822\nAnd here you can see\nthis parasite in action,\n\n00:05:34.846 --> 00:05:37.513\nlike in an acrobatic maneuver.\n\n00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:39.234\nShe stands vis-\u00e0-vis\n\n00:05:39.258 --> 00:05:41.585\nin front of the victim\nat the right-hand side,\n\n00:05:41.609 --> 00:05:46.783\nbending its abdomen\nand inserting a single egg\n\n00:05:46.807 --> 00:05:48.914\ninto the body fluids of the aphid.\n\n00:05:49.596 --> 00:05:51.753\nBy the way, the aphid tries to escape.\n\n00:05:51.777 --> 00:05:56.036\nShe kicks and bites\nand secretes different liquids,\n\n00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.110\nbut nothing will happen, in fact --\n\n00:05:58.134 --> 00:06:01.544\nonly the egg of the parasitoid\nwill be inserted\n\n00:06:01.568 --> 00:06:03.706\ninto the body fluids of the aphid.\n\n00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.666\nAnd after a few days,\ndepending upon temperature,\n\n00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.107\nthe egg will hatch\n\n00:06:08.131 --> 00:06:13.102\nand the larva of this parasite\nwill eat the aphid from the inside.\n\n00:06:13.126 --> 00:06:14.177\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:14.201 --> 00:06:16.445\nThis is all natural. This is all natural.\n\n00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:18.468\nThis is not fiction, nothing at all.\n\n00:06:18.492 --> 00:06:21.443\nAgain -- in your backyard.\nIn your backyard.\n\n00:06:21.467 --> 00:06:22.972\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:22.996 --> 00:06:24.461\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:24.485 --> 00:06:30.942\nBut this is the end result: mummies.\n\n00:06:31.052 --> 00:06:36.234\nThis is the visual result\nof a dead aphid encompassing inside,\n\n00:06:36.258 --> 00:06:42.153\na developing parasitoid that,\nafter a few minutes, you see halfway out.\n\n00:06:42.177 --> 00:06:44.383\nThe birth is almost complete.\n\n00:06:44.407 --> 00:06:47.581\nYou can see, by the way,\nin different movies, etc.,\n\n00:06:47.605 --> 00:06:49.234\nit takes just a few minutes.\n\n00:06:49.258 --> 00:06:52.760\nAnd if this is a female,\nshe'll immediately mate with a male\n\n00:06:52.784 --> 00:06:55.620\nand off she goes,\nbecause time is very short.\n\n00:06:55.644 --> 00:06:58.234\nThis female can live\nonly three to four days,\n\n00:06:58.258 --> 00:07:02.120\nand she needs to give rise\nto around 400 eggs.\n\n00:07:02.144 --> 00:07:05.546\nThat means she has 400 bad aphids\n\n00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.551\nto put her eggs into their body fluids.\n\n00:07:09.162 --> 00:07:11.138\nThis is, of course, not the end of it.\n\n00:07:11.162 --> 00:07:13.544\nThere is a whole wealth\nof other natural enemies\n\n00:07:13.568 --> 00:07:15.234\nand this is just the last example.\n\n00:07:15.258 --> 00:07:17.751\nAgain, we'll start first with the pest:\n\n00:07:17.775 --> 00:07:19.234\nthe thrips.\n\n00:07:19.258 --> 00:07:21.561\nBy the way, all these weird names --\n\n00:07:21.585 --> 00:07:25.084\nI didn't bother you with the Latin\nnames of these creatures,\n\n00:07:25.108 --> 00:07:26.348\njust the popular names.\n\n00:07:26.372 --> 00:07:30.484\nBut this is a nice,\nslender, very bad pest.\n\n00:07:30.508 --> 00:07:32.856\nIf you can see this: sweet peppers.\n\n00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.879\nThis is not just an exotic,\nornamental sweet pepper.\n\n00:07:35.903 --> 00:07:38.450\nThis is a sweet pepper\nwhich is not consumable\n\n00:07:38.474 --> 00:07:41.234\nbecause it is suffering\nfrom a viral disease\n\n00:07:41.258 --> 00:07:44.423\ntransmitted by those thrip adults.\n\n00:07:44.868 --> 00:07:48.385\nAnd here comes the natural enemy,\nminute pirate bug --\n\n00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:50.988\n\"minute,\" because it is rather small.\n\n00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:54.431\nHere you can see the adult,\nblack, and two young ones.\n\n00:07:54.455 --> 00:07:56.000\nAnd again, in action.\n\n00:07:56.024 --> 00:07:58.835\nThis adult pierces the thrips,\n\n00:07:59.572 --> 00:08:01.818\nsucking it within just several minutes,\n\n00:08:01.842 --> 00:08:05.072\ngoing to the other prey,\ncontinuing all over the place.\n\n00:08:05.096 --> 00:08:09.391\nAnd if we spread those minute\npirate bugs, the good ones,\n\n00:08:09.415 --> 00:08:12.311\nfor example, in a sweet pepper plot,\n\n00:08:12.335 --> 00:08:13.904\nthey go to the flowers.\n\n00:08:13.928 --> 00:08:19.012\nAnd look -- this flower is flooded\nwith predatory bugs, with the good ones,\n\n00:08:19.036 --> 00:08:22.234\nafter wiping out the bad ones, the thrips.\n\n00:08:22.258 --> 00:08:24.842\nSo this is a very positive situation.\n\n00:08:24.866 --> 00:08:28.166\nNo harm to the developing fruit.\nNo harm to the fruit set.\n\n00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.254\nEverything is just fine\nunder these circumstances.\n\n00:08:32.003 --> 00:08:33.464\nBut again, the question is,\n\n00:08:33.488 --> 00:08:37.689\nhere you saw them on a one-to-one basis --\nthe pest, the natural enemy.\n\n00:08:38.055 --> 00:08:41.026\nWhat we do is actually this.\n\n00:08:41.502 --> 00:08:44.931\nIn Northeast Israel,\nin Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu,\n\n00:08:44.955 --> 00:08:49.324\nthere is a facility that mass-produces\nthose natural enemies.\n\n00:08:49.669 --> 00:08:56.147\nIn other words, what we do there\nis amplify the natural control,\n\n00:08:56.171 --> 00:08:58.148\nor the biological control phenomenon.\n\n00:08:58.172 --> 00:09:03.049\nAnd in 30,000 square meters\nof state-of-the-art greenhouses,\n\n00:09:03.073 --> 00:09:06.377\nthere, we are mass-producing\nthose predatory mites,\n\n00:09:06.401 --> 00:09:08.096\nthose minute pirate bugs,\n\n00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.016\nthose parasitic wasps, etc.\n\n00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.367\nMany different parts.\n\n00:09:12.391 --> 00:09:14.647\nBy the way, they have\na very nice landscape --\n\n00:09:14.671 --> 00:09:17.047\nyou see the Jordanian Mountains\non the one hand,\n\n00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:19.048\nand the Jordan Valley on the other hand,\n\n00:09:19.072 --> 00:09:23.125\nand a good, mild winter\nand a nice, hot summer,\n\n00:09:23.149 --> 00:09:27.144\nwhich is an excellent condition\nto mass-produce those creatures.\n\n00:09:27.168 --> 00:09:31.408\nAnd by the way, mass-production --\nit is not genetic manipulation.\n\n00:09:31.432 --> 00:09:35.479\nThere are no GMOs -- genetically\nmodified organisms -- whatsoever.\n\n00:09:35.503 --> 00:09:37.234\nWe take them from nature,\n\n00:09:37.258 --> 00:09:41.555\nand the only thing that we do\nis give them the optimal conditions,\n\n00:09:41.579 --> 00:09:44.234\nunder the greenhouses\nor in the climate rooms,\n\n00:09:44.258 --> 00:09:47.675\nin order to proliferate,\nmultiply and reproduce.\n\n00:09:48.325 --> 00:09:50.016\nAnd that's what we get.\n\n00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.897\nYou see under a microscope.\n\n00:09:51.921 --> 00:09:55.065\nYou see in the upper left corner?\nYou see a single predatory mite.\n\n00:09:55.089 --> 00:09:58.484\nAnd this is the whole bunch\nof predatory mites.\n\n00:09:58.508 --> 00:10:00.828\nYou see this ampul. You see this one.\n\n00:10:00.852 --> 00:10:04.028\nI have one gram of those predatory mites.\n\n00:10:04.349 --> 00:10:07.897\nOne gram is 80,000 individuals.\n\n00:10:08.461 --> 00:10:14.047\n80,000 individuals are good enough\nto control one acre,\n\n00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:15.909\n4,000 square meters,\n\n00:10:15.933 --> 00:10:17.786\nof a strawberry plot\n\n00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.739\nagainst spider mites for the whole season\n\n00:10:20.763 --> 00:10:22.176\nof almost one year.\n\n00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.488\nAnd we can produce\nfrom this, believe you me,\n\n00:10:26.512 --> 00:10:30.914\nseveral dozens of kilograms\non an annual basis.\n\n00:10:30.938 --> 00:10:35.146\nSo this is what I call\namplification of the phenomenon.\n\n00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:38.969\nAnd no, we do not disrupt the balance.\n\n00:10:38.993 --> 00:10:40.234\nOn the contrary,\n\n00:10:40.258 --> 00:10:43.141\nbecause we bring it to every cultural plot\n\n00:10:43.165 --> 00:10:45.918\nwhere the balance was already disrupted\n\n00:10:45.942 --> 00:10:47.234\nby the chemicals.\n\n00:10:47.258 --> 00:10:49.135\nHere we come with those natural enemies\n\n00:10:49.159 --> 00:10:52.066\nin order to reverse\na little bit of the wheel\n\n00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:56.072\nand to bring more natural balance\nto the agricultural plot\n\n00:10:56.096 --> 00:10:57.937\nby reducing those chemicals.\n\n00:10:57.961 --> 00:10:59.516\nThat's the whole idea.\n\n00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:00.978\nAnd what is the impact?\n\n00:11:01.002 --> 00:11:04.234\nIn this table, you can\nactually see what is an impact\n\n00:11:04.258 --> 00:11:07.986\nof a successful biological\ncontrol by good bugs.\n\n00:11:08.606 --> 00:11:14.975\nFor example, in Israel, where we employ\nmore than 1,000 hectares --\n\n00:11:14.999 --> 00:11:17.674\n10,000 dunams in Israeli terms --\n\n00:11:17.698 --> 00:11:20.323\nof biological pests\ncontrolling sweet pepper\n\n00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:21.871\nunder protection,\n\n00:11:21.895 --> 00:11:25.550\n75 percent of the pesticides\nwere actually reduced.\n\n00:11:25.574 --> 00:11:28.059\nAnd Israeli strawberries, even more --\n\n00:11:28.083 --> 00:11:29.857\n80 percent of the pesticides,\n\n00:11:29.881 --> 00:11:34.449\nespecially those aimed\nagainst pest mites in strawberries.\n\n00:11:34.804 --> 00:11:36.680\nSo the impact is very strong.\n\n00:11:37.942 --> 00:11:40.090\nAnd there goes the question,\n\n00:11:40.114 --> 00:11:43.091\nespecially if you ask\ngrowers, agriculturists:\n\n00:11:43.115 --> 00:11:44.808\nWhy biological control?\n\n00:11:44.832 --> 00:11:46.610\nWhy good bugs?\n\n00:11:46.634 --> 00:11:49.400\nBy the way, the number of answers you get\n\n00:11:49.424 --> 00:11:51.555\nequals the number of people you ask.\n\n00:11:53.012 --> 00:11:57.570\nBut if we go, for example,\nto this place, Southeast Israel,\n\n00:11:57.594 --> 00:12:01.070\nthe Arava area\nabove the Great Rift Valley,\n\n00:12:01.094 --> 00:12:06.139\nwhere the pearl of Israeli\nagriculture is located,\n\n00:12:06.163 --> 00:12:09.756\nespecially under greenhouse conditions,\nor under screenhouse conditions --\n\n00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.569\nif you drive all the way\nto Eilat, you see this\n\n00:12:12.593 --> 00:12:14.506\njust in the middle of the desert.\n\n00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.039\nAnd if you zoom in,\n\n00:12:16.063 --> 00:12:17.766\nyou can definitely watch this:\n\n00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:20.341\ngrandparents with their grandchildren,\n\n00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:23.234\ndistributing the natural\nenemies, the good bugs,\n\n00:12:23.258 --> 00:12:25.631\ninstead of wearing special clothes\n\n00:12:25.655 --> 00:12:27.855\nand gas masks and applying chemicals.\n\n00:12:28.443 --> 00:12:31.029\nSo safety, with respect\nto the application,\n\n00:12:31.053 --> 00:12:34.472\nis the number one answer\nthat we get from growers,\n\n00:12:34.496 --> 00:12:36.469\nfor \"Why biological control?\"\n\n00:12:37.647 --> 00:12:41.617\nNumber two, many growers\nare, in fact, petrified\n\n00:12:41.641 --> 00:12:44.824\nby the idea of resistance,\n\n00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:49.401\nthat the pests will become\nresistant to the chemicals,\n\n00:12:49.425 --> 00:12:53.234\njust like in our case, that bacteria\nbecomes resistant to antibiotics.\n\n00:12:53.258 --> 00:12:56.026\nIt's the same, and it can\nhappen very quickly.\n\n00:12:56.866 --> 00:13:01.234\nFortunately, in either biological control\nor even natural control,\n\n00:13:01.258 --> 00:13:04.319\nresistance is extremely rare.\n\n00:13:04.898 --> 00:13:06.447\nIt hardly happens.\n\n00:13:06.471 --> 00:13:09.823\nBecause this is evolution,\nthis is the natural ratio,\n\n00:13:09.847 --> 00:13:13.701\nunlike resistance, which happens\nin the case of chemicals.\n\n00:13:13.725 --> 00:13:16.701\nAnd thirdly, public demand.\n\n00:13:17.194 --> 00:13:21.998\nThe more the public demands\nthe reduction of chemicals,\n\n00:13:22.022 --> 00:13:25.867\nthe more growers become aware of the fact\n\n00:13:25.891 --> 00:13:28.633\nthat they should, wherever they can\nand wherever possible,\n\n00:13:28.657 --> 00:13:32.588\nreplace the chemical control\nwith biological control.\n\n00:13:32.692 --> 00:13:34.754\nEven here, there is another grower,\n\n00:13:34.778 --> 00:13:38.505\nyou see, very interested in the bugs,\nthe bad ones and the good ones,\n\n00:13:38.529 --> 00:13:40.724\nwearing this magnifier\nalready on her head,\n\n00:13:40.748 --> 00:13:43.157\njust walking safely in her crop.\n\n00:13:43.825 --> 00:13:47.085\nFinally, I want to get to my vision,\n\n00:13:47.109 --> 00:13:49.061\nor, in fact, to my dream.\n\n00:13:49.569 --> 00:13:51.592\nBecause, you see, this is the reality.\n\n00:13:51.616 --> 00:13:53.092\nHave a look at the gap.\n\n00:13:53.116 --> 00:13:55.234\nIf we take the overall turnover\n\n00:13:55.258 --> 00:13:57.703\nof the biocontrol industry worldwide,\n\n00:13:57.727 --> 00:13:59.601\nit's 250 million dollars.\n\n00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.814\nAnd look at the overall pesticide industry\n\n00:14:03.838 --> 00:14:05.692\nin all the crops throughout the world.\n\n00:14:06.035 --> 00:14:08.906\nI think it's times 100\nor something like that.\n\n00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.636\nTwenty-five billion.\n\n00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:13.275\nSo there is a huge gap to bridge.\n\n00:14:14.258 --> 00:14:15.922\nSo actually, how can we do it?\n\n00:14:15.946 --> 00:14:20.826\nHow can we bridge, or let's say,\nnarrow, this gap over the years?\n\n00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:24.598\nFirst of all, we need to find more robust,\n\n00:14:24.622 --> 00:14:27.234\ngood and reliable biological solutions,\n\n00:14:27.258 --> 00:14:31.881\nmore good bugs that we can\neither mass-produce\n\n00:14:31.905 --> 00:14:34.409\nor actually conserve in the field.\n\n00:14:34.971 --> 00:14:39.557\nSecondly, to create even more intensive\nand strict public demand\n\n00:14:39.581 --> 00:14:42.833\nfor the reduction of chemicals\nin agricultural fresh produce.\n\n00:14:43.674 --> 00:14:47.432\nAnd thirdly, also to increase\nawareness by the growers\n\n00:14:47.456 --> 00:14:49.607\nto the potential of this industry.\n\n00:14:50.258 --> 00:14:52.757\nAnd this gap really narrows.\n\n00:14:52.781 --> 00:14:55.396\nStep by step, it does narrow.\n\n00:14:56.515 --> 00:14:58.720\nSo I think my last slide is:\n\n00:14:58.744 --> 00:15:01.009\nAll we are saying --\nwe can actually sing it --\n\n00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:02.827\nGive nature a chance.\n\n00:15:02.851 --> 00:15:06.017\nI'm saying it on behalf\nof all the biocontrol practitioners\n\n00:15:06.041 --> 00:15:07.355\nand implementers,\n\n00:15:07.379 --> 00:15:09.600\nin Israel and abroad,\n\n00:15:09.624 --> 00:15:11.656\nreally give nature a chance.\n\n00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:12.839\nThank you.\n\n00:15:12.863 --> 00:15:14.934\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Glorious visions in

I'm also slightly in awe of them. I'm in awe of their power in terms of imagination, in terms of technology, in terms of concept. But I think, above all, I'm in awe at their power to motivate, to compel us, to transfix us, like really nothing else we've ever invented has quite done before. And I think that we can learn some pretty amazing things by looking at how we do this. And in particular, I think we can learn things about learning. Now the video games industry is far and away the fastest growing of all modern media. From about 10 billion in 1990, it's worth 50 billion dollars globally today, and it shows no sign of slowing down. In four years' time, it's estimated it'll be worth over 80 billion dollars. That's about three times the recorded music industry. This is pretty stunning, but I don't think it's the most telling statistic of all. The thing that really amazes me is that, today, people spend about eight billion real dollars a year buying virtual items that only exist inside video games. This is a screenshot from the virtual game world, Entropia Universe. Earlier this year, a virtual asteroid in it sold for 330,000 real dollars. And this is a Titan class ship in the space game, EVE Online. And this virtual object takes 200 real people about 56 days of real time to build, plus countless thousands of hours of effort before that. And yet, many of these get built. At the other end of the scale, the game Farmville that you may well have heard of, has 70 million players around the world and most of these players are playing it almost every day.This may all sound really quite alarming to some people, an index of something worrying or wrong in society. But we're here for the good news, and the good news is that I think we can explore why this very real human effort, this very intense generation of value, is occurring. And by answering that question, I think we can take something extremely powerful away. And I think the most interesting way to think about how all this is going on is in terms of rewards. And specifically, it's in terms of the very intense emotional rewards that playing games offers to people both individually and collectively. Now if we look at what's going on in someone's head when they are being engaged, two quite different processes are occurring. On the one hand, there's the wanting processes. This is a bit like ambition and drive \u2014 I'm going to do that. I'm going to work hard. On the other hand, there's the liking processes, fun and affection and delight and an enormous flying beast with an orc on the back. It's a really great image. It's pretty cool. It's from the game World of Warcraft with more than 10 million players globally, one of whom is me, another of whom is my wife. And this kind of a world, this vast flying beast you can ride around, shows why games are so very good at doing both the wanting and the liking. Because it's very powerful. It's pretty awesome. It gives you great powers. Your ambition is satisfied, but it's very beautiful. It's a very great pleasure to fly around. And so these combine to form a very intense emotional engagement.But this isn't the really interesting stuff. The really interesting stuff about virtuality is what you can measure with it. Because what you can measure in virtuality is everything. Every single thing that every single person who's ever played in a game has ever done can be measured. The biggest games in the world today are measuring more than one billion points of data about their players, about what everybody does \u2014 far more detail than you'd ever get from any website. And this allows something very special to happen in games. It's something called the reward schedule. And by this, I mean looking at what millions upon millions of people have done and carefully calibrating the rate, the nature, the type, the intensity of rewards in games to keep them engaged over staggering amounts of time and effort. Now, to try and explain this in sort of real terms, I want to talk about a kind of task that might fall to you in so many games. Go and get a certain amount of a certain little game-y item. Let's say, for the sake of argument, my mission is to get 15 pies and I can get 15 pies by killing these cute, little monsters. Simple game quest. Now you can think about this, if you like, as a problem about boxes. I've got to keep opening boxes. I don't know what's inside them until I open them. And I go around opening box after box until I've got 15 pies. Now, if you take a game like Warcraft, you can think about it, if you like, as a great box-opening effort. The game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes, getting better and better stuff in them.This sounds immensely boring but games are able to make this process incredibly compelling. And the way they do this is through a combination of probability and data. Let's think about probability. If we want to engage someone in the process of opening boxes to try and find pies, we want to make sure it's neither too easy, nor too difficult, to find a pie. So what do you do? Well, you look at a million people \u2014 no, 100 million people, 100 million box openers \u2014 and you work out, if you make the pie rate about 25 percent \u2014 that's neither too frustrating, nor too easy. It keeps people engaged. But of course, that's not all you do \u2014 there's 15 pies. Now, I could make a game called Piecraft, where all you had to do was get a million pies or a thousand pies. That would be very boring. Fifteen is a pretty optimal number. You find that \u2014 you know, between five and 20 is about the right number for keeping people going. But we don't just have pies in the boxes. There's 100 percent up here. And what we do is make sure that every time a box is opened, there's something in it, some little reward that keeps people progressing and engaged. In most adventure games, it's a little bit in-game currency, a little bit experience. But we don't just do that either.We also say there's going to be loads of other items of varying qualities and levels of excitement. There's going to be a 10 percent chance you get a pretty good item. There's going to be a 0.1 percent chance you get an absolutely awesome item. And each of these rewards is carefully calibrated to the item. And also, we say, \"Well, how many monsters? Should I have the entire world full of a billion monsters?\" No, we want one or two monsters on the screen at any one time. So I'm drawn on. It's not too easy, not too difficult. So all this is very powerful. But we're in virtuality. These aren't real boxes. So we can do some rather amazing things. We notice, looking at all these people opening boxes, that when people get to about 13 out of 15 pies, their perception shifts, they start to get a bit bored, a bit testy. They're not rational about probability. They think this game is unfair. It's not giving me my last two pies. I'm going to give up. If they're real boxes, there's not much we can do, but in a game we can just say, \"Right, well. When you get to 13 pies, you've got 75 percent chance of getting a pie now.\" Keep you engaged. Look at what people do \u2014 adjust the world to match their expectation. Our games don't always do this. And one thing they certainly do at the moment is if you got a 0.1 percent awesome item, they make very sure another one doesn't appear for a certain length of time to keep the value, to keep it special.And the point is really that we evolved to be satisfied by the world in particular ways. Over tens and hundreds of thousands of years, we evolved to find certain things stimulating, and as very intelligent, civilized beings, we're enormously stimulated by problem solving and learning. But now, we can reverse engineer that and build worlds that expressly tick our evolutionary boxes. So what does all this mean in practice? Well, I've come up with seven things that, I think, show how you can take these lessons from games and use them outside of games. The first one is very simple: experience bars measuring progress \u2014 something that's been talked about brilliantly by people like Jesse Schell earlier this year. It's already been done at the University of Indiana in the States, among other places. It's the simple idea that instead of grading people incrementally in little bits and pieces, you give them one profile character avatar which is constantly progressing in tiny, tiny, tiny little increments which they feel are their own. And everything comes towards that, and they watch it creeping up, and they own that as it goes along.Second, multiple long and short-term aims \u2014 5,000 pies, boring, 15 pies, interesting. So, you give people lots and lots of different tasks. You say, it's about doing 10 of these questions, but another task is turning up to 20 classes on time, but another task is collaborating with other people, another task is showing you're working five times, another task is hitting this particular target. You break things down into these calibrated slices that people can choose and do in parallel to keep them engaged and that you can use to point them towards individually beneficial activities.Third, you reward effort. It's your 100 percent factor. Games are brilliant at this. Every time you do something, you get credit; you get a credit for trying. You don't punish failure. You reward every little bit of effort \u2014 a little bit of gold, a little bit of credit. You've done 20 questions \u2014 tick. It all feeds in as minute reinforcement.Fourth, feedback. This is absolutely crucial, and virtuality is dazzling at delivering this. If you look at some of the most intractable problems in the world today that we've been hearing amazing things about, it's very, very hard for people to learn if they cannot link consequences to actions. Pollution, global warming, these things \u2014 the consequences are distant in time and space. It's very hard to learn, to feel a lesson. But if you can model things for people, if you can give things to people that they can manipulate and play with and where the feedback comes, then they can learn a lesson, they can see, they can move on, they can understand.And fifth, the element of uncertainty. Now this is the neurological goldmine, if you like, because a known reward excites people, but what really gets them going is the uncertain reward, the reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty, that they didn't quite know whether they were going to get it or not. The 25 percent. This lights the brain up. And if you think about using this in testing, in just introducing control elements of randomness in all forms of testing and training, you can transform the levels of people's engagement by tapping into this very powerful evolutionary mechanism. When we don't quite predict something perfectly, we get really excited about it. We just want to go back and find out more.As you probably know, the neurotransmitter associated with learning is called dopamine. It's associated with reward-seeking behavior. And something very exciting is just beginning to happen in places like the University of Bristol in the U.K., where we are beginning to be able to model mathematically dopamine levels in the brain. And what this means is we can predict learning, we can predict enhanced engagement, these windows, these windows of time, in which the learning is taking place at an enhanced level. And two things really flow from this. The first has to do with memory, that we can find these moments. When someone is more likely to remember, we can give them a nugget in a window. And the second thing is confidence, that we can see how game-playing and reward structures make people braver, make them more willing to take risks, more willing to take on difficulty, harder to discourage. This can all seem very sinister. But you know, sort of \"our brains have been manipulated; we're all addicts.\" The word \"addiction\" is thrown around. There are real concerns there. But the biggest neurological turn-on for people is other people. This is what really excites us. In reward terms, it's not money; it's not being given cash \u2014 that's nice \u2014 it's doing stuff with our peers, watching us, collaborating with us.And I want to tell you a quick story about 1999 \u2014 a video game called EverQuest. And in this video game, there were two really big dragons, and you had to team up to kill them \u2014 42 people, up to 42 to kill these big dragons. That's a problem because they dropped two or three decent items. So players addressed this problem by spontaneously coming up with a system to motivate each other, fairly and transparently. What happened was, they paid each other a virtual currency they called \"dragon kill points.\" And every time you turned up to go on a mission, you got paid in dragon kill points. They tracked these on a separate website. So they tracked their own private currency, and then players could bid afterwards for cool items they wanted \u2014 all organized by the players themselves. Now the staggering system, not just that this worked in EverQuest, but that today, a decade on, every single video game in the world with this kind of task uses a version of this system \u2014 tens of millions of people. And the success rate is at close to 100 percent. This is a player-developed, self-enforcing, voluntary currency, and it's incredibly sophisticated player behavior.And I just want to end by suggesting a few ways in which these principles could fan out into the world. Let's start with business. I mean, we're beginning to see some of the big problems around something like business are recycling and energy conservation. We're beginning to see the emergence of wonderful technologies like real-time energy meters. And I just look at this, and I think, yes, we could take that so much further by allowing people to set targets by setting calibrated targets, by using elements of uncertainty, by using these multiple targets, by using a grand, underlying reward and incentive system, by setting people up to collaborate in terms of groups, in terms of streets to collaborate and compete, to use these very sophisticated group and motivational mechanics we see. In terms of education, perhaps most obviously of all, we can transform how we engage people. We can offer people the grand continuity of experience and personal investment. We can break things down into highly calibrated small tasks. We can use calculated randomness. We can reward effort consistently as everything fields together. And we can use the kind of group behaviors that we see evolving when people are at play together, these really quite unprecedentedly complex cooperative mechanisms. Government, well, one thing that comes to mind is the U.S. government, among others, is literally starting to pay people to lose weight. So we're seeing financial reward being used to tackle the great issue of obesity. But again, those rewards could be calibrated so precisely if we were able to use the vast expertise of gaming systems to just jack up that appeal, to take the data, to take the observations, of millions of human hours and plow that feedback into increasing engagement.And in the end, it's this word, \"engagement,\" that I want to leave you with. It's about how individual engagement can be transformed by the psychological and the neurological lessons we can learn from watching people that are playing games. But it's also about collective engagement and about the unprecedented laboratory for observing what makes people tick and work and play and engage on a grand scale in games. And if we can look at these things and learn from them and see how to turn them outwards, then I really think we have something quite revolutionary on our hands.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id":

is\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nthat I think we can explore\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nwhy this very real human effort,\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nthis very intense generation of value, is occurring.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAnd by answering that question,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nI think we can take something\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nextremely powerful away.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nAnd I think the most interesting way\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nto think about how all this is going on\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nis in terms of rewards.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nAnd specifically, it's in terms\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nof the very intense emotional rewards\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nthat playing games offers to people\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nboth individually\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nand collectively.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nNow if we look at what's going on in someone's head\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nwhen they are being engaged,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\ntwo quite different processes are occurring.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nOn the one hand, there's the wanting processes.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nThis is a bit like ambition and drive -- I'm going to do that. I'm going to work hard.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nOn the other hand, there's the liking processes,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nfun and affection\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nand delight\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nand an enormous flying beast with an orc on the back.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nIt's a really great image. It's pretty cool.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nIt's from the game World of Warcraft with more than 10 million players globally,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\none of whom is me, another of whom is my wife.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nAnd this kind of a world,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nthis vast flying beast you can ride around,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nshows why games are so very good\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nat doing both the wanting and the liking.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nBecause it's very powerful. It's pretty awesome.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nIt gives you great powers.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nYour ambition is satisfied, but it's very beautiful.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nIt's a very great pleasure to fly around.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAnd so these combine to form\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\na very intense emotional engagement.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nBut this isn't the really interesting stuff.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nThe really interesting stuff about virtuality\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nis what you can measure with it.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nBecause what you can measure in virtuality\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nis everything.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nEvery single thing that every single person\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nwho's ever played in a game has ever done can be measured.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nThe biggest games in the world today\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nare measuring more than one billion points of data\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nabout their players, about what everybody does --\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nfar more detail than you'd ever get from any website.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nAnd this allows something very special\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nto happen in games.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nIt's something called the reward schedule.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nAnd by this, I mean looking\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nat what millions upon millions of people have done\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nand carefully calibrating the rate,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nthe nature, the type, the intensity of rewards in games\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nto keep them engaged\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nover staggering amounts of time and effort.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nNow, to try and explain this\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nin sort of real terms,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nI want to talk about a kind of task\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nthat might fall to you in so many games.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nGo and get a certain amount of a certain little game-y item.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nLet's say, for the sake of argument,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nmy mission is to get 15 pies\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nand I can get 15 pies\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nby killing these cute, little monsters.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nSimple game quest.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nNow you can think about this, if you like,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nas a problem about boxes.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nI've got to keep opening boxes.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nI don't know what's inside them until I open them.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nAnd I go around opening box after box until I've got 15 pies.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nNow, if you take a game like Warcraft,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nyou can think about it, if you like,\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nas a great box-opening effort.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nThe game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes,\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\ngetting better and better stuff in them.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nThis sounds immensely boring\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nbut games are able\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nto make this process\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nincredibly compelling.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nAnd the way they do this\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nis through a combination of probability and data.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nLet's think about probability.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nIf we want to engage someone\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nin the process of opening boxes to try and find pies,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nwe want to make sure it's neither too easy,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nnor too difficult, to find a pie.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nSo what do you do? Well, you look at a million people --\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nno, 100 million people, 100 million box openers --\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nand you work out, if you make the pie rate\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nabout 25 percent --\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nthat's neither too frustrating, nor too easy.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nIt keeps people engaged.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nBut of course, that's not all you do -- there's 15 pies.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nNow, I could make a game called Piecraft,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nwhere all you had to do was get a million pies\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nor a thousand pies.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nThat would be very boring.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nFifteen is a pretty optimal number.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nYou find that -- you know, between five and 20\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nis about the right number for keeping people going.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nBut we don't just have pies in the boxes.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nThere's 100 percent up here.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nAnd what we do is make sure that every time a box is opened,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nthere's something in it, some little reward\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nthat keeps people progressing and engaged.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nIn most adventure games,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nit's a little bit in-game currency, a little bit experience.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nBut we don't just do that either.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nWe also say there's going to be loads of other items\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nof varying qualities and levels of excitement.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nThere's going to be a 10 percent chance you get a pretty good item.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nThere's going to be a 0.1 percent chance\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nyou get an absolutely awesome item.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nAnd each of these rewards is carefully calibrated to the item.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd also, we say,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\n\"Well, how many monsters? Should I have the entire world full of a billion monsters?\"\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nNo, we want one or two monsters on the screen at any one time.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nSo I'm drawn on. It's not too easy, not too difficult.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nSo all this is very powerful.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nBut we're in virtuality. These aren't real boxes.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nSo we can do\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nsome rather amazing things.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nWe notice, looking at all these people opening boxes,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nthat when people get to about 13 out of 15 pies,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\ntheir perception shifts, they start to get a bit bored, a bit testy.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nThey're not rational about probability.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nThey think this game is unfair.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nIt's not giving me my last two pies. I'm going to give up.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nIf they're real boxes, there's not much we can do,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nbut in a game we can just say, \"Right, well.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nWhen you get to 13 pies, you've got 75 percent chance of getting a pie now.\"\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nKeep you engaged. Look at what people do --\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nadjust the world to match their expectation.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nOur games don't always do this.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nAnd one thing they certainly do at the moment\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nis if you got a 0.1 percent awesome item,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nthey make very sure another one doesn't appear for a certain length of time\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nto keep the value, to keep it special.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nAnd the point is really\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nthat we evolved to be satisfied by the world\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nin particular ways.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nOver tens and hundreds of thousands of years,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nwe evolved to find certain things stimulating,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nand as very intelligent, civilized beings,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nwe're enormously stimulated by problem solving and learning.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nBut now, we can reverse engineer that\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nand build worlds\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nthat expressly tick our evolutionary boxes.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nSo what does all this mean in practice?\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nWell, I've come up\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nwith seven things\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nthat, I think, show\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nhow you can take these lessons from games\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nand use them outside of games.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nThe first one is very simple:\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nexperience bars measuring progress --\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nsomething that's been talked about brilliantly\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nby people like Jesse Schell earlier this year.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nIt's already been done at the University of Indiana in the States, among other places.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nIt's the simple idea that instead of grading people incrementally\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nin little bits and pieces,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nyou give them one profile character avatar\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nwhich is constantly progressing\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nin tiny, tiny, tiny little increments which they feel are their own.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nAnd everything comes towards that,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nand they watch it creeping up, and they own that as it goes along.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nSecond, multiple long and short-term aims --\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\n5,000 pies, boring,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\n15 pies, interesting.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nSo, you give people\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nlots and lots of different tasks.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nYou say, it's about\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\ndoing 10 of these questions,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nbut another task\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nis turning up to 20 classes on time,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nbut another task is collaborating with other people,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nanother task is showing you're working five times,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nanother task is hitting this particular target.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nYou break things down into these calibrated slices\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nthat people can choose and do in parallel\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nto keep them engaged\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nand that you can use to point them\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\ntowards individually beneficial activities.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nThird, you reward effort.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nIt's your 100 percent factor. Games are brilliant at this.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nEvery time you do something, you get credit; you get a credit for trying.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nYou don't punish failure. You reward every little bit of effort --\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\na little bit of gold, a little bit of credit. You've done 20 questions -- tick.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nIt all feeds in as minute reinforcement.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nFourth, feedback.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nThis is absolutely crucial,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nand virtuality is dazzling at delivering this.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nIf you look at some of the most intractable problems in the world today\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nthat we've been hearing amazing things about,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nit's very, very hard for people to learn\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nif they cannot link consequences to actions.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nPollution, global warming, these things --\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nthe consequences are distant in time and space.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nIt's very hard to learn, to feel a lesson.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nBut if you can model things for people,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nif you can give things to people that they can manipulate\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nand play with and where the feedback comes,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nthen they can learn a lesson, they can see,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nthey can move on, they can understand.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nAnd fifth,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nthe element of uncertainty.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nNow this is the neurological goldmine,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nif you like,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nbecause a known reward\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nexcites people,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nbut what really gets them going\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nis the uncertain reward,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nthe reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty,\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nthat they didn't quite know whether they were going to get it or not.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nThe 25 percent. This lights the brain up.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nAnd if you think about\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nusing this in testing,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nin just introducing control elements of randomness\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nin all forms of testing and training,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nyou can transform the levels of people's engagement\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nby tapping into this very powerful\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nevolutionary mechanism.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nWhen we don't quite predict something perfectly,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nwe get really excited about it.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nWe just want to go back and find out more.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nAs you probably know, the neurotransmitter\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nassociated with learning is called dopamine.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nIt's associated with reward-seeking behavior.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nAnd something very exciting is just beginning to happen\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nin places like the University of Bristol in the U.K.,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nwhere we are beginning to be able to model mathematically\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\ndopamine levels in the brain.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nAnd what this means is we can predict learning,\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nwe can predict enhanced engagement,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nthese windows, these windows of time,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nin which the learning is taking place at an enhanced level.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nAnd two things really flow from this.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nThe first has to do with memory,\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nthat we can find these moments.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nWhen someone is more likely to remember,\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nwe can give them a nugget in a window.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nAnd the second thing is confidence,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nthat we can see how game-playing and reward structures\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nmake people braver, make them more willing to take risks,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nmore willing to take on difficulty,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nharder to discourage.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nThis can all seem very sinister.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nBut you know, sort of \"our brains have been manipulated; we're all addicts.\"\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nThe word \"addiction\" is thrown around.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nThere are real concerns there.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nBut the biggest neurological turn-on for people\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nis other people.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nThis is what really excites us.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nIn reward terms, it's not money;\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nit's not being given cash -- that's nice --\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nit's doing stuff with our peers,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nwatching us, collaborating with us.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nAnd I want to tell you a quick story about 1999 --\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\na video game called EverQuest.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nAnd in this video game,\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nthere were two really big dragons, and you had to team up to kill them --\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\n42 people, up to 42 to kill these big dragons.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nThat's a problem\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nbecause they dropped two or three decent items.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nSo players addressed this problem\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nby spontaneously coming up with a system\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nto motivate each other,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nfairly and transparently.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nWhat happened was, they paid each other a virtual currency\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nthey called \"dragon kill points.\"\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nAnd every time you turned up to go on a mission,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nyou got paid in dragon kill points.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nThey tracked these on a separate website.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nSo they tracked their own private currency,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nand then players could bid afterwards\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nfor cool items they wanted --\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nall organized by the players themselves.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nNow the staggering system, not just that this worked in EverQuest,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nbut that today, a decade on,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nevery single video game in the world with this kind of task\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nuses a version of this system --\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\ntens of millions of people.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nAnd the success rate\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nis at close to 100 percent.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nThis is a player-developed,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nself-enforcing, voluntary currency,\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nand it's incredibly sophisticated\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nplayer behavior.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nAnd I just want to end by suggesting\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\na few ways in which these principles\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\ncould fan out into the world.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nLet's start with business.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nI mean, we're beginning to see some of the big problems\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\naround something like business are\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nrecycling and energy conservation.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nWe're beginning to see the emergence of wonderful technologies\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nlike real-time energy meters.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nAnd I just look at this, and I think, yes,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nwe could take that so much further\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nby allowing people to set targets\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nby setting calibrated targets,\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nby using elements of uncertainty,\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nby using these multiple targets,\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nby using a grand, underlying reward and incentive system,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nby setting people up\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nto collaborate in terms of groups, in terms of streets\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nto collaborate and compete,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nto use these very sophisticated\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\ngroup and motivational mechanics we see.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nIn terms of education,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nperhaps most obviously of all,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nwe can transform how we engage people.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nWe can offer people the grand continuity\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nof experience and personal investment.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nWe can break things down\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\ninto highly calibrated small tasks.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nWe can use calculated randomness.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nWe can reward effort consistently\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nas everything fields together.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nAnd we can use the kind of group behaviors\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nthat we see evolving when people are at play together,\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nthese really quite unprecedentedly complex\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\ncooperative mechanisms.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nGovernment, well, one thing that comes to mind\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nis the U.S. government, among others,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nis literally starting to pay people\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nto lose weight.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nSo we're seeing financial reward being used\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nto tackle the great issue of obesity.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nBut again, those rewards\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\ncould be calibrated so precisely\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nif we were able to use the vast expertise\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nof gaming systems to just jack up that appeal,\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nto take the data, to take the observations,\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nof millions of human hours\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nand plow that feedback\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\ninto increasing engagement.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nAnd in the end, it's this word, \"engagement,\"\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nthat I want to leave you with.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nIt's about how individual engagement\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\ncan be transformed\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nby the psychological and the neurological lessons\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nwe can learn from watching people that are playing games.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nBut it's also about collective engagement\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nand about the unprecedented laboratory\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nfor observing what makes people tick\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nand work and play and engage\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\non a grand scale in games.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nAnd if we can look at these things and learn from them\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nand see how to turn them outwards,\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nthen I really think we have something quite revolutionary on our hands.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:18.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "E-voting without fraud", "duration": "422", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_bismark_e_voting_without_fraud", "transcript": "So there are a few things that bring us humans together in the way that an election does. We stand in elections; we vote in elections; we observe elections. Our democracies rely on elections. We all understand why we have elections, and we all leave the house on the same day to go and vote. We cherish the opportunity to have our say, to help decide the future of the country. The fundamental idea is that politicians are given mandate to speak for us, to make decisions on our behalf that affect us all. Without that mandate, they would be corrupt.Well unfortunately, power corrupts, and so people will do lots of things to get power and to stay in power, including doing bad things to elections. You see, even if the idea of the election is perfect, running a countrywide election is a big project, and big projects are messy. Whenever there is an election, it seems like something always goes wrong, someone tries to cheat, or something goes accidentally awry \u2014 a ballot box goes missing here, chads are left hanging over here.To make sure as few things as possible go wrong, we have all these procedures around the election. So for example, you come to the polling station, and a poll station worker asks for your ID before giving you a ballot form and asking you to go into a voting booth to fill out your vote. When you come back out, you get to drop your vote into the ballot box where it mixes with all the other votes, so that no one knows how you voted.Well, what I want us to think about for a moment is what happens after that, after you drop your vote into the ballot box. And most people would go home and feel sure that their vote has been counted, because they trust that the election system works. They trust that election workers and election observers do their jobs and do their jobs correctly. The ballot boxes go to counting places. They're unsealed and the votes are poured out and laboriously counted. Most of us have to trust that that happens correctly for our own vote, and we all have to trust that that happens correctly for all the votes in the election. So we have to trust a lot of people. We have to trust a lot of procedures. And sometimes we even have to trust computers. So imagine hundreds of millions of voters casting hundreds of millions of votes, all to be counted correctly and all the things that can possibly go wrong causing all these bad headlines, and you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea of trying to make elections better.Well in the face of all these bad headlines, researchers have taken a step back and thought about how we can do elections differently. They've zoomed out and looked at the big picture. And the big picture is this: elections should be verifiable. Voters should be able to check that their votes are counted correctly, without breaking election secrecy, which is so very important. And that's the tough part. How do we make an election system completely verifiable while keeping the votes absolutely secret?Well, the way we've come up with uses computers but doesn't depend on them. And the secret is the ballot form. And if you look closely at these ballot forms, you'll notice that the candidate list is in a different order on each one. And that means, if you mark your choices on one of them and then remove the candidate list, I won't be able to tell from the bit remaining what your vote is for. And on each ballot form there is this encrypted value in the form of this 2D barcode on the right. And there's some complicated cryptography going on in there, but what's not complicated is voting with one of these forms. So we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us, and then we'll use the paper for verification.So this is how you vote. You get one of these ballot forms at random, and then you go into the voting booth, and you mark your choices, and you tear along a perforation. And you shred the candidate list. And the bit that remains, the one with your marks \u2014 this is your encrypted vote. So you let a poll station worker scan your encrypted vote. And because it's encrypted, it can be submitted, stored and counted centrally and displayed on a website for anyone to see, including you. So you take this encrypted vote home as your receipt. And after the close of the election, you can check that your vote was counted by comparing your receipt to the vote on the website. And remember, the vote is encrypted from the moment you leave the voting booth, so if an election official wants to find out how you voted, they will not be able to. If the government wants to find out how you voted, they won't be able to. No hacker can break in and find out how you voted. No hacker can break in and change your vote, because then it won't match your receipt. Votes can't go missing because then you won't find yours when you look for it.But the election magic doesn't stop there. Instead, we want to make the whole process so transparent that news media and international observers and anyone who wants to can download all the election data and do the count themselves. They can check that all the votes were counted correctly. They can check that the announced result of the election is the correct one. And these are elections by the people, for the people. So the next step for our democracies are transparent and verifiable elections.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 997, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958

we vote in elections;\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nwe observe elections.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nOur democracies rely on elections.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nWe all understand why we have elections,\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nand we all leave the house on the same day\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nto go and vote.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nWe cherish the opportunity to have our say,\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nto help decide the future of the country.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nThe fundamental idea is that politicians\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nare given mandate to speak for us,\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nto make decisions on our behalf\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nthat affect us all.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nWithout that mandate, they would be corrupt.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nWell unfortunately, power corrupts,\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nand so people will do lots of things\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nto get power and to stay in power,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nincluding doing bad things to elections.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nYou see, even if the idea\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nof the election is perfect,\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nrunning a countrywide election is a big project,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nand big projects are messy.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nWhenever there is an election,\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nit seems like something always goes wrong,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nsomeone tries to cheat,\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nor something goes accidentally awry --\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.958\na ballot box goes missing here,\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nchads are left hanging over here.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nTo make sure as few things as possible go wrong,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nwe have all these procedures around the election.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nSo for example, you come to the polling station,\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nand a poll station worker asks for your ID\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nbefore giving you a ballot form\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nand asking you to go into a voting booth\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nto fill out your vote.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nWhen you come back out, you get to drop your vote\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\ninto the ballot box\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nwhere it mixes with all the other votes,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nso that no one knows how you voted.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nWell, what I want us to think about for a moment\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nis what happens after that,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nafter you drop your vote into the ballot box.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nAnd most people would go home\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nand feel sure that their vote has been counted,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nbecause they trust\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nthat the election system works.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nThey trust that election workers and election observers\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\ndo their jobs and do their jobs correctly.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nThe ballot boxes go to counting places.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nThey're unsealed and the votes are poured out\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nand laboriously counted.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nMost of us have to trust\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nthat that happens correctly for our own vote,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nand we all have to trust that that happens correctly\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nfor all the votes in the election.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nSo we have to trust a lot of people.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nWe have to trust a lot of procedures.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nAnd sometimes we even have to trust computers.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nSo imagine hundreds of millions of voters\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\ncasting hundreds of millions of votes,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nall to be counted correctly\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nand all the things that can possibly go wrong\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\ncausing all these bad headlines,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nand you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nof trying to make elections better.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nWell in the face of all these bad headlines,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nresearchers have taken a step back\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nand thought about how we can do elections differently.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nThey've zoomed out and looked at the big picture.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nAnd the big picture is this:\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nelections should be verifiable.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nVoters should be able to check\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nthat their votes are counted correctly,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nwithout breaking election secrecy,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nwhich is so very important.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nAnd that's the tough part.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nHow do we make an election system completely verifiable\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nwhile keeping the votes\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nabsolutely secret?\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nWell, the way we've come up with\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nuses computers\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nbut doesn't depend on them.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nAnd the secret is the ballot form.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nAnd if you look closely at these ballot forms,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nyou'll notice that the candidate list\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nis in a different order on each one.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nAnd that means, if you mark your choices on one of them\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nand then remove the candidate list,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nI won't be able to tell from the bit remaining\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nwhat your vote is for.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nAnd on each ballot form there is this encrypted value\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nin the form of this 2D barcode\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\non the right.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nAnd there's some complicated cryptography\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\ngoing on in there,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nbut what's not complicated\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nis voting with one of these forms.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nSo we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nand then we'll use the paper for verification.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nSo this is how you vote.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nYou get one of these ballot forms at random,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nand then you go into the voting booth,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nand you mark your choices,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nand you tear along a perforation.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nAnd you shred the candidate list.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAnd the bit that remains, the one with your marks --\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nthis is your encrypted vote.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nSo you let a poll station worker\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nscan your encrypted vote.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nAnd because it's encrypted,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nit can be submitted, stored\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nand counted centrally\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nand displayed on a website\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nfor anyone to see, including you.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nSo you take this encrypted vote\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nhome as your receipt.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd after the close of the election,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nyou can check that your vote was counted\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nby comparing your receipt\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nto the vote on the website.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nAnd remember, the vote is encrypted\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nfrom the moment you leave the voting booth,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nso if an election official wants to find out how you voted,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nthey will not be able to.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nIf the government wants to find out how you voted,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nthey won't be able to.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nNo hacker can break in\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nand find out how you voted.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nNo hacker can break in and change your vote,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nbecause then it won't match your receipt.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nVotes can't go missing\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nbecause then you won't find yours when you look for it.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nBut the election magic doesn't stop there.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nInstead, we want to make the whole process\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nso transparent\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nthat news media and international observers\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nand anyone who wants to\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\ncan download all the election data\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nand do the count themselves.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nThey can check that all the votes were counted correctly.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nThey can check\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nthat the announced result of the election\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nis the correct one.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nAnd these are elections\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nby the people, for the people.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nSo the next step for our democracies\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nare transparent\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nand verifiable elections.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nThank you.\n\n00:06:45.958 -->

guess the story actually has to start maybe back in the the 1960s, when I was seven or eight years old, watching Jacques Cousteau documentaries on the living room floor with my mask and flippers on. Then after every episode, I had to go up to the bathtub and swim around the bathtub and look at the drain, because that's all there was to look at. And by the time I turned 16, I pursued a career in marine science, in exploration and diving, and lived in underwater habitats, like this one off the Florida Keys, for 30 days total. Brian Skerry took this shot. Thanks, Brian. And I've dived in deep-sea submersibles around the world. And this one is the deepest diving submarine in the world, operated by the Japanese government.And Sylvia Earle and I were on an expedition in this submarine 20 years ago in Japan. And on my dive, I went down 18,000 feet, to an area that I thought would be pristine wilderness area on the sea floor. But when I got there, I found lots of plastic garbage and other debris. And it was really a turning point in my life, where I started to realize that I couldn't just go have fun doing science and exploration. I needed to put it into a context. I needed to head towards conservation goals. So I began to work with National Geographic Society and others and led expeditions to Antarctica. I led three diving expeditions to Antarctica. Ten years ago was a seminal trip, where we explored that big iceberg, B-15, the largest iceberg in history, that broke off the Ross Ice Shelf. And we developed techniques to dive inside and under the iceberg, such as heating pads on our kidneys with a battery that we dragged around, so that, as the blood flowed through our kidneys, it would get a little boost of warmth before going back into our bodies. But after three trips to Antarctica, I decided that it might be nicer to work in warmer water. And that same year, 10 years ago, I headed north to the Phoenix Islands.And I'm going to tell you that story here in a moment. But before I do, I just want you to ponder this graph for a moment. You may have seen this in other forms, but the top line is the amount of protected area on land, globally, and it's about 12 percent. And you can see that it kind of hockey sticks up around the 1960s and '70s, and it's on kind of a nice trajectory right now. And that's probably because that's when everybody got aware of the environment and Earth Day and all the stuff that happened in the '60s with the Hippies and everything really did, I think, have an affect on global awareness. But the ocean-protected area is basically flat line until right about now \u2014 it appears to be ticking up. And I do believe that we are at the hockey stick point of the protected area in the ocean. I think we would have gotten there a lot earlier if we could see what happens in the ocean like we can see what happens on land. But unfortunately, the ocean is opaque, and we can't see what's going on. And therefore we're way behind on protection. But scuba diving, submersibles and all the work that we're setting about to do here will help rectify that.So where are the Phoenix Islands? They were the world's largest marine-protected area up until last week when the Chagos Archipelago was declared. It's in the mid-Pacific. It's about five days from anywhere. If you want to get to the Phoenix Islands, it's five days from Fiji, it's five days from Hawaii, it's five days from Samoa. It's out in the middle of the Pacific, right around the Equator. I had never heard of the islands 10 years ago, nor the country, Kiribati, that owns them, till two friends of mine who run a liveaboard dive boat in Fiji said, \"Greg, would you lead a scientific expedition up to these islands? They've never been dived.\" And I said, \"Yeah. But tell me where they are and the country that owns them.\" So that's when I first learned of the Islands and had no idea what I was getting into. But I was in for the adventure. Let me give you a little peek here of the Phoenix Islands-protected area. It's a very deep-water part of our planet. The average depths are about 12,000 ft. There's lots of seamounts in the Phoenix Islands, which are specifically part of the protected area. Seamounts are important for biodiversity. There's actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land. It's an interesting fact. And the Phoenix Islands is very rich in those seamounts. So it's a deep \u2014 think about it in a big three-dimensional space, very deep three-dimensional space with herds of tuna, whales, all kinds of deep sea marine life like we've seen here before.That's the vessel that we took up there for these studies, early on, and that's what the Islands look like \u2014 you can see in the background. They're very low to the water, and they're all uninhabited, except one island has about 35 caretakers on it. And they've been uninhabited for most of time because even in the ancient days, these islands were too far away from the bright lights of Fiji and Hawaii and Tahiti for those ancient Polynesian mariners that were traversing the Pacific so widely. But we got up there, and I had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity to get to a place that had never been dived and just get to an island and go, \"Okay, where are we going to dive? Let's try there,\" and then falling into the water. Both my personal and my professional life changed.Suddenly, I saw a world that I had never seen before in the ocean \u2014 schools of fish that were so dense they dulled the penetration of sunlight from the surface, coral reefs that were continuous and solid and colorful, large fish everywhere, manta rays. It was an ecosystem. Parrotfish spawning \u2014 this is about 5,000 longnose parrotfish spawning at the entrance to one of the Phoenix Islands. You can see the fish are balled up and then there's a little cloudy area there where they're exchanging the eggs and sperm for reproduction \u2014 events that the ocean is supposed to do, but struggles to do in many places now because of human activity. The Phoenix Islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet are very important for tuna fisheries, especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here. Phoenix Islands is a major tuna location. And sharks \u2014 we had sharks on our early dives, up to 150 sharks at once, which is an indication of a very, very healthy, very strong, system.So I thought the scenes of never-ending wilderness would go on forever, but they did finally come to an end. And we explored the surface of the Islands as well \u2014 very important bird nesting site, some of the most important bird-nesting sites in the Pacific, in the world. And we finished our trip. And that's the area again. You can see the Islands \u2014 there are eight islands \u2014 that pop out of the water. The peaks that don't come out of the water are the seamounts. Remember, a seamount turns into an island when it hits the surface.And what's the context of the Phoenix Islands? Where do these exist? Well they exist in the Republic of Kiribati, and Kiribati is located in the Central Pacific in three island groups. In the west we have the Gilbert Islands. In the center we have the Phoenix Islands, which is the subject that I'm talking about. And then over to the east we have the Line Islands. It's the largest atoll nation in the world. And they have about 110,000 people spread out over 33 islands. They control 3.4 million cubic miles of ocean, and that's between one and two percent of all the ocean water on the planet. And when I was first going up there, I barely knew the name of this country 10 years ago, and people would ask me, \"Why are you going to this place called Kiribati?\" And it reminded me of that old joke where the bank robber comes out of the courthouse handcuffed, and the reporter yells, \"Hey, Willy. Why do you rob banks?\" And he says, \"cause that's where all the money is.\" And I would tell people, \"Why do I go to Kiribati? Because that's where all the ocean is.\" They basically are one nation that controls most of the equatorial waters of the Central Pacific Ocean.They're also a country that is in dire danger. Sea levels are rising, and Kiribati, along with 42 other nations in the world, will be under water within 50 to 100 years due to climate change and the associated sea-level rise from thermal expansion and the melting of freshwater into the ocean. The Islands rise only one to two meters above the surface. Some of the islands have already gone under water. And these nations are faced with a real problem. We as a world are faced with a problem. What do we do with displaced fellow Earthlings who no longer have a home on the planet? The president of the Maldives conducted a mock cabinet meeting underwater recently to highlight the dire straits of these countries. So it's something we need to focus on. But back to the Phoenix Islands, which is the subject of this Talk.After I got back, I said, okay, this is amazing, what we found. I'd like to go back and share it with the government of Kiribati, who are over in Tarawa, the westernmost group. So I started contacting them \u2014 because they had actually given me a permit to do this \u2014 and I said, \"I want to come up and tell you what we found.\" And for some reason they didn't want me to come, or it was hard to find a time and a place, and it took a while, but finally they said, \"Okay, you can come. But if you come, you have to buy lunch for everybody who comes to the seminar.\" So I said, \"Okay, I'm happy to buy lunch. Just get whatever anybody wants.\" So David Obura, a coral reef biologist, and I went to Tarawa, and we presented for two hours on the amazing findings of the Phoenix Islands. And the country never knew this. They never had any data from this area. They'd never had any information from the Phoenix Islands. After the talk, the Minister of Fisheries walked up to me and he said, \"Greg, do you realize that you are the first scientist who has ever come back and told us what they did?\" He said, \"We often issue these permits to do research in our waters, but usually we get a note two or three years later, or a reprint. But you're the first one who's ever come back and told us what you did. And we really appreciate that. And we're buying you lunch today. And are you free for dinner?\"And I was free for dinner, and I went out to dinner with the Minister of Fisheries in Kiribati. And over the course of dinner, I learned that Kiribati gains most of its revenue \u2014 it's a very poor country \u2014 but it gains what revenue is has by selling access to foreign nations to take fish out of its waters, because Kiribati does not have the capacity to take the fish itself. And the deal that they strike is the extracting country gives Kiribati five percent of the landed value. So if the United States removes a million dollars' worth of lobsters from a reef, Kiribati gets 50,000 dollars. And, you know, it didn't seem like a very good deal to me. So I asked the Minister over dinner, I said, \"Would you consider a situation where you would still get paid \u2014 we do the math and figure out what the value of the resource is \u2014 but you leave fish and the sharks and the shrimp in the water?\" He stopped, and he said, \"Yes, we would like to do that to deal with our overfishing problem, and I think we would call it a reverse fishing license.\" He coined the term \"reverse fishing license.\" So I said, \"Yes, a 'reverse fishing license.'\"So we walked away from this dinner really not knowing where to go at that point. I went back to the States and started looking around to see if I could find examples where reverse fishing licenses had been issued, and it turned out there were none. There were no oceanic deals where countries were compensated for not fishing. It had occurred on land, in rainforests of South America and Africa, where landowners had been paid not to cut the trees down. And Conservation International had struck some of those deals. So I went to Conservation International and brought them in as a partner and went through the process of valuing the fishery resource, deciding how much Kiribati should be compensated, what the range of the fishes were, brought in a whole bunch of other partners \u2014 the government of Australia, the government of New Zealand, the World Bank. The Oak Foundation and National Geographic have been big funders of this as well. And we basically founded the park on the idea of an endowment that would pay the equivalent lost fishing license fees to this very poor country to keep the area intact.Halfway through this process, I met the president of Kiribati, President Anote Tong. He's a really important leader, a real visionary, forward-thinking man, and he told me two things when I approached him. He said, \"Greg, there's two things I'd like you to do. One is, remember I'm a politician, so you've got to go out and work with my ministers and convince the people of Kiribati that this is a good idea. Secondly, I'd like you to create principles that will transcend my own presidency. I don't want to do something like this if it's going to go away after I'm voted out of office.\" So we had very strong leadership, very good vision and a lot of science, a lot of lawyers involved. Many, many steps were taken to pull this off. And it was primarily because Kiribati realized that this was in their own self-interest to do this. They realized that this was a common cause that they had found with the conservation community.Then in 2002, when this was all going full-swing, a coral-bleaching event happened in the Phoenix Islands. Here's this resource that we're looking to save, and it turns out it's the hottest heating event that we can find on record. The ocean heated up as it does sometimes, and the hot spot formed and stalled right over the Phoenix Islands for six months. It was over 32 degrees Celsius for six months and it basically killed 60 percent of the coral. So suddenly we had this area that we were protecting, but now it appeared to be dead, at least in the coral areas. Of course the deep-sea areas and the open ocean areas were fine, but the coral, which everybody likes to look at, was in trouble. Well, the good news is it's recovered and recovering fast, faster than any reef we've seen. This picture was just taken by Brian Skerry a few months ago when we returned to the Phoenix Islands and discovered that, because it is a protected area and has healthy fish populations that keep the algae grazed down and keep the rest of the reef healthy, the coral is booming, is just booming back. It's almost like if a person has multiple diseases, it's hard to get well, you might die, but if you only have one disease to deal with, you can get better. And that's the story with climate-change heating. It's the only threat, the only influence that the reef had to deal with. There was no fishing, there was no pollution, there was no coastal development, and the reef is on a full-bore recovery.Now I remember that dinner I had with the Minister of Fisheries 10 years ago when we first brought this up and I got quite animated during the dinner and said, \"Well, I think that the conservation community might embrace this idea, Minister.\" He paused and put his hands together and said, \"Yes, Greg, but the devil will be in the details,\" he said. And it certainly was. The last 10 years have been detail after detail ranging from creating legislation to multiple research expeditions to communication plans, as I said, teams of lawyers, MOUs, creating the Phoenix Islands Trust Board. And we are now in the process of raising the full endowment. Kiribati has frozen extracting activities at its current state while we raise the endowment. We just had our first PIPA Trust Board meeting three weeks ago. So it's a fully functional up-and-running entity that negotiates the reverse fishing license with the country. And the PIPA Trust Board holds that license and pays the country for this. So it's a very solid, very well thought-out, very well grounded system, and it was a bottom-up system, and that was very important with this work, from the bottom up to secure this. So the conditions for success here are listed. You can read them yourselves. But I would say the most important one in my mind was working within the market forces of the situation. And that insured that we could move this forward and it would have both the self-interest of Kiribati as well as the self-interest of the world.And I'll leave you with one final slide, that is: how do we scale this up? How do we realize Sylvia's dream? Where eventually do we take this? Here's the Pacific with large MPAs and large conservation zones on it. And as you can see, we have a patchwork across this ocean. I've just described to you the one story behind that rectangular area in the middle, the Phoenix Islands, but every other green patch on that has its own story. And what we need to do now is look at the whole Pacific Ocean in its entirety and make a network of MPAs across the Pacific so that we have our world's largest ocean protected and self-sustaining over time.Thank you very much.

It's about five days from anywhere.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nIf you want to get to the Phoenix Islands,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nit's five days from Fiji,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nit's five days from Hawaii, it's five days from Samoa.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nIt's out in the middle of the Pacific,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nright around the Equator.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nI had never heard of the islands 10 years ago,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nnor the country, Kiribati, that owns them,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\ntill two friends of mine who run a liveaboard dive boat in Fiji\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nsaid, \"Greg, would you lead a scientific expedition up to these islands?\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nThey've never been dived.\"\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nAnd I said, \"Yeah.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nBut tell me where they are and the country that owns them.\"\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nSo that's when I first learned of the Islands\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nand had no idea what I was getting into.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nBut I was in for the adventure.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nLet me give you a little peek here of the Phoenix Islands-protected area.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nIt's a very deep-water part of our planet.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nThe average depths are about 12,000 ft.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nThere's lots of seamounts in the Phoenix Islands,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nwhich are specifically part of the protected area.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nSeamounts are important for biodiversity.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nThere's actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nIt's an interesting fact.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nAnd the Phoenix Islands is very rich in those seamounts.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nSo it's a deep -- think about it in a big three-dimensional space,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nvery deep three-dimensional space\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nwith herds of tuna, whales,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nall kinds of deep sea marine life\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nlike we've seen here before.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nThat's the vessel that we took up there\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nfor these studies, early on,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nand that's what the Islands look like -- you can see in the background.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nThey're very low to the water,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nand they're all uninhabited, except one island\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nhas about 35 caretakers on it.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nAnd they've been uninhabited for most of time\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nbecause even in the ancient days,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nthese islands were too far away\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nfrom the bright lights of Fiji and Hawaii and Tahiti\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nfor those ancient Polynesian mariners\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nthat were traversing the Pacific so widely.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nBut we got up there,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nand I had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nto get to a place that had never been dived\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nand just get to an island and go, \"Okay, where are we going to dive?\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nLet's try there,\"\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nand then falling into the water.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nBoth my personal and my professional life changed.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nSuddenly, I saw a world\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nthat I had never seen before in the ocean --\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nschools of fish that were so dense\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nthey dulled the penetration of sunlight from the surface,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\ncoral reefs that were continuous\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nand solid and colorful,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nlarge fish everywhere,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nmanta rays.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nIt was an ecosystem. Parrotfish spawning --\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nthis is about 5,000 longnose parrotfish spawning\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nat the entrance to one of the Phoenix Islands.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nYou can see the fish are balled up\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand then there's a little cloudy area there\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nwhere they're exchanging the eggs and sperm for reproduction --\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nevents that the ocean is supposed to do,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nbut struggles to do in many places now\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nbecause of human activity.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nThe Phoenix Islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nare very important for tuna fisheries,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nespecially this yellowfin tuna that you see here.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nPhoenix Islands is a major tuna location.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd sharks -- we had sharks on our early dives,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nup to 150 sharks at once,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nwhich is an indication\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nof a very, very healthy, very strong, system.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nSo I thought the scenes\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nof never-ending wilderness\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nwould go on forever,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nbut they did finally come to an end.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nAnd we explored the surface of the Islands as well --\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nvery important bird nesting site,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nsome of the most important bird-nesting sites in the Pacific, in the world.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAnd we finished our trip.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nAnd that's the area again.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nYou can see the Islands -- there are eight islands --\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nthat pop out of the water.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nThe peaks that don't come out of the water are the seamounts.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nRemember, a seamount turns into an island when it hits the surface.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nAnd what's the context of the Phoenix Islands?\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nWhere do these exist?\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nWell they exist in the Republic of Kiribati,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nand Kiribati is located in the Central Pacific\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nin three island groups.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nIn the west we have the Gilbert Islands.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nIn the center we have the Phoenix Islands,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nwhich is the subject that I'm talking about.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAnd then over to the east we have the Line Islands.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nIt's the largest atoll nation in the world.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd they have\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nabout 110,000 people\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nspread out over 33 islands.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nThey control 3.4 million cubic miles of ocean,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nand that's between one and two percent\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nof all the ocean water on the planet.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nAnd when I was first going up there,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nI barely knew the name of this country 10 years ago,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nand people would ask me,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\n\"Why are you going to this place called Kiribati?\"\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nAnd it reminded me of that old joke\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nwhere the bank robber comes out of the courthouse handcuffed,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nand the reporter yells, \"Hey, Willy.

They never had any data from this area.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nThey'd never had any information from the Phoenix Islands.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nAfter the talk, the Minister of Fisheries walked up to me\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nand he said, \"Greg, do you realize\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nthat you are the first scientist\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nwho has ever come back\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nand told us what they did?\"\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nHe said, \"We often issue these permits\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nto do research in our waters,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nbut usually we get a note two or three years later,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nor a reprint.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nBut you're the first one who's ever come back and told us what you did.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nAnd we really appreciate that.

went out to dinner with the Minister of Fisheries in Kiribati.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nAnd over the course of dinner,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nI learned that Kiribati gains most of its revenue --\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nit's a very poor country --\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nbut it gains what revenue is has\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nby selling access to foreign nations\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nto take fish out of its waters,\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nbecause Kiribati does not have the capacity\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nto take the fish itself.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nAnd the deal that they strike\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nis the extracting country\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\ngives Kiribati five

--> 00:10:46.958\nworth of lobsters from a reef,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nKiribati gets 50,000 dollars.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nAnd, you know, it didn't seem like a very good deal to me.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nSo I asked the Minister over dinner,\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nI said, \"Would you consider a situation\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nwhere you would still get paid --\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nwe do the math and figure out what the value of the resource is --\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nbut you leave fish and the sharks\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nand the shrimp in the water?\"\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nHe stopped, and he said, \"Yes, we would like to do that\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nto deal with our overfishing problem,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nand I think we would call it a reverse fishing license.\"\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nHe coined the term \"reverse fishing license.\"\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nSo I said, \"Yes, a 'reverse fishing license.'\"\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nSo we walked away from this dinner\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nreally not knowing where to go at that point.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nI went back to the States and started looking around\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nto see if I could find examples\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nwhere reverse fishing licenses\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nhad been issued,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nand it turned out there were none.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nThere were no oceanic deals\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nwhere countries were compensated for not fishing.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nIt had occurred on land,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nin rainforests of South America and Africa,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nwhere landowners had been paid\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nnot to cut the trees down.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nAnd Conservation International had struck some of those deals.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nSo I went to Conservation International\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nand brought them in as a partner\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nand went through the process\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nof valuing the fishery resource,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\ndeciding how much Kiribati should be compensated,\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nwhat the range of the fishes were,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nbrought in a whole bunch of other partners --\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nthe government of Australia,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nthe government of New Zealand, the World Bank.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nThe Oak Foundation and National Geographic\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nhave been big funders of this as well.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nAnd we basically founded the park\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\non the idea of an endowment\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nthat would pay the equivalent lost fishing license fees\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nto this very poor country\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nto keep the area intact.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nHalfway through this process, I met the president of Kiribati,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nPresident Anote Tong.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nHe's a really important leader,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\na real visionary, forward-thinking man,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nand he told me two things when I approached him.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nHe said, \"Greg, there's two things I'd like you to do.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nOne is, remember I'm a politician,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nso you've got to go out and work with my ministers\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nand convince the people of Kiribati that this is a good idea.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nSecondly, I'd like you to create principles\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nthat will transcend my own presidency.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nI don't want to do something like this\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nif it's going to go away after I'm voted out of office.\"\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nSo we had very strong leadership, very good vision\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nand a lot of science, a lot of lawyers involved.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nMany, many steps were taken to pull this off.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nAnd it was primarily because Kiribati realized\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nthat this was in their own self-interest to do this.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nThey realized that this was a common cause\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nthat they had found\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nwith the conservation community.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nThen in 2002,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nwhen this was all going full-swing,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\na coral-bleaching event happened in the Phoenix Islands.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nHere's this resource that we're looking to save,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nand it turns out it's the hottest heating event\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nthat we can find on record.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nThe ocean heated up as it does sometimes,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nand the hot spot formed and stalled\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nright over the Phoenix Islands for six months.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nIt was over 32 degrees Celsius for six months\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nand it basically killed\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\n60 percent of the coral.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nSo suddenly we had this area that we were protecting,\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nbut now it appeared to be dead, at least in the coral areas.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nOf course the deep-sea areas and the open ocean areas were fine,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nbut the coral, which everybody likes to look at, was in trouble.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nWell, the good news is it's recovered\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nand recovering fast,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nfaster than any reef we've seen.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nThis picture was just taken by Brian Skerry a few months ago\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nwhen we returned to the Phoenix Islands\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nand discovered that, because it is a protected area\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nand has healthy fish populations\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nthat keep the algae grazed down\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nand keep the rest of the reef healthy,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nthe coral is booming, is just booming back.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nIt's almost like if a person\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nhas multiple diseases,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nit's hard to get well, you might die,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nbut if you only have one disease to deal with, you can get better.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nAnd that's the story with climate-change heating.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nIt's the only threat,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nthe only influence that the reef had to deal with.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nThere was no fishing, there was no pollution, there was no coastal development,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nand the reef is on a full-bore recovery.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nNow I remember that dinner I had with the Minister of Fisheries 10 years ago\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nwhen we first brought this up and I got quite animated during the dinner\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nand said, \"Well, I think that the conservation community\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nmight embrace this idea, Minister.\"\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nHe paused and put his hands together and said,\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\n\"Yes, Greg,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nbut the devil will be in the details,\" he said.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nAnd it certainly was.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nThe last 10 years have been detail after detail\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nranging from creating legislation\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nto multiple research expeditions\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nto communication plans,\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nas I said, teams of lawyers,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nMOUs,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\ncreating the Phoenix Islands Trust Board.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nAnd we are now in the process of raising the full endowment.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nKiribati has frozen extracting activities\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nat its current state while we raise the endowment.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nWe just had our first PIPA Trust Board meeting three weeks ago.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nSo it's a fully functional\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nup-and-running entity\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nthat negotiates the reverse fishing license with the country.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nAnd the PIPA Trust Board holds that license\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nand pays the country for this.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nSo it's a very solid, very well thought-out,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nvery well grounded system,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nand it was a bottom-up system,\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nand that was very important with this work,\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nfrom the bottom up to secure this.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nSo the conditions for success here are listed.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nYou can read them yourselves.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nBut I would say the most important one in my mind\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nwas working within the market forces\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nof the situation.\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nAnd that insured that we could move this forward\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nand it would have both the self-interest of Kiribati\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nas well as the self-interest of the world.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nAnd I'll leave you with one final slide,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nthat is: how do we scale this up?\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nHow do we realize Sylvia's dream?\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nWhere eventually do we take this?\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nHere's the Pacific\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nwith large MPAs\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nand large conservation zones on it.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nAnd as you can see,\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nwe have a patchwork across this ocean.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nI've just described to you the one story\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nbehind that rectangular area in the middle, the Phoenix Islands,\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nbut every other green patch on that\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nhas its own story.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nAnd what we need to do now\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nis look at the whole Pacific Ocean\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nin its entirety\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nand make a network of MPAs\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nacross the Pacific\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nso that we have our world's largest ocean\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nprotected and self-sustaining\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nover time.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nThank you very much. (Applause)"}, {"title": "Re-engineering the brain", "duration": "1054", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/gero_miesenboeck", "transcript": "I have a doppelganger. (Laughter) Dr. Gero is a brilliant but slightly mad scientist in the \"Dragonball Z: Android Saga.\" If you look very carefully, you see that his skull has been replaced with a transparent Plexiglas dome so that the workings of his brain can be observed and also controlled with light. That's exactly what I do \u2014 optical mind control.(Laughter)But in contrast to my evil twin who lusts after world domination, my motives are not sinister. I control the brain in order to understand how it works. Now wait a minute, you may say, how can you go straight to controlling the brain without understanding it first? Isn't that putting the cart before the horse? Many neuroscientists agree with this view and think that understanding will come from more detailed observation and analysis. They say, \"If we could record the activity of our neurons, we would understand the brain.\" But think for a moment what that means. Even if we could measure what every cell is doing at all times, we would still have to make sense of the recorded activity patterns, and that's so difficult, chances are we'll understand these patterns just as little as the brains that produce them.Take a look at what brain activity might look like. In this simulation, each black dot is one nerve cell. The dot is visible whenever a cell fires an electrical impulse. There's 10,000 neurons here. So you're looking at roughly one percent of the brain of a cockroach. Your brains are about 100 million times more complicated. Somewhere, in a pattern like this, is you, your perceptions, your emotions, your memories, your plans for the future. But we don't know where, since we don't know how to read the pattern. We don't understand the code used by the brain. To make progress, we need to break the code. But how? An experienced code-breaker will tell you that in order to figure out what the symbols in a code mean, it's essential to be able to play with them, to rearrange them at will. So in this situation too, to decode the information contained in patterns like this, watching alone won't do. We need to rearrange the pattern. In other words, instead of recording the activity of neurons, we need to control it. It's not essential that we can control the activity of all neurons in the brain, just some. The more targeted our interventions, the better. And I'll show you in a moment how we can achieve the necessary precision.And since I'm realistic, rather than grandiose, I don't claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system will at once unravel all its mysteries. But we'll certainly learn a lot. Now, I'm by no means the first person to realize how powerful a tool intervention is. The history of attempts to tinker with the function of the nervous system is long and illustrious. It dates back at least 200 years, to Galvani's famous experiments in the late 18th century and beyond. Galvani showed that a frog's legs twitched when he connected the lumbar nerve to a source of electrical current. This experiment revealed the first, and perhaps most fundamental, nugget of the neural code: that information is written in the form of electrical impulses. Galvani's approach of probing the nervous system with electrodes has remained state-of-the-art until today, despite a number of drawbacks. Sticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude. It's hard to do in animals that run around, and there is a physical limit to the number of wires that can be inserted simultaneously.So around the turn of the last century, I started to think, \"Wouldn't it be wonderful if one could take this logic and turn it upside down?\" So instead of inserting a wire into one spot of the brain, re-engineer the brain itself so that some of its neural elements become responsive to diffusely broadcast signals such as a flash of light. Such an approach would literally, in a flash of light, overcome many of the obstacles to discovery. First, it's clearly a non-invasive, wireless form of communication. And second, just as in a radio broadcast, you can communicate with many receivers at once. You don't need to know where these receivers are, and it doesn't matter if these receivers move \u2014 just think of the stereo in your car. It gets even better, for it turns out that we can fabricate the receivers out of materials that are encoded in DNA. So each nerve cell with the right genetic makeup will spontaneously produce a receiver that allows us to control its function. I hope you'll appreciate the beautiful simplicity of this concept. There's no high-tech gizmos here, just biology revealed through biology.Now let's take a look at these miraculous receivers up close. As we zoom in on one of these purple neurons, we see that its outer membrane is studded with microscopic pores. Pores like these conduct electrical current and are responsible for all the communication in the nervous system. But these pores here are special. They are coupled to light receptors similar to the ones in your eyes. Whenever a flash of light hits the receptor, the pore opens, an electrical current is switched on, and the neuron fires electrical impulses. Because the light-activated pore is encoded in DNA, we can achieve incredible precision. This is because, although each cell in our bodies contains the same set of genes, different mixes of genes get turned on and off in different cells. You can exploit this to make sure that only some neurons contain our light-activated pore and others don't. So in this cartoon, the bluish white cell in the upper-left corner does not respond to light because it lacks the light-activated pore. The approach works so well that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain. In this example, each electrical impulse, each deflection on the trace, is caused by a brief pulse of light. And the approach, of course, also works in moving, behaving animals.This is the first ever such experiment, sort of the optical equivalent of Galvani's. It was done six or seven years ago by my then graduate student, Susana Lima. Susana had engineered the fruit fly on the left so that just two out of the 200,000 cells in its brain expressed the light-activated pore. You're familiar with these cells because they are the ones that frustrate you when you try to swat the fly. They trained the escape reflex that makes the fly jump into the air and fly away whenever you move your hand in position. And you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect. The animal jumps, it spreads its wings, it vibrates them, but it can't actually take off because the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates. Now to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly to a flash it could see, Susana did a simple but brutally effective experiment. She cut the heads off of her flies. These headless bodies can live for about a day, but they don't do much. They just stand around and groom excessively. So it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is vanity. (Laughter) Anyway, as you'll see in a moment, Susana was able to turn on the flight motor of what's the equivalent of the spinal cord of these flies and get some of the headless bodies to actually take off and fly away. They didn't get very far, obviously. Since we took these first steps, the field of optogenetics has exploded. And there are now hundreds of labs using these approaches.And we've come a long way since Galvani's and Susana's first successes in making animals twitch or jump. We can now actually interfere with their psychology in rather profound ways, as I'll show you in my last example, which is directed at a familiar question. Life is a string of choices creating a constant pressure to decide what to do next. We cope with this pressure by having brains, and within our brains, decision-making centers that I've called here the \"Actor.\" The Actor implements a policy that takes into account the state of the environment and the context in which we operate. Our actions change the environment, or context, and these changes are then fed back into the decision loop.Now to put some neurobiological meat on this abstract model, we constructed a simple one-dimensional world for our favorite subject, fruit flies. Each chamber in these two vertical stacks contains one fly. The left and the right halves of the chamber are filled with two different odors, and a security camera watches as the flies pace up and down between them. Here's some such CCTV footage. Whenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odor streams meet, it has to make a decision. It has to decide whether to turn around and stay in the same odor, or whether to cross the midline and try something new. These decisions are clearly a reflection of the Actor's policy. Now for an intelligent being like our fly, this policy is not written in stone but rather changes as the animal learns from experience. We can incorporate such an element of adaptive intelligence into our model by assuming that the fly's brain contains not only an Actor, but a different group of cells, a \"Critic,\" that provides a running commentary on the Actor's choices. You can think of this nagging inner voice as sort of the brain's equivalent of the Catholic Church, if you're an Austrian like me, or the super-ego, if you're Freudian, or your mother, if you're Jewish.(Laughter)Now obviously, the Critic is a key ingredient in what makes us intelligent. So we set out to identify the cells in the fly's brain that played the role of the Critic. And the logic of our experiment was simple. We thought if we could use our optical remote control to activate the cells of the Critic, we should be able, artificially, to nag the Actor into changing its policy. In other words, the fly should learn from mistakes that it thought it had made but, in reality, it had not made. So we bred flies whose brains were more or less randomly peppered with cells that were light addressable. And then we took these flies and allowed them to make choices. And whenever they made one of the two choices, chose one odor, in this case the blue one over the orange one, we switched on the lights. If the Critic was among the optically activated cells, the result of this intervention should be a change in policy. The fly should learn to avoid the optically reinforced odor.Here's what happened in two instances: We're comparing two strains of flies, each of them having about 100 light-addressable cells in their brains, shown here in green on the left and on the right. What's common among these groups of cells is that they all produce the neurotransmitter dopamine. But the identities of the individual dopamine-producing neurons are clearly largely different on the left and on the right. Optically activating these hundred or so cells into two strains of flies has dramatically different consequences. If you look first at the behavior of the fly on the right, you can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odors meet, it marches straight through, as it did before. Its behavior is completely unchanged. But the behavior of the fly on the left is very different. Whenever it comes up to the midpoint, it pauses, it carefully scans the odor interface as if it was sniffing out its environment, and then it turns around. This means that the policy that the Actor implements now includes an instruction to avoid the odor that's in the right half of the chamber. This means that the Critic must have spoken in that animal, and that the Critic must be contained among the dopamine-producing neurons on the left, but not among the dopamine producing neurons on the right.Through many such experiments, we were able to narrow down the identity of the Critic to just 12 cells. These 12 cells, as shown here in green, send the output to a brain structure called the \"mushroom body,\" which is shown here in gray. We know from our formal model that the brain structure at the receiving end of the Critic's commentary is the Actor. So this anatomy suggests that the mushroom bodies have something to do with action choice. Based on everything we know about the mushroom bodies, this makes perfect sense. In fact, it makes so much sense that we can construct an electronic toy circuit that simulates the behavior of the fly. In this electronic toy circuit, the mushroom body neurons are symbolized by the vertical bank of blue LEDs in the center of the board. These LED's are wired to sensors that detect the presence of odorous molecules in the air. Each odor activates a different combination of sensors, which in turn activates a different odor detector in the mushroom body. So the pilot in the cockpit of the fly, the Actor, can tell which odor is present simply by looking at which of the blue LEDs lights up.What the Actor does with this information depends on its policy, which is stored in the strengths of the connection, between the odor detectors and the motors that power the fly's evasive actions. If the connection is weak, the motors will stay off and the fly will continue straight on its course. If the connection is strong, the motors will turn on and the fly will initiate a turn. Now consider a situation in which the motors stay off, the fly continues on its path and it suffers some painful consequence such as getting zapped. In a situation like this, we would expect the Critic to speak up and to tell the Actor to change its policy. We have created such a situation, artificially, by turning on the critic with a flash of light. That caused a strengthening of the connections between the currently active odor detector and the motors. So the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again, the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive maneuver.I don't know about you, but I find it exhilarating to see how vague psychological notions evaporate and give rise to a physical, mechanistic understanding of the mind, even if it's the mind of the fly. This is one piece of good news. The other piece of good news, for a scientist at least, is that much remains to be discovered. In the experiments I told you about, we have lifted the identity of the Critic, but we still have no idea how the Critic does its job. Come to think of it, knowing when you're wrong without a teacher, or your mother, telling you, is a very hard problem. There are some ideas in computer science and in artificial intelligence as to how this might be done, but we still haven't solved a single example of how intelligent behavior springs from the physical interactions in living matter. I think we'll get there in the not too distant future.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1000, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nI have

00:01:54.958\nThere's 10,000 neurons here.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nSo you're looking at roughly one percent\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nof the brain of a cockroach.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nYour brains are about 100 million times\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nmore complicated.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nSomewhere, in a pattern like this,\n\n00:02:07.958 -->

--> 00:02:33.958\nAn experienced code-breaker will tell you\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nthat in order to figure out what the symbols in a code mean,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nit's essential to be able to play with them,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nto rearrange them at will.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nSo in this situation too,\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nto

rearrange the pattern.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nIn other words,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\ninstead of recording the activity of neurons,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nwe need to control it.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nIt's not essential that we can control\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nthe activity of all neurons in the brain, just some.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nThe more targeted our interventions, the better.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nAnd I'll show you in a moment\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nhow we can achieve the necessary precision.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nAnd since I'm realistic, rather than grandiose,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nI don't claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nwill at once unravel all its mysteries.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nBut we'll certainly learn a lot.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nNow, I'm by no means\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nthe first person to realize\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nhow powerful a tool intervention is.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nThe history of attempts\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nto tinker with the function of the nervous system\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nis long and illustrious.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nIt dates back at least 200 years,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nto Galvani's famous experiments\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nin the late 18th century and beyond.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nGalvani showed that a frog's legs twitched\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nwhen he connected the lumbar nerve\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nto a source of electrical current.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nThis experiment revealed the first, and perhaps most fundamental,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nnugget of the neural code:\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nthat information is written in the form\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nof electrical impulses.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nGalvani's approach\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nof probing the nervous system with electrodes\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nhas remained state-of-the-art until today,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\ndespite a number of drawbacks.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nSticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nIt's hard to do in animals that run around,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nand there is a physical limit\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nto the number of wires\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nthat can be inserted simultaneously.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nSo around the turn of the last century,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nI started to think,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\n\"Wouldn't it be wonderful if one could take this logic\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand turn it upside down?\"\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nSo instead of inserting a wire\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\ninto one spot of the brain,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nre-engineer the brain itself\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nso that some of its neural elements\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nbecome responsive to diffusely broadcast signals\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nsuch as a flash of light.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nSuch an approach would literally, in a flash of light,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\novercome many of the obstacles to discovery.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nFirst, it's clearly a non-invasive,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nwireless form of communication.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nAnd second, just as in a radio broadcast,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nyou can communicate with many receivers at once.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nYou don't need to know where these receivers are,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nand it doesn't matter if these receivers move --\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\njust think of the stereo in your car.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nIt gets even better,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nfor it turns out that we can fabricate the receivers\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nout of materials that are encoded in DNA.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nSo each nerve cell\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nwith the right genetic makeup\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nwill spontaneously produce a receiver\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nthat allows us to control its function.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nI hope you'll appreciate\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nthe beautiful simplicity\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nof this concept.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nThere's no high-tech gizmos here,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\njust biology revealed through biology.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nNow let's take a look at these miraculous receivers up close.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nAs we zoom in on one of these purple neurons,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nwe see that its outer membrane\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nis studded with microscopic pores.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nPores like these conduct electrical current\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nand are responsible\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nfor all the communication in the nervous system.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nBut these pores here are special.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nThey are coupled to light receptors\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nsimilar to the ones in your eyes.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nWhenever a flash of light hits the receptor,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nthe pore opens, an electrical current is switched on,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nand the neuron fires electrical impulses.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nBecause the light-activated pore is encoded in DNA,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nwe can achieve incredible precision.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nThis is because,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nalthough each cell in our bodies\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\ncontains the same set of genes,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\ndifferent mixes of genes get turned on and off\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nin different cells.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nYou can exploit this to make sure\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nthat only some neurons\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\ncontain our light-activated pore and others don't.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nSo in this cartoon, the bluish white cell\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nin the upper-left corner\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\ndoes not respond to light\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nbecause it lacks the light-activated pore.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nThe approach works so well\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nthat we can write purely artificial messages\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\ndirectly to the brain.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nIn this example, each electrical impulse,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\neach deflection on the trace,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nis caused by a brief pulse of light.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nAnd the approach, of course, also works\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nin moving, behaving animals.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nThis is the first ever such experiment,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nsort of the optical equivalent of Galvani's.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nIt was done six or seven years ago\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nby my then graduate student, Susana Lima.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nSusana had engineered the fruit fly on the left\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nso that just two out of the 200,000 cells in its brain\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nexpressed the light-activated pore.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nYou're familiar with these cells\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nbecause they are the ones that frustrate you\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nwhen you try to swat the fly.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nThey trained the escape reflex that makes the fly jump into the air\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nand fly away whenever you move your hand in position.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nAnd you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nThe animal jumps, it spreads its wings, it vibrates them,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nbut it can't actually take off\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nbecause the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nNow to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nto a flash it could see,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nSusana did a simple\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nbut brutally effective experiment.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nShe cut the heads off of her flies.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nThese headless bodies can live for about a day,\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nbut they don't do much.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nThey just stand around\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nand groom excessively.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nSo it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is vanity.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nAnyway, as you'll see in a moment,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nSusana was able to turn on the flight motor\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nof what's the equivalent of the spinal cord of these flies\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nand get some of the headless bodies\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nto actually take off and fly away.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nThey didn't get very far, obviously.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nSince we took these first steps,\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nthe field of optogenetics has exploded.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nAnd there are now hundreds of labs\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nusing these approaches.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nAnd we've come a long way\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nsince Galvani's and Susana's first successes\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nin making animals twitch or jump.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nWe can now actually interfere with their psychology\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nin rather profound ways,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nas I'll show you in my last example,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nwhich is directed at a familiar question.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nLife is a string of choices\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\ncreating a constant pressure to decide what to do next.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nWe cope with this pressure by having brains,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nand within our brains, decision-making centers\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nthat I've called here the \"Actor.\"\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nThe Actor implements a policy that takes into account\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nthe state of the environment\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nand the context in which we operate.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nOur actions change the environment, or context,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nand these changes are then fed back into the decision loop.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nNow to put some neurobiological meat\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\non this abstract model,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nwe constructed a simple one-dimensional world\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nfor our favorite subject, fruit flies.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nEach chamber in these two vertical stacks\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\ncontains one fly.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nThe left and the right halves of the chamber\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nare filled with two different odors,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nand a security camera watches\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nas the flies pace up and down between them.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nHere's some such CCTV footage.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nWhenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nwhere the two odor streams meet,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nit has to make a decision.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nIt has to decide whether to turn around\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nand stay in the same odor,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nor whether to cross the midline\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nand try something new.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nThese decisions are clearly a reflection\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nof the Actor's policy.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nNow for an intelligent being like our fly,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nthis policy is not written in stone\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nbut rather changes as the animal learns from experience.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nWe can incorporate such an element\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nof adaptive intelligence into our model\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nby assuming that the fly's brain\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\ncontains not only an Actor,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nbut a different group of cells,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\na \"Critic,\" that provides a running commentary\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\non the Actor's choices.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nYou can think of this nagging inner voice\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nas sort of the brain's equivalent\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nof the Catholic Church,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nif you're an Austrian like me,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nor the super-ego, if you're Freudian,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nor your mother, if you're Jewish.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:16.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nNow obviously,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nthe Critic is a key ingredient\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nin what makes us intelligent.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nSo we set out to identify\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nthe cells in the fly's brain\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nthat played the role of the Critic.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nAnd the logic of our experiment was simple.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nWe thought if we could use our optical remote control\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nto activate the cells of the Critic,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nwe should be able, artificially, to nag the Actor\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\ninto changing its policy.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nIn other words,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nthe fly should learn from mistakes\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nthat it thought it had made\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nbut, in reality, it had not made.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nSo we bred flies\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nwhose brains were more or less randomly peppered\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nwith cells that were light addressable.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nAnd then we took these flies\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nand allowed them to make choices.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nAnd whenever they made one of the two choices,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nchose one odor,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nin this case the blue one over the orange one,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nwe switched on the lights.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nIf the Critic was among the optically activated cells,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nthe result of this intervention\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nshould be a change in policy.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nThe fly should learn to avoid\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nthe optically reinforced odor.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nHere's what happened in two instances:\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nWe're comparing two strains of flies,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\neach of them having\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nabout 100 light-addressable cells in their brains,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nshown here in green on the left and on the right.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nWhat's common among these groups of cells\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nis that they all produce the neurotransmitter dopamine.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nBut the identities of the individual\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\ndopamine-producing neurons\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nare clearly largely different on the left and on the right.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nOptically activating\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nthese hundred or so cells\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\ninto two strains of flies\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nhas dramatically different consequences.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nIf you look first at the behavior\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nof the fly on the right,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nyou can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nwhere the two odors meet,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nit marches straight through, as it did before.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nIts behavior is completely unchanged.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nBut the behavior of the fly on the left is very different.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nWhenever it comes up to the midpoint,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nit pauses,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nit carefully scans the odor interface\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nas if it was sniffing out its environment,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nand then it turns around.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nThis means that the policy that the Actor implements\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nnow includes an instruction to avoid the odor\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nthat's in the right half of the chamber.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nThis means that the Critic\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nmust have spoken in that animal,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nand that the Critic must be contained\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\namong the dopamine-producing neurons on the left,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nbut not among the dopamine producing neurons on the right.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nThrough many such experiments,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nwe were able to narrow down\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nthe identity of the Critic\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nto just 12 cells.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nThese 12 cells, as shown here in green,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nsend the output to a brain structure\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\ncalled the \"mushroom body,\"\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nwhich is shown here in gray.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nWe know from our formal model\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nthat the brain structure\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nat the receiving end of the Critic's commentary is the Actor.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nSo this anatomy suggests\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nthat the mushroom bodies have something to do\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nwith action choice.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nBased on everything we know about the mushroom bodies,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nthis makes perfect sense.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nIn fact, it makes so much sense\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nthat we can construct an electronic toy circuit\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nthat simulates the behavior of the fly.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nIn this electronic toy circuit,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nthe mushroom body neurons are symbolized\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nby the vertical bank of blue LEDs\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nin the center of the board.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nThese LED's are wired to sensors\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nthat detect the presence of odorous molecules in the air.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nEach odor activates a different combination of sensors,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nwhich in turn activates\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\na different odor detector in the mushroom body.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nSo the pilot in the cockpit of the fly,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nthe Actor,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\ncan tell which odor is present\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nsimply by looking at which of the blue LEDs lights up.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nWhat the Actor does with this information\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\ndepends on its policy,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nwhich is stored in the strengths of the connection,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nbetween the odor detectors\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nand the motors\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nthat power the fly's evasive actions.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nIf the connection is weak, the motors will stay off\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nand the fly will continue straight on its course.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nIf the connection is strong, the motors will turn on\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nand the fly will initiate a turn.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nNow consider a situation\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nin which the motors stay off,\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nthe fly continues on its path\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nand it suffers some painful consequence\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nsuch as getting zapped.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nIn a situation like this,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nwe would expect the Critic to speak up\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nand to tell the Actor\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nto change its policy.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nWe have created such a situation, artificially,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nby turning on the critic with a flash of light.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nThat caused a strengthening of the connections\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nbetween the currently active odor detector\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nand the motors.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nSo the next time\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nthe fly finds itself facing the same odor again,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nthe connection is strong enough to turn on the motors\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nand to trigger an evasive maneuver.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nI don't know about you,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nbut I find it exhilarating to see\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nhow vague psychological notions\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nevaporate and give rise\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nto a physical, mechanistic understanding of the mind,\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\neven if it's the mind of the fly.\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nThis is one piece of good news.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nThe other piece of good news,\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nfor a scientist at least,\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nis that much remains to be discovered.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nIn the experiments I told you about,\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nwe have lifted the identity of the Critic,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nbut we still have no idea\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nhow the Critic does its job.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nCome to think of it, knowing when you're wrong\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nwithout a teacher, or your mother, telling you,\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nis a very hard problem.\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nThere are some ideas in computer science\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nand in artificial intelligence\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nas to how this might be done,\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nbut we still haven't solved\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\na single example\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nof how intelligent behavior\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nsprings from the physical

wake up \u266b \u266b in the morning \u266b \u266b I pour the coffee \u266b \u266b I read the paper \u266b \u266b And then I slowly \u266b \u266b and so softly \u266b \u266b do the dishes \u266b \u266b So feed the fishes \u266b \u266b You sing me happy birthday \u266b \u266b Like it's gonna be \u266b \u266b your last day \u266b \u266b here on Earth \u266b(Applause)All right. So, I wanted to do something special today. I want to debut a new song that I've been working on in the last five or six months. And there's few things more thrilling than playing a song for the first time in front of an audience, especially when it's half-finished. (Laughter) I'm kind of hoping some conversations here might help me finish it. Because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms. And so this is basically a song about loops, but not the kind of loops that I make up here. They're feedback loops. And in the audio world that's when the microphone gets too close to its sound source, and then it gets in this self-destructive loop that creates a very unpleasant sound. And I'm going to demonstrate for you. (Laughter) I'm not going to hurt you. Don't worry.\u266b This is a loop, feedback loop \u266b \u266b This is a loop, feedback loop \u266b \u266b This is a loop, feedback loop \u266b \u266b This is a loop, feedback loop \u266b \u266b This is a loop, feedback loop \u266b \u266b This is a loop, feedback loop \u266b \u266b This is a \u2014 (Feedback)All right. I don't know if that was necessary to demonstrate \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 but my point is it's the sound of self-destruction.And I've been thinking about how that applies across a whole spectrum of realms, from, say, the ecological, okay. There seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from, it gets ugly. So like, you can't feed cows their own brains or you get mad cow disease, and inbreeding and incest and, let's see, what's the other one? Biological \u2014 there's autoimmune diseases, where the body attacks itself a little too overzealously and destroys the host, or the person. And then \u2014 okay, this is where we get to the song \u2014 kind of bridges the gap to the emotional.Because although I've used scientific terms in songs, it's very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical. And there's some things you just don't need to have in songs. So I'm trying to bridge this gap between this idea and this melody. And so, I don't know if you've ever had this, but when I close my eyes sometimes and try to sleep, I can't stop thinking about my own eyes. And it's like your eyes start straining to see themselves. That's what it feels like to me. It's not pleasant. I'm sorry if I put that idea in your head. (Laughter) It's impossible, of course, for your eyes to see themselves, but they seem to be trying. So that's getting a little more closer to a personal experience. Or ears being able to hear themselves \u2014 it's just impossible. That's the thing. So, I've been working on this song that mentions these things and then also imagines a person who's been so successful at defending themselves from heartbreak that they're left to do the deed themselves, if that's possible. And that's what the song is asking. All right. It doesn't have a name yet.(Music)\u266b Go ahead and congratulate yourself \u266b \u266b Give yourself a hand, the hand is your hand \u266b \u266b And the eye that eyes itself is your eye \u266b \u266b And the ear that hears itself is near \u266b \u266b 'Cause it's your ear, oh oh \u266b \u266b You've done the impossible now \u266b \u266b Took yourself apart \u266b \u266b You made yourself invulnerable \u266b \u266b No one can break your heart \u266b \u266b So you wear it out \u266b \u266b And you wring it out \u266b \u266b And you wear it out \u266b \u266b And you break it yourself \u266b \u266b Breaking your own, break it yourself \u266b \u266b Breaking your own, break it yourself \u266b \u266b Breaking your own \u266b (Applause)Thanks. (Applause) All right. It's kind of cool. Songwriters can sort of get away with murder. You can throw out crazy theories and not have to back it up with data or graphs or research. But, you know, I think reckless curiosity would be what the world needs now, just a little bit. (Applause) I'm going to finish up with a song of mine called \"Weather Systems.\"(Music)\u266b Quiet \u266b \u266b Quiet down, she said \u266b \u266b Speak into the back of his head \u266b \u266b On the edge of the bed, I can see your blood flow \u266b \u266b I can see your \u266b \u266b cells grow \u266b \u266b Hold still awhile \u266b \u266b Don't spill the wine \u266b \u266b I can see it all from here \u266b \u266b I can see \u266b \u266b oh, I \u266b \u266b I can see \u266b \u266b weather systems \u266b \u266b of the world \u266b \u266b Weather systems \u266b \u266b of the world \u266b \u266b Some things you say \u266b \u266b are not for sale \u266b \u266b I would hold it where \u266b \u266b our free agents of some substance are \u266b \u266b scared \u266b \u266b Hold still a while \u266b \u266b Don't spill the wine \u266b \u266b I can see it all from here \u266b \u266b I can see \u266b \u266b oh, I \u266b \u266b I can see \u266b \u266b weather systems of the world \u266b \u266b Weather systems \u266b \u266b of the world \u266bThanks.(Applause)", "id": 1001, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nWell, there's lots to talk about,\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nbut I think I'm just going to play to start off.\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:30.958\n(Music)\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\n\u266b When I wake up \u266b\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\n\u266b in the morning \u266b\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\n\u266b I pour the coffee \u266b\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\n\u266b I read the paper \u266b\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\n\u266b And then I slowly \u266b\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\n\u266b and so softly \u266b\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\n\u266b do the dishes \u266b\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\n\u266b So feed the fishes \u266b\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\n\u266b You sing me happy birthday \u266b\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\n\u266b Like it's gonna be \u266b\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.958\n\u266b your last day \u266b\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\n\u266b here on Earth \u266b\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:38.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nAll right.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nSo, I wanted to do something special today.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nI want to debut a new song that I've been working on\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nin the last five or six months.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nAnd there's few things more thrilling\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nthan playing a song\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nfor the first time in front of an audience,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nespecially when it's half-finished.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nI'm kind of hoping some conversations here\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nmight help me finish it.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nBecause it gets into all sorts\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nof crazy realms.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nAnd so this is basically a song\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nabout loops,\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nbut not the kind of loops that I make up here.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nThey're feedback loops.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nAnd in the audio world\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nthat's when the microphone gets too close\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nto its sound source,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nand then it gets in this self-destructive loop\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nthat creates a very unpleasant sound.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nAnd I'm going to demonstrate for you.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nI'm not going to hurt you.

It's a story of public education and of rural communities and of what design might do to improve both. So this is Bertie County, North Carolina, USA. To give you an idea of the \"where:\" So here's North Carolina, and if we zoom in, Bertie County is in the eastern part of the state. It's about two hours east driving-time from Raleigh. And it's very flat. It's very swampy. It's mostly farmland. The entire county is home to just 20,000 people, and they're very sparsely distributed. So there's only 27 people per square mile, which comes down to about 10 people per square kilometer.Bertie County is kind of a prime example in the demise of rural America. We've seen this story all over the country and even in places beyond the American borders. We know the symptoms. It's the hollowing out of small towns. It's downtowns becoming ghost towns. The brain drain \u2014 where all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back. It's the dependence on farm subsidies and under-performing schools and higher poverty rates in rural areas than in urban. And Bertie County is no exception to this. Perhaps the biggest thing it struggles with, like many communities similar to it, is that there's no shared, collective investment in the future of rural communities. Only 6.8 percent of all our philanthropic giving in the U.S. right now benefits rural communities, and yet 20 percent of our population lives there.So Bertie County is not only very rural; it's incredibly poor. It is the poorest county in the state. It has one in three of its children living in poverty, and it's what is referred to as a \"rural ghetto.\" The economy is mostly agricultural. The biggest crops are cotton and tobacco, and we're very proud of our Bertie County peanut. The biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant. The county seat is Windsor. This is like Times Square of Windsor that you're looking at right now. It's home to only 2,000 people, and like a lot of other small towns it has been hollowed out over the years. There are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair than occupied and in use. You can count the number of restaurants in the county on one hand \u2014 Bunn's Barbecue being my absolute favorite. But in the whole county there is no coffee shop, there's no Internet cafe, there's no movie theater, there's no bookstore. There isn't even a Walmart.Racially, the county is about 60 percent African-American, but what happens in the public schools is most of the privileged white kids go to the private Lawrence Academy. So the public school students are about 86 percent African-American. And this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class, and you can see the difference is pretty stark. So to say that the public education system in Bertie County is struggling would be a huge understatement. There's basically no pool of qualified teachers to pull from, and only eight percent of the people in the county have a bachelor's degree or higher. So there isn't a big legacy in the pride of education. In fact, two years ago, only 27 percent of all the third- through eighth-graders were passing the state standard in both English and math.So it sounds like I'm painting a really bleak picture of this place, but I promise there is good news. The biggest asset, in my opinion, one of the biggest assets in Bertie County right now is this man: This is Dr. Chip Zullinger, fondly known as Dr. Z. He was brought in in October 2007 as the new superintendent to basically fix this broken school system. And he previously was a superintendent in Charleston, South Carolina and then in Denver, Colorado. He started some of the country's first charter schools in the late '80s in the U.S. And he is an absolute renegade and a visionary, and he is the reason that I now live and work there. So in February of 2009, Dr. Zullinger invited us, Project H Design \u2014 which is a non-profit design firm that I founded \u2014 to come to Bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district. And he invited us in particular because we have a very specific type of design process \u2014 one that results in appropriate design solutions in places that don't usually have access to design services or creative capital. Specifically, we use these six design directives, probably the most important being number two: we design with, not for \u2014 in that, when we're doing humanitarian-focused design, it's not about designing for clients anymore. It's about designing with people, and letting appropriate solutions emerge from within.So at the time of being invited down there, we were based in San Francisco, and so we were going back and forth for basically the rest of 2009, spending about half our time in Bertie County. And when I say we, I mean Project H, but more specifically, I mean myself and my partner, Matthew Miller, who's an architect and a sort of MacGyver-type builder. So fast-forward to today, and we now live there. I have strategically cut Matt's head out of this photo, because he would kill me if he knew I was using it because of the sweatsuits. But this is our front porch. We live there. We now call this place home. Over the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth, we realized we had fallen in love with the place. We had fallen in love with the place and the people and the work that we're able to do in a rural place like Bertie County, that, as designers and builders, you can't do everywhere. There's space to experiment and to weld and to test things. We have an amazing advocate in Dr. Zullinger. There's a nobility of real, hands-on, dirt-under-your-fingernails work.But beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there, there is a huge need. There is a total vacuum of creative capital in Bertie County. There isn't a single licensed architect in the whole county. And so we saw an opportunity to bring design as this untouched tool, something that Bertie County didn't otherwise have, and to be sort of the \u2014 to usher that in as a new type of tool in their tool kit. The initial goal became using design within the public education system in partnership with Dr. Zullinger \u2014 that was why we were there. But beyond that, we recognized that Bertie County, as a community, was in dire need of a fresh perspective of pride and connectedness and of the creative capital that they were so much lacking. So the goal became, yes, to apply design within education, but then to figure out how to make education a great vehicle for community development.So in order to do this, we've taken three different approaches to the intersection of design and education. And I should say that these are three things that we've done in Bertie County, but I feel pretty confident that they could work in a lot of other rural communities around the U.S. and maybe even beyond. So the first of the three is design for education. This is the most kind of direct, obvious intersection of the two things. It's the physical construction of improved spaces and materials and experiences for teachers and students. This is in response to the awful mobile trailers and the outdated textbooks and the terrible materials that we're building schools out of these days. And so this played out for us in a couple different ways. The first was a series of renovations of computer labs. So traditionally, the computer labs, particularly in an under-performing school like Bertie County, where they have to benchmark test every other week, the computer lab is a kill-and-drill testing facility. You come in, you face the wall, you take your test and you leave. So we wanted to change the way that students approach technology, to create a more convivial and social space that was more engaging, more accessible, and also to increase the ability for teachers to use these spaces for technology-based instruction. So this is the lab at the high school, and the principal there is in love with this room. Every time he has visitors, it's the first place that he takes them.And this also meant the co-creation with some teachers of this educational playground system called the learning landscape. It allows elementary-level students to learn core subjects through game play and activity and running around and screaming and being a kid. So this game that the kids are playing here \u2014 in this case they were learning basic multiplication through a game called Match Me. And in Match Me, you take the class, divide it into two teams, one team on each side of the playground, and the teacher will take a piece of chalk and just write a number on each of the tires. And then she'll call out a math problem \u2014 so let's say four times four \u2014 and then one student from each team has to compete to figure out that four times four is 16 and find the tire with the 16 on it and sit on it. So the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires and then your team wins. And the impact of the learning landscape has been pretty surprising and amazing. Some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores, a greater comfort level with the material, especially with the boys, that in going outside and playing, they aren't afraid to take on a double-digit multiplication problem \u2014 and also that the teachers are able to use these as assessment tools to better gauge how their students are understanding new material. So with design for education, I think the most important thing is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers, so that they have the incentive and the desire to use them. So this is Mr. Perry. He's the assistant superintendent. He came out for one of our teacher-training days and won like five rounds of Match Me in a row and was very proud of himself.(Laughter)So the second approach is redesigning education itself. This is the most complex. It's a systems-level look at how education is administered and what is being offered and to whom. So in many cases this is not so much about making change as it is creating the conditions under which change is possible and the incentive to want to make change, which is easier said than done in rural communities and in inside-the-box education systems in rural communities. So for us, this was a graphic public campaign called Connect Bertie. There are thousands of these blue dots all over the county. And this was for a fund that the school district had to put a desktop computer and a broadband Internet connection in every home with a child in the public school system. Right now I should say, there are only 10 percent of the houses that actually have an in-home Internet connection. And the only places to get WiFi are in the school buildings, or at the Bojangles Fried Chicken joint, which I find myself squatting outside of a lot. Aside from, you know, getting people excited and wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place, it asked the school system to envision how it might become a catalyst for a more connected community. It asked them to reach outside of the school walls and to think about how they could play a role in the community's development. So the first batch of computers are being installed later this summer, and we're helping Dr. Zullinger develop some strategies around how we might connect the classroom and the home to extend learning beyond the school day.And then the third approach, which is what I'm most excited about, which is where we are now, is: design as education. So \"design as education\" means that we could actually teach design within public schools, and not design-based learning \u2014 not like \"let's learn physics by building a rocket,\" but actually learning design-thinking coupled with real construction and fabrication skills put towards a local community purpose. It also means that designers are no longer consultants, but we're teachers, and we are charged with growing creative capital within the next generation. And what design offers as an educational framework is an antidote to all of the boring, rigid, verbal instruction that so many of these school districts are plagued by. It's hands-on, it's in-your-face, it requires an active engagement, and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning in real ways. So we started thinking about the legacy of shop class and how shop class \u2014 wood and metal shop class in particular \u2014 historically, has been something intended for kids who aren't going to go to college. It's a vocational training path. It's working-class; it's blue-collar. The projects are things like, let's make a birdhouse for your mom for Christmas. And in recent decades, a lot of the funding for shop class has gone away entirely.So we thought, what if you could bring back shop class, but this time orient the projects around things that the community needed, and to infuse shop class with a more critical and creative-design-thinking studio process. So we took this kind of nebulous idea and have worked really closely with Dr. Zullinger for the past year on writing this as a one-year curriculum offered at the high school level to the junior class. And so this starts in four weeks, at the end of the summer, and my partner and I, Matthew and I, just went through the arduous and totally convoluted process of getting certified as high school teachers to actually run it. And this is what it looks like.So over the course of two semesters, the Fall and the Spring, the students spend three hours a day every single day in our 4,500 square foot studio/shop space. And during that time, they're doing everything from going out and doing ethnographic research and doing the need-finding, coming back into the studio, doing the brainstorming and design visualization to come up with concepts that might work, and then moving into the shop and actually testing them, building them, prototyping them, figuring out if they are going to work and refining that. And then over the summer, they're offered a summer job. They're paid as employees of Project H to be the construction crew with us to build these projects in the community. So the first project, which will be built next summer, is an open-air farmers' market downtown, followed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year and home improvements for the elderly in the third year. So these are real visible projects that hopefully the students can point to and say, \"I built that, and I'm proud of it.\"So I want you to meet three of our students. This is Ryan. She is 15 years old. She loves agriculture and wants to be a high school teacher. She wants to go to college, but she wants to come back to Bertie County, because that's where her family is from, where she calls home, and she feels very strongly about giving back to this place that she's been fairly fortunate in. So what Studio H might offer her is a way to develop skills so that she might give back in the most meaningful way.This is Eric. He plays for the football team. He is really into dirtbike racing, and he wants to be an architect. So for him, Studio H offers him a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect, everything from drafting to wood and metal construction to how to do research for a client.And then this is Anthony. He is 16 years old, loves hunting and fishing and being outside and doing anything with his hands, and so for him, Studio H means that he can stay interested in his education through that hands-on engagement. He's interested in forestry, but he isn't sure, so if he ends up not going to college, he will have developed some industry-relevant skills.What design and building really offers to public education is a different kind of classroom. So this building downtown, which may very well become the site of our future farmers' market, is now the classroom. And going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy and from where and why \u2014 that's a homework assignment. And the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the end of the summer when they have built the farmers' market and it's open to the public \u2014 that's the final exam. And for the community, what design and building offers is real, visible, built progress. It's one project per year, and it makes the youth the biggest asset and the biggest untapped resource in imagining a new future.So we recognize that Studio H, especially in its first year, is a small story \u2014 13 students, it's two teachers, it's one project in one place. But we feel like this could work in other places. And I really, strongly believe in the power of the small story, because it is so difficult to do humanitarian work at a global scale. Because, when you zoom out that far, you lose the ability to view people as humans.Ultimately, design itself is a process of constant education for the people that we work with and for and for us as designers. And let's face it, designers, we need to reinvent ourselves. We need to re-educate ourselves around the things that matter, we need to work outside of our comfort zones more, and we need to be better citizens in our own backyard. So while this is a very small story, we hope that it represents a step in the right direction for the future of rural communities and for the future of public education and hopefully also for the future of design.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1002, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nSo this is a story\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nof a place that I now call home.\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nIt's a story of public education\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nand of rural communities\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nand of what design might do to improve both.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nSo this is Bertie County,\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nNorth Carolina, USA.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nTo give you an idea of the \"where:\"\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nSo here's North Carolina, and if we zoom in,\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nBertie County is in the eastern part of the state.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nIt's about two hours east\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\ndriving-time from Raleigh.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nAnd it's very flat.

symptoms.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nIt's the hollowing out of small towns.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nIt's downtowns becoming ghost towns.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nThe brain drain --\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nwhere all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nIt's the dependence on farm subsidies\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nand under-performing schools\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nand higher poverty rates in rural areas\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nthan in urban.\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nAnd Bertie County is no exception to this.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nPerhaps the biggest thing it struggles with,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nlike many communities similar to it,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nis that there's no\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nshared, collective investment\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nin the future of rural communities.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nOnly 6.8 percent of all our philanthropic giving in the U.S. right now\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nbenefits rural communities,\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nand yet 20 percent of our population lives there.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nSo Bertie County is not only very rural; it's incredibly poor.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nIt is the poorest county in the state.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nIt has one in three of its children living in poverty,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nand it's what is referred to as a \"rural ghetto.\"\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nThe economy is mostly agricultural.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nThe biggest crops are cotton and tobacco,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nand we're very proud of our Bertie County peanut.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nThe biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nThe county seat is Windsor.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nThis is like Times Square of Windsor that you're looking at right now.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nIt's home to only 2,000 people,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nand like a lot of other small towns\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nit has been hollowed out over the years.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nThere are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nthan occupied and in use.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nYou can count the number of restaurants in the county\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\non one hand --\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nBunn's Barbecue being my absolute favorite.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nBut in the whole county there is no coffee shop,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nthere's no Internet cafe,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nthere's no movie theater, there's no bookstore.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nThere isn't even a Walmart.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nRacially, the county\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nis about 60 percent African-American,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nbut what happens in the public schools\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nis most of the privileged white kids\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\ngo to the private Lawrence Academy.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nSo the public school students\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nare about 86 percent African-American.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nAnd this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nand you can see the difference is pretty stark.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nSo to say that the public education system\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nin Bertie County is struggling\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nwould be a huge understatement.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nThere's basically no pool\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nof qualified teachers to pull from,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nand only eight percent of the people in the county\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nhave a bachelor's degree or higher.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nSo there isn't a big legacy\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nin the pride of education.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nIn fact, two years ago,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nonly 27 percent of all the third- through eighth-graders\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nwere passing the state standard\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nin both English and math.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nSo it sounds like I'm painting a really bleak picture of this place,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nbut I promise there is good news.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nThe biggest asset, in my opinion,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\none of the biggest assets in Bertie County right now is this man:\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nThis is Dr. Chip Zullinger,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nfondly known as Dr. Z.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nHe was brought in in October 2007\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nas the new superintendent\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nto basically fix this broken school system.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nAnd he previously was a superintendent\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nin Charleston, South Carolina\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nand then in Denver, Colorado.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nHe started some of the country's first charter schools\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nin the late '80s in the U.S.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nAnd he is an absolute renegade and a visionary,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nand he is the reason that I now live and work there.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nSo in February of 2009,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nDr. Zullinger invited us, Project H Design --\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nwhich is a non-profit design firm that I founded --\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nto come to Bertie and to partner with him\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\non the repair of this school district\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nand to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nAnd he invited us in particular\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nbecause we have a very specific\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\ntype of design process --\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\none that results in appropriate design solutions\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nin places that don't usually have access\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nto design services or creative capital.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nSpecifically, we use these six design directives,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nprobably the most important being number two:\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nwe design with, not for --\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nin that, when we're doing humanitarian-focused design,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nit's not about designing for clients anymore.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nIt's about designing with people,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nand letting appropriate solutions emerge from within.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nSo at the time of being invited down there,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nwe were based in San Francisco,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nand so we were going back and forth\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nfor basically the rest of 2009,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nspending about half our time in Bertie County.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nAnd when I say we, I mean Project H,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nbut more specifically, I mean myself and my partner, Matthew Miller,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nwho's an architect and a sort of MacGyver-type builder.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nSo fast-forward to today, and we now live there.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nI have strategically cut Matt's head out of this photo,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nbecause he would kill me if he knew I was using it\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nbecause of the sweatsuits.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nBut this is our front porch. We live there.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nWe now call this place home.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nOver the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth,\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nwe realized we had fallen in love with the place.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nWe had fallen in love with the place and the people\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nand the work that we're able to do\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nin a rural place like Bertie County,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nthat, as designers and builders,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nyou can't do everywhere.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nThere's space to experiment\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nand to weld and to test things.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nWe have an amazing advocate in Dr. Zullinger.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nThere's a nobility of real, hands-on,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\ndirt-under-your-fingernails work.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nBut beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nthere is a huge need.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nThere is a total vacuum of creative capital in Bertie County.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nThere isn't a single licensed architect in the whole county.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nAnd so we saw an opportunity\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nto bring design as this untouched tool,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nsomething that Bertie County didn't otherwise have,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nand to be sort of the -- to usher that in\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nas a new type of tool in their tool kit.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nThe initial goal became using design\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nwithin the public education system in partnership with Dr. Zullinger --\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nthat was why we were there.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nBut beyond that, we recognized\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nthat Bertie County, as a community,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nwas in dire need of a fresh perspective\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nof pride and connectedness\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nand of the creative capital\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nthat they were so much lacking.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nSo the goal became, yes, to apply design within education,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nbut then to figure out how to make education\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\na great vehicle for community development.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nSo in order to do this, we've taken three different approaches\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nto the intersection of design and education.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nAnd I should say that these are three things that we've done in Bertie County,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nbut I feel pretty confident that they could work\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nin a lot of other rural communities\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\naround the U.S. and maybe even beyond.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nSo the first of the three is design for education.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nThis is the most kind of direct, obvious\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nintersection of the two things.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nIt's the physical construction\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nof improved spaces and materials and experiences\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nfor teachers and students.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nThis is in response to the awful mobile trailers\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nand the outdated textbooks\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nand the terrible materials that we're building schools out of these days.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nAnd so this played out for us in a couple different ways.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nThe first was a series of renovations of computer labs.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nSo traditionally, the computer labs,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nparticularly in an under-performing school like Bertie County,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nwhere they have to benchmark test every other week,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nthe computer lab is a kill-and-drill\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\ntesting facility.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nYou come in, you face the wall, you take your test and you leave.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nSo we wanted to change the way that students approach technology,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nto create a more convivial and social space\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nthat was more engaging, more accessible,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nand also to increase the ability for teachers\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nto use these spaces for technology-based instruction.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nSo this is the lab at the high school,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nand the principal there is in love with this room.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nEvery time he has visitors, it's the first place that he takes them.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd this also meant the co-creation with some teachers\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nof this educational playground system\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\ncalled the learning landscape.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nIt allows elementary-level students to learn core subjects\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nthrough game play and activity\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nand running around and screaming and being a kid.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nSo this game that the kids are playing here --\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nin this case they were learning basic multiplication\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nthrough a game called Match Me.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nAnd in Match Me, you take the class, divide it into two teams,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\none team on each side of the playground,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nand the teacher will take a piece of chalk\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nand just write a number on each of the tires.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nAnd then she'll call out a math problem --\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nso let's say four times four --\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nand then one student from each team has to compete\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nto figure out that four times four is 16\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nand find the tire with the 16 on it and sit on it.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nSo the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nand then your team wins.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nAnd the impact of the learning landscape\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nhas been pretty surprising and amazing.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nSome of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\na greater comfort level with the material,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nespecially with the boys,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nthat in going outside and playing,\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nthey aren't afraid to take on\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\na double-digit multiplication problem --\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nand also that the teachers are able\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nto use these as assessment tools\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nto better gauge how their students\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nare understanding new material.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nSo with design for education, I think the most important thing\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nis to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nso that they have the incentive and the desire to use them.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nSo this is Mr. Perry. He's the assistant superintendent.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nHe came out for one of our teacher-training days\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nand won like five rounds of Match Me in a row and was very proud of himself.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nSo the second approach is redesigning education itself.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nThis is the most complex.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nIt's a systems-level look\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nat how education is administered\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nand what is being offered and to whom.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nSo in many cases this is not so much about making change\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nas it is creating the conditions\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nunder which change is possible\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nand the incentive to want to make change,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nwhich is easier said than done in rural communities\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nand in inside-the-box education systems\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nin rural communities.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nSo for us, this was a graphic public campaign\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\ncalled Connect Bertie.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nThere are thousands of these blue dots all over the county.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nAnd this was for a fund that the school district had\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nto put a desktop computer and a broadband Internet connection\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nin every home\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nwith a child in the public school system.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nRight now I should say,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nthere are only 10 percent of the houses\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nthat actually have an in-home Internet connection.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nAnd the only places to get WiFi\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nare in the school buildings, or at the Bojangles Fried Chicken joint,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nwhich I find myself squatting outside of a lot.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nAside from, you know, getting people excited\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nand wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nit asked the school system\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nto envision how it might become a catalyst\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nfor a more connected community.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nIt asked them to reach outside of the school walls\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nand to think about how they could play a role\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nin the community's development.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nSo the first batch of computers\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nare being installed later this summer,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nand we're helping Dr. Zullinger develop some strategies\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\naround how we might connect the classroom and the home\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nto extend learning beyond the school day.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nAnd then the third approach, which is what I'm most excited about,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nwhich is where we are now,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nis: design as education.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nSo \"design as education\" means\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nthat we could actually teach design within public schools,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nand not design-based learning --\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nnot like \"let's learn physics by building a rocket,\"\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nbut actually learning design-thinking\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\ncoupled with real construction and fabrication skills\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nput towards a local community purpose.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nIt also means that designers are no longer consultants,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nbut we're teachers,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nand we are charged with growing creative capital\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nwithin the next generation.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nAnd what design offers as an educational framework\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nis an antidote\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nto all of the boring, rigid, verbal instruction\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nthat so many of these school districts are plagued by.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nIt's hands-on, it's in-your-face,\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nit requires an active engagement,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nand it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nin real ways.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nSo we started thinking\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nabout the legacy of shop class\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nand how shop class -- wood and metal shop class in particular --\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nhistorically, has been something\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nintended for kids who aren't going to go to college.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nIt's a vocational training path.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nIt's working-class; it's blue-collar.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nThe projects are things like,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nlet's make a birdhouse for your mom for Christmas.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nAnd in recent decades, a lot of the funding for shop class\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nhas gone away entirely.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nSo we thought, what if you could bring back shop class,\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nbut this time orient the projects\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\naround things that the community needed,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nand to infuse shop class\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nwith a more critical and creative-design-thinking studio process.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nSo we took this kind of nebulous idea\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nand have worked really closely with Dr. Zullinger for the past year\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\non writing this as a one-year curriculum\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\noffered at the high school level to the junior class.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nAnd so this starts in four weeks,\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nat the end of the summer,\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nand my partner and I, Matthew and I,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\njust went through the arduous and totally convoluted process\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nof getting certified as high school teachers to actually run it.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nAnd this is what it looks like.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nSo over the course of two semesters,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nthe Fall and the Spring,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nthe students spend three hours a day every single day\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nin our 4,500 square foot\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nstudio/shop space.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nAnd during that time, they're doing everything\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nfrom going out and doing ethnographic research and doing the need-finding,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\ncoming back into the studio,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\ndoing the brainstorming and design visualization\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nto come up with concepts that might work,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nand then moving into the shop and actually testing them,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nbuilding them, prototyping them,\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nfiguring out if they are going to work and refining that.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nAnd then over the summer, they're offered a summer job.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nThey're paid as employees of Project H\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nto be the construction crew with us\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nto build these projects in the community.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nSo the first project, which will be built next summer,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nis an open-air farmers' market downtown,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nfollowed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nand home improvements for the elderly in the third year.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nSo these are real visible projects\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nthat hopefully the students can point to and say,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\n\"I built that, and I'm proud of it.\"\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nSo I want you to meet three of our students.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nThis is Ryan.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nShe is 15 years old.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nShe loves agriculture and wants to be a high school teacher.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nShe wants to go to college, but she wants to come back to Bertie County,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nbecause that's where her family is from, where she calls home,\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nand she feels very strongly about giving back\n\n00:14:01.958

These are not normally the most cheerful of topics, nor do they generally generate the kind of good news that this conference is about. Yet, not only is there at least some good news to be told about fewer such conflicts now than two decades ago, but what is perhaps more important is that we also have come to a much better understanding of what can be done to further reduce the number of ethnic conflicts and civil wars and the suffering that they inflict. Three things stand out: leadership, diplomacy and institutional design. What I will focus on in my talk is why they matter, how they matter, and what we can all do to make sure that they continue to matter in the right ways, that is, how all of us can contribute to developing and honing the skills of local and global leaders to make peace and to make it last. But let's start at the beginning.Civil wars have made news headlines for many decades now, and ethnic conflicts in particular have been a near constant presence as a major international security threat. For nearly two decades now, the news has been bad and the images have been haunting. In Georgia, after years of stalemate, we saw a full-scale resurgence of violence in August, 2008. This quickly escalated into a five-day war between Russia and Georgia, leaving Georgia ever more divided. In Kenya, contested presidential elections in 2007 \u2014 we just heard about them \u2014 quickly led to high levels of inter-ethnic violence and the killing and displacement of thousands of people. In Sri Lanka, a decades-long civil war between the Tamil minority and the Sinhala majority led to a bloody climax in 2009, after perhaps as many as 100,000 people had been killed since 1983. In Kyrgyzstan, just over the last few weeks, unprecedented levels of violence occurred between ethnic Kyrgyz and ethnic Uzbeks. Hundreds have been killed, and more than 100,000 displaced, including many ethnic Uzbeks who fled to neighboring Uzbekistan. In the Middle East, conflict between Israelis and Palestinians continues unabated, and it becomes ever more difficult to see how, just how a possible, sustainable solution can be achieved. Darfur may have slipped from the news headlines, but the killing and displacement there continues as well, and the sheer human misery that it creates is very hard to fathom. And in Iraq, finally, violence is on the rise again, and the country has yet to form a government four months after its last parliamentary elections.But hang on, this talk is to be about the good news. So are these now the images of the past? Well, notwithstanding the gloomy pictures from the Middle East, Darfur, Iraq, elsewhere, there is a longer-term trend that does represent some good news. Over the past two decades, since the end of the Cold War, there has been an overall decline in the number of civil wars. Since the high in the early 1990s, with about 50 such civil wars ongoing, we now have 30 percent fewer such conflicts today. The number of people killed in civil wars also is much lower today than it was a decade ago or two. But this trend is less unambiguous. The highest level of deaths on the battlefield was recorded between 1998 and 2001, with about 80,000 soldiers, policemen and rebels killed every year. The lowest number of combatant casualties occurred in 2003, with just 20,000 killed. Despite the up and down since then, the overall trend \u2014 and this is the important bit \u2014 clearly points downward for the past two decades.The news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be. From over 12,000 civilians deliberately killed in civil wars in 1997 and 1998, a decade later, this figure stands at 4,000. This is a decrease by two-thirds. This decline would be even more obvious if we factored in the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. But then 800,000 civilians were slaughtered in a matter of just a few months. This certainly is an accomplishment that must never be surpassed. What is also important is to note that these figures only tell part of the story. They exclude people that died as a consequence of civil war, from hunger or disease, for example. And they also do not properly account for civilian suffering more generally. Torture, rape and ethnic cleansing have become highly effective, if often non-lethal, weapons in civil war. To put it differently, for the civilians that suffer the consequences of ethnic conflict and civil war, there is no good war and there is no bad peace. Thus, even though every civilian killed, maimed, raped, or tortured is one too many, the fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago, is good news.So, we have fewer conflicts today in which fewer people get killed. And the big question, of course, is why? In some cases, there is a military victory of one side. This is a solution of sorts, but rarely is it one that comes without human costs or humanitarian consequences. The defeat of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka is perhaps the most recent example of this, but we have seen similar so-called military solutions in the Balkans, in the South Caucasus and across most of Africa. At times, they are complimented by negotiated settlements, or at least cease-fire agreements, and peacekeepers are deployed. But hardly ever do they represent a resounding success \u2014 Bosnia and Herzegovina perhaps more so than Georgia. But for many parts of Africa, a colleague of mine once put it this way, \"The cease-fire on Tuesday night was reached just in time for the genocide to start on Wednesday morning.\"But let's look at the good news again. If there's no solution on the battlefield, three factors can account for the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war, or for sustainable peace afterwards: leadership, diplomacy and institutional design. Take the example of Northern Ireland. Despite centuries of animosity, decades of violence and thousands of people killed, 1998 saw the conclusion of an historic agreement. Its initial version was skillfully mediated by Senator George Mitchell. Crucially, for the long-term success of the peace process in Northern Ireland, he imposed very clear conditions for the participation and negotiations. Central among them, a commitment to exclusively peaceful means. Subsequent revisions of the agreement were facilitated by the British and Irish governments, who never wavered in their determination to bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland.The core institutions that were put in place in 1998 and their modifications in 2006 and 2008 were highly innovative and allowed all conflict parties to see their core concerns and demands addressed. The agreement combines a power-sharing arrangement in Northern Ireland with cross-border institutions that link Belfast and Dublin and thus recognizes the so-called Irish dimension of the conflict. And significantly, there's also a clear focus on both the rights of individuals and the rights of communities. The provisions in the agreement may be complex, but so is the underlying conflict. Perhaps most importantly, local leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise, not always fast and not always enthusiastically, but rise in the end they did. Who ever could have imagined Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness jointly governing Northern Ireland as First and Deputy First Minister?But then, is Northern Ireland a unique example, or does this kind of explanation only hold more generally in democratic and developed countries? By no means. The ending of Liberia's long-lasting civil war in 2003 illustrates the importance of leadership, diplomacy and institutional design as much as the successful prevention of a full-scale civil war in Macedonia in 2001, or the successful ending of the conflict in Aceh in Indonesia in 2005. In all three cases, local leaders were willing and able to make peace, the international community stood ready to help them negotiate and implement an agreement, and the institutions have lived up to the promise that they held on the day they were agreed.Focusing on leadership, diplomacy and institutional design also helps explain failures to achieve peace, or to make it last. The hopes that were vested in the Oslo Accords did not lead to an end of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. Not all the issues that needed to be resolved were actually covered in the agreements. Rather, local leaders committed to revisiting them later on. Yet instead of grasping this opportunity, local and international leaders soon disengaged and became distracted by the second Intifada, the events of 9/11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.The comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan signed in 2005 turned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged, and its provisions may yet bear the seeds of a full-scale return to war between north and south. Changes and shortcomings in leadership, more off than on international diplomacy and institutional failures account for this in almost equal measure. Unresolved boundary issues, squabbles over oil revenues, the ongoing conflict in Darfur, escalating tribal violence in the south and generally weak state capacity across all of Sudan complete a very depressing picture of the state of affairs in Africa's largest country.A final example: Kosovo. The failure to achieve a negotiated solution for Kosovo and the violence, tension and de facto partition that resulted from it have their reasons in many, many different factors. Central among them are three. First, the intransigence of local leaders to settle for nothing less than their maximum demands. Second, an international diplomatic effort that was hampered from the beginning by Western support for Kosovo's independence. And third, a lack of imagination when it came to designing institutions that could have addressed the concerns of Serbs and Albanians alike. By the same token \u2014 and here we have some good news again \u2014 the very fact that there is a high-level, well-resourced international presence in Kosovo and the Balkans region more generally and the fact that local leaders on both sides have showed relative restraint, explains why things have not been worse over the past two years since 2008.So even in situations where outcomes are less than optimal, local leaders and international leaders have a choice, and they can make a difference for the better. A cold war is not as good as a cold peace, but a cold peace is still better than a hot war. Good news is also about learning the right lesson. So what then distinguishes the Israeli/Palestinian conflict from that in Northern Ireland, or the civil war in Sudan from that in Liberia? Both successes and failures teach us several critically important things that we need to bear in mind if we want the good news to continue. First, leadership. In the same way in which ethnic conflict and civil war are not natural but man-made disasters, their prevention and settlement does not happen automatically either. Leadership needs to be capable, determined and visionary in its commitment to peace. Leaders need to connect to each other and to their followers, and they need to bring them along on what is an often arduous journey into a peaceful future.Second, diplomacy. Diplomacy needs to be well resourced, sustained, and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures on leaders and followers. It needs to help them reach an equitable compromise, and it needs to ensure that a broad coalition of local, regional and international supporters help them implement their agreement.Third, institutional design. Institutional design requires a keen focus on issues, innovative thinking and flexible and well-funded implementation. Conflict parties need to move away from maximum demands and towards a compromise that recognizes each other's needs. And they need to think about the substance of their agreement much more than about the labels they want to attach to them. Conflict parties also need to be prepared to return to the negotiation table if the agreement implementation stalls.For me personally, the most critical lesson of all is this: Local commitment to peace is all-important, but it is often not enough to prevent or end violence. Yet, no amount of diplomacy or institutional design can make up for local failures and the consequences that they have. Therefore, we must invest in developing leaders, leaders that have the skills, vision and determination to make peace. Leaders, in other words, that people will trust and that they will want to follow even if that means making hard choices.A final thought: Ending civil wars is a process that is fraught with dangers, frustrations and setbacks. It often takes a generation to accomplish, but it also requires us, today's generation, to take responsibility and to learn the right lessons about leadership, diplomacy and institutional design, so that the child soldiers of today can become the children of tomorrow.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1003, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 -->

00:03:01.958\nand it becomes ever more difficult\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nto see how, just how\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\na possible, sustainable solution\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\ncan be achieved.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nDarfur may have slipped from the news headlines,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nbut the killing and displacement there\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\ncontinues as well,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nand the sheer human misery that it creates\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nis very hard to fathom.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nAnd in Iraq, finally,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nviolence is on the rise again,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nand the country has yet to form a government\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nfour months after\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nits last parliamentary elections.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nBut hang on, this talk is to be about the good news.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nSo are these now the images of the past?\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nWell, notwithstanding the gloomy pictures\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nfrom the Middle East, Darfur,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nIraq, elsewhere,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nthere is a longer-term trend\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthat does represent some good news.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nOver the past two decades, since the end of the Cold War,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nthere has been an overall decline\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nin the number of civil wars.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nSince the high in the early 1990s,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nwith about 50 such civil wars ongoing,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nwe now have 30 percent fewer\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nsuch conflicts today.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nThe number of people killed in civil wars\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nalso is much lower today\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nthan it was a decade ago or two.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nBut this trend is less unambiguous.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nThe highest level of deaths on the battlefield\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nwas recorded between 1998 and 2001,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nwith about 80,000 soldiers, policemen and rebels\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nkilled every year.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nThe lowest number of combatant casualties\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\noccurred in 2003,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nwith just 20,000 killed.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nDespite the up and down since then,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nthe overall trend --\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nand this is the important bit --\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nclearly points downward\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nfor the past two decades.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nThe news about civilian casualties\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nis also less bad than it used to be.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nFrom over 12,000 civilians\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\ndeliberately killed in civil wars\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nin 1997 and 1998,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\na decade later,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nthis figure stands at 4,000.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nThis is a decrease by two-thirds.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nThis decline would be even more obvious\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nif we factored in the genocide in Rwanda\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nin 1994.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nBut then 800,000 civilians were slaughtered\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nin a matter of just a few months.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nThis certainly is an accomplishment\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nthat must never be surpassed.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nWhat is also important is to note\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nthat these figures only tell part of the story.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nThey exclude people\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nthat died as a consequence of civil war,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nfrom hunger or disease, for example.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nAnd they also do not properly account\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nfor civilian suffering more generally.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nTorture, rape and ethnic cleansing\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nhave become highly effective,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nif often non-lethal, weapons in civil war.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nTo put it differently,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nfor the civilians that suffer the consequences\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nof ethnic conflict and civil war,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthere is no good war\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nand there is no bad peace.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nThus, even though every civilian killed,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nmaimed, raped, or tortured is one too many,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nthe fact that the number\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nof civilian casualties\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nis clearly lower today\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nthan it was a decade ago,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nis good news.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nSo, we have fewer conflicts today\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nin which fewer people get killed.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nAnd the big question, of course,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nis why?\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nIn some cases,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nthere is a military victory of one side.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nThis is a solution of sorts,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nbut rarely is it one\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nthat comes without human costs\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nor humanitarian consequences.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nThe defeat of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nis perhaps the most recent example of this,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nbut we have seen similar\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nso-called military solutions\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nin the Balkans, in the South Caucasus\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nand across most of Africa.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nAt times, they are complimented\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nby negotiated settlements,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nor at least cease-fire agreements,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nand peacekeepers are deployed.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nBut hardly ever do they represent\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\na resounding success --\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nBosnia and Herzegovina\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nperhaps more so than Georgia.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nBut for many parts of Africa,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\na colleague of mine once put it this way,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\n\"The cease-fire on Tuesday night\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nwas reached just in time\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nfor the genocide to start on Wednesday morning.\"\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nBut let's look at the good news again.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nIf there's no solution on the battlefield,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nthree factors can account\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nfor the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nor for sustainable peace afterwards:\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nleadership, diplomacy\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nand institutional design.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nTake the example of Northern Ireland.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nDespite centuries of animosity,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\ndecades of violence\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nand thousands of people killed,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\n1998 saw the conclusion\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nof an historic agreement.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nIts initial version was skillfully mediated\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nby Senator George Mitchell.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nCrucially, for the long-term success\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nof the peace process in Northern Ireland,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nhe imposed very clear conditions\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nfor the participation and negotiations.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nCentral among them,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\na commitment\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nto exclusively peaceful means.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nSubsequent revisions of the agreement\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nwere facilitated by the British and Irish governments,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nwho never wavered in their determination\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nto bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nThe core institutions\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nthat were put in place in 1998\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nand their modifications\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nin 2006 and 2008\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nwere highly innovative\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nand allowed all conflict parties\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nto see their core concerns and demands addressed.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nThe agreement combines a power-sharing arrangement\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nin Northern Ireland\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nwith cross-border institutions\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nthat link Belfast and Dublin\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nand thus recognizes\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nthe so-called Irish dimension of the conflict.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nAnd significantly,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nthere's also a clear focus\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\non both the rights of individuals\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nand the rights of communities.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nThe provisions in the agreement may be complex,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nbut so is the underlying conflict.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nPerhaps most importantly,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nlocal leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nnot always fast\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nand not always enthusiastically,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nbut rise in the end they did.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nWho ever could have imagined\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nIan Paisley and Martin McGuinness\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\njointly governing Northern Ireland\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nas First and Deputy First Minister?\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nBut then, is Northern Ireland a unique example,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nor does this kind of explanation\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nonly hold more generally\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nin democratic and developed countries?\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nBy no means.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nThe ending of Liberia's long-lasting civil war\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nin 2003\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nillustrates the importance\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nof leadership, diplomacy\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nand institutional design\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nas much as the successful prevention\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nof a full-scale civil war\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nin Macedonia in 2001,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nor the successful ending\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nof the conflict in Aceh in Indonesia in 2005.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nIn all three cases,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nlocal leaders were willing and able\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nto make peace,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nthe international community stood ready\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nto help them negotiate and implement an agreement,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nand the institutions have lived up\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nto the promise that they held\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\non the day they were agreed.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nFocusing on leadership, diplomacy\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nand institutional design\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nalso helps explain failures to achieve peace,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nor to make it last.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nThe hopes that were vested in the Oslo Accords\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\ndid not lead to an end\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nof the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nNot all the issues that needed to be resolved\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nwere actually covered in the agreements.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nRather, local leaders committed\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nto revisiting them later on.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nYet instead of grasping this opportunity,\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nlocal and international leaders\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nsoon disengaged\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nand became distracted\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nby the second Intifada, the events of 9/11\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nand the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nThe comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nsigned in 2005\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nturned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nand its provisions may yet bear the seeds\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nof a full-scale return to war\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nbetween north and south.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nChanges and shortcomings in leadership,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nmore off than on international diplomacy\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nand institutional failures\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\naccount for this\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nin almost equal measure.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nUnresolved boundary issues, squabbles over oil revenues,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nthe ongoing conflict in Darfur,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nescalating tribal violence in the south\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nand generally weak state capacity\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nacross all of Sudan\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\ncomplete a very depressing picture\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nof the state of affairs\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nin Africa's largest country.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nA final example: Kosovo.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nThe failure to achieve\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\na negotiated solution for Kosovo\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand the violence, tension\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nand de facto partition that resulted from it\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nhave their reasons\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nin many, many different factors.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nCentral among them are three.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nFirst, the intransigence of local leaders\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nto settle for nothing less\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nthan their maximum demands.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nSecond, an international diplomatic effort\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nthat was hampered from the beginning\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nby Western support for Kosovo's independence.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nAnd third, a lack of imagination\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nwhen it came to designing institutions\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nthat could have addressed the concerns\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nof Serbs and Albanians alike.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nBy the same token --\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nand here we have some good news again --\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nthe very fact that there is a high-level,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nwell-resourced international presence\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nin Kosovo\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nand the Balkans region more generally\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nand the fact that local leaders on both sides\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nhave showed relative restraint,\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nexplains why things have not been worse\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nover the past two years since 2008.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nSo even in situations\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nwhere outcomes are less than optimal,\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nlocal leaders\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nand international leaders have a choice,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nand they can make a difference for the better.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nA cold war\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nis not as good\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nas a cold peace,\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nbut a cold peace\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nis still better than a hot war.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nGood news is also about learning the right lesson.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nSo what then distinguishes\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nthe Israeli/Palestinian conflict\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nfrom that in Northern Ireland,\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nor the civil war in Sudan\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nfrom that in Liberia?\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nBoth successes and failures\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nteach us several critically important things\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nthat we need to bear in mind\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nif we want the good news to continue.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nFirst, leadership.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nIn the same way in which ethnic conflict and civil war\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nare not natural\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nbut man-made disasters,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\ntheir prevention and settlement\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\ndoes not happen automatically either.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nLeadership needs to be capable,\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\ndetermined and visionary\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nin its commitment to peace.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nLeaders need to connect to each other\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nand to their followers,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nand they need to bring them along\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\non what is an often arduous journey\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\ninto a peaceful future.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nSecond, diplomacy.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nDiplomacy needs to be well resourced,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nsustained,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nand apply the right mix of incentives and pressures\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\non leaders and followers.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nIt needs to help them reach an equitable compromise,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nand it needs to ensure\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nthat a broad coalition\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nof local, regional\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nand international supporters\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nhelp them implement their agreement.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nThird, institutional design.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nInstitutional design requires\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\na keen focus on issues,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\ninnovative thinking\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nand flexible and well-funded implementation.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nConflict parties need to move away\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nfrom maximum demands\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nand towards a compromise\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nthat recognizes each other's needs.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nAnd they need to think\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nabout the substance of their agreement\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nmuch more than about\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nthe labels they want to attach to them.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nConflict parties also need to be prepared\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nto return to the negotiation table\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nif the agreement implementation stalls.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nFor me personally,\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nthe most critical lesson of all is this:\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nLocal commitment to peace\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nis all-important,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nbut it is often not enough\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nto prevent or end violence.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nYet, no amount of diplomacy\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nor institutional design\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\ncan make up for local failures\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nand the consequences that they have.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nTherefore, we must invest\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nin developing leaders,\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nleaders that have the skills,\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nvision and determination\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nto make peace.\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nLeaders, in other words,\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nthat people will trust\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nand that they will want to follow\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.958\neven if that means\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nmaking hard choices.\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nA final thought:\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nEnding civil wars\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nis a process that is fraught with dangers,\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nfrustrations and setbacks.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nIt often takes a generation to accomplish,\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nbut it also requires us, today's generation,\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nto take responsibility\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nand to learn the right lessons\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nabout leadership, diplomacy\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nand institutional design,\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nso that the child soldiers of today\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.958\ncan become the children of tomorrow.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nThank you.\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:25.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "America's native prisoners of war", "duration": "927", "url":

Many of you may have heard of the Lakota, or at least the larger group of tribes, called the Sioux. The Lakota are one of many tribes that were moved off their land to prisoner-of-war camps, now called reservations. The Pine Ridge Reservation, the subject of today's slide show, is located about 75 miles southeast of the Black Hills in South Dakota. It is sometimes referred to as Prisoner of War Camp Number 334, and it is where the Lakota now live. Now, if any of you have ever heard of AIM, the American Indian Movement, or of Russell Means, or Leonard Peltier, or of the standoff at Oglala, then you know Pine Ridge is ground zero for Native issues in the US.So I've been asked to talk a little bit today about my relationship with the Lakota, and that's a very difficult one for me, because, if you haven't noticed from my skin color, I'm white, and that is a huge barrier on a Native reservation. You'll see a lot of people in my photographs today. I've become very close with them, and they've welcomed me like family. They've called me \"brother\" and \"uncle,\" and invited me again and again over five years. But on Pine Ridge, I will always be what is called \"wasichu.\" \"Wasichu\" is a Lakota word that means \"non-Indian,\" but another version of this word means \"the one who takes the best meat for himself.\" And that's what I want to focus on \u2014 the one who takes the best part of the meat. It means \"greedy.\"So take a look around this auditorium today. We are at a private school in the American West, sitting in red velvet chairs with money in our pockets. And if we look at our lives, we have indeed taken the best part of the meat. So let's look today at a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could gain, and know that when you see these people's faces, that these are not just images of the Lakota; they stand for all indigenous people.On this piece of paper is the history the way I learned it from my Lakota friends and family. The following is a time line of treaties made, treaties broken and massacres disguised as battles. I'll begin in 1824. What is known as the Bureau of Indian Affairs was created within the War Department, setting an early tone of aggression in our dealings with the Native Americans.1851: The first treaty of Fort Laramie was made, clearly marking the boundaries of the Lakota Nation. According to the treaty, those lands are a sovereign nation. If the boundaries of this treaty had held \u2014 and there is a legal basis that they should \u2014 then this is what the US would look like today. Ten years later. The Homestead Act, signed by President Lincoln, unleashed a flood of white settlers into Native lands.1863: An uprising of Santee Sioux in Minnesota ends with the hanging of 38 Sioux men, the largest mass execution in US history. The execution was ordered by President Lincoln, only two days after he signed the Emancipation Proclamation.1866: The beginning of the Transcontinental Railroad \u2014 a new era. We appropriated land for trails and trains to shortcut through the heart of the Lakota Nation. The treaties were out the window. In response, three tribes led by the Lakota chief Red Cloud attacked and defeated the US army, many times over. I want to repeat that part: The Lakota defeat the US army.1868: The second Fort Laramie Treaty clearly guarantees the sovereignty of the Great Sioux Nation and the Lakotas' ownership of the sacred Black Hills. The government also promises land and hunting rights in the surrounding states. We promise that the Powder River country will henceforth be closed to all whites. The treaty seemed to be a complete victory for Red Cloud and the Sioux. In fact, this is the only war in American history in which the government negotiated a peace by conceding everything demanded by the enemy.1869: The Transcontinental Railroad was completed. It began carrying, among other things, large numbers of hunters, who began the wholesale killing of buffalo, eliminating a source of food, clothing and shelter for the Sioux.1871: The Indian Appropriation Act makes all Indians wards of the federal government. In addition, the military issued orders forbidding western Indians from leaving reservations. All western Indians at that point in time were now prisoners of war. Also in 1871, we ended the time of treaty-making. The problem with treaties is they allow tribes to exist as sovereign nations, and we can't have that. We had plans.1874: General George Custer announced the discovery of gold in Lakota territory, specifically the Black Hills. The news of gold creates a massive influx of white settlers into Lakota Nation. Custer recommends that Congress find a way to end the treaties with the Lakota as soon as possible.1875: The Lakota war begins over the violation of the Fort Laramie Treaty. 1876: On July 26th, on its way to attack a Lakota village, Custer's 7th Cavalry was crushed at the battle of Little Big Horn. 1877: The great Lakota warrior and chief named Crazy Horse surrendered at Fort Robinson. He was later killed while in custody. 1877 is also the year we found a way to get around the Fort Laramie Treaties. A new agreement was presented to Sioux chiefs and their leading men, under a campaign known as \"Sell or Starve\" \u2014 sign the paper, or no food for your tribe. Only 10 percent of the adult male population signed. The Fort Laramie Treaty called for at least three-quarters of the tribe to sign away land. That clause was obviously ignored.1887: The Dawes Act. Communal ownership of reservation lands ends. Reservations are cut up into 160-acre sections, and distributed to individual Indians with the surplus disposed of. Tribes lost millions of acres. The American dream of individual land ownership turned out to be a very clever way to divide the reservation until nothing was left. The move destroyed the reservations, making it easier to further subdivide and to sell with every passing generation. Most of the surplus land and many of the plots within reservation boundaries are now in the hands of white ranchers. Once again, the fat of the land goes to wasichu.1890: A date I believe to be the most important in this slide show. This is the year of the Wounded Knee Massacre. On December 29, US troops surrounded a Sioux encampment at Wounded Knee Creek, and massacred Chief Big Foot and 300 prisoners of war, using a new rapid-fire weapon that fired exploding shells, called a Hotchkiss gun. For this so-called \"battle,\" 20 Congressional Medals of Honor for Valor were given to the 7th Cavalry. To this day, this is the most Medals of Honor ever awarded for a single battle. More Medals of Honor were given for the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children than for any battle in World War One, World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq or Afghanistan.The Wounded Knee Massacre is considered the end of the Indian wars. Whenever I visit the site of the mass grave at Wounded Knee, I see it not just as a grave for the Lakota or for the Sioux, but as a grave for all indigenous peoples. The holy man Black Elk, said, \"I did not know then how much was ended. When I look back now from this high hill of my old age, I can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch, as plain as when I saw them with eyes still young. And I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud and was buried in the blizzard. A people's dream died there. And it was a beautiful dream.\"With this event, a new era in Native American history began. Everything can be measured before Wounded Knee and after, because it was in this moment, with the fingers on the triggers of the Hotchkiss guns, that the US government openly declared its position on Native rights. They were tired of treaties. They were tired of sacred hills. They were tired of ghost dances. And they were tired of all the inconveniences of the Sioux. So they brought out their cannons. \"You want to be an Indian now?\" they said, finger on the trigger.1900: the US Indian population reached its low point \u2014 less than 250,000, compared to an estimated eight million in 1492.Fast-forward. 1980: The longest-running court case in US history, the Sioux Nation versus the United States, was ruled upon by the US Supreme Court. The court determined that when the Sioux were resettled onto reservations and seven million acres of their land were opened up to prospectors and homesteaders, the terms of the second Fort Laramie Treaty had been violated. The court stated that the Black Hills were illegally taken, and that the initial offering price, plus interest, should be paid to the Sioux Nation. As payment for the Black Hills, the court awarded only 106 million dollars to the Sioux Nation. The Sioux refused the money with the rallying cry, \"The Black Hills are not for sale.\"2010: Statistics about Native population today, more than a century after the massacre at Wounded Knee, reveal the legacy of colonization, forced migration and treaty violations. Unemployment on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation fluctuates between 85 and 90 percent. The housing office is unable to build new structures, and existing structures are falling apart. Many are homeless, and those with homes are packed into rotting buildings with up to five families. Thirty-nine percent of homes on Pine Ridge have no electricity. At least 60 percent of the homes on the reservation are infested with black mold. More than 90 percent of the population lives below the federal poverty line. The tuberculosis rate on Pine Ridge is approximately eight times higher than the US national average. The infant mortality rate is the highest on this continent, and is about three times higher than the US national average. Cervical cancer is five times higher than the US national average. The school dropout rate is up to 70 percent. Teacher turnover is eight times higher than the US national average. Frequently, grandparents are raising their grandchildren because parents, due to alcoholism, domestic violence and general apathy, cannot raise them. Fifty percent of the population over the age of 40 suffers from diabetes. The life expectancy for men is between 46 and 48 years old \u2014 roughly the same as in Afghanistan and Somalia.The last chapter in any successful genocide is the one in which the oppressor can remove their hands and say, \"My god \u2014 what are these people doing to themselves? They're killing each other. They're killing themselves while we watch them die.\" This is how we came to own these United States. This is the legacy of Manifest Destiny. Prisoners are still born into prisoner of war camps, long after the guards are gone. These are the bones left after the best meat has been taken.A long time ago, a series of events was set in motion by a people who look like me, by wasichu, eager to take the land and the water and the gold in the hills. Those events led to a domino effect that has yet to end.As removed as we, the dominant society, may feel from a massacre in 1890, or a series of broken treaties 150 years ago, I still have to ask you the question: How should you feel about the statistics of today? What is the connection between these images of suffering and the history that I just read to you? And how much of this history do you need to own, even? Is any of this your responsibility today? I have been told that there must be something we can do. There must be some call to action. Because for so long, I've been standing on the sidelines, content to be a witness, just taking photographs. Because the solutions seem so far in the past, I needed nothing short of a time machine to access them.The suffering of indigenous peoples is not a simple issue to fix. It's not something everyone can get behind the way they get behind helping Haiti, or ending AIDS, or fighting a famine. The \"fix,\" as it's called, may be much more difficult for the dominant society than, say, a $50 check or a church trip to paint some graffiti-covered houses, or a suburban family donating a box of clothes they don't even want anymore. So where does that leave us? Shrugging our shoulders in the dark?The United States continues on a daily basis to violate the terms of the 1851 and 1868 Fort Laramie Treaties with the Lakota. The call to action I offer today \u2014 my TED wish \u2014 is this: Honor the treaties. Give back the Black Hills. It's not your business what they do with them.(Applause)", "id": 1004, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:15.712\nI'm here today to show\nmy photographs of the Lakota.\n\n00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:18.513\nMany of you may have heard of the Lakota,\n\n00:00:18.537 --> 00:00:20.477\nor at least the larger group of tribes,\n\n00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:21.957\ncalled the Sioux.\n\n00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:25.761\nThe Lakota are one of many tribes\nthat were moved off their land\n\n00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:27.190\nto prisoner-of-war camps,\n\n00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:28.736\nnow called reservations.\n\n00:00:29.455 --> 00:00:31.542\nThe Pine Ridge Reservation,\n\n00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.698\nthe subject of today's slide show,\n\n00:00:33.722 --> 00:00:38.024\nis located about 75 miles southeast\nof the Black Hills in South Dakota.\n\n00:00:38.048 --> 00:00:42.975\nIt is sometimes referred to\nas Prisoner of War Camp Number 334,\n\n00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:45.125\nand it is where the Lakota now live.\n\n00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.335\nNow, if any of you have ever heard of AIM,\n\n00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:49.279\nthe American Indian Movement,\n\n00:00:49.303 --> 00:00:51.145\nor of Russell Means,\n\n00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:52.581\nor Leonard Peltier,\n\n00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:55.668\nor of the standoff at Oglala,\n\n00:00:55.692 --> 00:00:59.829\nthen you know Pine Ridge is ground zero\nfor Native issues in the US.\n\n00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:03.373\nSo I've been asked to talk\na little bit today\n\n00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:05.565\nabout my relationship with the Lakota,\n\n00:01:05.589 --> 00:01:07.565\nand that's a very difficult one for me,\n\n00:01:07.589 --> 00:01:10.047\nbecause, if you haven't\nnoticed from my skin color,\n\n00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:11.460\nI'm white,\n\n00:01:11.484 --> 00:01:14.484\nand that is a huge barrier\non a Native reservation.\n\n00:01:16.071 --> 00:01:18.501\nYou'll see a lot of people\nin my photographs today.\n\n00:01:18.525 --> 00:01:21.842\nI've become very close with them,\nand they've welcomed me like family.\n\n00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.784\nThey've called me \"brother\" and \"uncle,\"\n\n00:01:23.808 --> 00:01:26.112\nand invited me again and again\nover five years.\n\n00:01:26.136 --> 00:01:27.334\nBut on Pine Ridge,\n\n00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:30.334\nI will always be what is called \"wasichu.\"\n\n00:01:30.358 --> 00:01:33.524\n\"Wasichu\" is a Lakota word\n\n00:01:33.548 --> 00:01:35.649\nthat means \"non-Indian,\"\n\n00:01:35.673 --> 00:01:37.752\nbut another version of this word\n\n00:01:37.776 --> 00:01:40.996\nmeans \"the one who takes\nthe best meat for himself.\"\n\n00:01:41.365 --> 00:01:43.186\nAnd that's what I want to focus on --\n\n00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.306\nthe one who takes\nthe best part of the meat.\n\n00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:46.991\nIt means \"greedy.\"\n\n00:01:48.016 --> 00:01:50.112\nSo take a look around\nthis auditorium today.\n\n00:01:50.828 --> 00:01:53.888\nWe are at a private school\nin the American West,\n\n00:01:53.912 --> 00:01:56.334\nsitting in red velvet chairs\n\n00:01:56.358 --> 00:01:57.770\nwith money in our pockets.\n\n00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.405\nAnd if we look at our lives,\n\n00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.307\nwe have indeed taken\nthe best part of the meat.\n\n00:02:04.294 --> 00:02:07.334\nSo let's look today\nat a set of photographs\n\n00:02:07.358 --> 00:02:08.996\nof a people who lost\n\n00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.997\nso that we could gain,\n\n00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:13.527\nand know that when you see\nthese people's faces,\n\n00:02:14.262 --> 00:02:16.866\nthat these are not just\nimages of the Lakota;\n\n00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.214\nthey stand for all indigenous people.\n\n00:02:22.318 --> 00:02:23.973\nOn this piece of paper\n\n00:02:23.997 --> 00:02:27.710\nis the history the way I learned it\nfrom my Lakota friends and family.\n\n00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:33.844\nThe following is a time line\nof treaties made, treaties broken\n\n00:02:33.868 --> 00:02:36.150\nand massacres disguised as battles.\n\n00:02:36.626 --> 00:02:38.333\nI'll begin in 1824.\n\n00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.971\nWhat is known as\nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs\n\n00:02:40.995 --> 00:02:42.825\nwas created within the War Department,\n\n00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.539\nsetting an early tone of aggression\n\n00:02:44.563 --> 00:02:46.602\nin our dealings with the Native Americans.\n\n00:02:46.626 --> 00:02:48.169\n1851:\n\n00:02:48.193 --> 00:02:50.358\nThe first treaty of Fort Laramie was made,\n\n00:02:50.382 --> 00:02:53.120\nclearly marking the boundaries\nof the Lakota Nation.\n\n00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:56.794\nAccording to the treaty,\nthose lands are a sovereign nation.\n\n00:02:57.358 --> 00:02:59.454\nIf the boundaries\nof this treaty had held --\n\n00:02:59.478 --> 00:03:02.105\nand there is a legal basis\nthat they should --\n\n00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.884\nthen this is what the US\nwould look like today.\n\n00:03:07.713 --> 00:03:08.884\nTen years later.\n\n00:03:09.278 --> 00:03:12.000\nThe Homestead Act,\nsigned by President Lincoln,\n\n00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:14.703\nunleashed a flood of white settlers\ninto Native lands.\n\n00:03:15.303 --> 00:03:16.982\n1863:\n\n00:03:17.006 --> 00:03:19.504\nAn uprising of Santee Sioux in Minnesota\n\n00:03:19.528 --> 00:03:22.436\nends with the hanging of 38 Sioux men,\n\n00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.460\nthe largest mass execution in US history.\n\n00:03:25.993 --> 00:03:28.232\nThe execution was ordered\nby President Lincoln,\n\n00:03:28.256 --> 00:03:32.951\nonly two days after he signed\nthe Emancipation Proclamation.\n\n00:03:34.527 --> 00:03:38.099\n1866: The beginning\nof the Transcontinental Railroad --\n\n00:03:38.123 --> 00:03:39.334\na new era.\n\n00:03:39.721 --> 00:03:41.911\nWe appropriated land for trails and trains\n\n00:03:41.935 --> 00:03:44.334\nto shortcut through the heart\nof the Lakota Nation.\n\n00:03:44.358 --> 00:03:46.174\nThe treaties were out the window.\n\n00:03:46.198 --> 00:03:49.665\nIn response, three tribes led\nby the Lakota chief Red Cloud\n\n00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:51.395\nattacked and defeated the US army,\n\n00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:52.617\nmany times over.\n\n00:03:52.641 --> 00:03:53.966\nI want to repeat that part:\n\n00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.022\nThe Lakota defeat the US army.\n\n00:03:57.728 --> 00:04:01.577\n1868: The second Fort Laramie Treaty\nclearly guarantees\n\n00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:03.617\nthe sovereignty of the Great Sioux Nation\n\n00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:06.458\nand the Lakotas' ownership\nof the sacred Black Hills.\n\n00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:09.242\nThe government also promises\nland and hunting rights\n\n00:04:09.266 --> 00:04:10.590\nin the surrounding states.\n\n00:04:10.614 --> 00:04:12.677\nWe promise that the Powder River country\n\n00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:14.840\nwill henceforth be closed to all whites.\n\n00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.517\nThe treaty seemed to be a complete victory\n\n00:04:17.541 --> 00:04:19.001\nfor Red Cloud and the Sioux.\n\n00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:21.937\nIn fact, this is the only war\nin American history\n\n00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.006\nin which the government negotiated a peace\n\n00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.701\nby conceding everything\ndemanded by the enemy.\n\n00:04:30.711 --> 00:04:34.453\n1869: The Transcontinental\nRailroad was completed.\n\n00:04:34.477 --> 00:04:37.864\nIt began carrying, among other things,\nlarge numbers of hunters,\n\n00:04:37.888 --> 00:04:40.234\nwho began the wholesale\nkilling of buffalo,\n\n00:04:40.258 --> 00:04:43.816\neliminating a source of food,\nclothing and shelter for the Sioux.\n\n00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.056\n1871:\n\n00:04:45.635 --> 00:04:47.295\nThe Indian Appropriation Act\n\n00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:49.658\nmakes all Indians\nwards of the federal government.\n\n00:04:50.257 --> 00:04:52.408\nIn addition, the military issued orders\n\n00:04:52.432 --> 00:04:55.296\nforbidding western Indians\nfrom leaving reservations.\n\n00:04:56.112 --> 00:05:00.196\nAll western Indians at that point in time\nwere now prisoners of war.\n\n00:05:00.861 --> 00:05:02.308\nAlso in 1871,\n\n00:05:02.332 --> 00:05:04.309\nwe ended the time of treaty-making.\n\n00:05:04.333 --> 00:05:08.025\nThe problem with treaties is they allow\ntribes to exist as sovereign nations,\n\n00:05:08.049 --> 00:05:09.219\nand we can't have that.\n\n00:05:09.243 --> 00:05:10.440\nWe had plans.\n\n00:05:11.512 --> 00:05:12.735\n1874:\n\n00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:16.315\nGeneral George Custer announced\nthe discovery of gold in Lakota territory,\n\n00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:18.024\nspecifically the Black Hills.\n\n00:05:18.048 --> 00:05:20.859\nThe news of gold creates\na massive influx of white settlers\n\n00:05:20.883 --> 00:05:22.068\ninto Lakota Nation.\n\n00:05:22.672 --> 00:05:24.705\nCuster recommends that Congress find a way\n\n00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.649\nto end the treaties with the Lakota\nas soon as possible.\n\n00:05:28.006 --> 00:05:31.039\n1875: The Lakota war begins\n\n00:05:31.063 --> 00:05:33.715\nover the violation\nof the Fort Laramie Treaty.\n\n00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:35.710\n1876:\n\n00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.938\nOn July 26th,\n\n00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:40.181\non its way to attack a Lakota village,\n\n00:05:40.205 --> 00:05:42.269\nCuster's 7th Cavalry was crushed\n\n00:05:42.293 --> 00:05:43.942\nat the battle of Little Big Horn.\n\n00:05:44.704 --> 00:05:45.900\n1877:\n\n00:05:46.543 --> 00:05:49.587\nThe great Lakota warrior\nand chief named Crazy Horse\n\n00:05:49.611 --> 00:05:51.334\nsurrendered at Fort Robinson.\n\n00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:53.817\nHe was later killed while in custody.\n\n00:05:57.893 --> 00:06:02.581\n1877 is also the year we found a way\nto get around the Fort Laramie Treaties.\n\n00:06:02.605 --> 00:06:05.898\nA new agreement was presented\nto Sioux chiefs and their leading men,\n\n00:06:05.922 --> 00:06:08.334\nunder a campaign known\nas \"Sell or Starve\" --\n\n00:06:08.358 --> 00:06:10.663\nsign the paper, or no food for your tribe.\n\n00:06:11.114 --> 00:06:13.830\nOnly 10 percent of the adult\nmale population signed.\n\n00:06:14.544 --> 00:06:18.263\nThe Fort Laramie Treaty called\nfor at least three-quarters of the tribe\n\n00:06:18.287 --> 00:06:19.446\nto sign away land.\n\n00:06:20.212 --> 00:06:22.040\nThat clause was obviously ignored.\n\n00:06:22.667 --> 00:06:25.219\n1887: The Dawes Act.\n\n00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:28.334\nCommunal ownership\nof reservation lands ends.\n\n00:06:28.358 --> 00:06:31.449\nReservations are cut up\ninto 160-acre sections,\n\n00:06:31.473 --> 00:06:33.454\nand distributed to individual Indians\n\n00:06:33.478 --> 00:06:35.334\nwith the surplus disposed of.\n\n00:06:35.358 --> 00:06:37.177\nTribes lost millions of acres.\n\n00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.527\nThe American dream\nof individual land ownership\n\n00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:42.546\nturned out to be a very clever way\n\n00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.492\nto divide the reservation\nuntil nothing was left.\n\n00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:47.845\nThe move destroyed the reservations,\n\n00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:50.819\nmaking it easier\nto further subdivide and to sell\n\n00:06:50.843 --> 00:06:52.764\nwith every passing generation.\n\n00:06:53.113 --> 00:06:54.828\nMost of the surplus land\n\n00:06:54.852 --> 00:06:57.488\nand many of the plots\nwithin reservation boundaries\n\n00:06:57.512 --> 00:06:59.478\nare now in the hands of white ranchers.\n\n00:06:59.992 --> 00:07:03.165\nOnce again, the fat of the land\ngoes to wasichu.\n\n00:07:04.119 --> 00:07:08.745\n1890: A date I believe to be\nthe most important in this slide show.\n\n00:07:09.126 --> 00:07:11.549\nThis is the year\nof the Wounded Knee Massacre.\n\n00:07:12.195 --> 00:07:13.616\nOn December 29,\n\n00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.822\nUS troops surrounded a Sioux\nencampment at Wounded Knee Creek,\n\n00:07:16.846 --> 00:07:20.895\nand massacred Chief Big Foot\nand 300 prisoners of war,\n\n00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:24.421\nusing a new rapid-fire weapon\nthat fired exploding shells,\n\n00:07:24.445 --> 00:07:25.603\ncalled a Hotchkiss gun.\n\n00:07:26.508 --> 00:07:28.088\nFor this so-called \"battle,\"\n\n00:07:28.112 --> 00:07:31.115\n20 Congressional Medals of Honor for Valor\n\n00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:32.971\nwere given to the 7th Cavalry.\n\n00:07:34.358 --> 00:07:35.661\nTo this day,\n\n00:07:36.963 --> 00:07:41.071\nthis is the most Medals of Honor\never awarded for a single battle.\n\n00:07:41.977 --> 00:07:43.597\nMore Medals of Honor were given\n\n00:07:43.621 --> 00:07:46.151\nfor the indiscriminate slaughter\nof women and children\n\n00:07:46.175 --> 00:07:49.047\nthan for any battle in World War One,\n\n00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:50.412\nWorld War Two,\n\n00:07:50.436 --> 00:07:52.747\nKorea, Vietnam,\n\n00:07:52.771 --> 00:07:54.848\nIraq or Afghanistan.\n\n00:07:56.769 --> 00:08:00.437\nThe Wounded Knee Massacre\nis considered the end of the Indian wars.\n\n00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.260\nWhenever I visit the site\nof the mass grave at Wounded Knee,\n\n00:08:05.284 --> 00:08:09.686\nI see it not just as a grave\nfor the Lakota or for the Sioux,\n\n00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.101\nbut as a grave for all indigenous peoples.\n\n00:08:15.188 --> 00:08:17.728\nThe holy man Black Elk, said,\n\n00:08:17.752 --> 00:08:20.145\n\"I did not know then how much was ended.\n\n00:08:21.695 --> 00:08:25.112\nWhen I look back now\nfrom this high hill of my old age,\n\n00:08:25.136 --> 00:08:27.717\nI can still see\nthe butchered women and children\n\n00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:31.812\nlying heaped and scattered\nall along the crooked gulch,\n\n00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:37.644\nas plain as when I saw them\n\n00:08:37.668 --> 00:08:39.105\nwith eyes still young.\n\n00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.275\nAnd I can see that something else\ndied there in the bloody mud\n\n00:08:47.933 --> 00:08:49.629\nand was buried in the blizzard.\n\n00:08:51.341 --> 00:08:53.298\nA people's dream died there.\n\n00:08:54.481 --> 00:08:56.290\nAnd it was a beautiful dream.\"\n\n00:08:59.036 --> 00:09:00.492\nWith this event,\n\n00:09:00.516 --> 00:09:03.516\na new era in Native American\nhistory began.\n\n00:09:04.358 --> 00:09:09.334\nEverything can be measured\nbefore Wounded Knee and after,\n\n00:09:09.358 --> 00:09:11.125\nbecause it was in this moment,\n\n00:09:11.149 --> 00:09:14.436\nwith the fingers on the triggers\nof the Hotchkiss guns,\n\n00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:18.334\nthat the US government openly\ndeclared its position on Native rights.\n\n00:09:18.817 --> 00:09:20.334\nThey were tired of treaties.\n\n00:09:20.753 --> 00:09:22.721\nThey were tired of sacred hills.\n\n00:09:22.745 --> 00:09:24.578\nThey were tired of ghost dances.\n\n00:09:25.634 --> 00:09:28.649\nAnd they were tired of all\nthe inconveniences of the Sioux.\n\n00:09:29.253 --> 00:09:30.888\nSo they brought out their cannons.\n\n00:09:32.671 --> 00:09:34.998\n\"You want to be an Indian now?\" they said,\n\n00:09:35.022 --> 00:09:36.284\nfinger on the trigger.\n\n00:09:42.514 --> 00:09:43.680\n1900:\n\n00:09:44.506 --> 00:09:47.976\nthe US Indian population\nreached its low point

taken,\n\n00:10:26.254 --> 00:10:28.869\nand that the initial\noffering price, plus interest,\n\n00:10:28.893 --> 00:10:30.687\nshould be paid to the Sioux Nation.\n\n00:10:31.258 --> 00:10:32.810\nAs payment for the Black Hills,\n\n00:10:32.834 --> 00:10:37.266\nthe court awarded only 106 million dollars\nto the Sioux Nation.\n\n00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:40.334\nThe Sioux refused the money\nwith the rallying cry,\n\n00:10:40.358 --> 00:10:42.334\n\"The Black Hills are not for sale.\"\n\n00:10:43.588 --> 00:10:44.747\n2010:\n\n00:10:45.287 --> 00:10:48.079\nStatistics about Native population

call to action.\n\n00:13:57.655 --> 00:14:00.730\nBecause for so long,\nI've been standing on the sidelines,\n\n00:14:01.167 --> 00:14:02.793\ncontent to be a witness,\n\n00:14:02.817 -->

as it's called,\n\n00:14:27.687 --> 00:14:30.334\nmay be much more difficult\nfor the dominant society\n\n00:14:30.358 --> 00:14:32.655\nthan, say, a $50 check\n\n00:14:32.679 --> 00:14:35.976\nor a church trip to paint\nsome graffiti-covered houses,\n\n00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.611\nor a suburban family\n\n00:14:37.635 --> 00:14:40.611\ndonating a box of clothes\nthey don't even want anymore.\n\n00:14:41.254 --> 00:14:42.649\nSo where does that leave us?\n\n00:14:43.134 --> 00:14:45.198\nShrugging our shoulders in the dark?\n\n00:14:46.968 --> 00:14:51.648\nThe United States

"url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/auret_van_heerden_making_global_labor_fair", "transcript": "This cell phone started its trajectory in an artisanal mine in the Eastern Congo. It's mined by armed gangs using slaves, child slaves, what the U.N. Security Council calls \"blood minerals,\" then traveled into some components and ended up in a factory in Shinjin in China. That factory \u2014 over a dozen people have committed suicide already this year. One man died after working a 36-hour shift. We all love chocolate. We buy it for our kids. Eighty percent of the cocoa comes from Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana and it's harvested by children. Cote d'Ivoire, we have a huge problem of child slaves. Children have been trafficked from other conflict zones to come and work on the coffee plantations. Heparin \u2014 a blood thinner, a pharmaceutical product \u2014 starts out in artisanal workshops like this in China, because the active ingredient comes from pigs' intestines. Your diamond \u2014 you've all heard, probably seen the movie \"Blood Diamond.\" This is a mine in Zimbabwe right now. Cotton: Uzbekistan is the second biggest exporter of cotton on Earth. Every year when it comes to the cotton harvest, the government shuts down the schools, puts the kids in buses, buses them to the cotton fields to spend three weeks harvesting the cotton. It's forced child labor on an institutional scale. And all of those products probably end their lives in a dump like this one in Manila.These places, these origins, represent governance gaps. That's the politest description I have for them. These are the dark pools where global supply chains begin \u2014 the global supply chains, which bring us our favorite brand name products. Some of these governance gaps are run by rogue states. Some of them are not states anymore at all. They're failed states. Some of them are just countries who believe that deregulation or no regulation is the best way to attract investment, promote trade. Either way, they present us with a huge moral and ethical dilemma. I know that none of us want to be accessories after the fact of a human rights abuse in a global supply chain. But right now, most of the companies involved in these supply chains don't have any way of assuring us that nobody had to mortgage their future, nobody had to sacrifice their rights to bring us our favorite brand name product.Now, I didn't come here to depress you about the state of the global supply chain. We need a reality check. We need to recognize just how serious a deficit of rights we have. This is an independent republic, probably a failed state. It's definitely not a democratic state. And right now, that independent republic of the supply chain is not being governed in a way that would satisfy us, that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption. Now, that's not a new story. You've seen the documentaries of sweatshops making garments all over the world, even in developed countries. You want to see the classic sweatshop, meet me at Madison Square Garden, I'll take you down the street, and I'll show you a Chinese sweatshop.But take the example of heparin. It's a pharmaceutical product. You expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital, probably squeaky clean. The problem is that the active ingredient in there \u2014 as I mentioned earlier \u2014 comes from pigs. The main American manufacturer of that active ingredient decided a few years ago to relocate to China because it's the world's biggest supplier of pigs. And their factory in China \u2014 which probably is pretty clean \u2014 is getting all of the ingredients from backyard abattoirs, where families slaughter pigs and extract the ingredient. So a couple of years ago, we had a scandal which killed about 80 people around the world, because of contaminants that crept into the heparin supply chain. Worse, some of the suppliers realized that they could substitute a product which mimicked heparin in tests. This substitute cost nine dollars a pound, whereas real heparin, the real ingredient, cost 900 dollars a pound. A no-brainer. The problem was that it killed more people.And so you're asking yourself, \"How come the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allowed this to happen? How did the Chinese State Agency for Food and Drugs allow this to happen?\" And the answer is quite simple: the Chinese define these facilities as chemical facilities, not pharmaceutical facilities, so they don't audit them. And the USFDA has a jurisdictional problem. This is offshore. They actually do conduct a few investigations overseas \u2014 about a dozen a year \u2014 maybe 20 in a good year. There are 500 of these facilities producing active ingredients in China alone. In fact, about 80 percent of the active ingredients in medicines now come from offshore, particularly China and India, and we don't have a governance system. We don't have a regulatory system able to ensure that that production is safe. We don't have a system to ensure that human rights, basic dignity, are ensured.So at a national level \u2014 and we work in about 60 different countries \u2014 at a national level we've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments to regulate production on their own soil. And the real problem with the global supply chain is that it's supranational. So governments who are failing, who are dropping the ball at a national level, have even less ability to get their arms around the problem at an international level. And you can just look at the headlines. Take Copenhagen last year \u2014 complete failure of governments to do the right thing in the face of an international challenge. Take the G20 meeting a couple of weeks ago \u2014 stepped back from its commitments of just a few months ago. You can take any one of the major global challenges we've discussed this week and ask yourself, where is the leadership from governments to step up and come up with solutions, responses, to those international problems? And the simple answer is they can't. They're national. Their voters are local. They have parochial interests. They can't subordinate those interests to the greater global public good.So, if we're going to ensure the delivery of the key public goods at an international level \u2014 in this case, in the global supply chain \u2014 we have to come up with a different mechanism. We need a different machine. Fortunately, we have some examples. In the 1990s, there were a whole series of scandals concerning the production of brand name goods in the U.S. \u2014 child labor, forced labor, serious health and safety abuses. And eventually President Clinton, in 1996, convened a meeting at the White House, invited industry, human rights NGOs, trade unions, the Department of Labor, got them all in a room and said, \"Look, I don't want globalization to be a race to the bottom. I don't know how to prevent that, but I'm at least going to use my good offices to get you folks together to come up with a response.\" So they formed a White House task force, and they spent about three years arguing about who takes how much responsibility in the global supply chain. Companies didn't feel it was their responsibility. They don't own those facilities. They don't employ those workers. They're not legally liable. Everybody else at the table said, \"Folks, that doesn't cut it. You have a custodial duty, a duty of care, to make sure that that product gets from wherever to the store in a way that allows us to consume it, without fear of our safety, or without having to sacrifice our conscience to consume that product.\" So they agreed, \"Okay, what we'll do is we agree on a common set of standards, code of conduct. We'll apply that throughout our global supply chain regardless of ownership or control. We'll make it part of the contract.\" And that was a stroke of absolute genius, because what they did was they harnessed the power of the contract, private power, to deliver public goods.And let's face it, the contract from a major multinational brand to a supplier in India or China has much more persuasive value than the local labor law, the local environmental regulations, the local human rights standards. Those factories will probably never see an inspector. If the inspector did come along, it would be amazing if they were able to resist the bribe. Even if they did their jobs, and they cited those facilities for their violations, the fine would be derisory. But you lose that contract for a major brand name, that's the difference between staying in business or going bankrupt. That makes a difference. So what we've been able to do is we've been able to harness the power and the influence of the only truly transnational institution in the global supply chain, that of the multinational company, and get them to do the right thing, get them to use that power for good, to deliver the key public goods.Now of course, this doesn't come naturally to multinational companies. They weren't set up to do this. They're set up to make money. But they are extremely efficient organizations. They have resources, and if we can add the will, the commitment, they know how to deliver that product. Now, getting there is not easy. Those supply chains I put up on the screen earlier, they're not there. You need a safe space. You need a place where people can come together, sit down without fear of judgment, without recrimination, to actually face the problem, agree on the problem and come up with solutions. We can do it. The technical solutions are there. The problem is the lack of trust, the lack of confidence, the lack of partnership between NGOs, campaign groups, civil society organizations and multinational companies. If we can put those two together in a safe space, get them to work together, we can deliver public goods right now, or in extremely short supply.This is a radical proposition, and it's crazy to think that if you're a 15-year-old Bangladeshi girl leaving your rural village to go and work in a factory in Dhaka \u2014 22, 23, 24 dollars a month \u2014 your best chance of enjoying rights at work is if that factory is producing for a brand name company which has got a code of conduct and made that code of conduct part of the contract. It's crazy. Multinationals are protecting human rights. I know there's going to be disbelief. You'll say, \"How can we trust them?\" Well, we don't. It's the old arms control phrase: \"Trust, but verify.\" So we audit. We take their supply chain, we take all the factory names, we do a random sample, we send inspectors on an unannounced basis to inspect those facilities, and then we publish the results. Transparency is absolutely critical to this. You can call yourself responsible, but responsibility without accountability often doesn't work. So what we're doing is, we're not only enlisting the multinationals, we're giving them the tools to deliver this public good \u2014 respect for human rights \u2014 and we're checking. You don't need to believe me. You shouldn't believe me. Go to the website. Look at the audit results. Ask yourself, is this company behaving in a socially responsible way? Can I buy that product without compromising my ethics? That's the way the system works.I hate the idea that governments are not protecting human rights around the world. I hate the idea that governments have dropped this ball and I can't get used to the idea that somehow we can't get them to do their jobs. I've been at this for 30 years, and in that time I've seen the ability, the commitment, the will of government to do this decline, and I don't see them making a comeback right now. So we started out thinking this was a stopgap measure. We're now thinking that, in fact, this is probably the start of a new way of regulating and addressing international challenges. Call it network governance. Call it what you will. The private actors, companies and NGOs, are going to have to get together to face the major challenges we are going to face. Just look at pandemics \u2014 swine flu, bird flu, H1N1. Look at the health systems in so many countries. Do they have the resources to face up to a serious pandemic? No. Could the private sector and NGOs get together and marshal a response? Absolutely. What they lack is that safe space to come together, agree and move to action. That's what we're trying to provide.I know as well that this often seems like an overwhelming level of responsibility for people to assume. \"You want me to deliver human rights throughout my global supply chain. There are thousands of suppliers in there.\" It seems too daunting, too dangerous, for any company to take on. But there are companies. We have 4,000 companies who are members. Some of them are very, very large companies. The sporting goods industry, in particular, stepped up to the plate and have done it. The example, the role model, is there. And whenever we discuss one of these problems that we have to address \u2014 child labor in cottonseed farms in India \u2014 this year we will monitor 50,000 cottonseed farms in India. It seems overwhelming. The numbers just make you want to zone out. But we break it down to some basic realities.And human rights comes down to a very simple proposition: can I give this person their dignity back? Poor people, people whose human rights have been violated \u2014 the crux of that is the loss of dignity, the lack of dignity. It starts with just giving people back their dignity. I was sitting in a slum outside Gurgaon just next to Delhi, one of the flashiest, brightest new cities popping up in India right now, and I was talking to workers who worked in garment sweatshops down the road, and I asked them what message they would like me to take to the brands. They didn't say money. They said, \"The people who employ us treat us like we are less than human, like we don't exist. Please ask them to treat us like human beings.\" That's my simple understanding of human rights. That's my simple proposition to you, my simple plea to every decision-maker in this room, everybody out there. We can all make a decision to come together and pick up the balls and run with the balls that governments have dropped. If we don't do it, we're abandoning hope, we're abandoning our essential humanity, and I know that's not a place we want to be, and we don't have to be there. So I appeal to you. Join us, come into that safe space, and let's start to make this happen.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1005, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nThis cell phone\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nstarted its trajectory\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nin an artisanal mine\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nin the Eastern Congo.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nIt's mined by armed gangs\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nusing slaves, child slaves,\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nwhat the U.N.

00:03:04.958\nNow, I didn't come here to depress you\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nabout the state of the global supply chain.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nWe need a reality check.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nWe need to recognize just how serious\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\na deficit of rights we have.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nThis is an independent republic,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nprobably a failed state.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nIt's definitely not a democratic state.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nAnd right now,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nthat independent republic of the supply chain\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nis not being governed\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nin a way that would satisfy us,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nthat we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nNow, that's not a new story.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nYou've seen the documentaries\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nof sweatshops making garments\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nall over the world, even in developed countries.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nYou want to see the classic sweatshop,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nmeet me at Madison Square Garden,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nI'll take you down the street, and I'll show you a Chinese sweatshop.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nBut take the example of heparin.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nIt's a pharmaceutical product.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nYou expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nprobably squeaky clean.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nThe problem is that the active ingredient in there --\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nas I mentioned earlier --\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\ncomes from pigs.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nThe main American manufacturer\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nof that active ingredient\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\ndecided a few years ago to relocate to China\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nbecause it's the world's biggest supplier of pigs.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nAnd their factory in China --\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nwhich probably is pretty clean --\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nis getting all of the ingredients\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nfrom backyard abattoirs,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nwhere families slaughter pigs\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand extract the ingredient.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nSo a couple of years ago, we had a scandal\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nwhich killed about 80 people around the world,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nbecause of contaminants\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nthat crept into the heparin supply chain.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nWorse, some of the suppliers\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nrealized that they could substitute a product\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nwhich mimicked heparin in tests.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nThis substitute cost nine dollars a pound,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nwhereas real heparin, the real ingredient,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\ncost 900 dollars a pound.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nA no-brainer.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nThe problem was that it killed more people.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nAnd so you're asking yourself,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\n\"How come the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nallowed this to happen?\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nHow did the Chinese State Agency for Food and Drugs\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nallow this to happen?\"\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nAnd the answer is quite simple:\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nthe Chinese define these facilities\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nas chemical facilities, not pharmaceutical facilities,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nso they don't audit them.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nAnd the USFDA\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nhas a jurisdictional problem.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nThis is offshore.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nThey actually do conduct a few investigations overseas --\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nabout a dozen a year -- maybe 20 in a good year.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nThere are

percent\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nof the active ingredients in medicines now\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\ncome from offshore,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nparticularly China and India,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nand we don't have a governance system.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nWe don't have a regulatory system\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nable to ensure\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nthat that production is safe.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nWe don't have a system to ensure\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nthat human rights, basic dignity,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nare ensured.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nSo at a national level --\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nand we work in about 60 different countries --\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nat a national level\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nwe've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nto regulate production\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\non their own soil.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nAnd the real problem with the global supply chain\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nis that it's supranational.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nSo governments who are failing,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nwho are dropping the ball\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nat a national level,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nhave even less ability to get their arms around the problem\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nat an international level.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nAnd you can just look at the headlines.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nTake Copenhagen last year --\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\ncomplete failure of governments\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nto do the right thing\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nin the face of an international challenge.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nTake the G20 meeting a couple of weeks ago --\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nstepped back from its commitments of just a few months ago.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nYou can take any one\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nof the major global challenges we've discussed this week\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nand ask yourself, where is the leadership from governments\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nto step up and come up with solutions,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nresponses,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nto those international problems?\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd the simple answer is they can't. They're national.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nTheir voters are local.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nThey have parochial interests.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nThey can't subordinate those interests\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nto the greater global public good.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nSo, if we're going to ensure the delivery\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nof

have to come up with a different mechanism.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nWe need a different machine.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nFortunately, we have some examples.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nIn the 1990s,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nthere were a whole series of scandals\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nconcerning the production of brand name goods in the U.S. --\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nchild labor, forced labor,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nserious health and safety abuses.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nAnd eventually President Clinton, in 1996,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nconvened a meeting at the White House,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\ninvited industry, human rights NGOs,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\ntrade unions, the Department of Labor,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\ngot them all in a room\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nand said, \"Look,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nI don't want globalization to be a race to the bottom.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nI don't know how to prevent that,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nbut I'm at least going to use my good offices\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nto get you folks together\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nto come up with a response.\"\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nSo they formed a White House task force,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nand they spent about three years arguing\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nabout who takes how much responsibility\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nin the global supply chain.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nCompanies didn't feel it was their responsibility.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nThey don't own those facilities.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nThey don't employ those workers.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nThey're not legally liable.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nEverybody else at the table\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nsaid, \"Folks, that doesn't cut it.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nYou have a custodial duty, a duty of care,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nto make sure that that product\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\ngets from wherever to the store\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nin a way that allows us to consume it,\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nwithout fear of our safety,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nor without having to sacrifice our conscience\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nto consume that product.\"\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nSo they agreed, \"Okay, what we'll do\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nis we agree on a common set of standards,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\ncode of conduct.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nWe'll apply that throughout\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nour global supply chain\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nregardless of ownership or control.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nWe'll make it part of the contract.\"\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nAnd that was a stroke of absolute genius,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nbecause what they did\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nwas they harnessed the power of the contract,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nprivate power,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nto deliver public goods.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nAnd let's face it,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nthe contract from a major multinational brand\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nto a supplier in India or China\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nhas much more persuasive value\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nthan the local labor law,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nthe local environmental regulations,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nthe local human rights standards.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nThose factories will probably never see an inspector.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nIf the inspector did come along,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nit would be amazing if they were able\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nto resist the bribe.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nEven if they did their jobs,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nand they cited those facilities for their violations,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nthe fine would be derisory.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nBut you lose that contract\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nfor a major brand name,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nthat's the difference\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nbetween staying in business or going bankrupt.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nThat makes a difference.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nSo what we've been able to do\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nis we've been able to harness\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nthe power and the influence\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nof the only truly transnational institution\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nin the global supply chain,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nthat of the multinational company,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nand get them to do the right thing,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nget them to use that power for good,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nto deliver the key public goods.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nNow of course, this doesn't come naturally\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nto multinational companies.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nThey weren't set up to do this. They're set up to make money.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nBut they are extremely efficient organizations.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nThey have resources,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nand if we can add the will, the commitment,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nthey know how to deliver that product.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nNow, getting there is not easy.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nThose supply chains I put up on the screen earlier,\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nthey're not there.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nYou need a safe space.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nYou need a place where people can come together,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nsit down without fear of judgment,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nwithout recrimination,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nto actually face the problem,\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nagree on the problem and come up with solutions.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nWe can do it. The technical solutions are there.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nThe problem is the lack of trust, the lack of confidence,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nthe lack of partnership\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nbetween NGOs, campaign groups,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\ncivil society organizations\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nand multinational companies.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nIf we can put those two together in a safe space,\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nget them to work together,\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nwe can deliver public goods right now,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nor in extremely short supply.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nThis is a radical proposition,\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nand it's crazy to think\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nthat if you're a 15-year-old Bangladeshi girl\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nleaving your rural village\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nto go and work in a factory in Dhaka --\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\n22, 23, 24 dollars a month --\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nyour best chance of enjoying rights at work\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nis if that factory is producing\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nfor a brand name company\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nwhich has got a code of conduct\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nand made that code of conduct part of the contract.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nIt's crazy.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nMultinationals are protecting human rights.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nI know there's going to be disbelief.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nYou'll say, \"How can we trust them?\"\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nWell, we don't.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nIt's the old arms control phrase:\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\n\"Trust, but verify.\"\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nSo we audit.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nWe take their supply chain, we take all the factory names,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nwe do a random sample,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nwe send inspectors on an unannounced basis\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nto inspect those facilities,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nand then we publish the results.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nTransparency is absolutely critical to this.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nYou can call yourself responsible,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nbut responsibility without accountability\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\noften doesn't work.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nSo what we're doing is, we're not only enlisting the multinationals,\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nwe're giving them the tools to deliver this public good --\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nrespect for human rights --\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nand we're checking.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nYou don't need to believe me.

Look at the audit results.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAsk yourself, is this company behaving\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nin a socially responsible way?\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nCan I buy that product\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nwithout compromising my ethics?\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nThat's the way the system works.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nI hate the idea\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nthat governments are not protecting human rights around the world.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nI hate the idea\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nthat governments have dropped this ball\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nand I can't get used to the idea\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nthat somehow we can't get them to do their jobs.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nI've been at this for 30 years,\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nand in that time I've seen\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nthe ability, the commitment, the will of government\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nto do this decline,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nand I don't see them making a comeback right now.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nSo we started out thinking\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nthis was a stopgap measure.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nWe're now thinking that, in fact,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nthis is probably the start\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nof a new way of regulating and addressing\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\ninternational challenges.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nCall it network governance. Call it what you will.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nThe private actors,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\ncompanies and NGOs,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nare going to have to get together\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nto face the major challenges we are going to face.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nJust look at pandemics --\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nswine flu, bird flu, H1N1.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nLook at the health systems in so many countries.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nDo they have the resources\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nto

00:15:23.958\nIt seems too daunting, too dangerous,\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nfor any company to take on.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nBut there are companies.\n\n00:15:27.958 -->

particular,\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nstepped up to the plate and have done it.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nThe example, the role model, is there.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nAnd

00:15:51.958\nthis year we will monitor 50,000 cottonseed farms in India.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nIt seems overwhelming.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nThe numbers just make you want to zone out.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nBut we break it down to some basic realities.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nAnd human rights\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\ncomes down to a very simple proposition:\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\ncan I give this person their dignity back?\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nPoor people,\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\npeople whose human

with a complex problem? Well, I hope to change that in less than three minutes. So, I hope to convince you that complex doesn't always equal complicated. So for me, a well-crafted baguette, fresh out of the oven, is complex, but a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread is complicated. I'm an ecologist, and I study complexity. I love complexity. And I study that in the natural world, the interconnectedness of species.So here's a food web, or a map of feeding links between species that live in Alpine Lakes in the mountains of California. And this is what happens to that food web when it's stocked with non-native fish that never lived there before. All the grayed-out species disappear. Some are actually on the brink of extinction. And lakes with fish have more mosquitos, even though they eat them. These effects were all unanticipated, and yet we're discovering they're predictable.So I want to share with you a couple key insights about complexity we're learning from studying nature that maybe are applicable to other problems. First is the simple power of good visualization tools to help untangle complexity and just encourage you to ask questions you didn't think of before. For example, you could plot the flow of carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem, or the interconnections of habitat patches for endangered species in Yosemite National Park. The next thing is that if you want to predict the effect of one species on another, if you focus only on that link, and then you black box the rest, it's actually less predictable than if you step back, consider the entire system \u2014 all the species, all the links \u2014 and from that place, hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most. And we're discovering, with our research, that's often very local to the node you care about within one or two degrees. So the more you step back, embrace complexity, the better chance you have of finding simple answers, and it's often different than the simple answer that you started with.So let's switch gears and look at a really complex problem courtesy of the U.S. government. This is a diagram of the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan. It was front page of the New York Times a couple months ago. Instantly ridiculed by the media for being so crazy complicated. And the stated goal was to increase popular support for the Afghan government. Clearly a complex problem, but is it complicated? Well, when I saw this in the front page of the Times, I thought, \"Great. Finally something I can relate to. I can sink my teeth into this.\"So let's do it. So here we go for the first time ever, a world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network. The circled node is the one we're trying to influence \u2014 popular support for the government. And so now we can look one degrees, two degrees, three degrees away from that node and eliminate three-quarters of the diagram outside that sphere of influence. Within that sphere, most of those nodes are not actionable, like the harshness of the terrain, and a very small minority are actual military actions. Most are non-violent and they fall into two broad categories: active engagement with ethnic rivalries and religious beliefs and fair, transparent economic development and provisioning of services. I don't know about this, but this is what I can decipher from this diagram in 24 seconds.When you see a diagram like this, I don't want you to be afraid. I want you to be excited. I want you to be relieved. Because simple answers may emerge. We're discovering in nature that simplicity often lies on the other side of complexity. So for any problem, the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity, the better chance you have of zooming in on the simple details that matter most.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1006, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nDo you ever feel completely overwhelmed\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nwhen you're faced with a complex problem?\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nWell, I hope to change that in less than three minutes.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nSo, I hope to convince you that complex\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.958\ndoesn't always equal complicated.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nSo for me, a well-crafted baguette, fresh out of the oven,\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nis complex,\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nbut a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nis complicated.\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nI'm an ecologist, and I study complexity.

Basically, no one's very happy. Those learning it think it's disconnected, uninteresting and hard. Those trying to employ them think they don't know enough. Governments realize that it's a big deal for our economies, but don't know how to fix it. And teachers are also frustrated. Yet math is more important to the world than at any point in human history. So at one end we've got falling interest in education in math, and at the other end we've got a more mathematical world, a more quantitative world than we ever have had.So what's the problem, why has this chasm opened up, and what can we do to fix it? Well actually, I think the answer is staring us right in the face: Use computers. I believe that correctly using computers is the silver bullet for making math education work. So to explain that, let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world and what it looks like in education. See, in the real world math isn't necessarily done by mathematicians. It's done by geologists, engineers, biologists, all sorts of different people \u2014 modeling and simulation. It's actually very popular. But in education it looks very different \u2014 dumbed-down problems, lots of calculating, mostly by hand. Lots of things that seem simple and not difficult like in the real world, except if you're learning it. And another thing about math: math sometimes looks like math \u2014 like in this example here \u2014 and sometimes it doesn't \u2014 like \"Am I drunk?\" And then you get an answer that's quantitative in the modern world. You wouldn't have expected that a few years back. But now you can find out all about \u2014 unfortunately, my weight is a little higher than that, but \u2014 all about what happens.So let's zoom out a bit and ask, why are we teaching people math? What's the point of teaching people math? And in particular, why are we teaching them math in general? Why is it such an important part of education as a sort of compulsory subject? Well, I think there are about three reasons: technical jobs so critical to the development of our economies, what I call \"everyday living\" \u2014 to function in the world today, you've got to be pretty quantitative, much more so than a few years ago: figure out your mortgages, being skeptical of government statistics, those kinds of things \u2014 and thirdly, what I would call something like logical mind training, logical thinking. Over the years we've put so much in society into being able to process and think logically. It's part of human society. It's very important to learn that math is a great way to do that.So let's ask another question. What is math? What do we mean when we say we're doing math, or educating people to do math? Well, I think it's about four steps, roughly speaking, starting with posing the right question. What is it that we want to ask? What is it we're trying to find out here? And this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world, beyond virtually any other part of doing math. People ask the wrong question, and surprisingly enough, they get the wrong answer, for that reason, if not for others. So the next thing is take that problem and turn it from a real world problem into a math problem. That's stage two. Once you've done that, then there's the computation step. Turn it from that into some answer in a mathematical form. And of course, math is very powerful at doing that. And then finally, turn it back to the real world. Did it answer the question? And also verify it \u2014 crucial step. Now here's the crazy thing right now. In math education, we're spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time teaching people to do step three by hand. Yet, that's the one step computers can do better than any human after years of practice. Instead, we ought to be using computers to do step three and using the students to spend much more effort on learning how to do steps one, two and four \u2014 conceptualizing problems, applying them, getting the teacher to run them through how to do that.See, crucial point here: math is not equal to calculating. Math is a much broader subject than calculating. Now it's understandable that this has all got intertwined over hundreds of years. There was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand. But in the last few decades that has totally changed. We've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject that I could ever imagine with computers. Calculating was typically the limiting step, and now often it isn't. So I think in terms of the fact that math has been liberated from calculating. But that math liberation didn't get into education yet. See, I think of calculating, in a sense, as the machinery of math. It's the chore. It's the thing you'd like to avoid if you can, like to get a machine to do. It's a means to an end, not an end in itself, and automation allows us to have that machinery. Computers allow us to do that \u2014 and this is not a small problem by any means. I estimated that, just today, across the world, we spent about 106 average world lifetimes teaching people how to calculate by hand. That's an amazing amount of human endeavor. So we better be damn sure \u2014 and by the way, they didn't even have fun doing it, most of them \u2014 so we better be damn sure that we know why we're doing that and it has a real purpose.I think we should be assuming computers for doing the calculating and only doing hand calculations where it really makes sense to teach people that. And I think there are some cases. For example: mental arithmetic. I still do a lot of that, mainly for estimating. People say, \"Is such and such true?\" And I'll say, \"Hmm, not sure.\" I'll think about it roughly. It's still quicker to do that and more practical. So I think practicality is one case where it's worth teaching people by hand. And then there are certain conceptual things that can also benefit from hand calculating, but I think they're relatively small in number. One thing I often ask about is ancient Greek and how this relates. See, the thing we're doing right now is we're forcing people to learn mathematics. It's a major subject. I'm not for one minute suggesting that, if people are interested in hand calculating or in following their own interests in any subject however bizarre \u2014 they should do that. That's absolutely the right thing, for people to follow their self-interest. I was somewhat interested in ancient Greek, but I don't think that we should force the entire population to learn a subject like ancient Greek. I don't think it's warranted. So I have this distinction between what we're making people do and the subject that's sort of mainstream and the subject that, in a sense, people might follow with their own interest and perhaps even be spiked into doing that.So what are the issues people bring up with this? Well one of them is, they say, you need to get the basics first. You shouldn't use the machine until you get the basics of the subject. So my usual question is, what do you mean by \"basics?\" Basics of what? Are the basics of driving a car learning how to service it, or design it for that matter? Are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill? I don't think so. I think you need to separate the basics of what you're trying to do from how it gets done and the machinery of how it gets done and automation allows you to make that separation. A hundred years ago, it's certainly true that to drive a car you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things. But automation in cars allowed that to separate, so driving is now a quite separate subject, so to speak, from engineering of the car or learning how to service it. So automation allows this separation and also allows \u2014 in the case of driving, and I believe also in the future case of maths \u2014 a democratized way of doing that. It can be spread across a much larger number of people who can really work with that.So there's another thing that comes up with basics. People confuse, in my view, the order of the invention of the tools with the order in which they should use them for teaching. So just because paper was invented before computers, it doesn't necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject by using paper instead of a computer to teach mathematics. My daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this. She enjoys making what she calls \"paper laptops.\" (Laughter) So I asked her one day, \"You know, when I was your age, I didn't make these. Why do you think that was?\" And after a second or two, carefully reflecting, she said, \"No paper?\" (Laughter) If you were born after computers and paper, it doesn't really matter which order you're taught with them in, you just want to have the best tool.So another one that comes up is \"Computers dumb math down.\" That somehow, if you use a computer, it's all mindless button-pushing, but if you do it by hand, it's all intellectual. This one kind of annoys me, I must say. Do we really believe that the math that most people are doing in school practically today is more than applying procedures to problems they don't really understand, for reasons they don't get? I don't think so. And what's worse, what they're learning there isn't even practically useful anymore. Might have been 50 years ago, but it isn't anymore. When they're out of education, they do it on a computer. Just to be clear, I think computers can really help with this problem, actually make it more conceptual. Now, of course, like any great tool, they can be used completely mindlessly, like turning everything into a multimedia show, like the example I was shown of solving an equation by hand, where the computer was the teacher \u2014 show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand. This is just nuts. Why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand that the computer should be doing anyway? All backwards.Let me show you that you can also make problems harder to calculate. See, normally in school, you do things like solve quadratic equations. But you see, when you're using a computer, you can just substitute. You can make it a quartic equation. Make it kind of harder, calculating-wise. Same principles applied \u2014 calculations, harder. And problems in the real world look nutty and horrible like this. They've got hair all over them. They're not just simple, dumbed-down things that we see in school math. And think of the outside world. Do we really believe that engineering and biology and all of these other things that have so benefited from computers and maths have somehow conceptually gotten reduced by using computers? I don't think so \u2014 quite the opposite. So the problem we've really got in math education is not that computers might dumb it down, but that we have dumbed-down problems right now. Well, another issue people bring up is somehow that hand calculating procedures teach understanding. So if you go through lots of examples, you can get the answer, you can understand how the basics of the system work better. I think there is one thing that I think very valid here, which is that I think understanding procedures and processes is important. But there's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world. It's called programming.Programming is how most procedures and processes get written down these days, and it's also a great way to engage students much more and to check they really understand. If you really want to check you understand math then write a program to do it. So programming is the way I think we should be doing that. So to be clear, what I really am suggesting here is we have a unique opportunity to make maths both more practical and more conceptual, simultaneously. I can't think of any other subject where that's recently been possible. It's usually some kind of choice between the vocational and the intellectual. But I think we can do both at the same time here. And we open up so many more possibilities. You can do so many more problems. What I really think we gain from this is students getting intuition and experience in far greater quantities than they've ever got before. And experience of harder problems \u2014 being able to play with the math, interact with it, feel it. We want people who can feel the math instinctively. That's what computers allow us to do.Another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum. Traditionally it's been by how difficult it is to calculate, but now we can reorder it by how difficult it is to understand the concepts, however hard the calculating. So calculus has traditionally been taught very late. Why is this? Well, it's damn hard doing the calculations, that's the problem. But actually many of the concepts are amenable to a much younger age group. This was an example I built for my daughter. And very, very simple. We were talking about what happens when you increase the number of sides of a polygon to a very large number. And of course, it turns into a circle. And by the way, she was also very insistent on being able to change the color, an important feature for this demonstration. You can see that this is a very early step into limits and differential calculus and what happens when you take things to an extreme \u2014 and very small sides and a very large number of sides. Very simple example. That's a view of the world that we don't usually give people for many, many years after this. And yet, that's a really important practical view of the world. So one of the roadblocks we have in moving this agenda forward is exams. In the end, if we test everyone by hand in exams, it's kind of hard to get the curricula changed to a point where they can use computers during the semesters.And one of the reasons it's so important \u2014 so it's very important to get computers in exams. And then we can ask questions, real questions, questions like, what's the best life insurance policy to get? \u2014 real questions that people have in their everyday lives. And you see, this isn't some dumbed-down model here. This is an actual model where we can be asked to optimize what happens. How many years of protection do I need? What does that do to the payments and to the interest rates and so forth? Now I'm not for one minute suggesting it's the only kind of question that should be asked in exams, but I think it's a very important type that right now just gets completely ignored and is critical for people's real understanding.So I believe [there is] critical reform we have to do in computer-based math. We have got to make sure that we can move our economies forward, and also our societies, based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics. This isn't some optional extra. And the country that does this first will, in my view, leapfrog others in achieving a new economy even, an improved economy, an improved outlook. In fact, I even talk about us moving from what we often call now the \"knowledge economy\" to what we might call a \"computational knowledge economy,\" where high-level math is integral to what everyone does in the way that knowledge currently is. We can engage so many more students with this, and they can have a better time doing it. And let's understand: this is not an incremental sort of change. We're trying to cross the chasm here between school math and the real-world math. And you know if you walk across a chasm, you end up making it worse than if you didn't start at all \u2014 bigger disaster. No, what I'm suggesting is that we should leap off, we should increase our velocity so it's high, and we should leap off one side and go the other \u2014 of course, having calculated our differential equation very carefully.(Laughter)So I want to see a completely renewed, changed math curriculum built from the ground up, based on computers being there, computers that are now ubiquitous almost. Calculating machines are everywhere and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years. Now I'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math, but what I am sure is it's the mainstream subject of the future. Let's go for it, and while we're about it, let's have a bit of fun, for us, for the students and for TED here.Thanks.(Applause)", "id": 1007, "subtitle":

one's very happy.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nThose learning it\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nthink it's disconnected,\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nuninteresting and hard.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nThose trying to employ them\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nthink they don't know enough.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nGovernments realize that it's a big deal for our economies,\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nbut don't know how to fix it.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nAnd teachers are also frustrated.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nYet math is more important to the world\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nthan at any point in human history.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nSo at one end we've got falling interest\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nin education in math,\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nand at the other end we've got a more mathematical world,\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\na more quantitative world than we ever have had.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nSo what's the problem, why has this chasm opened up,\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nand what can we do to fix it?\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nWell actually, I think the answer\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nis staring us right in the face:\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nUse computers.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nI believe\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nthat correctly using computers\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nis the silver bullet\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nfor making math education work.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nSo to explain that,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nlet me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nand what it looks like in education.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nSee, in the real world\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nmath isn't necessarily done by mathematicians.\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nIt's done by geologists,\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nengineers, biologists,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nall sorts of different people --\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nmodeling and simulation.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nIt's actually very popular.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nBut in education it looks very different --\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\ndumbed-down problems, lots of calculating,\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nmostly by hand.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nLots of things that seem simple\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nand not difficult like in the real world,\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nexcept if you're learning it.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nAnd another thing about math:\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nmath sometimes looks like math --\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nlike in this example here --\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nand sometimes it doesn't --\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nlike \"Am I drunk?\"\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nAnd then you get an answer that's quantitative in the modern world.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nYou wouldn't have expected that a few years back.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nBut now you can find out all about --\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nunfortunately, my weight is a little higher than that, but --\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nall about what happens.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nSo let's zoom out a bit and ask,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nwhy are we teaching people math?\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nWhat's the point of teaching people math?\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nAnd in particular, why are we teaching them math in general?\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nWhy is it such an important part of education\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nas a sort of compulsory subject?\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nWell, I think there are about three reasons:\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\ntechnical jobs\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nso critical to the development of our economies,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nwhat I call \"everyday living\" --\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nto function in the world today,\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nyou've got to be pretty quantitative,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nmuch more so than a few years ago:\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nfigure out your mortgages,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nbeing skeptical of government statistics, those kinds of things --\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nand thirdly, what I would call something like\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nlogical mind training, logical thinking.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nOver the years\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nwe've put so much in society\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\ninto being able to process and think logically. It's part of human society.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nIt's very important to learn that\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nmath is a great way to do that.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nSo let's ask another question.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nWhat is math?\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nWhat do we mean when we say we're doing math,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nor educating people to do math?\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nWell, I think it's about four steps, roughly speaking,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nstarting with posing the right question.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nWhat is it that we want to ask? What is it we're trying to find out here?\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nAnd this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nbeyond virtually any other part of doing math.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nPeople ask the wrong question,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nand surprisingly enough, they get the wrong answer,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nfor that reason, if not for others.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nSo the next thing is take that problem\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nand turn it from a real world problem\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\ninto a math problem.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nThat's stage two.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nOnce you've done that, then there's the computation step.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nTurn it from that into some answer\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nin a mathematical form.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nAnd of course, math is very powerful at doing that.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nAnd then finally, turn it back to the real world.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nDid it answer the question?\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nAnd also verify it -- crucial step.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nNow here's the crazy thing right now.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nIn math education,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nwe're spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nteaching people to do step three by hand.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nYet, that's the one step computers can do\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nbetter than any human after years of practice.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nInstead, we ought to be using computers\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nto do step three\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nand using the students to spend much more effort\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\non learning how to do steps one, two and four --\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nconceptualizing problems, applying them,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\ngetting the teacher to run them through how to do that.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nSee, crucial point here:\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nmath is not equal to calculating.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nMath is a much broader subject than calculating.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nNow it's understandable that this has all got intertwined\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nover hundreds of years.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nThere was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nBut in the last few decades\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nthat has totally changed.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nWe've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nthat I could ever imagine with computers.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nCalculating was typically the limiting step,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nand now often it isn't.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nSo I think in terms of the fact that math\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nhas been liberated from calculating.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nBut that math liberation didn't get into education yet.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nSee, I think of calculating, in a sense,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nas the machinery of math.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nIt's the chore.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nIt's the thing you'd like to avoid if you can, like to get a machine to do.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nIt's a means to an end, not an end in itself,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nand automation allows us\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nto have that machinery.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nComputers allow us to do that --\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nand this is not a small problem by any means.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nI estimated that, just today, across the world,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nwe spent about 106 average world lifetimes\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nteaching people how to calculate by hand.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nThat's an amazing amount of human endeavor.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nSo we better be damn sure --\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nand by the way, they didn't even have fun doing it, most of them --\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nso we better be damn sure\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nthat we know why we're doing that\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nand it has a real purpose.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nI think we should be assuming computers\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nfor doing the calculating\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nand only doing hand calculations where it really makes sense to teach people that.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nAnd I think there are some cases.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nFor example: mental arithmetic.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nI still do a lot of that, mainly for estimating.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nPeople say, \"Is such and such true?\"\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nAnd I'll say, \"Hmm, not sure.\" I'll think about it roughly.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nIt's still quicker to do that and more practical.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nSo I think practicality is one case\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nwhere it's worth teaching people by hand.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nAnd then there are certain conceptual things\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nthat can also benefit from hand calculating,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nbut I think they're relatively small in number.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nOne thing I often ask about\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nis ancient Greek and how this relates.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nSee, the thing we're doing right now\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nis we're forcing people to learn mathematics.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nIt's a major subject.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nI'm not for one minute suggesting that, if people are interested in hand calculating\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nor in following their own interests\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nin any subject however bizarre --\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nthey should do that.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nThat's absolutely the right thing,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nfor people to follow their self-interest.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nI was somewhat interested in ancient Greek,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nbut I don't think that we should force the entire population\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nto learn a subject like ancient Greek.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nI don't think it's warranted.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nSo I have this distinction between what we're making people do\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nand the subject that's sort of mainstream\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nand the subject that, in a sense, people might follow with their own interest\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nand perhaps even be spiked into doing that.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nSo what are the issues people bring up with this?\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nWell one of them is, they say, you need to get the basics first.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nYou shouldn't use the machine\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nuntil you get the basics of the subject.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nSo my usual question is, what do you mean by \"basics?\"\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nBasics of what?\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nAre the basics of driving a car\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nlearning how to service it, or design it for that matter?\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nAre the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill?\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nI don't think so.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nI think you need to separate the basics of what you're trying to do\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nfrom how it gets done\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nand the machinery of how it gets done\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nand automation allows you to make that separation.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nA hundred years ago, it's certainly true that to drive a car\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nyou kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nand how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nBut automation in cars\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nallowed that to separate,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nso driving is now a quite separate subject, so to speak,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nfrom engineering of the car\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nor learning how to service it.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nSo automation allows this separation\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nand also allows -- in the case of driving,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nand I believe also in the future case of maths --\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\na democratized way of doing that.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nIt can be spread across a much larger number of people\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nwho can really work with that.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nSo there's another thing that comes up with basics.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nPeople confuse, in my view,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nthe order of the invention of the tools\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nwith the order in which they should use them for teaching.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nSo just because paper was invented before computers,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nit doesn't necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nby using paper instead of a computer\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nto teach mathematics.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nMy daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nShe enjoys making what she calls \"paper laptops.\"\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nSo I asked her one day, \"You know, when I was your age,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nI didn't make these.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nWhy do you think that was?\"\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nAnd after a second or two, carefully reflecting,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nshe said, \"No paper?\"\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nIf you were born after computers and paper,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nit doesn't really matter which order you're taught with them in,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nyou just want to have the best tool.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nSo another one that comes up is \"Computers dumb math down.\"\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nThat somehow, if you use a computer,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nit's all mindless button-pushing,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nbut if you do it by hand,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nit's all intellectual.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nThis one kind of annoys me, I must say.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nDo we really believe\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nthat the math that most people are doing in school\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\npractically today\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nis more than applying procedures\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nto problems they don't really understand, for reasons they don't get?\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nI don't think so.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nAnd what's worse, what they're learning there isn't even practically useful anymore.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nMight have been 50 years ago, but it isn't anymore.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nWhen they're out of education, they do it on a computer.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nJust to be clear, I think computers can really help with this problem,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nactually make it more conceptual.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nNow, of course, like any great tool,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nthey can be used completely mindlessly,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nlike turning everything into a multimedia show,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nlike the example I was shown of solving an equation by hand,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nwhere the computer was the teacher --\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nshow the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nThis is just nuts.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nWhy are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nthat the computer should be doing anyway?\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nAll backwards.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nLet me show you\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nthat you can also make problems harder to calculate.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nSee, normally in school,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nyou do things like solve quadratic equations.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nBut you see, when you're using a computer,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nyou can just substitute.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nYou can make it a quartic equation. Make it kind of harder, calculating-wise.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nSame principles applied --\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\ncalculations, harder.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nAnd problems in the real world\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nlook nutty and horrible like this.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nThey've got hair all over them.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nThey're not just simple, dumbed-down things that we see in school math.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nAnd think of the outside world.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nDo we really believe that engineering and biology\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nand all of these other things\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nthat have so benefited from computers and maths\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nhave somehow conceptually gotten reduced by using computers?\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nI don't think so -- quite the opposite.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nSo the problem we've really got in math education\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nis not that computers might dumb it down,\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nbut that we have dumbed-down problems right now.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nWell, another issue people bring up\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nis somehow that hand calculating procedures\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nteach understanding.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nSo if you go through lots of examples,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nyou can get the answer,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nyou can understand how the basics of the system work better.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nI think there is one thing that I think very valid here,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nwhich is that I think understanding procedures and processes is important.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nBut there's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nIt's called programming.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nProgramming is how most procedures and processes\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nget written down these days,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nand it's also a great way\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nto engage students much more\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nand to check they really understand.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nIf you really want to check you understand math\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nthen write a program to do it.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nSo programming is the way I think we should be doing that.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nSo to be clear, what I really am suggesting here\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nis we have a unique opportunity\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nto make maths both more practical\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nand more conceptual, simultaneously.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nI can't think of any other subject where that's recently been possible.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nIt's usually some kind of choice\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nbetween the vocational and the intellectual.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nBut I think we can do both at the same time here.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nAnd we open up so many more possibilities.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nYou can do so many more problems.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nWhat I really think we gain from this\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nis students getting intuition and experience\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nin far greater quantities than they've ever got before.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nAnd experience of harder problems --\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nbeing able to play with the math, interact with it,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nfeel it.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nWe want people who can feel the math instinctively.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nThat's what computers allow us to do.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nAnother thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nTraditionally it's been by how difficult it is to calculate,\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nbut now we can reorder it\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nby how difficult it is to understand the concepts,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nhowever hard the calculating.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nSo calculus has traditionally been taught very late.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nWhy is this?\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nWell, it's damn hard doing the calculations, that's the problem.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nBut actually many of the concepts\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nare amenable to a much younger age group.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nThis was an example I built for my daughter.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nAnd very, very simple.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nWe were talking about what happens\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nwhen you increase the number of sides of a polygon\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nto a very large number.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nAnd of course, it turns into a circle.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nAnd by the way, she was also very insistent\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\non being able to change the color,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nan important feature for this demonstration.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nYou can see that this is a very early step\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\ninto limits and differential calculus\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nand what happens when you take things to an extreme --\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nand very small sides and a very large number of sides.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nVery simple example.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nThat's a view of the world\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nthat we don't usually give people for many, many years after this.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nAnd yet, that's a really important practical view of the world.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nSo one of the roadblocks we have\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nin moving this agenda forward\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nis exams.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nIn the end, if we test everyone by hand in exams,\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nit's kind of hard to get the curricula changed\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nto a point where they can use computers\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nduring the semesters.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nAnd one of the reasons it's so important --\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nso it's very important to get computers in exams.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nAnd then we can ask questions, real questions,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nquestions like, what's the best life insurance policy to get? --\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nreal questions that people have in their everyday lives.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nAnd you see, this isn't some dumbed-down model here.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nThis is an actual model where we can be asked to optimize what happens.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nHow many years of protection do I need?\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nWhat does that do to the payments\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nand to the interest rates and so forth?\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nNow I'm not for one minute suggesting it's the only kind of question\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nthat should be asked in exams,\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nbut I think it's a very important type\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nthat right now just gets completely ignored\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nand is critical for people's real understanding.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nSo I believe [there is] critical reform\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nwe have to do in computer-based math.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nWe have got to make sure\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nthat we can move our economies forward,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nand also our societies,\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nbased on the idea that people can really feel mathematics.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nThis isn't some optional extra.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nAnd the country that does this first\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nwill, in my view, leapfrog others\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nin achieving a new economy even,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nan improved economy,\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nan improved outlook.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nIn fact, I even talk about us moving\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nfrom what we often call now the \"knowledge economy\"\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nto what we might call a \"computational knowledge economy,\"\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nwhere high-level math is integral to what everyone does\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nin the way that knowledge currently is.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nWe can engage so many more students with this,\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nand they can have a better time doing it.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nAnd let's understand:\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nthis is not an incremental sort of change.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nWe're trying to cross the chasm here\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nbetween school math and the real-world math.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nAnd you know if you walk across a chasm,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nyou end up making it worse than if you didn't start at all --\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nbigger disaster.\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nNo, what I'm suggesting\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nis that we should leap off,\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nwe should increase our velocity\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nso it's high,\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nand we should leap off one side and go the other --\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nof course, having calculated our differential equation very carefully.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nSo I want to see\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\na completely renewed, changed math curriculum\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nbuilt from the ground up,\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nbased on computers being there,\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\ncomputers that are now ubiquitous almost.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nCalculating machines are everywhere\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nand will be completely everywhere in a small number of years.\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nNow I'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math,\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nbut what I am sure is\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nit's the mainstream subject of the future.\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nLet's go for it,\n\n00:16:52.958 -->

"https://www.ted.com/talks/denis_dutton_a_darwinian_theory_of_beauty", "transcript": "Delighted to be here and to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart, which is beauty. I do the philosophy of art, aesthetics, actually, for a living. I try to figure out intellectually, philosophically, psychologically, what the experience of beauty is, what sensibly can be said about it and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it. Now this is an extremely complicated subject, in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different. I mean just think of the sheer variety \u2014 a baby's face, Berlioz's \"Harold in Italy,\" movies like \"The Wizard of Oz\" or the plays of Chekhov, a central California landscape, a Hokusai view of Mt. Fuji, \"Der Rosenkavalier,\" a stunning match-winning goal in a World Cup soccer match, Van Gogh's \"Starry Night,\" a Jane Austen novel, Fred Astaire dancing across the screen. This brief list includes human beings, natural landforms, works of art and skilled human actions. An account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy.I can, however, give you at least a taste of what I regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have. And we get it not from a philosopher of art, not from a postmodern art theorist or a bigwig art critic. No, this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding, and you know who I mean: Charles Darwin. Of course, a lot of people think they already know the proper answer to the question, \"What is beauty?\" It's in the eye of the beholder. It's whatever moves you personally. Or, as some people, especially academics prefer, beauty is in the culturally conditioned eye of the beholder. People agree that paintings or movies or music are beautiful because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste. Taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease. Beethoven is adored in Japan. Peruvians love Japanese woodblock prints. Inca sculptures are regarded as treasures in British museums, while Shakespeare is translated into every major language of the Earth. Or just think about American jazz or American movies \u2014 they go everywhere. There are many differences among the arts, but there are also universal, cross-cultural aesthetic pleasures and values.How can we explain this universality? The best answer lies in trying to reconstruct a Darwinian evolutionary history of our artistic and aesthetic tastes. We need to reverse-engineer our present artistic tastes and preferences and explain how they came to be engraved in our minds by the actions of both our prehistoric, largely pleistocene environments, where we became fully human, but also by the social situations in which we evolved. This reverse engineering can also enlist help from the human record preserved in prehistory. I mean fossils, cave paintings and so forth. And it should take into account what we know of the aesthetic interests of isolated hunter-gatherer bands that survived into the 19th and the 20th centuries.Now, I personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty, with its emotional intensity and pleasure, belongs to our evolved human psychology. The experience of beauty is one component in a whole series of Darwinian adaptations. Beauty is an adaptive effect, which we extend and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment. As many of you will know, evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms. The first of these is natural selection \u2014 that's random mutation and selective retention \u2014 along with our basic anatomy and physiology \u2014 the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails. Natural selection also explains many basic revulsions, such as the horrid smell of rotting meat, or fears, such as the fear of snakes or standing close to the edge of a cliff. Natural selection also explains pleasures \u2014 sexual pleasure, our liking for sweet, fat and proteins, which in turn explains a lot of popular foods, from ripe fruits through chocolate malts and barbecued ribs.The other great principle of evolution is sexual selection, and it operates very differently. The peacock's magnificent tail is the most famous example of this. It did not evolve for natural survival. In fact, it goes against natural survival. No, the peacock's tail results from the mating choices made by peahens. It's quite a familiar story. It's women who actually push history forward. Darwin himself, by the way, had no doubts that the peacock's tail was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen. He actually used that word. Now, keeping these ideas firmly in mind, we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination, even obsession, in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction. Beauty is nature's way of acting at a distance, so to speak. I mean, you can't expect to eat an adaptively beneficial landscape. It would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover. So evolution's trick is to make them beautiful, to have them exert a kind of magnetism to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them.Consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure, the magnetic pull of beautiful landscapes. People in very different cultures all over the world tend to like a particular kind of landscape, a landscape that just happens to be similar to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved. This landscape shows up today on calendars, on postcards, in the design of golf courses and public parks and in gold-framed pictures that hang in living rooms from New York to New Zealand. It's a kind of Hudson River school landscape featuring open spaces of low grasses interspersed with copses of trees. The trees, by the way, are often preferred if they fork near the ground, that is to say, if they're trees you could scramble up if you were in a tight fix. The landscape shows the presence of water directly in view, or evidence of water in a bluish distance, indications of animal or bird life as well as diverse greenery and finally \u2014 get this \u2014 a path or a road, perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline, that extends into the distance, almost inviting you to follow it. This landscape type is regarded as beautiful, even by people in countries that don't have it. The ideal savanna landscape is one of the clearest examples where human beings everywhere find beauty in similar visual experience.But, someone might argue, that's natural beauty. How about artistic beauty? Isn't that exhaustively cultural? No, I don't think it is. And once again, I'd like to look back to prehistory to say something about it. It is widely assumed that the earliest human artworks are the stupendously skillful cave paintings that we all know from Lascaux and Chauvet. Chauvet caves are about 32,000 years old, along with a few small, realistic sculptures of women and animals from the same period. But artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that. Beautiful shell necklaces that look like something you'd see at an arts and crafts fair, as well as ochre body paint, have been found from around 100,000 years ago.But the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts are older even than this. I have in mind the so-called Acheulian hand axes. The oldest stone tools are choppers from the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa. They go back about two-and-a-half-million years. These crude tools were around for thousands of centuries, until around 1.4 million years ago when Homo erectus started shaping single, thin stone blades, sometimes rounded ovals, but often in what are to our eyes an arresting, symmetrical pointed leaf or teardrop form. These Acheulian hand axes \u2014 they're named after St. Acheul in France, where finds were made in 19th century \u2014 have been unearthed in their thousands, scattered across Asia, Europe and Africa, almost everywhere Homo erectus and Homo ergaster roamed. Now, the sheer numbers of these hand axes shows that they can't have been made for butchering animals. And the plot really thickens when you realize that, unlike other pleistocene tools, the hand axes often exhibit no evidence of wear on their delicate blade edges. And some, in any event, are too big to use for butchery. Their symmetry, their attractive materials and, above all, their meticulous workmanship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes, even today.So what were these ancient \u2014 I mean, they're ancient, they're foreign, but they're at the same time somehow familiar. What were these artifacts for? The best available answer is that they were literally the earliest known works of art, practical tools transformed into captivating aesthetic objects, contemplated both for their elegant shape and their virtuoso craftsmanship. Hand axes mark an evolutionary advance in human history \u2014 tools fashioned to function as what Darwinians call \"fitness signals\" \u2014 that is to say, displays that are performances like the peacock's tail, except that, unlike hair and feathers, the hand axes are consciously cleverly crafted. Competently made hand axes indicated desirable personal qualities \u2014 intelligence, fine motor control, planning ability, conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials. Over tens of thousands of generations, such skills increased the status of those who displayed them and gained a reproductive advantage over the less capable. You know, it's an old line, but it has been shown to work \u2014 \"Why don't you come up to my cave, so I can show you my hand axes?\"(Laughter)Except, of course, what's interesting about this is that we can't be sure how that idea was conveyed, because the Homo erectus that made these objects did not have language. It's hard to grasp, but it's an incredible fact. This object was made by a hominid ancestor, Homo erectus or Homo ergaster, between 50,000 and 100,000 years before language. Stretching over a million years, the hand axe tradition is the longest artistic tradition in human and proto-human history. By the end of the hand axe epic, Homo sapiens \u2014 as they were then called, finally \u2014 were doubtless finding new ways to amuse and amaze each other by, who knows, telling jokes, storytelling, dancing, or hairstyling. Yes, hairstyling \u2014 I insist on that.For us moderns, virtuoso technique is used to create imaginary worlds in fiction and in movies, to express intense emotions with music, painting and dance. But still, one fundamental trait of the ancestral personality persists in our aesthetic cravings: the beauty we find in skilled performances. From Lascaux to the Louvre to Carnegie Hall, human beings have a permanent innate taste for virtuoso displays in the arts. We find beauty in something done well.So the next time you pass a jewelry shop window displaying a beautifully cut teardrop-shaped stone, don't be so sure it's just your culture telling you that that sparkling jewel is beautiful. Your distant ancestors loved that shape and found beauty in the skill needed to make it, even before they could put their love into words. Is beauty in the eye of the beholder? No, it's deep in our minds. It's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills and rich emotional lives of our most ancient ancestors. Our powerful reaction to images, to the expression of emotion in art, to the beauty of music, to the night sky, will be with us and our descendants for as long as the human race exists.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1008, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nDelighted to be here\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nand to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart,\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nwhich is beauty.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nI do the philosophy of art, aesthetics,\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nactually, for a living.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nI try to figure out intellectually,\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nphilosophically, psychologically,\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nwhat the experience of beauty is,\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nwhat sensibly can be said about it\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nand how people go off the rails in trying to understand it.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nNow this is an extremely complicated subject,\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nin part because the things that we call beautiful\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nare so different.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nI mean just think of the sheer variety --\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\na baby's face,\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nBerlioz's \"Harold in Italy,\"\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nmovies like \"The Wizard of Oz\"\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nor the plays of Chekhov,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\na central California landscape,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\na Hokusai view of Mt.

00:03:34.958\nlargely pleistocene environments,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nwhere we became fully human,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nbut also by the social situations\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nin which we evolved.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nThis reverse engineering\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\ncan also enlist help\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nfrom the human record\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\npreserved in prehistory.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nI mean fossils, cave paintings and so forth.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nAnd it should take into account\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nwhat we know of the aesthetic interests\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nof isolated hunter-gatherer bands\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nthat survived into the 19th and the 20th centuries.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nNow, I personally\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nhave no doubt whatsoever\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nthat the experience of beauty,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nwith its emotional intensity and pleasure,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nbelongs to our evolved human psychology.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nThe experience of beauty is one component\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nin a whole series of Darwinian adaptations.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nBeauty is an adaptive effect,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nwhich we extend\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nand intensify\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nin the creation and enjoyment\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nof works of art and entertainment.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nAs many of you will know,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nevolution operates by two main primary mechanisms.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nThe first of these is natural selection --\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nthat's random mutation and selective retention --\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nalong with our basic anatomy and physiology --\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nthe evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nNatural selection also explains\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nmany basic revulsions,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nsuch as the horrid smell of rotting meat,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nor fears, such as the fear of snakes\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nor standing close to the edge of a cliff.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nNatural selection also explains pleasures --\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nsexual pleasure,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nour liking for sweet, fat and proteins,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nwhich in turn explains a lot of popular foods,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nfrom ripe fruits through chocolate malts\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nand barbecued ribs.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nThe other great principle of evolution\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nis sexual selection,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nand it operates very differently.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nThe peacock's magnificent tail\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nis the most famous example of this.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nIt did not evolve for natural survival.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nIn fact, it goes against natural survival.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nNo, the peacock's tail\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nresults from the mating choices\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nmade by peahens.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nIt's quite a familiar story.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nIt's women who actually push history forward.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nDarwin himself, by the way,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nhad no doubts that the peacock's tail\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nwas beautiful in the eyes of the peahen.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nHe actually used that word.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nNow, keeping these ideas firmly in mind,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nwe can say that the experience of beauty\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nis one of the ways that evolution has\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nof arousing and sustaining\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\ninterest or fascination,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\neven obsession,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nin order to encourage us\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\ntoward making the most adaptive decisions\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nfor survival and reproduction.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nBeauty is nature's way\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nof acting at a distance,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nso to speak.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nI mean, you can't expect to eat\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nan adaptively beneficial landscape.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nIt would hardly do to eat your baby\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nor your lover.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nSo evolution's trick\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nis to make them beautiful,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nto have them exert a kind of magnetism\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nto give you the pleasure of simply looking at them.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nConsider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nthe magnetic pull\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nof beautiful landscapes.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nPeople in very different cultures\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nall over the world\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\ntend to like a particular kind of landscape,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\na landscape that just happens to be similar\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nto the pleistocene savannas where we evolved.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nThis landscape shows up today\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\non calendars, on postcards,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nin the design of golf courses and public parks\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nand in gold-framed pictures\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nthat hang in living rooms\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nfrom New York to New Zealand.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nIt's a kind of Hudson River school landscape\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nfeaturing open spaces\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nof low grasses\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\ninterspersed with copses of trees.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nThe trees, by the way, are often preferred\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nif they fork near the ground,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nthat is to say, if they're trees you could scramble up\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nif you were in a tight fix.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nThe landscape shows the presence\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nof water directly in view,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nor evidence of water in a bluish distance,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nindications of animal or bird life\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nas well as diverse greenery\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nand finally -- get this --\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\na path\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nor a road,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nperhaps a riverbank or a shoreline,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nthat extends into the distance,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nalmost inviting you to follow it.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nThis landscape type is regarded as beautiful,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\neven by people in countries\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nthat don't have it.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nThe ideal savanna landscape\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nis one of the clearest examples\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nwhere human beings everywhere\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nfind beauty\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nin similar visual experience.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nBut, someone might argue,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nthat's natural beauty.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nHow about artistic beauty?\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nIsn't that exhaustively cultural?\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nNo, I don't think it is.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nAnd once again, I'd like to look back to prehistory\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nto say something about it.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nIt is widely assumed\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nthat the earliest human artworks\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nare the stupendously skillful cave paintings\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nthat we all know from Lascaux\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nand Chauvet.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nChauvet caves\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nare about 32,000 years old,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nalong with a few small, realistic sculptures\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nof women and animals from the same period.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nBut artistic and decorative skills\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nare actually much older than that.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nBeautiful shell necklaces\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nthat look like something you'd see at an arts and crafts fair,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nas well as ochre body paint,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nhave been found\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nfrom around 100,000 years ago.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nBut the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nare older even than this.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nI have in mind\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nthe so-called Acheulian hand axes.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nThe oldest stone tools are choppers\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nfrom the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nThey go back about two-and-a-half-million years.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nThese crude tools\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nwere around for thousands of centuries,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nuntil around 1.4 million years ago\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nwhen Homo erectus\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nstarted shaping\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nsingle, thin stone blades,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nsometimes rounded ovals,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nbut often in what are to our eyes\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nan arresting, symmetrical pointed leaf\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nor teardrop form.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nThese Acheulian hand axes --\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nthey're named after St. Acheul in France,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nwhere finds were made in 19th century --\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nhave been unearthed in their thousands,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nscattered across Asia, Europe and Africa,\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nalmost everywhere Homo erectus\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nand Homo ergaster roamed.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nNow, the sheer numbers of these hand axes\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nshows that they can't have been made\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nfor butchering animals.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nAnd the plot really thickens when you realize\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nthat, unlike other pleistocene tools,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nthe hand axes often exhibit\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nno evidence of wear\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\non their delicate blade edges.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nAnd some, in any event, are too big\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nto use for butchery.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nTheir symmetry, their attractive materials\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nand, above all,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\ntheir meticulous workmanship\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nare simply quite beautiful\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nto our eyes, even today.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nSo what were these ancient --\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nI mean, they're ancient, they're foreign,\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nbut they're at the same time\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nsomehow familiar.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nWhat were these artifacts for?\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nThe best available answer\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nis that they were literally\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nthe earliest known works of art,\n\n00:11:30.958 -->

ride can teach you", "duration": "946", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/shimon_schocken_s_rides_of_hope", "transcript": "Mountain biking in Israel is something that I do with great passion and commitment. And when I'm on my bike, I feel that I connect with the profound beauty of Israel, and I feel that I'm united with this country's history and biblical law. And also, for me, biking is a matter of empowerment. When I reach the summit of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere, I feel young, invincible, eternal. It's as if I'm connecting with some legacy or with some energy far greater than myself. You can see my fellow riders at the end of the picture, looking at me with some concern. And here is another picture of them. Unfortunately, I cannot show their faces, neither can I disclose their true names, and that's because my fellow riders are juvenile inmates, offenders spending time in a correction facility about 20 minutes' ride from here \u2014 well, like everything in Israel. And I've been riding with these kids once a week, every Tuesday, rain or shine, for the last four years and by now, they've become a very big part of my life.This story began four years ago. The correction facility where they are locked up happens to be right in the middle of one of my usual trips, and it's surrounded by barbed wires and electric gates and armed guards. So on one of these rides, I talked my way into the compound and went to see the warden. I told the warden that I wanted to start a mountain biking club in this place and that basically I wanted to take the kids from here to there. And I told him, \"Let's find a way in which I'll be able to take out 10 kids once a week to ride with in the summer in the country.\" And the warden was quite amused, and he told me he thought that I was a nut and he told me, \"This place is a correction facility. These guys are serious offenders. They are supposed to be locked up. They aren't supposed to be out at large.\" And yet, we began to talk about it, and one thing led to another. And I can't see myself going into a state prison in New Jersey and making such a proposition, but this being Israel, the warden somehow made it happen. And so two months later, we found ourselves \"at large\" \u2014 myself, 10 juvenile inmates and a wonderful fellow named Russ, who became a very good friend of mine and my partner in this project.And in the next few weeks, I had the tremendous pleasure of introducing these kids to the world of total freedom, a world consisting of magnificent vistas like these \u2014 everything you see here is obviously in Israel \u2014 as well as close encounters with all sorts of small creatures coming in all sorts of sizes, colors, shapes, forms and so on. In spite of all this splendor, the beginning was extremely frustrating. Every small obstacle, every slight uphill, would cause these fellows to stop in their tracks and give up. So we had a lot of this going on. I found out that they had a very hard time dealing with frustration and difficulties \u2014 not because they were physically unfit. But that's one reason why they ended up where they were. And I became increasingly more and more agitated, because I was there not only to be with them, but also to ride and create a team and I didn't know what to do.Now, let me give you an example. We're going downhill in some rocky terrain, and the front tire of Alex gets caught in one of these crevasses here. So he crashes down, and he gets slightly injured, but this does not prevent him from jumping up and then starting to jump up and down on his bike and curse violently. Then he throws his helmet in the air. His backpack goes ballistic in some other direction. And then he runs to the nearest tree and starts to break branches and throw rocks and curse like I've never heard. And I'm just standing there, watching this scene with a complete disbelief, not knowing what to do. I'm used to algorithms and data structures and super motivated students, and nothing in my background prepared me to deal with a raging, violent adolescent in the middle of nowhere. And you have to realize that these incidents did not happen in convenient locations. They happened in places like this, in the Judean Desert, 20 kilometers away from the nearest road. And what you don't see in this picture is that somewhere between these riders there, there's a teenager sitting on a rock, saying, \"I'm not moving from here. Forget it. I've had it.\" Well, that's a problem because one way or another, you have to get this guy moving because it's getting dark soon and dangerous.It took me several such incidents to figure out what I was supposed to do. At the beginning, it was a disaster. I tried harsh words and threats and they took me nowhere. That's what they had all their lives. And at some point I found out, when a kid like this gets into a fit, the best thing that you can possibly do is stay as close as possible to this kid, which is difficult, because what you really want to do is go away. But that's what he had all his life, people walking away from him. So what you have to do is stay close and try to reach in and pet his shoulder or give him a piece of chocolate. So I would say, \"Alex, I know that it's terribly difficult. Why don't you rest for a few minutes and then we'll go on.\" \"Go away you maniac-psychopath. Why would you bring us to this goddamn place?\" And I would say, \"Relax, Alex. Here's a piece of chocolate.\" And Alex would go, \"Arrrrggg!\" Because you have to understand that on these rides we are constantly hungry \u2014 and after the rides also.And who is this guy, Alex, to begin with? He's a 17-year-old. When he was eight, someone put him on a boat in Odessa and sent him, shipped him to Israel on his own. And he ended up in south Tel Aviv and did not have the good luck to be picked up by a [unclear] and roamed the streets and became a prominent gang member. And he spent the last 10 years of his life in two places only, the slums and the state prison, where he spent the last two years before he ended up sitting on this rock there. And so this kid was probably abused, abandoned, ignored, betrayed by almost every adult along the way. So, for such a kid, when an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him and doesn't walk away from him in any situation, irrespective of how he behaves, it's a tremendous healing experience. It's an act of unconditional acceptance, something that he never had.I want to say a few words about vision. When I started this program four years ago, I had this original plan of creating a team of winning underdogs. I had an image of Lance Armstrong in my mind. And it took me exactly two months of complete frustration to realize that this vision was misplaced, and that there was another vision supremely more important and more readily available. It all of a sudden dawned on me, in this project, that the purpose of these rides should actually be to expose the kids to one thing only: love. Love to the country, to the uphill and the downhill, to all the incredible creatures that surround us \u2014 the animals, the plants, the insects \u2014 love and respect to other fellow members in your team, in your biking team, and most importantly, love and respect to yourself, which is something that they badly miss.Together with the kids, I also went through a remarkable transformation. Now, I come from a cutthroat world of science and high technology. I used to think that reason and logic and relentless drive were the only ways to make things happen. And before I worked with the kids, anything that I did with them, or anything that I did with myself, was supposed to be perfect, ideal, optimal, but after working with them for some time, I discovered the great virtues of empathy and flexibility and being able to start with some vision, and if the vision doesn't work, well nothing happened. All you have to do is play with it, change it a little bit, and come up with something that does help, that does work. So right now, I feel more like these are my principles, and if you don't like them, I have others.(Laughter)(Applause)And one of these principles is focus. Before each ride we sit together with the kids, and we give them one word to think about during the ride. You have to focus their attention on something because so many things happen. So these are words like \"teamwork\" or \"endurance\" or even complicated concepts like \"resource allocation\" or \"perspective,\" a word that they don't understand. You know, perspective is one of these critically important life-coping strategies that mountain biking can really teach you. I tell kids when they struggle through some uphill and feel like they cannot take it anymore, it really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles and raise your head and look around and see how the vista around you grows. It literally propels you upwards. That's what perspective is all about. Or you can also look back in time and realize that you've already conquered steeper mountains before. And that's how they develop self-esteem.Now, let me give you an example of how it works. You stand with your bike at the beginning of February. It's very cold, and you're standing in one of these rainy days, and it's drizzling and cold and chilly, and you're standing in, let's say, Yokneam. And you look up at the sky through a hole in the clouds you see the monastery at the top of the Muhraka \u2014 that's where you're supposed to climb now \u2014 and you say, \"There's no way that I could possibly get there.\" And yet, two hours later you find yourself standing on the roof of this monastery, smeared with mud, blood and sweat. And you look down at Yokneam; everything is so small and tiny. And you say, \"Hey, Alex. Look at this parking lot where we started. It's that big. I can't believe that I did it.\" And that's the point when you start loving yourself.And so we talked about these special words that we teach them. And at the end of each ride, we sit together and share moments in which those special words of the day popped up and made a difference, and these discussions can be extremely inspiring. In one of them, one of the kids once said, \"When we were riding on this ridge overlooking the Dead Sea \u2014 and he's talking about this spot here \u2014 \"I was reminded of the day when I left my village in Ethiopia and went away together with my brother. We walked 120 kilometers until we reached Sudan. This was the first place where we got some water and supplies.\" And he goes on saying, and everyone looks at him like a hero, probably for the first time in his life. And he says \u2014 because I also have volunteers riding with me, adults, who are sitting there listening to him \u2014 and he says, \"And this was just the beginning of our ordeal until we ended up in Israel. And only now,\" he says, \"I'm beginning to understand where I am, and I actually like it.\" Now I remember, when he said it, I felt goosebumps on my body, because he said it overlooking the Moab Mountains here in the background. That's where Joshua descended and crossed the Jordan and led the people of Israel into the land of Canaan 3,000 years ago in this final leg of the journey from Africa.And so, perspective and context and history play key roles in the way I plan my rides with the kids. We visit Kibbutzim that were established by Holocaust survivors. We explore ruins of Palestinian villages, and we discuss how they became ruins. And we go through numerous remnants of Jewish settlements, Nabatic settlements, Canaanite settlements \u2014 three-, four, five-thousand years old. And through this tapestry, which is the history of this country, the kids acquire what is probably the most important value in education, and that is the understanding that life is complex, and there's no black and white. And by appreciating complexity, they become more tolerant, and tolerance leads to hope.I ride with these kids once a week, every Tuesday. Here's a picture I took last Tuesday \u2014 less than a week ago \u2014 and I ride with them tomorrow also. In every one of these rides I always end up standing in one of these incredible locations, taking in this incredible landscape around me, and I feel blessed and fortunate that I'm alive, and that I sense every fiber in my aching body. And I feel blessed and fortunate that 15 years ago I had the courage to resign my tenured position at NYU and return to my home country where I can do these incredible rides with this group of troubled kids coming from Ethiopia and Morocco and Russia. And I feel blessed and fortunate that every week, every Tuesday \u2014 and actually every Friday also \u2014 I can once again celebrate in the marrow of my bones the very essence of living in Israel on the edge.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1009, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nMountain biking in Israel\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nis something that I do with great passion\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nand commitment.\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nAnd when I'm on my bike,\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nI feel that I connect\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nwith the profound beauty of Israel,\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nand I feel that I'm united\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nwith this country's history\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nand biblical law.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nAnd also, for me,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nbiking is a matter of empowerment.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nWhen I reach the summit\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nof a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere,\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nI feel young,\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.958\ninvincible, eternal.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nIt's as if I'm connecting with some legacy\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nor with some energy\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nfar greater than myself.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nYou can see my fellow riders\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nat the end of the picture,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nlooking at me with some concern.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nAnd here is another picture of them.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nUnfortunately, I cannot show their faces,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nneither can I disclose their true names,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nand that's because my fellow riders\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nare juvenile inmates,\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\noffenders\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nspending time in a correction facility\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nabout 20 minutes' ride from here --\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nwell, like everything in Israel.\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nAnd I've been riding with these kids once a week,\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nevery Tuesday, rain or shine, for the last four years\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nand by now, they've become a very big part of my life.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nThis story began four years ago.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nThe correction facility where they are locked up\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nhappens to be right in the middle\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nof one of my usual trips,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nand it's surrounded by barbed wires\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nand electric gates and armed guards.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nSo on one of these rides,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nI talked my way into the compound\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nand went to see the warden.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nI told the warden\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nthat I wanted to start a mountain biking club in this place\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nand that basically I wanted to take the kids\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nfrom here to there.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nAnd I told him, \"Let's find a way\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nin which I'll be able to take out 10 kids once a week\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nto ride with in the summer in the country.\"\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nAnd the warden was quite amused,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nand he told me he thought that I was a nut\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nand he told me,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\n\"This place is a correction facility. These guys are serious offenders.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nThey are supposed to be locked up.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nThey aren't supposed to be out at large.\"\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nAnd yet, we began to talk about it,\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nand one thing led to another.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nAnd I can't see myself\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\ngoing into a state prison in New Jersey\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nand making such a proposition,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nbut this being Israel,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nthe warden somehow made it happen.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nAnd so two months later,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nwe found ourselves \"at large\" --\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nmyself,\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\n10 juvenile inmates\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nand a wonderful fellow named Russ,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nwho became a very good friend of mine\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nand my partner in this project.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nAnd in the next few weeks, I had the tremendous pleasure\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nof introducing these kids\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nto the world of total freedom,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\na world consisting of magnificent vistas\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nlike these --\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\neverything you see here is obviously in Israel --\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nas well as close encounters\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nwith all sorts of small creatures\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\ncoming in all sorts of sizes,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\ncolors, shapes, forms\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nand so on.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nIn spite of all this splendor,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nthe beginning was extremely frustrating.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nEvery small obstacle,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nevery slight uphill,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nwould cause these fellows\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nto stop in their tracks and give up.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nSo we had a lot of this going on.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nI found out that they had a very hard time\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\ndealing with frustration and difficulties --\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nnot because they were physically unfit.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nBut that's one reason why they ended up where they were.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nAnd I became increasingly more and more agitated,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nbecause I was there\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nnot only to be with them,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nbut also to ride and create a team\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nand I didn't know what to do.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nNow, let me give you an example.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nWe're going downhill in some rocky terrain,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nand the front tire of Alex\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\ngets caught in one of these crevasses here.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nSo he crashes down,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nand he gets slightly injured,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nbut this does not prevent him from jumping up\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nand then starting to jump up and down on his bike\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nand curse violently.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nThen he throws his helmet in the air.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nHis backpack goes ballistic in some other direction.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nAnd then he runs to the nearest tree\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nand starts to break branches and throw rocks\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nand curse like I've never heard.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nAnd I'm just standing there,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nwatching this scene\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nwith a complete disbelief,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nnot knowing what to do.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nI'm used to algorithms\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nand data structures\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nand super motivated students,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nand nothing in my background\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nprepared me to deal\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nwith a raging, violent adolescent\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nin the middle of nowhere.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nAnd you have to realize that these incidents\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\ndid not happen in convenient locations.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nThey happened in places like this,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nin the Judean Desert,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\n20 kilometers away from the nearest road.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nAnd what you don't see in this picture\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nis that somewhere between these riders there,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nthere's a teenager sitting on a rock,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nsaying, \"I'm not moving from here. Forget it.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nI've had it.\"\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nWell, that's a problem\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nbecause one way or another, you have to get this guy moving\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nbecause it's getting dark soon and dangerous.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nIt took me several such incidents to figure out what I was supposed to do.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nAt the beginning, it was a disaster.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nI tried harsh words and threats\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nand they took me nowhere.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nThat's what they had all their lives.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nAnd at some point I found out,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nwhen a kid like this gets into a fit,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nthe best thing that you can possibly do\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nis stay as close as possible to this kid,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nwhich is difficult,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nbecause what you really want to do is go away.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nBut that's what he had all his life,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\npeople walking away from him.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nSo what you have to do is stay close\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nand try to reach in\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nand pet his shoulder\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nor give him a piece of chocolate.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nSo I would say, \"Alex, I know that it's terribly difficult.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nWhy don't you rest for a few minutes\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nand then we'll go on.\"\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\n\"Go away you maniac-psychopath.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nWhy would you bring us to this goddamn place?\"\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nAnd I would say, \"Relax, Alex.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nHere's a piece of chocolate.\"\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nAnd Alex would go, \"Arrrrggg!\"\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nBecause you have to understand\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nthat on these rides we are constantly hungry --\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nand after the rides also.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nAnd who is this guy, Alex, to begin with?\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nHe's a 17-year-old.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nWhen he was eight,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nsomeone put him on a boat in Odessa\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nand sent him, shipped him to Israel\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\non his own.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nAnd he ended up in south Tel Aviv\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nand did not have the good luck\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nto be picked up by a [unclear]\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nand roamed the streets\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nand became a prominent gang member.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nAnd he spent the last 10 years of his life\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nin two places only,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nthe slums and the state prison,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nwhere he spent the last two years\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nbefore he ended up sitting on this rock there.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nAnd so this kid\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nwas probably abused,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nabandoned, ignored, betrayed\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nby almost every adult along the way.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nSo, for such a kid,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nwhen an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nand doesn't walk away from him\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nin any situation,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nirrespective of how he behaves,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nit's a tremendous healing experience.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nIt's an act of unconditional acceptance,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nsomething that he never had.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nI want to say a few words about vision.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nWhen I started this program four years ago,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nI had this original plan\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nof creating a team\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nof winning underdogs.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nI had an image of Lance Armstrong\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nin my mind.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nAnd it took me exactly two months\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nof complete frustration\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nto realize that this vision\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nwas misplaced,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nand that there was another vision\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nsupremely more important\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nand more readily available.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nIt all of a sudden dawned on me, in this project,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nthat the purpose of these rides\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nshould actually be\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nto expose the kids\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nto one thing only: love.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nLove to the country, to the uphill\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nand the downhill,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nto all the incredible creatures that surround us --\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nthe animals, the plants,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nthe insects --\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nlove and respect\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nto other fellow members in your team,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nin your biking team,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nand most importantly,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nlove and respect to yourself,\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nwhich is something\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nthat they badly miss.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nTogether with the kids,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nI also went through a remarkable transformation.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nNow, I come from a cutthroat world\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nof science and high technology.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nI used to think that reason and logic\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nand relentless drive\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nwere the only ways to make things happen.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nAnd before I worked with the kids,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nanything that I did with them,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nor anything that I did with myself,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nwas supposed to be perfect,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nideal, optimal,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nbut after working with them for some time,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nI discovered the great virtues of empathy\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nand flexibility\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nand being able to start with some vision,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nand if the vision doesn't work, well nothing happened.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nAll you have to do is play with it, change it a little bit,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nand come up with something that does help, that does work.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nSo right now, I feel more\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nlike these are my principles,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nand if you don't like them,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nI have others.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:01.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nAnd one of these principles\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nis focus.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nBefore each ride\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nwe sit together with the kids,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nand we give them one word\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nto think about during the ride.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nYou have to focus their attention on something\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nbecause so many things happen.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nSo these are words like \"teamwork\"\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nor \"endurance\"\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nor even complicated concepts\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nlike \"resource allocation\"\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nor \"perspective,\" a word that they don't understand.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nYou know, perspective\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nis one of these critically important\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nlife-coping strategies\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nthat mountain biking can really teach you.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nI tell kids\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nwhen they struggle through some uphill\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nand feel like they cannot take it anymore,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nit really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nand raise your head and look around\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nand see how the vista around you grows.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nIt literally propels you upwards.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nThat's what perspective is all about.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nOr you can also look back in time\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nand realize that you've already conquered\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nsteeper mountains before.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nAnd that's how they develop self-esteem.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nNow, let me give you an example of how it works.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nYou stand with your bike at the beginning of February.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nIt's very cold, and you're standing in one of these rainy days,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nand it's drizzling\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nand cold and chilly,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nand you're standing in, let's say, Yokneam.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAnd you look up at the sky through a hole in the clouds\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nyou see the monastery at the top of the Muhraka --\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nthat's where you're supposed to climb now --\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nand you say, \"There's no way that I could possibly get there.\"\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nAnd yet, two hours later\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nyou find yourself standing on the roof of this monastery,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nsmeared with mud,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nblood and sweat.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nAnd you look down at Yokneam;\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\neverything is so small and tiny.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nAnd you say, \"Hey, Alex. Look at this parking lot where we started.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nIt's that big.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nI can't believe that I did it.\"\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nAnd that's the point\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nwhen you start loving yourself.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nAnd so we talked about\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nthese special words that we teach them.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nAnd at the end of each ride, we sit together\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand share moments\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nin which those special words of the day\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\npopped up and made a difference,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nand these discussions\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\ncan be extremely inspiring.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nIn one of them, one of the kids once said,\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\n\"When we were riding on this ridge\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\noverlooking the Dead Sea --\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nand he's talking about this spot here --\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\n\"I was reminded\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nof the day when I left my village in Ethiopia\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nand went away together with my brother.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nWe walked 120 kilometers\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nuntil we reached Sudan.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nThis was the first place where we got some water and supplies.\"\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nAnd he goes on saying, and everyone looks at him like a hero,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nprobably for the first time in his life.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nAnd he says -- because I also have volunteers riding with me,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nadults, who are sitting there\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nlistening to him --\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nand he says, \"And this was just the beginning\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nof our ordeal\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nuntil we ended up in Israel.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nAnd only now,\" he says,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\n\"I'm beginning to understand where I am,\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nand I actually like it.\"\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nNow I remember, when he said it,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nI felt goosebumps on my body,\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nbecause he said it overlooking the Moab Mountains here in the background.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nThat's where Joshua descended\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nand crossed the Jordan\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nand led the people of Israel into the land of Canaan\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\n3,000 years ago\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nin this final leg\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nof the journey from Africa.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd so, perspective\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nand context and history\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nplay key roles\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nin the way I plan my rides\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nwith the kids.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nWe visit Kibbutzim\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nthat were established by Holocaust survivors.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nWe explore ruins\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nof Palestinian villages,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nand we discuss how they became ruins.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nAnd we go through numerous remnants\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nof Jewish settlements, Nabatic settlements,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nCanaanite settlements --\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nthree-, four, five-thousand years old.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nAnd through this tapestry,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nwhich is the history of this country,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nthe kids acquire\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nwhat is probably the most important\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nvalue in education,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nand that is the understanding that life is complex,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nand there's no black and white.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nAnd by appreciating complexity,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nthey become more tolerant,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nand tolerance leads to hope.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nI ride with these kids once a week,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nevery Tuesday.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nHere's a picture I took last Tuesday -- less than a week ago --\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nand I ride with them tomorrow also.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nIn every one of these rides\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nI always end up standing in one of these incredible locations,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\ntaking in this incredible landscape around me,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nand I feel blessed and fortunate\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nthat I'm alive,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nand that I sense every fiber\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nin my aching body.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nAnd I feel blessed and fortunate\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nthat 15 years ago\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nI had the courage to resign\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nmy tenured position at NYU\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nand return to my home country\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nwhere I can do these incredible rides\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nwith this group of troubled kids\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\ncoming from Ethiopia\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nand Morocco and Russia.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nAnd I feel blessed and fortunate\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nthat every week, every Tuesday --\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nand actually every Friday also --\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nI can once again celebrate\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nin the marrow of my bones\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nthe very essence of living in Israel on the edge.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nThank you.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:35.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "My green school dream", "duration": "815", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/john_hardy_my_green_school_dream", "transcript": "I grew up in a very small village in Canada, and I'm an undiagnosed dyslexic. I had a really hard time in school. In fact, my mother told me eventually that I was the little kid in the village who cried all the way to school. I ran away. I left when I was 25 years old to go to Bali, and there I met my incredible wife, Cynthia, and together, over 20 years, we built an amazing jewelry business. It was a fairy tale, and then we retired. Then she took me to see a film that I really didn't want to see. It ruined my life \u2014 (Laughter) \"The Inconvenient Truth\" and Mr. Gore. I have four kids, and even if part of what he says is true, they're not going to have the life that I had. And I decided at that moment that I would spend the rest of my life doing whatever I could to improve their possibilities. So here's the world, and here we are in Bali. It's a tiny, little island \u2014 60 miles by 90 miles. It has an intact Hindu culture. Cynthia and I were there. We had had a wonderful life there, and we decided to do something unusual. We decided to give back locally.And here it is: it's called the Green School. I know it doesn't look like a school, but it is something we decided to do, and it is extremely, extremely green. The classrooms have no walls. The teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard. The desks are not square. At Green School, the children are smiling \u2014 an unusual thing for school, especially for me. And we practice holism. And for me it's just the idea that, if this little girl graduates as a whole person, chances are she'll demand a whole world \u2014 a whole world \u2014 to live on. Our children spend 181 days going to school in a box. The people that built my school also built the prison and the insane asylum out of the same materials. So if this gentleman had had a holistic education, would he be sitting there? Would he have had more possibilities in his life?The classrooms have natural light. They're beautiful. They're bamboo. The breeze passes through them. And when the natural breeze isn't enough, the kids deploy bubbles, but not the kind of bubbles you know. These bubbles are made from natural cotton and rubber from the rubber tree. So we basically turned the box into a bubble. And these kids know that painless climate control may not be part of their future. We pay the bill at the end of the month, but the people that are really going to pay the bill are our grandchildren. We have to teach the kids that the world is not indestructible. These kids did a little graffiti on their desks, and then they signed up for two extra courses. The first one was called sanding and the second one was called re-waxing. But since that happened, they own those desks. They know they can control their world.We're on the grid. We're not proud of it. But an amazing alternative energy company in Paris is taking us off the grid with solar. And this thing is the second vortex to be built in the world, in a two-and-a-half meter drop on a river. When the turbine drops in, it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity, day and night. And you know what these are. There's nowhere to flush. And as long as we're taking our waste and mixing it with a huge amount of water \u2014 you're all really smart, just do the math. How many people times how much water. There isn't enough water. These are compost toilets, and nobody at the school wanted to know about them, especially the principal. And they work. People use them. People are okay. It's something you should think about doing. Not many things didn't work. The beautiful canvas and rubber skylights got eaten by the sun in six months. We had to replace them with recyclable plastic. The teachers dragged giant PVC whiteboards into the classrooms. So we had some good ideas: we took old automobile windshields, put paper behind them and created the first alternative to the whiteboard.Green School sits in south-central Bali, and it's on 20 acres of rolling garden. There's an amazing river traveling through it, and you can see there how we manage to get across the river. I met a father the other day; he looked a little crazed. I said, \"Welcome to Green School.\" He said, \"I've been on an airplane for 24 hours.\" I asked him, \"Why?\" He said, \"I had a dream once about a green school, and I saw a picture of this green school, I got on an airplane. In August I'm bringing my sons.\" This was a great thing. But more than that, people are building green houses around Green School, so their kids can walk to school on the paths. And people are bringing their green industries, hopefully their green restaurants, to the Green School. It's becoming a community. It's becoming a green model. We had to look at everything. No petrochemicals in the pavement. No pavement. These are volcanic stones laid by hand. There are no sidewalks. The sidewalks are gravel. They flood when it rains, but they're green.This is the school buffalo. He's planning to eat that fence for dinner. All the fences at Green School are green. And when the kindergarten kids recently moved their gate, they found out the fence was made out of tapioca. They took the tapioca roots up to the kitchen, sliced them thinly and made delicious chips. Landscaping. We manage to keep the garden that was there running right up to the edge of each of the classrooms. We dropped them gently in. We made space for these guys who are Bali's last black pigs. And the school cow is trying to figure out how to replace the lawnmower on the playing field.These young ladies are living in a rice culture, but they know something that few people know in a rice culture. They know how to plant organic rice, they know how to look after it, they know how to harvest and they know how to cook it. They're part of the rice cycle and these skills will be valuable for them in their future. This young man is picking organic vegetables. We feed 400 people lunch every day and it's not a normal lunch. There's no gas. Local Balinese women cook the food on sawdust burners using secrets that only their grandmothers know. The food is incredible.Green School is a place of pioneers, local and global. And it's a kind of microcosm of the globalized world. The kids are from 25 countries. When I see them together, I know that they're working out how to live in the future. Green School is going into its third year with 160 children. It's a school where you do learn reading \u2014 one of my favorites \u2014 writing \u2014 I was bad at it \u2014 arithmetic. But you also learn other things. You learn bamboo building. You practice ancient Balinese arts. This is called mud wrestling in the rice fields. The kids love it. The mothers aren't quite convinced.(Laughter)We've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives, and we said, okay, local, what does \"local\" mean? Local means that 20 percent of the population of the school has to be Balinese, and this was a really big commitment. And we were right. And people are coming forward from all over the world to support the Balinese Scholarship Fund, because these kids will be Bali's next green leaders. The teachers are as diverse as the student body, and the amazing thing is that volunteers are popping up. A man came from Java with a new kind of organic agriculture. A woman came from Africa with music. And together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global, green leaders. The Green School effect \u2014 we don't know what it is. We need someone to come and study it. But what's happening, our learning-different kids \u2014 dyslexic \u2014 we've renamed them prolexic \u2014 are doing well in these beautiful, beautiful classrooms. And all the kids are thriving.And how did we do all this? On giant grass. It's bamboo. It comes out of the ground like a train. It grows as high as a coconut tree in two months and three years later it can be harvested to build buildings like this. It's as strong and dense as teak and it will hold up any roof. When the architects came, they brought us these things, and you've probably seen things like this. The yellow box was called the administration complex. (Laughter) We squashed it, we rethought it, but mainly we renamed it \"the heart of school,\" and that changed everything forever. It's a double helix. It has administrators in it and many, many other things.And the problem of building it \u2014 when the Balinese workers saw long reams of plans, they looked at them and said, \"What's this?\" So we built big models. We had them engineered by the engineers. And Balinese carpenters like this measured them with their bamboo rulers, selected the bamboo and built the buildings using age-old techniques, mostly by hand. It was chaos. And the Balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do, so they use metal scaffolding to build the bamboo building and when the scaffolding came down, we realized that we had a cathedral, a cathedral to green, and a cathedral to green education. The heart of school has seven kilometers of bamboo in it. From the time the foundations were finished, in three months it had roofs and floors. It may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world, but many people believe that it's the most beautiful.Is this doable in your community? We believe it is. Green School is a model we built for the world. It's a model we built for Bali. And you just have to follow these simple, simple rules: be local, let the environment lead and think about how your grandchildren might build.So, Mr. Gore, thank you. You ruined my life, but you gave me an incredible future. And if you're interested in being involved in finishing Green School and building the next 50 around the world, please come and see us.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1010, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nI grew up\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nin a very small village in Canada,\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nand I'm an undiagnosed\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\ndyslexic.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nI had a really hard time in school.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nIn fact, my mother told me eventually\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nthat I was the little kid in the village\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nwho cried all the way to school.\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nI ran away.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nI left when I was 25 years old to go to Bali,\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nand there I met my incredible wife, Cynthia,\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nand together, over 20 years,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nwe built an amazing jewelry business.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nIt was a fairy tale, and then we retired.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nThen she took me to see a film\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nthat I really didn't want to see.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nIt ruined my life --\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\n\"The Inconvenient Truth\" and Mr. Gore.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nI have four kids,\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nand even if part of what he says is true,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nthey're not going to have the life that I had.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nAnd I decided at that moment\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nthat I would spend the rest of my life\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\ndoing whatever I could\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nto improve their possibilities.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nSo here's the world,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nand here we are in Bali.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nIt's a tiny, little island --\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\n60 miles by 90 miles.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nIt has an intact Hindu culture.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nCynthia and I were there.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nWe had had a wonderful life there,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nand we decided to do something unusual.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nWe decided to give back\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nlocally.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nAnd here it is: it's called the Green School.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nI know it doesn't look like a school,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nbut it is something we decided to do,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nand it is extremely,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nextremely green.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nThe classrooms have no walls.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nThe teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nThe desks are not square.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nAt Green School, the children are smiling --\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nan unusual thing for school, especially for me.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAnd we practice holism.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nAnd for me it's just the idea\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nthat, if this little girl\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\ngraduates as a whole person,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nchances are\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nshe'll demand a whole world --\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\na whole world --\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nto live on.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nOur children spend 181 days\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\ngoing to school in a box.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nThe people that built my school\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nalso built the prison and the insane asylum\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nout of the same materials.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nSo if this gentleman\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nhad had a holistic education,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nwould he be sitting there?\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nWould he have had more possibilities in his life?\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nThe classrooms have natural light.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nThey're beautiful. They're bamboo.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nThe breeze passes through them.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nAnd when the natural breeze isn't enough,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nthe kids deploy bubbles,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nbut not the kind of bubbles you know.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nThese bubbles are made from natural cotton\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nand rubber from the rubber tree.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nSo we basically turned the box\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\ninto a bubble.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAnd these kids know\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nthat painless climate control\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nmay not be\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\npart of their future.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nWe pay the bill at the end of the month,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nbut the people that are really going to pay the bill\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nare our grandchildren.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nWe have to teach the kids\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nthat the world is not indestructible.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nThese kids did a little graffiti on their desks,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nand then they signed up for two extra courses.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nThe first one was called sanding\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nand the second one was called re-waxing.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nBut since that happened,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nthey own those desks.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nThey know they can control their world.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nWe're on the grid. We're not proud of it.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nBut an amazing alternative energy company in Paris\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nis taking us off the grid with solar.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nAnd this thing\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nis the second vortex to be built in the world,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nin a two-and-a-half meter drop on a river.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nWhen the turbine drops in,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nit will produce 8,000 watts of electricity,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nday and night.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nAnd you know what these are.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nThere's nowhere to flush.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nAnd as long as we're taking our waste\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nand mixing it with a huge amount of water --\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nyou're all really smart, just do the math.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nHow many people times how much water.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nThere isn't enough water.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nThese are compost toilets,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nand nobody at the school wanted to know about them,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nespecially the principal.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nAnd they work. People use them. People are okay.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nIt's something you should think about doing.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nNot many things didn't work.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nThe beautiful canvas and rubber skylights\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\ngot eaten by the sun in six months.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nWe had to replace them with recyclable plastic.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nThe teachers dragged giant PVC whiteboards\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\ninto the classrooms.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nSo we had some good ideas:\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nwe took old automobile windshields, put paper behind them\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nand created the first alternative\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nto the whiteboard.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nGreen School sits in south-central Bali,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nand it's on 20 acres\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nof rolling garden.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nThere's an amazing river traveling through it,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nand you can see there\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nhow we manage to get across the river.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nI met a father the other day; he looked a little crazed.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nI said, \"Welcome to Green School.\"\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nHe said, \"I've been on an airplane for 24 hours.\"\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nI asked him, \"Why?\"\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nHe said, \"I had a dream once about a green school,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nand I saw a picture of this green school,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nI got on an airplane.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nIn August I'm bringing my sons.\"\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nThis was a great thing.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nBut more than that,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\npeople are building green houses around Green School,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nso their kids can walk to school on the paths.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nAnd people are bringing their green industries,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nhopefully their green restaurants,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nto the Green School.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nIt's becoming a community.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nIt's becoming a green model.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nWe had to look at everything.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nNo petrochemicals in the pavement.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nNo pavement.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nThese are volcanic stones laid by hand.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nThere are no sidewalks.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nThe sidewalks are gravel. They flood when it rains,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nbut they're green.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nThis is the school buffalo.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nHe's planning to eat that fence for dinner.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nAll the fences at Green School are green.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nAnd when the kindergarten kids\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nrecently moved their gate,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nthey found out the fence was made out of tapioca.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nThey took the tapioca roots up to the kitchen,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nsliced them thinly and made delicious chips.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nLandscaping.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nWe manage to keep the garden that was there\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nrunning right up to the edge of each of the classrooms.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nWe dropped them gently in.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nWe made space for these guys\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nwho are Bali's last black pigs.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nAnd the school cow\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nis trying to figure out\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nhow to replace the lawnmower\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\non the playing field.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nThese young ladies\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nare living in a rice culture,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nbut they know something that few people know in a rice culture.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nThey know how to plant organic rice,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nthey know how to look after it,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nthey know how to harvest and they know how to cook it.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nThey're part of the rice cycle\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nand these skills will be valuable\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nfor them in their future.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nThis young man is picking organic vegetables.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nWe feed 400 people lunch every day\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nand it's not a normal lunch. There's no gas.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nLocal Balinese women\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\ncook the food on sawdust burners\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nusing secrets that only their grandmothers know.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nThe food is incredible.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nGreen School is a place of pioneers,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nlocal and global.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nAnd it's a kind of microcosm\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nof the globalized world.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nThe kids are from 25 countries.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nWhen I see them together,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nI know that they're working out\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nhow to live in the future.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nGreen School is going into its third year\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nwith 160 children.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nIt's a school where you do learn reading --\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\none of my favorites --\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nwriting -- I was bad at it --\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\narithmetic.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nBut you also learn other things.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nYou learn bamboo building.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nYou practice\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nancient Balinese arts.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nThis is called mud wrestling in the rice fields.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nThe kids love it.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nThe mothers aren't quite convinced.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nWe've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nand we said, okay, local, what does \"local\" mean?\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nLocal means\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nthat 20 percent of the population of the school\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nhas to be Balinese,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nand this was a really big commitment.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nAnd we were right.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nAnd people are coming forward\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nfrom all over the world\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nto support the Balinese Scholarship Fund,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nbecause these kids will be Bali's next green leaders.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nThe teachers are as diverse\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nas the student body,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nand the amazing thing\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nis that volunteers are popping up.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nA man came from Java\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nwith a new kind of organic agriculture.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nA woman came from Africa with music.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nAnd together these volunteers and the teachers\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nare deeply committed\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nto creating a new generation\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nof global, green leaders.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nThe Green School effect --\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nwe don't know what it is.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nWe need someone to come and study it.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nBut what's happening, our learning-different kids --\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\ndyslexic --\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nwe've renamed them prolexic --\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nare doing well in these beautiful, beautiful classrooms.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nAnd all the kids are thriving.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nAnd how did we do all this?\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nOn giant grass.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nIt's bamboo.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nIt comes out of the ground like a train.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nIt grows as high as a coconut tree in two months\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nand three years later it can be harvested\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nto build buildings like this.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nIt's as strong and dense as teak\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nand it will hold up any roof.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nWhen the architects came, they brought us these things,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nand you've probably seen things like this.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nThe yellow box was called the administration complex.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nWe squashed it, we rethought it,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nbut mainly we renamed it\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\n\"the heart of school,\"\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nand that changed everything forever.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nIt's a double helix.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nIt has administrators in it\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nand many, many other things.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nAnd the problem of building it --\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nwhen the Balinese workers\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nsaw long reams of plans,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nthey looked at them and said, \"What's this?\"\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nSo we built big models.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nWe had them engineered by the engineers.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nAnd Balinese carpenters like this\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nmeasured them with their bamboo rulers,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nselected the bamboo and built the buildings\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nusing age-old techniques,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nmostly by hand.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nIt was chaos.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nAnd the Balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nso they use metal scaffolding\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nto build the bamboo building\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nand when the scaffolding came down,\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nwe realized that we had a cathedral,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\na cathedral to green,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nand a cathedral to green education.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nThe heart of school has seven kilometers\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nof bamboo in it.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nFrom the time the foundations were finished,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nin three months it had roofs and floors.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nIt may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nbut many people believe\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nthat it's the most beautiful.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nIs this doable in your community?\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nWe believe it is.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nGreen School is a model we built for the world.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nIt's a model we built for Bali.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nAnd you just have to follow these simple, simple rules:\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nbe local,\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nlet the environment lead\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nand think about\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nhow your grandchildren might build.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nSo, Mr. Gore, thank you.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nYou ruined my life,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nbut you gave me an incredible future.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nAnd if you're interested in being involved\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nin finishing Green School\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nand building the next 50 around the world,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nplease come and see us.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nThank you.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:24.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Making law on the high seas", "duration": "946", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/kristina_gjerde_making_law_on_the_high_seas", "transcript": "Today I'm going to take you on a voyage to some place so deep, so dark, so unexplored that we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon. It's a place of myth and legend. It's a place marked on ancient maps as \"here be monsters.\" It is a place where each new voyage of exploration brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed. Instead, they just make me green with envy that my colleague from IUCN was able to go on this journey to the south of Madagascar seamounts to actually take photographs and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep.We are talking about the high seas. The \"high seas\" is a legal term, but in fact, it covers 50 percent of the planet. With an average depth of the oceans of 4,000 meters, in fact, the high seas covers and provides nearly 90 percent of the habitat for life on this Earth. It is, in theory, the global commons, belonging to us all. But in reality, it is managed by and for those who have the resources to go out and exploit it. So today I'm going to take you on a voyage to cast light on some of the outdated myths and legends and assumptions that have kept us as the true stakeholders in the high seas in the dark. We're going to voyage to some of these special places that we've been discovering in the past few years to show why we really need to care. And then finally, we're going to try to develop and pioneer a new perspective on high seas governance that's rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation, but framed in an arena of global norms of precaution and respect.So here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above \u2014 that area in the darker blue. To me, as an international lawyer, this scared me far more than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen, for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean, the global ocean, that provides us all with carbon storage, with heat storage, with oxygen, if you can only protect 36 percent. This is indeed the true heart of the planet. Some of the problems that we have to confront are that the current international laws \u2014 for example, shipping \u2014 provide more protection to the areas closest to shore. For example, garbage discharge, something you would think just simply goes away, but the laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further you are from shore. As a result, we have garbage patches the size of twice-Texas. It's unbelievable. We used to think the solution to pollution was dilution, but that has proved to be no longer the case.So what we have learned from social scientists and economists like Elinor Ostrom, who are studying the phenomenon of management of the commons on a local scale, is that there are certain prerequisites that you can put into place that enable you to manage and access open space for the good of one and all. And these include a sense of shared responsibility, common norms that bind people together as a community. Conditional access: You can invite people in, but they have to be able to play by the rules. And of course, if you want people to play by the rules, you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement, for as we've discovered, you can trust, but you also need to verify.What I'd also like to convey is that it is not all doom and gloom that we are seeing in the high seas. For a group of very dedicated individuals \u2014 scientists, conservationists, photographers and states \u2014 were able to actually change a tragic trajectory that was destroying fragile seascapes such as this coral garden that you see in front of you. That is, we're able to save it from a fate of deep-sea bottom trawling. And how did we do that? Well, as I said, we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships and actually photographed the activities in process. But we also spent many hours in the basements of the United Nations, trying to work with governments to make them understand what was going on so far away from land that few of us had ever even imagined that these creatures existed.So within three years, from 2003 to 2006, we were able to get norm in place that actually changed the paradigm of how fishers went about deep-sea bottom trawling. Instead of \"go anywhere, do anything you want,\" we actually created a regime that required prior assessment of where you're going and a duty to prevent significant harm. In 2009, when the U.N. reviewed progress, they discovered that almost 100 million square-kilometers of seabed had been protected. This does not mean that it's the final solution, or that this even provides permanent protection. But what it does mean is that a group of individuals can form a community to actually shape the way high seas are governed, to create a new regime. So I'm looking optimistically at our opportunities for creating a true, blue perspective for this beautiful planet. Sylvia's wish provides us with that leverage, that access to the heart of human beings, you might say, who have rarely seen places beyond their own toes, but are now hopefully going to become interested in the full life-cycle of creatures like these sea turtles, who indeed spend most of their time in the high seas.Today, we're just going to voyage to a small sampling of some of these special areas, just to give you an idea of the flavor of the riches and wonders they do contain. The Sargasso Sea, for example, is not a sea bounded by coastlines, but it is bounded by oceanic currents that contain and envelope this wealth of sargassum that grows and aggregates there. It's also known as the spawning ground for eels from Northern European and Northern American rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm, and five showed up in the U.K. just recently.But the Sargasso Sea, the same way it aggregates sargassum weed, actually is pulling in the plastic from throughout the region. This picture doesn't exactly show the plastics that I would like it to show, because I haven't been out there myself. But there has just been a study that was released in February that showed there are 200,000 pieces of plastic per square-kilometer now floating in the surface of the Sargasso Sea, and that is affecting the habitat for the many species in their juvenile stages who come to the Sargasso Sea for its protection and its food. The Sargasso Sea is also a wondrous place for the aggregation of these unique species that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat. It also provides a special habitat for these flying fish to lay their eggs. But what I'd like to get from this picture is that we truly do have an opportunity to launch a global initiative for protection. Thus, the government of Bermuda has recognized the need and its responsibility as having some of the Sargasso Sea within its national jurisdiction \u2014 but the vast majority is beyond \u2014 to help spearhead a movement to achieve protection for this vital area.Spinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now: the Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean. It's actually a bay. It's considered high seas, because the continent has been put off limits to territorial claims. So anything in the water is treated as if it's the high seas. But what makes the Ross Sea important is the vast sea of pack ice that in the spring and summer provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill that supports what, till recently, has been a virtually intact near-shore ecosystem. But unfortunately, CCAMLR, the regional commission in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks and other living marine resources, is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests and has authorized the expansion of toothfish fisheries in the region. The captain of a New Zealand vessel who was just down there is reporting a significant decline in the number of the Ross Sea killer whales, who are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish as their main source of food. So what we need to do is to stand up boldly, singly and together, to push governments, to push regional fisheries management organizations, to declare our right to declare certain areas off-limits to high seas fishing, so that the freedom to fish no longer means the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime.Coming closer to here, the Costa Rica Dome is a recently discovered area \u2014 potentially year-round habitat for blue whales. There's enough food there to last them the summer and the winter long. But what's unusual about the Costa Rica Dome is, in fact, it's not a permanent place. It's an oceanographic phenomenon that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis. So, in fact, it's not permanently in the high seas. It's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones of these five Central American countries, but it moves with the season. As such, it does create a challenge to protect, but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it. We can use the same technologies that fishers use to identify where the species are, in order to close the area when it's most vulnerable, which may, in some cases, be year-round.Getting closer to shore, where we are, this was in fact taken in the Galapagos. Many species are headed through this region, which is why there's been so much attention put into conservation of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape. This is the initiative that's been coordinated by Conservation International with a variety of partners and governments to actually try to bring integrated management regime throughout the area. That is, it provides a wonderful example of where you can go with a real regional initiative. It's protecting five World Heritage sites. Unfortunately, the World Heritage Convention does not recognize the need to protect areas beyond national jurisdiction, at present. So a place like the Costa Rica Dome could not technically qualify the time it's in the high seas. So what we've been suggesting is that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention, so that it can adopt and urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites, or we need to change the name and call it Half-the-World Heritage Convention. But what we also know is that species like these sea turtles do not stay put in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape. These happen to go down to a vast South Pacific Gyre, where they spend most of their time and often end up getting hooked like this, or as bycatch.So what I'd really like to suggest is that we need to scale-up. We need to work locally, but we also need to work ocean-basin-wide. We have the tools and technologies now to enable us to take a broader ocean-basin-wide initiative. We've heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project, one of the 17 Census of Marine Life projects. It's provided us data like this, of tiny, little sooty shearwaters that make the entire ocean basin their home. They fly 65,000 kilometers in less than a year. So we have the tools and treasures coming from the Census of Marine Life. And its culminating year that's going to be launched in October. So stay tuned for further information. What I find so exciting is that the Census of Marine Life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators; it's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column, where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found. And fortunately, we've been able, as IUCN, to team up with the Census of Marine Life and many of the scientists working there to actually try to translate much of this information to policymakers. We have the support of governments now behind us. We've been revealing this information through technical workshops. And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots, hotspots. At the same time we're saying, \"Yes, we need more. We need to move forward.\"But many of you have said, if you get these marine protected areas, or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place, how are you going to enforce it? Which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science, which is outer space technology. I wanted to be an astronaut, so I've constantly followed what are the tools available to monitor Earth from outer space \u2014 and that we have incredible tools like we've been learning about, in terms of being able to follow tagged species throughout their life-cycles in the open ocean. We can also tag and track fishing vessels. Many already have transponders on board that allow us to find out where they are and even what they're doing. But not all the vessels have those to date. It does not take too much rocket science to actually try to create new laws to mandate, if you're going to have the privilege of accessing our high seas resources, we need to know \u2014 someone needs to know \u2014 where you are and what you're doing.So it brings me to my main take-home message, which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons. We can stop the collision course of 50 percent of the planet with the high seas. But we need to think broad-scale. We need to think globally. We need to change how we actually go about managing these resources. We need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect. At the same time, we need to think locally, which is the joy and marvel of Sylvia's hope spot wish, is that we can shine a spotlight on many of these previously unknown areas, and to bring people to the table, if you will, to actually make them feel part of this community that truly has a stake in their future management. And third is that we need to look at ocean-basin-wide management. Our species are ocean-basin-wide. Many of the deep-sea communities have genetic distribution that goes ocean-basin-wide. We need to better understand, but we also need to start to manage and protect. And in order to do that, you also need ocean-basin management regimes. That is, we have regional management regimes within the exclusive economic zone, but we need to scale these up, we need to build their capacity, so they're like the Southern Ocean, where they do have the two-pronged fisheries and conservation organization.So with that, I would just like to sincerely thank and honor Sylvia Earle for her wish, for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction. It's helping to bring an incredible group of talented people together to really try to solve and penetrate these problems that have created our obstacles to management and rational use of this area that was once so far away and remote.So on this tour, I hope I provided you with a new perspective of the high seas: one, that it is our home too, and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1011, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nToday I'm going to

from above --\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nthat area in the darker blue.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nTo me, as an international lawyer,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nthis scared me far more\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nthan any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen,\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nfor it belies the notion that you can actually protect the

the problems that we have to confront\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nare that the current international laws --\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nfor example, shipping --\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nprovide more protection\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nto the areas closest to shore.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nFor example, garbage discharge,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nsomething you would think just simply goes away,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nbut the laws regulating\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nship discharge of garbage\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nactually get weaker the further you are from shore.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nAs a result, we have garbage patches\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nthe size of

00:03:55.958\nthat we are seeing in the high seas.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nFor a group of very dedicated individuals --\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nscientists, conservationists,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nphotographers and states --\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nwere able to actually change a tragic trajectory\n\n00:04:06.958 -->

00:04:14.958\nThat is, we're able to save it from a fate\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nof deep-sea bottom trawling.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nAnd how did we do that?\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nWell, as I said, we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nand actually photographed the activities in process.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nBut we also spent many hours\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nin the basements of the United Nations,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\ntrying to work with governments to make them understand\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nwhat was going on so far away from land\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nthat few of us had ever even imagined\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nthat these creatures existed.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nSo within three years,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nfrom 2003 to 2006,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nwe were able to get norm in place\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nthat actually changed the paradigm\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nof how fishers went about\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\ndeep-sea bottom

required prior assessment of where you're going\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nand a duty to prevent significant harm.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nIn 2009, when the U.N. reviewed progress,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nthey discovered\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nthat almost 100 million square-kilometers of seabed\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nhad been protected.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nThis does not mean that it's the final solution,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nor that this even provides permanent protection.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nBut what it does mean\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nis that a group of individuals can form a community\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nto actually shape\n\n00:05:22.958 -->

opportunities\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nfor creating a true, blue perspective\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nfor this beautiful planet.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nSylvia's wish\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nprovides us with that leverage, that access\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nto the heart of human beings,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nyou might say,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nwho have rarely seen places beyond their own toes,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nbut are now hopefully going to become interested\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nin the full life-cycle of creatures like these sea turtles,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nwho indeed spend most of their time in the high seas.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nToday, we're just going to voyage to a small sampling\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nof some of these special areas,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\njust to give you an idea of the flavor\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nof the riches and wonders they do contain.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nThe Sargasso Sea, for example,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nis not a sea bounded by coastlines,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nbut it is bounded by oceanic currents\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nthat contain and envelope\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nthis wealth of sargassum\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nthat grows and aggregates there.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nIt's also known as the spawning ground for eels\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nfrom Northern European\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nand Northern American rivers\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nthat are now so dwindling in numbers\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nthat they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nand five showed up in the U.K. just recently.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nBut the Sargasso Sea,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nthe same way it aggregates sargassum weed,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nactually is pulling in the plastic\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nfrom throughout the region.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nThis picture doesn't exactly show\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nthe plastics that I would like it to show, because I haven't been out there myself.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nBut there has just been a study\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nthat was released in February\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nthat showed there are 200,000\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\npieces of plastic per square-kilometer\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nnow floating in the surface of the Sargasso Sea,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nand that is affecting the habitat\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nfor the many species in their juvenile stages\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nwho come to the Sargasso Sea\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nfor its protection and its food.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nThe Sargasso Sea is also a wondrous place\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nfor the aggregation of these unique species\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nthat have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nIt also provides a special habitat\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nfor these flying fish to lay their eggs.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nBut what I'd like to get from this picture\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nis that we truly do have an opportunity\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nto launch a global initiative for protection.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nThus, the government of Bermuda has recognized the need\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nand its responsibility\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nas having some of the Sargasso Sea\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nwithin its national jurisdiction --\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nbut the vast majority is beyond --\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nto help spearhead a movement\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nto achieve protection for this vital area.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nSpinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now:\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nthe Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nIt's actually a bay.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nIt's considered high seas, because the continent\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nhas been put off limits\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nto territorial claims.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nSo anything in the water is treated as if it's the high seas.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nBut what makes the Ross Sea important\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nis the vast sea of pack ice\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nthat in the spring and summer\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nprovides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nthat supports what, till recently,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nhas been a virtually intact\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nnear-shore ecosystem.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nBut unfortunately, CCAMLR,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nthe regional commission\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nin charge of conserving and managing fish stocks\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nand other living marine resources,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nis unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nand has authorized the expansion\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nof toothfish fisheries in the region.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nThe captain of a New Zealand vessel\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nwho was just down there\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nis reporting a significant decline\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nin the number of the Ross Sea killer whales,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nwho are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nas their main source of food.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nSo what we need to do is to stand up boldly,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nsingly and together,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nto push governments,\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nto push regional fisheries management organizations,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nto declare our right\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nto declare certain areas off-limits to high seas fishing,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nso that the freedom to fish no longer means\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nthe freedom to fish anywhere and anytime.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nComing closer to here, the Costa Rica Dome\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nis a recently discovered area --\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\npotentially year-round habitat for blue whales.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nThere's enough food there to last them\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nthe summer and the winter long.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nBut what's unusual about the Costa Rica Dome\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nis, in fact, it's not a permanent place.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nIt's an oceanographic phenomenon\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nthat shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nSo, in fact, it's not permanently in the high seas.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nIt's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nof these five Central American countries,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nbut it moves with the season.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nAs such, it does create a challenge to protect,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nbut we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nWe can use the same technologies that fishers use\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nto identify where the species are,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nin order to close the area\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nwhen it's most vulnerable,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nwhich may, in some cases, be year-round.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nGetting closer to shore, where we are,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nthis was in fact taken in the Galapagos.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nMany species are headed through this region,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nwhich is why there's been so much attention\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nput into conservation\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nof the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nThis is the initiative that's been coordinated\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nby Conservation International\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nwith a variety of partners and governments\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nto actually try to bring integrated management regime\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nthroughout the area.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nThat is, it provides a wonderful example of where you can go\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nwith a real regional initiative.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nIt's protecting five World Heritage sites.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nUnfortunately, the World Heritage Convention\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\ndoes not recognize the need to protect areas\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nbeyond national jurisdiction, at present.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nSo a place like the Costa Rica Dome\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\ncould not technically qualify\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nthe time it's in the high seas.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nSo what we've been suggesting\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nis that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nso that it can adopt\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nand urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nor we need to change the name\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nand call it Half-the-World Heritage Convention.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nBut what we also know is that species like these sea turtles\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:03.958\ndo not stay put in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nThese happen to go down to a vast South Pacific Gyre,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nwhere they spend most of their time\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nand often end up getting hooked like this,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nor as bycatch.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nSo what I'd really like to suggest is that we need to scale-up.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nWe need to work locally,\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nbut we also need to work ocean-basin-wide.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nWe have the tools and technologies now\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nto enable us to take a broader\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nocean-basin-wide initiative.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nWe've heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project,\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\none of the 17 Census of Marine Life projects.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nIt's provided us data like this,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nof tiny, little sooty shearwaters\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nthat make the entire ocean basin their home.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nThey fly 65,000 kilometers\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nin less than a year.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nSo we have the tools and treasures coming from the Census of Marine Life.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nAnd its culminating year\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nthat's going to be launched in October.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nSo stay tuned for further information.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nWhat I find so exciting\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nis that the Census of Marine Life\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nhas looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators;\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nit's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nwhere creatures like this flying sea cucumber\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nhave been found.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nAnd fortunately, we've been able, as IUCN,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nto team up with the Census of Marine Life\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nand many of the scientists working there\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nto actually try to translate\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nmuch of this information to policymakers.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nWe have the support of governments now behind us.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nWe've been revealing this information through technical workshops.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nAnd the exciting thing is

And that's not to say I ever went on to become a brilliant, world-class neuropsychologist. Sorry, TED. But I did go on to be a reasonably astute, arguably world-class worrier. One of my girlfriends in graduate school, Marie, said, \"Kim, I figured it out. It's not that you're more neurotic than everyone else; it's just that you're more honest about how neurotic you are.\"So in the spirit of full disclosure, I brought some pictures to share. Awwww.(Laughter)I'll just say: July.(Laughter)Zip!(Laughter)For safety.(Laughter)Water wings \u2014 an inch of water. And then, finally, all suited up for the 90-minute drive to Copper Mountain. So you can get kind of a feel for this. So my baby, Vander, is eight years old now. And, despite being cursed with my athletic inability, he plays soccer. He's interested in playing football. He wants to learn how to ride a unicycle.So why would I worry? Because this is what I do. This is what I teach. It's what I study. It's what I treat. And I know that kids get concussed every year. In fact, more than four million people sustain a concussion every year, and these data are just among kids under 14 who were seen in emergency rooms. And so when kids sustain a concussion, we talk about them getting dinged or getting their bell rung, but what is it that we're really talking about? Let's take a look.[Concussive Force]\"Starsky and Hutch\"? Arguably, yes. So, a car accident. Forty miles an hour into a fixed barrier: 35 Gs. A heavyweight boxer punches you straight in the face: 58 Gs.(Music)In case you missed it, we'll look again. So look to the right-hand side of the screen.(Music)What would you say? How many Gs? Close. Seventy-two? Would it be crazy to know: 103 Gs? The average concussive impact is 95 Gs. Now, when the kid on the right doesn't get up, we know they've had a concussion.But how about the kid on the left, or the athlete that leaves the field of play? How do we know if he or she has sustained a concussion? How do we know that legislation that would require they be pulled from play, cleared for return to play, applies to them? The definition of concussion doesn't actually require a loss of consciousness. It requires only a change in consciousness, and that can be any one or a number of symptoms, including feeling foggy, feeling dizzy, hearing a ringing in your ear, being more impulsive or hostile than usual.So given all of that and given how darn neurotic I am, how do I get any sleep at all? Because I know our brains are resilient. They're designed to recover from an injury. If \u2014 God forbid \u2014 any of us left here tonight and sustained a concussion, most of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks. But kids are more vulnerable to brain injury. In fact, high-school athletes are three times more likely to sustain catastrophic injuries relative even to their college-age peers, and it takes them longer to return to a symptom-free baseline. After that first injury, their risk for second injury is exponentially greater. From there, their risk for a third injury, greater still, and so on.And here's the really alarming part: We don't fully understand the long-term impact of multiple injuries. You guys may be familiar with this research that's coming out of the NFL. In a nutshell, this research suggests that, among retired NFL players with three or more career concussions, the incidence of early-onset dementing disease is much greater than it is for the general population. So you've all seen that \u2014 New York Times, you've seen it. What you may not be familiar with is that this research was spearheaded by NFL wives who said, \"Isn't it weird that my 46-year-old husband is forever losing his keys?\" \"Isn't it weird that my 47-year-old husband is forever losing the car?\" \"Isn't it weird that my 48-year-old husband is forever losing his way home in the car, from the driveway?\" I may have forgotten to mention that my son is an only child. So it's going to be really important that he be able to drive me around someday.(Laughter)So, how do we guarantee the safety of our kids? How can we 100 percent guarantee the safety of our kids? Let me tell you what I've come up with.(Laughter)If only. My little boy's right there, and he's like, \"She's not kidding. She's totally not kidding.\" So in all seriousness: Should my kid play football? Should your kid play football? I don't know. But I do know there are three things you can do. The first: study up. You have to be familiar with the issues we're talking about today. There are some great resources out there.The CDC has a program, HEADS UP. It's at CDC.gov. HEADS UP is specific to concussion in kids. The second is a resource I'm personally really proud of. We've just rolled this out in the last couple months \u2014 CO Kids With Brain Injury. This is a great resource for student athletes, teachers, parents, professionals, athletic and coaching staff. It's a great place to start if you have questions.The second thing is: speak up. Just two weeks ago, a bill introduced by Senator Kefalas that would have required athletes, kids under 18, to wear a helmet when they're riding their bike, died in committee. It died, in large part, because it lacked constituent buy-in; it lacked stakeholder traction. Now, I'm not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shouldn't support, but I am going to tell you that, if it matters to you, your legislators need to know that.Speak up also with coaching staff. Ask about what kind of protective equipment is available. What's the budget for protective equipment? How old it is? Maybe offer to spearhead a fundraiser to buy new gear.Which brings us to: suit up. Wear a helmet. The only way to prevent a bad outcome is to prevent that first injury from happening. Recently, one of my graduate students, Tom, said, \"Kim, I've decided to wear a bike helmet on the way to class.\" And Tom knows that that little bit of foam in a bike helmet can reduce the g-force of impact by half. Now, I thought it was because I have this totally compelling helmet crusade, this epiphany of Tom's. As it turns out, it occurred to Tom that a $20 helmet is a good way to protect a $100,000 graduate education.(Laughter)So ... Should Vander play football? I can't say no, but I can guarantee that every time he leaves the house, that kid's wearing a helmet \u2014 like, to the car, or at school. So whether athlete, scholar, overprotected kid, neurotic mom, or otherwise, here's my baby, Vander, reminding you to mind your matter.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1012, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:14.934\nSo, a funny thing happened\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:19.434\non my way to becoming a brilliant,\nworld-class neuropsychologist:\n\n00:00:20.037 --> 00:00:21.209\nI had a baby.\n\n00:00:21.963 --> 00:00:23.218\nAnd that's not to say\n\n00:00:23.242 --> 00:00:27.180\nI ever went on to become a brilliant,\nworld-class neuropsychologist.\n\n00:00:27.204 --> 00:00:28.679\nSorry, TED.\n\n00:00:29.673 --> 00:00:33.332\nBut I did go on to be a reasonably astute,\n\n00:00:33.356 --> 00:00:35.234\narguably world-class worrier.\n\n00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.034\nOne of my girlfriends\nin graduate school, Marie,\n\n00:00:39.058 --> 00:00:41.803\nsaid, \"Kim, I figured it out.\n\n00:00:41.827 --> 00:00:44.634\nIt's not that you're more neurotic\nthan everyone else;\n\n00:00:44.658 --> 00:00:48.155\nit's just that you're more honest\nabout how neurotic you are.\"\n\n00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:51.193\nSo in the spirit of full disclosure,\n\n00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:52.802\nI brought some pictures to share.\n\n00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.058\nAwwww.\n\n00:00:55.082 --> 00:00:56.083\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:56.107 --> 00:00:58.354\nI'll just say: July.\n\n00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:03.168\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:03.658 --> 00:01:05.073\nZip!\n\n00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:06.098\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:06.122 --> 00:01:07.423\nFor safety.\n\n00:01:07.447 --> 00:01:09.110\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:09.134 --> 00:01:11.026\nWater wings --\n\n00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.276\nan inch of water.\n\n00:01:14.427 --> 00:01:16.421\nAnd then, finally, all suited up\n\n00:01:16.445 --> 00:01:18.793\nfor the 90-minute drive\nto Copper Mountain.\n\n00:01:19.237 --> 00:01:22.778\nSo you can get kind of a feel for this.\n\n00:01:23.213 --> 00:01:26.657\nSo my baby, Vander,\nis eight years old now.\n\n00:01:26.681 --> 00:01:31.298\nAnd, despite being cursed\nwith my athletic inability,\n\n00:01:31.322 --> 00:01:32.895\nhe plays soccer.\n\n00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:34.896\nHe's interested in playing football.\n\n00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.181\nHe wants to learn how to ride a unicycle.\n\n00:01:37.205 --> 00:01:39.404\nSo why would I worry?\n\n00:01:39.428 --> 00:01:42.405\nBecause this is what I do.\nThis is what I teach.\n\n00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.501\nIt's what I study.

00:03:55.663\nBecause I know our brains are resilient.\n\n00:03:56.027 --> 00:04:00.022\nThey're designed to recover\nfrom an injury.\n\n00:04:00.408 --> 00:04:02.634\nIf -- God forbid --\n\n00:04:02.658 --> 00:04:05.854\nany of us left here tonight\nand sustained a concussion,\n\n00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:09.354\nmost of us would go on to fully recover\ninside of a couple hours\n\n00:04:09.378 --> 00:04:10.824\nto a couple of weeks.\n\n00:04:10.848 --> 00:04:13.169\nBut kids are more vulnerable\nto brain injury.\n\n00:04:13.193 --> 00:04:16.478\nIn fact, high-school athletes\nare three times more likely\n\n00:04:16.502 --> 00:04:18.850\nto sustain catastrophic injuries\n\n00:04:18.874 --> 00:04:21.375\nrelative even to their college-age peers,\n\n00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:25.064\nand it takes them longer\nto return to a symptom-free baseline.\n\n00:04:26.706 --> 00:04:28.936\nAfter that first injury,\n\n00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.766\ntheir risk for second injury\nis exponentially greater.\n\n00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.703\nFrom there, their risk for a third injury,\ngreater still, and so on.\n\n00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.548\nAnd here's the really alarming part:\n\n00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:46.865\nWe don't fully understand\nthe long-term impact of multiple injuries.\n\n00:04:47.857 --> 00:04:49.981\nYou guys may be familiar\nwith this research\n\n00:04:50.005 --> 00:04:51.583\nthat's coming out of the NFL.\n\n00:04:52.448 --> 00:04:55.165\nIn a nutshell,\nthis research suggests that,\n\n00:04:55.189 --> 00:05:00.432\namong retired NFL players\nwith three or more career concussions,\n\n00:05:00.456 --> 00:05:03.432\nthe incidence of early-onset\ndementing disease\n\n00:05:03.456 --> 00:05:06.221\nis much greater than it\nis for the general population.\n\n00:05:06.784 --> 00:05:09.634\nSo you've all seen that --\nNew York Times, you've seen it.\n\n00:05:09.658 --> 00:05:11.260\nWhat you may not be familiar with\n\n00:05:11.284 --> 00:05:16.403\nis that this research was spearheaded\nby NFL wives who said,\n\n00:05:16.427 --> 00:05:19.404\n\"Isn't it weird\nthat my 46-year-old husband\n\n00:05:19.428 --> 00:05:21.091\nis forever losing his keys?\"\n\n00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:24.262\n\"Isn't it weird that\nmy 47-year-old husband\n\n00:05:24.286 --> 00:05:26.166\nis forever losing the car?\"\n\n00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:29.658\n\"Isn't it weird that\nmy 48-year-old husband\n\n00:05:29.682 --> 00:05:31.703\nis forever losing his way home\n\n00:05:31.727 --> 00:05:34.678\nin the car, from the driveway?\"\n\n00:05:34.996 --> 00:05:39.589\nI may have forgotten to mention\nthat my son is an only child.\n\n00:05:40.818 --> 00:05:43.598\nSo it's going to be really important\n\n00:05:43.622 --> 00:05:47.622\nthat he be able to drive\nme around someday.\n\n00:05:47.974 --> 00:05:49.124\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:49.148 --> 00:05:53.980\nSo, how do we guarantee\nthe safety of our kids?\n\n00:05:54.507 --> 00:05:59.340\nHow can we 100 percent\nguarantee the safety of our kids?\n\n00:05:59.364 --> 00:06:01.270\nLet me tell you what I've come up with.\n\n00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:07.634\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:07.658 --> 00:06:08.966\nIf only.\n\n00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.979\nMy little boy's right there,\nand he's like, \"She's not kidding.\n\n00:06:12.003 --> 00:06:13.406\nShe's totally not kidding.\"\n\n00:06:14.172 --> 00:06:16.740\nSo in all seriousness:\n\n00:06:16.764 --> 00:06:18.411\nShould my kid play football?\n\n00:06:18.435 --> 00:06:20.222\nShould your kid play football?\n\n00:06:20.246 --> 00:06:21.412\nI don't know.\n\n00:06:21.436 --> 00:06:24.943\nBut I do know there are\nthree things you can do.\n\n00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:27.809\nThe first: study up.\n\n00:06:27.833 --> 00:06:31.562\nYou have to be familiar with the issues\nwe're talking about today.\n\n00:06:31.586 --> 00:06:34.152\nThere are some great resources out there.\n\n00:06:34.176 --> 00:06:36.470\nThe CDC has a program, HEADS UP.\n\n00:06:36.494 --> 00:06:38.128\nIt's at CDC.gov.\n\n00:06:38.152 --> 00:06:41.540\nHEADS UP is specific\nto concussion in kids.\n\n00:06:41.564 --> 00:06:44.814\nThe second is a resource\nI'm personally really proud of.\n\n00:06:44.838 --> 00:06:47.480\nWe've just rolled this out\nin the last couple months --\n\n00:06:47.504 --> 00:06:48.876\nCO Kids With Brain Injury.\n\n00:06:49.197 --> 00:06:51.849\nThis is a great resource\nfor student athletes,\n\n00:06:51.873 --> 00:06:56.262\nteachers, parents, professionals,\nathletic and coaching staff.\n\n00:06:56.286 --> 00:07:00.039\nIt's a great place to start\nif you have questions.\n\n00:07:00.841 --> 00:07:02.982\nThe second thing is: speak up.\n\n00:07:04.163 --> 00:07:05.372\nJust two weeks ago,\n\n00:07:05.396 --> 00:07:07.373\na bill introduced by Senator Kefalas\n\n00:07:07.397 --> 00:07:11.307\nthat would have required\nathletes, kids under 18,\n\n00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:13.645\nto wear a helmet\nwhen they're riding their bike,\n\n00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:14.933\ndied in committee.\n\n00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.137\nIt died, in large part,\n\n00:07:18.161 --> 00:07:21.091\nbecause it lacked constituent buy-in;\n\n00:07:21.115 --> 00:07:23.228\nit lacked stakeholder traction.\n\n00:07:23.618 --> 00:07:25.034\nNow, I'm not here to tell you\n\n00:07:25.058 --> 00:07:27.959\nwhat kind of legislation\nyou should or shouldn't support,\n\n00:07:27.983 --> 00:07:31.057\nbut I am going to tell you\nthat, if it matters to you,\n\n00:07:31.081 --> 00:07:33.995\nyour legislators need to know that.\n\n00:07:34.602 --> 00:07:36.425\nSpeak up also with coaching staff.\n\n00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:39.426\nAsk about what kind\nof protective equipment is available.\n\n00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.499\nWhat's the budget\nfor protective equipment?\n\n00:07:41.523 --> 00:07:43.073\nHow old it is?\n\n00:07:43.097 --> 00:07:46.803\nMaybe offer to spearhead\na fundraiser to buy new gear.\n\n00:07:46.827 --> 00:07:49.824\nWhich brings us to: suit up.\n\n00:07:49.848 --> 00:07:51.315\nWear a helmet.\n\n00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.634\nThe only way to prevent a bad outcome\n\n00:07:55.658 --> 00:07:58.658\nis to prevent that first injury\nfrom happening.\n\n00:07:59.658 --> 00:08:04.217\nRecently, one of my graduate\nstudents, Tom, said,\n\n00:08:04.241 --> 00:08:07.810\n\"Kim, I've decided to wear a bike helmet\non the way to class.\"\n\n00:08:08.642 --> 00:08:12.538\nAnd Tom knows that that little bit\nof foam in a bike helmet\n\n00:08:12.562 --> 00:08:15.854\ncan reduce the g-force of impact by half.\n\n00:08:16.616 --> 00:08:21.577\nNow, I thought it was because I have\nthis totally compelling helmet crusade,\n\n00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:23.309\nthis epiphany of Tom's.\n\n00:08:23.744 --> 00:08:27.411\nAs it turns out, it occurred\nto Tom that a $20 helmet\n\n00:08:27.435 --> 00:08:31.634\nis a good way to protect\na $100,000 graduate education.\n\n00:08:31.658 --> 00:08:33.682\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:33.706 --> 00:08:35.229\nSo ...\n\n00:08:37.037 --> 00:08:38.704\nShould Vander play football?\n\n00:08:40.069 --> 00:08:41.372\nI can't say no,\n\n00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:45.634\nbut I can guarantee that every time\nhe leaves the house,\n\n00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:47.267\nthat kid's wearing a helmet --\n\n00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.357\nlike, to the car,\n\n00:08:50.381 --> 00:08:52.095\nor at school.\n\n00:08:53.046 --> 00:08:55.727\nSo whether athlete, scholar,\n\n00:08:55.751 --> 00:08:58.426\noverprotected kid, neurotic mom,\n\n00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.236\nor otherwise,\n\n00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.148\nhere's my baby, Vander,\n\n00:09:02.172 --> 00:09:03.553\nreminding you\n\n00:09:03.577 --> 00:09:06.092\nto mind your matter.\n\n00:09:06.658 --> 00:09:07.826\nThank you.\n\n00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:13.108\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Women, wartime and the dream of peace", "duration": "1066", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/zainab_salbi", "transcript": "I woke up in the middle of the night with the sound of heavy explosion. It was deep at night. I do not remember what time it was. I just remember the sound was so heavy and so very shocking. Everything in my room was shaking \u2014 my heart, my windows, my bed, everything. I looked out the windows and I saw a full half-circle of explosion. I thought it was just like the movies, but the movies had not conveyed them in the powerful image that I was seeing full of bright red and orange and gray, and a full circle of explosion. And I kept on staring at it until it disappeared. I went back to my bed, and I prayed, and I secretly thanked God that that missile did not land on my family's home, that it did not kill my family that night. Thirty years have passed, and I still feel guilty about that prayer, for the next day, I learned that that missile landed on my brother's friend's home and killed him and his father, but did not kill his mother or his sister. His mother showed up the next week at my brother's classroom and begged seven-year-old kids to share with her any picture they may have of her son, for she had lost everything.This is not a story of a nameless survivor of war, and nameless refugees, whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our TV with tattered clothes, dirty face, scared eyes. This is not a story of a nameless someone who lived in some war, who we do not know their hopes, their dreams, their accomplishments, their families, their beliefs, their values. This is my story. I was that girl. I am another image and vision of another survivor of war. I am that refugee, and I am that girl. You see, I grew up in war-torn Iraq, and I believe that there are two sides of wars and we've only seen one side of it. We only talk about one side of it. But there's another side that I have witnessed as someone who lived in it and someone who ended up working in it.I grew up with the colors of war \u2014 the red colors of fire and blood, the brown tones of earth as it explodes in our faces and the piercing silver of an exploded missile, so bright that nothing can protect your eyes from it. I grew up with the sounds of war \u2014 the staccato sounds of gunfire, the wrenching booms of explosions, ominous drones of jets flying overhead and the wailing warning sounds of sirens. These are the sounds you would expect, but they are also the sounds of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds screeching in the night, the high-pitched honest cries of children and the thunderous, unbearable silence. \"War,\" a friend of mine said, \"is not about sound at all. It is actually about silence, the silence of humanity.\"I have since left Iraq and founded a group called Women for Women International that ends up working with women survivors of wars. In my travels and in my work, from Congo to Afghanistan, from Sudan to Rwanda, I have learned not only that the colors and the sounds of war are the same, but the fears of war are the same. You know, there is a fear of dying, and do not believe any movie character where the hero is not afraid. It is very scary to go through that feeling of \"I am about to die\" or \"I could die in this explosion.\" But there's also the fear of losing loved ones, and I think that's even worse. It's too painful. You don't want to think about it. But I think the worst kind of fear is the fear \u2014 as Samia, a Bosnian woman, once told me, who survived the four-years besiege of Sarajevo; she said, \"The fear of losing the 'I' in me, the fear of losing the 'I' in me.\" That's what my mother in Iraq used to tell me. It's like dying from inside-out. A Palestinian woman once told me, \"It is not about the fear of one death,\" she said, \"sometimes I feel I die 10 times in one day,\" as she was describing the marches of soldiers and the sounds of their bullets. She said, \"But it's not fair, because there is only one life, and there should only be one death.\"We have been only seeing one side of war. We have only been discussing and consumed with high-level preoccupations over troop levels, drawdown timelines, surges and sting operations, when we should be examining the details of where the social fabric has been most torn, where the community has improvised and survived and shown acts of resilience and amazing courage just to keep life going. We have been so consumed with seemingly objective discussions of politics, tactics, weapons, dollars and casualties. This is the language of sterility.How casually we treat casualties in the context of this topic. This is where we conceive of rape and casualties as inevitabilities. Eighty percent of refugees around the world are women and children. Oh. Ninety percent of modern war casualties are civilians. Seventy-five percent of them are women and children. How interesting. Oh, half a million women in Rwanda get raped in 100 days. Or, as we speak now, hundreds of thousands of Congolese women are getting raped and mutilated. How interesting. These just become numbers that we refer to. The front of wars is increasingly non-human eyes peering down on our perceived enemies from space, guiding missiles toward unseen targets, while the human conduct of the orchestra of media relations in the event that this particular drone attack hits a villager instead of an extremist. It is a chess game. You learn to play an international relations school on your way out and up to national and international leadership. Checkmate.We are missing a completely other side of wars. We are missing my mother's story, who made sure with every siren, with every raid, with every cut off-of electricity, she played puppet shows for my brothers and I, so we would not be scared of the sounds of explosions. We are missing the story of Fareeda, a music teacher, a piano teacher, in Sarajevo, who made sure that she kept the music school open every single day in the four years of besiege in Sarajevo and walked to that school, despite the snipers shooting at that school and at her, and kept the piano, the violin, the cello playing the whole duration of the war, with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats. That was her fight. That was her resistance. We are missing the story of Nehia, a Palestinian woman in Gaza who, the minute there was a cease-fire in the last year's war, she left out of home, collected all the flour and baked as much bread for every neighbor to have, in case there is no cease-fire the day after. We are missing the stories of Violet, who, despite surviving genocide in the church massacre, she kept on going on, burying bodies, cleaning homes, cleaning the streets. We are missing stories of women who are literally keeping life going in the midst of wars. Do you know \u2014 do you know that people fall in love in war and go to school and go to factories and hospitals and get divorced and go dancing and go playing and live life going? And the ones who are keeping that life are women.There are two sides of war. There is a side that fights, and there is a side that keeps the schools and the factories and the hospitals open. There is a side that is focused on winning battles, and there is a side that is focused on winning life. There is a side that leads the front-line discussion, and there is a side that leads the back-line discussion. There is a side that thinks that peace is the end of fighting, and there is a side that thinks that peace is the arrival of schools and jobs. There is a side that is led by men, and there is a side that is led by women. And in order for us to understand how do we build lasting peace, we must understand war and peace from both sides. We must have a full picture of what that means.In order for us to understand what actually peace means, we need to understand, as one Sudanese woman once told me, \"Peace is the fact that my toenails are growing back again.\" She grew up in Sudan, in Southern Sudan, for 20 years of war, where it killed one million people and displaced five million refugees. Many women were taken as slaves by rebels and soldiers, as sexual slaves who were forced also to carry the ammunition and the water and the food for the soldiers. So that woman walked for 20 years, so she would not be kidnapped again. And only when there was some sort of peace, her toenails grew back again. We need to understand peace from a toenail's perspective.We need to understand that we cannot actually have negotiations of ending of wars or peace without fully including women at the negotiating table. I find it amazing that the only group of people who are not fighting and not killing and not pillaging and not burning and not raping, and the group of people who are mostly \u2014 though not exclusively \u2014 who are keeping life going in the midst of war, are not included in the negotiating table. And I do argue that women lead the back-line discussion, but there are also men who are excluded from that discussion. The doctors who are not fighting, the artists, the students, the men who refuse to pick up the guns, they are, too, excluded from the negotiating tables. There is no way we can talk about a lasting peace, building of democracy, sustainable economies, any kind of stabilities, if we do not fully include women at the negotiating table. Not one, but 50 percent.There is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we don't start investing in women and girls. Did you know that one year of the world's military spending equals 700 years of the U.N. budget and equals 2,928 years of the U.N. budget allocated for women? If we just reverse that distribution of funds, perhaps we could have a better lasting peace in this world. And last, but not least, we need to invest in peace and women, not only because it is the right thing to do, not only because it is the right thing to do, for all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today, but it is for the future.A Congolese woman, who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her raped in front of them and mutilated in front of them, and her children saw their nine-year-old sibling killed in front of them, how they're doing okay right now. She got into Women for Women International's program. She got a support network. She learned about her rights. We taught her vocational and business skills. We helped her get a job. She was earning 450 dollars. She was doing okay. She was sending them to school. Have a new home. She said, \"But what I worry about the most is not any of that. I worry that my children have hate in their hearts, and when they want to grow up, they want to fight again the killers of their father and their brother.\" We need to invest in women, because that's our only chance to ensure that there is no more war in the future. That mother has a better chance to heal her children than any peace agreement can do.Are there good news? Of course, there are good news. There are lots of good news. To start with, these women that I told you about are dancing and singing every single day, and if they can, who are we not to dance? That girl that I told you about ended up starting Women for Women International Group that impacted one million people, sent 80 million dollars, and I started this from zero, nothing, nada, [unclear].(Laughter)They are women who are standing on their feet in spite of their circumstances, not because of it. Think of how the world can be a much better place if, for a change, we have a better equality, we have equality, we have a representation and we understand war, both from the front-line and the back-line discussion.Rumi, a 13th-century Sufi poet, says, \"Out beyond the worlds of right-doings and wrong-doings, there is a field. I will meet you there. When the soul lies down in that grass, the world is too full to talk about. Ideas, language, even the phrase 'each other' no longer makes any sense.\" I humbly add \u2014 humbly add \u2014 that out beyond the worlds of war and peace, there is a field, and there are many women and men [who] are meeting there. Let us make this field a much bigger place. Let us all meet in that field.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1013, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nI woke up in the middle of the

But let's sort of start at the beginning.So, we have companies and non-profits and charities and all these groups that have employees or volunteers of some sort. And they expect these people who work for them to do great work \u2014 I would hope, at least. At least good work, hopefully, at least it's good work \u2014 hopefully great work. And so what they typically do is they decide that all these people need to come together in one place to do that work. So a company, or a charity, or an organization of any kind, unless you're working in Africa, if you're really lucky to do that \u2014 most people have to go to an office every day.And so these companies, they build offices. They go out and they buy a building, or they rent a building, or they lease some space, and they fill this space with stuff. They fill it with tables, or desks, chairs, computer equipment, software, Internet access, maybe a fridge, maybe a few other things, and they expect their employees, or their volunteers, to come to that location every day to do great work. It seems like it's perfectly reasonable to ask that.However, if you actually talk to people and even question yourself, and you ask yourself, where do you really want to go when you really need to get something done? You'll find out that people don't say what businesses think they would say. If you ask people the question: Where do you need to go when you need to get something done? Typically, you get three different kinds of answers. One is kind of a place or a location or a room. Another one is a moving object, and a third is a time.So here are some examples. I've been asking people this question for about 10 years: \"Where do you go when you really need to get something done?\" I'll hear things like, the porch, the deck, the kitchen. I'll hear things like an extra room in the house, the basement, the coffee shop, the library. And then you'll hear things like the train, a plane, a car \u2014 so, the commute. And then you'll hear people say, \"Well, it doesn't really matter where I am, as long as it's early in the morning or late at night or on the weekends.\" You almost never hear someone say, \"The office.\" But businesses are spending all this money on this place called the office, and they're making people go to it all the time, yet people don't do work in the office.What is that about?(Laughter)Why is that? Why is that happening? And what you find out is, if you dig a little bit deeper, you find out that people \u2014 this is what happens: People go to work, and they're basically trading in their work day for a series of \"work moments\" \u2014 that's what happens at the office. You don't have a work day anymore. You have work moments. It's like the front door of the office is like a Cuisinart, and you walk in and your day is shredded to bits, because you have 15 minutes here, 30 minutes there, and something else happens, you're pulled off your work, then you have 20 minutes, then it's lunch, then you have something else to do ... Then you've got 15 minutes, and someone pulls you aside and asks you a question, and before you know it, it's 5 p.m., and you look back on the day, and you realize that you didn't get anything done. We've all been through this. We probably went through it yesterday or the day before, or the day before that. You look back on your day, and you're like, \"I got nothing done today. I was at work. I sat at my desk. I used my expensive computer. I used the software they told me to use. I went to these meetings I was asked to go to. I did these conference calls. I did all this stuff. But I didn't actually do anything. I just did tasks. I didn't actually get meaningful work done.\"And what you find is that, especially with creative people \u2014 designers, programmers, writers, engineers, thinkers \u2014 that people really need long stretches of uninterrupted time to get something done. You cannot ask somebody to be creative in 15 minutes and really think about a problem. You might have a quick idea, but to be in deep thought about a problem and really consider a problem carefully, you need long stretches of uninterrupted time. And even though the work day is typically eight hours, how many people here have ever had eight hours to themselves at the office? How about seven hours? Six? Five? Four? When's the last time you had three hours to yourself at the office? Two hours? One, maybe? Very, very few people actually have long stretches of uninterrupted time at an office. And this is why people choose to do work at home, or they might go to the office, but they might go to the office really early in the day, or late at night when no one's around, or they stick around after everyone's left, or go in on the weekends, or they get work done on the plane, in the car or in the train, because there are no distractions.Now there are different kinds of distractions, but not the really bad distractions, which I'll talk about in a minute. And this whole phenomenon of having short bursts of time to get things done reminds me of another thing that doesn't work when you're interrupted, and that is sleep. I think that sleep and work are very closely related \u2014 not because you can work while you're sleeping and sleep while you're working. That's not really what I mean. I'm talking specifically about the fact that sleep and work are phase-based, or stage-based, events. Sleep is about sleep phases, or stages \u2014 some people call them different things. There are five of them, and in order to get to the really deep ones, the meaningful ones, you have to go through the early ones. If you're interrupted while you're going through the early ones \u2014 if someone bumps you in bed, or there's a sound, or whatever happens \u2014 you don't just pick up where you left off.If you're interrupted and woken up, you have to start again. So you have to go back a few phases and start again. And what ends up happening \u2014 you might have days like this where you wake up at eight or seven in the morning, or whenever you get up, and you're like, \"I didn't sleep very well. I did the sleep thing \u2014 I went to bed, I laid down, but I didn't really sleep.\" People say you go \"to\" sleep, but you don't go to sleep, you go towards sleep; it takes a while. You've got to go through phases and stuff, and if you're interrupted, you don't sleep well. So does anyone here expect someone to sleep well if they're interrupted all night? I don't think anyone would say yes. Why do we expect people to work well if they're being interrupted all day at the office? How can we possibly expect people to do their job if they go to the office and are interrupted? That doesn't really seem like it makes a lot of sense, to me.So what are the interruptions that happen at the office but not at other places? Because in other places, you can have interruptions like the TV, or you could go for a walk, or there's a fridge downstairs, or you've got your own couch, or whatever you want to do. If you talk to certain managers, they'll tell you that they don't want their employees to work at home because of these distractions. They'll sometimes also say, \"If I can't see the person, how do I know they're working?\" which is ridiculous, but that's one of the excuses that managers give. And I'm one of these managers. I understand. I know how this goes. We all have to improve on this sort of thing. But oftentimes they'll cite distractions: \"I can't let someone work at home. They'll watch TV, or do this other thing.\" It turns out those aren't the things that are distracting, Because those are voluntary distractions. You decide when you want to be distracted by the TV, when you want to turn something on, or when you want to go downstairs or go for a walk. At the office, most of the interruptions and distractions that really cause people not to get work done are involuntary. So let's go through a couple of those.Now, managers and bosses will often have you think that the real distractions at work are things like Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and other websites, and in fact, they'll go so far as to actually ban these sites at work. Some of you may work at places where you can't get to certain sites. I mean, is this China? What the hell is going on here? You can't go to a website at work, and that's the problem? That's why people aren't getting work done, because they're on Facebook and Twitter? That's kind of ridiculous. It's a total decoy. Today's Facebook and Twitter and YouTube, these things are just modern-day smoke breaks. No one cared about letting people take a smoke break for 15 minutes 10 years ago, so why does anyone care if someone goes to Facebook or Twitter or YouTube here and there? Those aren't the real problems in the office.The real problems are what I like to call the M&Ms, the Managers and the Meetings. Those are the real problems in the modern office today. And this is why things don't get done at work, it's because of the M&Ms. Now what's interesting is, if you listen to all the places that people talk about doing work, like at home, in the car, on a plane, late at night, or early in the morning, you don't find managers and meetings. You find a lot of other distractions, but not managers and meetings. So these are the things that you don't find elsewhere, but you do find at the office. And managers are basically people whose job it is to interrupt people. That's pretty much what managers are for. They're for interrupting people. They don't really do the work, so they make sure everyone else is doing work, which is an interruption. We have lots of managers in the world now, and a lot of people in the world, and a lot of interruptions by these managers. They have to check in: \"Hey, how's it going? Show me what's up.\" This sort of thing. They keep interrupting you at the wrong time, while you're actually trying to do something they're paying you to do, they tend to interrupt you. That's kind of bad.But what's even worse is the thing that managers do most of all, which is call meetings. And meetings are just toxic, terrible, poisonous things during the day at work.(Laughter)We all know this to be true, and you would never see a spontaneous meeting called by employees. It doesn't work that way. The manager calls the meeting so the employees can all come together, and it's an incredibly disruptive thing to do to people \u2014 to say, \"Hey look, we're going to bring 10 people together right now and have a meeting. I don't care what you're doing, you've got to stop doing it, so you can have this meeting.\" I mean, what are the chances that all 10 people are ready to stop? What if they're thinking about something important, or doing important work? All of a sudden you tell them they have to stop doing that to do something else. So they go into a meeting room, they get together, and they talk about stuff that doesn't really matter, usually. Because meetings aren't work. Meetings are places to go to talk about things you're supposed to be doing later.But meetings also procreate. So one meeting tends to lead to another meeting, which leads to another meeting. There's often too many people in the meetings, and they're very, very expensive to the organization. Companies often think of a one-hour meeting as a one-hour meeting, but that's not true, unless there's only one person. If there are 10 people, it's a 10-hour meeting, not a one-hour meeting. It's 10 hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization to have this one-hour meeting, which probably should have been handled by two or three people talking for a few minutes. But instead, there's a long scheduled meeting, because meetings are scheduled the way software works, which is in increments of 15 minutes, or 30 minutes, or an hour. You don't schedule an eight-hour meeting with Outlook; you can't. You can go 15 minutes or 30 minutes or 45 minutes or an hour. And so we tend to fill these times up when things should go really quickly.So meetings and managers are two major problems in businesses today, especially at offices. These things don't exist outside of the office. So I have some suggestions to remedy the situation. What can managers do \u2014 enlightened managers, hopefully \u2014 what can they do to make the office a better place for people to work, so it's not the last resort, but it's the first resort, so that people start to say, \"When I really want to get stuff done, I go to the office.\" Because the offices are well-equipped; everything is there for them to do the work. But they don't want to go there right now, so how do we change that? I have three suggestions to share with you. I have about three minutes, so that'll fit perfectly.We've all heard of the Casual Friday thing. I don't know if people still do that. But how about \"No-talk Thursdays?\"(Laughter)Pick one Thursday once a month, and cut it in half, just the afternoon \u2014 I'll make it easy for you. So just the afternoon, one Thursday. First Thursday of the month, just the afternoon, nobody in the office can talk to each other. Just silence, that's it. And what you'll find is that a tremendous amount of work gets done when no one talks to each other. This is when people actually get stuff done, is when no one's bothering them or interrupting them. Giving someone four hours of uninterrupted time is the best gift you can give anybody at work. It's better than a computer, better than a new monitor, better than new software, or whatever people typically use. Giving them four hours of quiet time at the office is going to be incredibly valuable. If you try that, I think you'll agree, and hopefully you can do it more often. So maybe it's every other week, or every week, once a week, afternoons no one can talk to each other. That's something that you'll find will really, really work.Another thing you can try, is switching from active communication and collaboration, which is like face-to-face stuff \u2014 tapping people on the shoulder, saying hi to them, having meetings, and replace that with more passive models of communication, using things like email and instant messaging, or collaboration products, things like that. Now some people might say email is really distracting, I.M. is really distracting, and these other things are really distracting, but they're distracting at a time of your own choice and your own choosing. You can quit the email app; you can't quit your boss. You can quit I.M.; you can't hide your manager. You can put these things away, and then you can be interrupted on your own schedule, at your own time, when you're available, when you're ready to go again. Because work, like sleep, happens in phases. So you'll be going up, doing some work, and then you'll come down from that work, and then maybe it's time to check that email or I.M. There are very, very few things that are that urgent, that need to happen, that need to be answered right this second. So if you're a manager, start encouraging people to use more things like I.M. and email and other things that someone can put away and then get back to you on their own schedule.And the last suggestion I have is that, if you do have a meeting coming up, if you have the power, just cancel it. Just cancel that next meeting.(Laughter)Today's Friday, usually people have meetings on Monday. Just don't have it. I don't mean move it; I mean just erase it from memory, it's gone. And you'll find out that everything will be just fine. All these discussions and decisions you thought you had to make at this one time at 9 a.m. on Monday, just forget about them, and things will be fine. People will have a more open morning, they can actually think. You'll find out all these things you thought you had to do, you don't actually have to do.So those are just three quick suggestions I wanted to give you guys to think about. I hope that some of these ideas were at least provocative enough for managers and bosses and business owners and organizers and people who are in charge of other people, to think about laying off a little bit, and giving people more time to get work done. I think it'll all pay off in the end.So, thanks for listening.(Applause)", "id": 1014, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.894 --> 00:00:14.584\nSo I'm going to talk about work;\n\n00:00:14.608 --> 00:00:18.394\nspecifically, why people can't\nseem to get work done at work,\n\n00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:20.847\nwhich is a problem we all kind of have.\n\n00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:23.034\nBut let's sort of start at the beginning.\n\n00:00:23.058 --> 00:00:26.664\nSo, we have companies\nand non-profits and charities\n\n00:00:26.688 --> 00:00:31.632\nand all these groups that have\nemployees or volunteers of some sort.\n\n00:00:32.156 --> 00:00:35.862\nAnd they expect these people\nwho work for them\n\n00:00:35.886 --> 00:00:37.568\nto do great work --\n\n00:00:37.592 --> 00:00:38.934\nI would hope, at least.\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:41.673\nAt least good work, hopefully,\nat least it's good work --\n\n00:00:41.697 --> 00:00:42.934\nhopefully great work.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.006\nAnd so what they typically\ndo is they decide\n\n00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.934\nthat all these people need to come\ntogether in one place to do that work.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.933\nSo a company, or a charity,\nor an organization of any kind,\n\n00:00:51.957 --> 00:00:56.121\nunless you're working in Africa,\nif you're really lucky to do that --\n\n00:00:56.145 --> 00:00:58.378\nmost people have to go\nto an office every day.\n\n00:00:58.402 --> 00:01:00.338\nAnd so these companies,\n\n00:01:00.362 --> 00:01:02.087\nthey build offices.\n\n00:01:02.111 --> 00:01:05.007\nThey go out and they buy a building,\nor they rent a building,\n\n00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:06.934\nor they lease some space,\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.934\nand they fill this space with stuff.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.934\nThey fill it with tables, or desks,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.833\nchairs, computer equipment,\n\n00:01:15.857 --> 00:01:18.934\nsoftware, Internet access,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.203\nmaybe a fridge, maybe a few other things,\n\n00:01:22.227 --> 00:01:24.808\nand they expect their employees,\nor their volunteers,\n\n00:01:24.832 --> 00:01:27.481\nto come to that location\nevery day to do great work.\n\n00:01:27.505 --> 00:01:30.426\nIt seems like it's perfectly\nreasonable to ask that.\n\n00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.783\nHowever, if you actually talk to people\n\n00:01:32.807 --> 00:01:35.451\nand even question yourself,\nand you ask yourself,\n\n00:01:35.475 --> 00:01:38.989\nwhere do you really want to go when you\nreally need to get something done?\n\n00:01:39.013 --> 00:01:42.739\nYou'll find out that people don't say\nwhat businesses think they would say.\n\n00:01:42.763 --> 00:01:44.260\nIf you ask people the question:\n\n00:01:44.284 --> 00:01:47.100\nWhere do you need to go\nwhen you need to get something done?\n\n00:01:47.124 --> 00:01:49.598\nTypically, you get three different\nkinds of answers.\n\n00:01:49.622 --> 00:01:52.485\nOne is kind of a place\nor a location or a room.\n\n00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.453\nAnother one is a moving object,\n\n00:01:54.477 --> 00:01:56.144\nand a third is a time.\n\n00:01:56.168 --> 00:01:58.180\nSo here are some examples.\n\n00:01:58.204 --> 00:02:01.435\nI've been asking people this question\nfor about 10 years:\n\n00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:04.615\n\"Where do you go when you\nreally need to get something done?\"\n\n00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:08.187\nI'll hear things like, the porch,\nthe deck, the kitchen.\n\n00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:11.259\nI'll hear things like\nan extra room in the house,\n\n00:02:11.283 --> 00:02:12.560\nthe basement,\n\n00:02:12.584 --> 00:02:14.485\nthe coffee shop, the library.\n\n00:02:15.505 --> 00:02:18.060\nAnd then you'll hear\nthings like the train,\n\n00:02:18.084 --> 00:02:21.184\na plane, a car -- so, the commute.\n\n00:02:21.624 --> 00:02:23.336\nAnd then you'll hear people say,\n\n00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.362\n\"Well, it doesn't really\nmatter where I am,\n\n00:02:25.386 --> 00:02:28.898\nas long as it's early in the morning\nor late at night or on the weekends.\"\n\n00:02:28.922 --> 00:02:31.747\nYou almost never hear\nsomeone say, \"The office.\"\n\n00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:35.343\nBut businesses are spending all this money\non this place called the office,\n\n00:02:35.367 --> 00:02:37.621\nand they're making people\ngo to it all the time,\n\n00:02:37.645 --> 00:02:39.680\nyet people don't do work in the office.\n\n00:02:39.704 --> 00:02:40.867\nWhat is that about?\n\n00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:42.351\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:45.628\nWhy is that?

One, maybe?\n\n00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:40.234\nVery, very few people actually have\n\n00:04:40.258 --> 00:04:42.932\nlong stretches of uninterrupted\ntime at an office.\n\n00:04:42.956 --> 00:04:46.486\nAnd this is why people\nchoose to do work at home,\n\n00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.089\nor they might go to the office,\n\n00:04:48.113 --> 00:04:50.748\nbut they might go to the office\nreally early in the day,\n\n00:04:50.772 --> 00:04:52.598\nor late at night when no one's around,\n\n00:04:52.622 --> 00:04:54.690\nor they stick around\nafter everyone's left,\n\n00:04:54.714 --> 00:04:56.128\nor go in on the weekends,\n\n00:04:56.152 --> 00:04:59.243\nor they get work done on the plane,\nin the car or in the train,\n\n00:04:59.267 --> 00:05:01.172\nbecause there are no distractions.\n\n00:05:01.196 --> 00:05:03.391\nNow there are different\nkinds of distractions,\n\n00:05:03.415 --> 00:05:06.804\nbut not the really bad distractions,\nwhich I'll talk about in a minute.\n\n00:05:06.828 --> 00:05:11.292\nAnd this whole phenomenon of having\nshort bursts of time to get things done\n\n00:05:11.316 --> 00:05:14.958\nreminds me of another thing\nthat doesn't work when you're interrupted,\n\n00:05:14.982 --> 00:05:16.167\nand that is sleep.\n\n00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.918\nI think that sleep and work\nare very closely related --\n\n00:05:19.942 --> 00:05:23.640\nnot because you can work while you're\nsleeping and sleep while you're working.\n\n00:05:23.664 --> 00:05:25.108\nThat's not really what I mean.\n\n00:05:25.132 --> 00:05:31.203\nI'm talking specifically about the fact\nthat sleep and work are phase-based,\n\n00:05:31.227 --> 00:05:32.958\nor stage-based, events.\n\n00:05:33.282 --> 00:05:39.337\nSleep is about sleep phases, or stages --\nsome people call them different things.\n\n00:05:39.361 --> 00:05:43.195\nThere are five of them, and in order\nto get to the really deep ones,\n\n00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:45.988\nthe meaningful ones,\nyou have to go through the early ones.\n\n00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:49.203\nIf you're interrupted while you're\ngoing through the early ones --\n\n00:05:49.227 --> 00:05:52.934\nif someone bumps you in bed,\nor there's a sound, or whatever happens --\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nyou don't just pick up where you left off.\n\n00:05:54.982 --> 00:05:56.934\nIf you're interrupted and woken up,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.696\nyou have to start again.\n\n00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.934\nSo you have to go back\na few phases and start again.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.725\nAnd what ends up happening --\nyou might have days like this\n\n00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:08.297\nwhere you wake up at eight or seven\nin the morning, or whenever you get up,\n\n00:06:08.321 --> 00:06:10.437\nand you're like,\n\"I didn't sleep very well.\n\n00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:13.029\nI did the sleep thing --\nI went to bed, I laid down,\n\n00:06:13.053 --> 00:06:15.431\nbut I didn't really sleep.\"\n\n00:06:15.455 --> 00:06:17.821\nPeople say you go \"to\" sleep,\n\n00:06:17.845 --> 00:06:20.963\nbut you don't go to sleep,\nyou go towards sleep; it takes a while.\n\n00:06:20.987 --> 00:06:23.042\nYou've got to go through phases and stuff,\n\n00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:25.375\nand if you're interrupted,\nyou don't sleep well.\n\n00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:27.755\nSo does anyone here\nexpect someone to sleep well\n\n00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:29.361\nif they're interrupted all night?\n\n00:06:29.385 --> 00:06:31.099\nI don't think anyone would say yes.\n\n00:06:31.123 --> 00:06:33.448\nWhy do we expect people to work well\n\n00:06:33.472 --> 00:06:35.944\nif they're being interrupted\nall day at the office?\n\n00:06:35.968 --> 00:06:38.402\nHow can we possibly expect\npeople to do their job\n\n00:06:38.426 --> 00:06:40.531\nif they go to the office\nand are interrupted?\n\n00:06:40.555 --> 00:06:43.462\nThat doesn't really seem\nlike it makes a lot of sense, to me.\n\n00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:47.354\nSo what are the interruptions that happen\nat the office but not at other places?\n\n00:06:47.378 --> 00:06:51.639\nBecause in other places, you can have\ninterruptions like the TV,\n\n00:06:51.663 --> 00:06:54.934\nor you could go for a walk,\nor there's a fridge downstairs,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:58.063\nor you've got your own couch,\nor whatever you want to do.\n\n00:06:58.087 --> 00:07:00.896\nIf you talk to certain managers,\nthey'll tell you\n\n00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.491\nthat they don't want\ntheir employees to work at home\n\n00:07:03.515 --> 00:07:05.412\nbecause of these distractions.\n\n00:07:05.436 --> 00:07:08.467\nThey'll sometimes also say,\n\n00:07:08.491 --> 00:07:11.334\n\"If I can't see the person,\nhow do I know they're working?\"\n\n00:07:11.358 --> 00:07:14.659\nwhich is ridiculous, but that's one\nof the excuses that managers give.\n\n00:07:14.683 --> 00:07:17.940\nAnd I'm one of these managers.\nI understand. I know how this goes.\n\n00:07:17.964 --> 00:07:20.687\nWe all have to improve\non this sort of thing.\n\n00:07:20.711 --> 00:07:22.681\nBut oftentimes they'll cite distractions:\n\n00:07:22.705 --> 00:07:24.339\n\"I can't let someone work at home.\n\n00:07:24.363 --> 00:07:26.379\nThey'll watch TV, or do this other thing.\"\n\n00:07:26.403 --> 00:07:29.138\nIt turns out those aren't\nthe things that are distracting,\n\n00:07:29.162 --> 00:07:31.118\nBecause those are voluntary distractions.\n\n00:07:31.142 --> 00:07:33.594\nYou decide when you want\nto be distracted by the TV,\n\n00:07:33.618 --> 00:07:35.309\nwhen you want to turn something on,\n\n00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:37.727\nor when you want to go\ndownstairs or go for a walk.\n\n00:07:37.751 --> 00:07:38.902\nAt the office,\n\n00:07:38.926 --> 00:07:40.949\nmost of the interruptions and distractions\n\n00:07:40.973 --> 00:07:44.090\nthat really cause people not\nto get work done are involuntary.\n\n00:07:44.114 --> 00:07:47.225\nSo let's go through a couple of those.\n\n00:07:47.249 --> 00:07:50.566\nNow, managers and bosses\nwill often have you think\n\n00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.594\nthat the real distractions at work\n\n00:07:52.618 --> 00:07:55.428\nare things like Facebook and Twitter\n\n00:07:55.452 --> 00:07:58.622\nand YouTube and other websites,\n\n00:07:58.646 --> 00:08:02.488\nand in fact, they'll go so far\nas to actually ban these sites at work.\n\n00:08:02.512 --> 00:08:05.853\nSome of you may work at places\nwhere you can't get to certain sites.\n\n00:08:05.877 --> 00:08:08.496\nI mean, is this China?\nWhat the hell is going on here?\n\n00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.263\nYou can't go to a website at work,\nand that's the problem?\n\n00:08:11.287 --> 00:08:13.295\nThat's why people aren't\ngetting work done,\n\n00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:15.247\nbecause they're on Facebook and Twitter?\n\n00:08:15.271 --> 00:08:17.524\nThat's kind of ridiculous.\nIt's a total decoy.\n\n00:08:18.255 --> 00:08:21.672\nToday's Facebook and Twitter and YouTube,\n\n00:08:21.696 --> 00:08:23.934\nthese things are just\nmodern-day smoke breaks.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:27.973\nNo one cared about letting people take\na smoke break for 15 minutes 10 years ago,\n\n00:08:27.997 --> 00:08:30.615\nso why does anyone care\nif someone goes to Facebook\n\n00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:32.750\nor Twitter or YouTube here and there?\n\n00:08:32.774 --> 00:08:35.351\nThose aren't the real\nproblems in the office.\n\n00:08:35.375 --> 00:08:38.986\nThe real problems are\nwhat I like to call the M&amp;Ms,\n\n00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.263\nthe Managers and the Meetings.\n\n00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:44.676\nThose are the real problems\nin the modern office today.\n\n00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.180\nAnd this is why\nthings don't get done at work,\n\n00:08:47.204 --> 00:08:49.004\nit's because of the M&amp;Ms.\n\n00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:51.330\nNow what's interesting is,\n\n00:08:51.354 --> 00:08:54.495\nif you listen to all the places\nthat people talk about doing work,\n\n00:08:54.519 --> 00:08:58.483\nlike at home, in the car, on a plane,\nlate at night, or early in the morning,\n\n00:08:58.507 --> 00:09:00.638\nyou don't find managers and meetings.\n\n00:09:00.662 --> 00:09:03.899\nYou find a lot of other distractions,\nbut not managers and meetings.\n\n00:09:03.923 --> 00:09:06.900\nSo these are the things\nthat you don't find elsewhere,\n\n00:09:06.924 --> 00:09:08.519\nbut you do find at the office.\n\n00:09:09.329 --> 00:09:12.680\nAnd managers are basically people\nwhose job it is to interrupt people.\n\n00:09:12.704 --> 00:09:16.196\nThat's pretty much what managers are for.\nThey're for interrupting people.\n\n00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:20.059\nThey don't really do the work, so they\nmake sure everyone else is doing work,\n\n00:09:20.083 --> 00:09:21.807\nwhich is an interruption.\n\n00:09:21.831 --> 00:09:25.425\nWe have lots of managers in the world now,\nand a lot of people in the world,\n\n00:09:25.449 --> 00:09:27.550\nand a lot of interruptions\nby these managers.\n\n00:09:27.574 --> 00:09:29.627\nThey have to check in:\n\"Hey, how's it going?\n\n00:09:29.651 --> 00:09:31.535\nShow me what's up.\" This sort of thing.\n\n00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:33.717\nThey keep interrupting you\nat the wrong time,\n\n00:09:33.741 --> 00:09:37.042\nwhile you're actually trying to do\nsomething they're paying you to do,\n\n00:09:37.066 --> 00:09:38.469\nthey tend to interrupt you.\n\n00:09:38.493 --> 00:09:40.056\nThat's kind of bad.\n\n00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.191\nBut what's even worse is the thing\nthat managers do most of all,\n\n00:09:43.215 --> 00:09:44.662\nwhich is call meetings.\n\n00:09:44.686 --> 00:09:47.232\nAnd meetings are just toxic,\n\n00:09:47.256 --> 00:09:50.258\nterrible, poisonous things\n\n00:09:50.282 --> 00:09:51.701\nduring the day at work.\n\n00:09:51.725 --> 00:09:52.941\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:52.965 --> 00:09:54.752\nWe all know this to be true,\n\n00:09:54.776 --> 00:09:57.997\nand you would never see a spontaneous\nmeeting called by employees.\n\n00:09:58.021 --> 00:09:59.282\nIt doesn't work that way.\n\n00:09:59.306 --> 00:10:01.034\nThe manager calls the meeting\n\n00:10:01.058 --> 00:10:02.973\nso the employees can all come together,\n\n00:10:02.997 --> 00:10:05.720\nand it's an incredibly disruptive\nthing to do to people --\n\n00:10:05.744 --> 00:10:06.934\nto say, \"Hey look,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:10.656\nwe're going to bring 10 people\ntogether right now and have a meeting.\n\n00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.172\nI don't care what you're doing,\n\n00:10:12.196 --> 00:10:15.203\nyou've got to stop doing it,\nso you can have this meeting.\"\n\n00:10:15.227 --> 00:10:18.601\nI mean, what are the chances\nthat all 10 people are ready to stop?\n\n00:10:18.625 --> 00:10:22.378\nWhat if they're thinking about something\nimportant, or doing important work?\n\n00:10:22.402 --> 00:10:26.191\nAll of a sudden you tell them they have\nto stop doing that to do something else.\n\n00:10:26.215 --> 00:10:28.934\nSo they go into a meeting room,\nthey get together,\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.230\nand they talk about stuff\nthat doesn't really matter, usually.\n\n00:10:32.254 --> 00:10:33.898\nBecause meetings aren't work.\n\n00:10:33.922 --> 00:10:36.088\nMeetings are places to go\nto talk about things\n\n00:10:36.112 --> 00:10:37.809\nyou're supposed to be doing later.\n\n00:10:37.833 --> 00:10:39.804\nBut meetings also procreate.\n\n00:10:39.828 --> 00:10:42.093\nSo one meeting tends\nto lead to another meeting,\n\n00:10:42.117 --> 00:10:43.602\nwhich leads to another meeting.\n\n00:10:43.626 --> 00:10:45.832\nThere's often too many people\nin the meetings,\n\n00:10:45.856 --> 00:10:48.581\nand they're very, very expensive\nto the organization.\n\n00:10:48.605 --> 00:10:51.730\nCompanies often think of a one-hour\nmeeting as a one-hour meeting,\n\n00:10:51.754 --> 00:10:54.215\nbut that's not true,\nunless there's only one person.\n\n00:10:54.239 --> 00:10:57.763\nIf there are 10 people, it's a 10-hour\nmeeting, not a one-hour meeting.\n\n00:10:57.787 --> 00:11:01.064\nIt's 10 hours of productivity taken\nfrom the rest of the organization\n\n00:11:01.088 --> 00:11:04.427\nto have this one-hour meeting,\nwhich probably should have been handled\n\n00:11:04.451 --> 00:11:06.934\nby two or three people\ntalking for a few minutes.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.497\nBut instead, there's a long\nscheduled meeting,\n\n00:11:09.521 --> 00:11:12.092\nbecause meetings are scheduled\nthe way software works,\n\n00:11:12.116 --> 00:11:15.517\nwhich is in increments of 15 minutes,\nor 30 minutes, or an hour.\n\n00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:19.184\nYou don't schedule an eight-hour meeting\nwith Outlook; you can't.\n\n00:11:19.208 --> 00:11:22.182\nYou can go 15 minutes or 30 minutes\nor 45 minutes or an hour.\n\n00:11:22.206 --> 00:11:24.180\nAnd so we tend to fill these times up\n\n00:11:24.204 --> 00:11:26.363\nwhen things should go really quickly.\n\n00:11:26.387 --> 00:11:30.037\nSo meetings and managers are\ntwo major problems in businesses today,\n\n00:11:30.061 --> 00:11:31.220\nespecially at offices.\n\n00:11:31.244 --> 00:11:33.890\nThese things don't exist\noutside of the office.\n\n00:11:34.386 --> 00:11:39.187\nSo I have some suggestions\nto remedy the situation.\n\n00:11:39.211 --> 00:11:40.934\nWhat can managers do --\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.934\nenlightened managers, hopefully --\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:46.430\nwhat can they do to make the office\na better place for people to work,\n\n00:11:46.454 --> 00:11:49.299\nso it's not the last resort,\nbut it's the first resort,\n\n00:11:49.323 --> 00:11:50.665\nso that people start to say,\n\n00:11:50.689 --> 00:11:53.466\n\"When I really want to get stuff done,\nI go to the office.\"\n\n00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:55.404\nBecause the offices are well-equipped;\n\n00:11:55.428 --> 00:11:57.562\neverything is there\nfor them to do the work.\n\n00:11:57.586 --> 00:12:00.847\nBut they don't want to go there right\nnow, so how do we change that?\n\n00:12:00.871 --> 00:12:02.905\nI have three suggestions\nto share with you.\n\n00:12:02.929 --> 00:12:05.800\nI have about three minutes,\nso that'll fit perfectly.\n\n00:12:05.824 --> 00:12:08.661\nWe've all heard\nof the Casual Friday thing.\n\n00:12:08.685 --> 00:12:10.534\nI don't know if people still do that.\n\n00:12:10.558 --> 00:12:12.234\nBut how about \"No-talk Thursdays?\"\n\n00:12:12.258 --> 00:12:14.290\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:14.314 --> 00:12:17.260\nPick one Thursday once a month,\n\n00:12:17.284 --> 00:12:20.595\nand cut it in half, just the afternoon --\nI'll make it easy for you.\n\n00:12:20.619 --> 00:12:22.349\nSo just the afternoon, one Thursday.\n\n00:12:22.373 --> 00:12:24.627\nFirst Thursday of the month,\njust the afternoon,\n\n00:12:24.651 --> 00:12:26.715\nnobody in the office\ncan talk to each other.\n\n00:12:26.739 --> 00:12:28.277\nJust silence, that's it.\n\n00:12:28.301 --> 00:12:29.934\nAnd what you'll find\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.366\nis that a tremendous amount\nof work gets done\n\n00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.994\nwhen no one talks to each other.\n\n00:12:34.018 --> 00:12:36.082\nThis is when people\nactually get stuff done,\n\n00:12:36.106 --> 00:12:38.622\nis when no one's bothering them\nor interrupting them.\n\n00:12:38.646 --> 00:12:41.607\nGiving someone four hours\nof uninterrupted time\n\n00:12:41.631 --> 00:12:43.805\nis the best gift you can\ngive anybody at work.\n\n00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:45.242\nIt's better than a computer,\n\n00:12:45.266 --> 00:12:48.020\nbetter than a new monitor,\nbetter than new software,\n\n00:12:48.044 --> 00:12:50.019\nor whatever people typically use.\n\n00:12:50.043 --> 00:12:52.447\nGiving them four hours\nof quiet time at the office\n\n00:12:52.471 --> 00:12:54.392\nis going to be incredibly valuable.\n\n00:12:54.416 --> 00:12:58.384\nIf you try that, I think you'll agree,\nand hopefully you can do it more often.\n\n00:12:58.408 --> 00:13:00.130\nSo maybe it's every other week,\n\n00:13:00.154 --> 00:13:01.934\nor every week, once a week,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.011\nafternoons no one can talk to each other.\n\n00:13:04.035 --> 00:13:07.122\nThat's something that you'll find\nwill really, really work.\n\n00:13:07.146 --> 00:13:09.448\nAnother thing you can try,\n\n00:13:09.472 --> 00:13:12.934\nis switching from active\ncommunication and collaboration,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:16.149\nwhich is like face-to-face stuff --\ntapping people on the shoulder,\n\n00:13:16.173 --> 00:13:18.149\nsaying hi to them, having meetings,\n\n00:13:18.173 --> 00:13:20.959\nand replace that with more\npassive models of communication,\n\n00:13:20.983 --> 00:13:23.284\nusing things like email\nand instant messaging,\n\n00:13:23.308 --> 00:13:26.260\nor collaboration products,\nthings like that.\n\n00:13:26.586 --> 00:13:29.507\nNow some people might say\nemail is really distracting,\n\n00:13:29.531 --> 00:13:33.101\nI.M. is really distracting, and these\nother things are really distracting,\n\n00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:36.697\nbut they're distracting at a time\nof your own choice and your own choosing.\n\n00:13:36.721 --> 00:13:39.529\nYou can quit the email app;\nyou can't quit your boss.\n\n00:13:39.553 --> 00:13:41.331\nYou can quit I.M.;\n\n00:13:41.355 --> 00:13:43.172\nyou can't hide your manager.\n\n00:13:43.196 --> 00:13:44.934\nYou can put these things away,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:48.339\nand then you can be interrupted\non your own schedule, at your own time,\n\n00:13:48.363 --> 00:13:50.840\nwhen you're available,\nwhen you're ready to go again.\n\n00:13:50.864 --> 00:13:52.934\nBecause work, like sleep,\nhappens in phases.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.051\nSo you'll be going up, doing some work,\n\n00:13:55.075 --> 00:13:57.034\nand then you'll come down from that work,\n\n00:13:57.058 --> 00:13:59.510\nand then maybe it's time\nto check that email or I.M.\n\n00:13:59.534 --> 00:14:02.035\nThere are very, very few things\nthat are that urgent,\n\n00:14:02.059 --> 00:14:05.106\nthat need to happen, that need\nto be answered right this second.\n\n00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:06.305\nSo if you're a manager,\n\n00:14:06.329 --> 00:14:09.313\nstart encouraging people to use\nmore things like I.M. and email\n\n00:14:09.337 --> 00:14:11.353\nand other things that someone can put away\n\n00:14:11.377 --> 00:14:13.578\nand then get back to you\non their own schedule.\n\n00:14:13.602 --> 00:14:17.181\nAnd the last suggestion I have is that,\n\n00:14:17.205 --> 00:14:18.934\nif you do have a meeting coming up,\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:22.584\nif you have the power, just cancel it.\n\n00:14:22.608 --> 00:14:24.068\nJust cancel that next meeting.\n\n00:14:24.092 --> 00:14:25.258\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:25.282 --> 00:14:27.927\nToday's Friday, usually people\nhave meetings on Monday.\n\n00:14:27.951 --> 00:14:29.113\nJust don't have it.\n\n00:14:29.137 --> 00:14:30.542\nI don't mean move it;\n\n00:14:30.566 --> 00:14:33.208\nI mean just erase it\nfrom memory, it's gone.\n\n00:14:33.232 --> 00:14:35.820\nAnd you'll find out that everything\nwill be just fine.\n\n00:14:35.844 --> 00:14:38.860\nAll these discussions and decisions\nyou thought you had to make\n\n00:14:38.884 --> 00:14:40.668\nat this one time at 9 a.m. on Monday,\n\n00:14:40.692 --> 00:14:42.989\njust forget about them,\nand things will be fine.\n\n00:14:43.013 --> 00:14:45.994\nPeople will have a more open morning,\nthey can actually think.\n\n00:14:46.018 --> 00:14:48.793\nYou'll find out all these things\nyou thought you had to do,\n\n00:14:48.817 --> 00:14:50.270\nyou don't actually have to do.\n\n00:14:50.294 --> 00:14:54.286\nSo those are just three quick suggestions\nI wanted to give you guys to think about.\n\n00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:57.335\nI hope that some of these ideas\nwere at least provocative enough\n\n00:14:57.359 --> 00:14:59.465\nfor managers and bosses\nand business owners\n\n00:14:59.489 --> 00:15:02.305\nand organizers and people\nwho are in charge of other people,\n\n00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:04.200\nto think about laying off a little bit,\n\n00:15:04.224 --> 00:15:06.359\nand giving people more time\nto get work done.\n\n00:15:06.383 --> 00:15:08.193\nI think it'll all pay off in the end.\n\n00:15:08.217 --> 00:15:10.219\nSo, thanks for listening.\n\n00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:11.902\n(Applause)"}]
